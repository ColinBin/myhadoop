 a story from the 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 this story is from the or of jutland but it 
 does not begin there in the north but far away in the south in spain the wide sea is the highroad from nation to nation journey in thought then to sunny spain it is warm and beautiful there 
 the fiery pomegranate flowers peep from among dark laurels a cool 
 refreshing breeze from the mountains blows over the orange gardens 
 over the moorish halls with their golden cupolas and coloured walls 
 
 children go through the streets in procession with candles and 
 waving banners and the sky lofty and clear with its glittering 
 stars rises above them sounds of singing and castanets can be heard and youths and maidens dance upon the flowering acacia trees while even the beggar sits upon a block of marble refreshing himself with a juicy melon and dreamily enjoying life it all seems like a beautiful dream 
 
 here dwelt a newly married couple who completely gave themselves 
 up to the charm of life indeed they possessed every good thing they 
 could desire health and happiness riches and honour 
 
 we are as happy as human beings can be said the young couple 
 from the depths of their hearts they had indeed only one step 
 higher to mount on the ladder of happiness they hoped that god 
 would give them a child a son like them in form and spirit the happy 
 little one was to be welcomed with rejoicing to be cared for with 
 love and tenderness and enjoy every advantage of wealth and luxury 
 that a rich and influential family can give so the days went by 
 like a joyous festival 
 
 life is a gracious gift from god almost too great a gift for 
 us to appreciate said the young wife yet they say that fulness 
 of joy for ever and ever can only be found in the future life i 
 cannot realise it 
 
 the thought arises perhaps from the arrogance of men said the 
 husband it seems a great pride to believe that we shall live for 
 ever that we shall be as gods were not these the words of the 
 serpent the father of lies 
 
 surely you do not doubt the existence of a future life 
 exclaimed the young wife it seemed as if one of the first shadows 
 passed over her sunny thoughts 
 
 faith realises it and the priests tell us so replied her 
 husband but amid all my happiness i feel that it is arrogant to 
 demand a continuation of it another life after this has not so 
 much been given us in this world that we ought to be we must be 
 contented with it 
 
 yes it has been given to us said the young wife but this 
 life is nothing more than one long scene of trial and hardship to many 
 thousands how many have been cast into this world only to endure 
 poverty shame illness and misfortune if there were no future life 
 everything here would be too unequally divided and god would not be the personification of justice 
 
 the beggar there said her husband has joys of his own which 
 seem to him great and cause him as much pleasure as a king would find in the magnificence of his palace and then do you not think that 
 the beast of burden which suffers blows and hunger and works 
 itself to death suffers just as much from its miserable fate the 
 dumb creature might demand a future life also and declare the law 
 unjust that excludes it from the advantages of the higher creation 
 christ said in my house are many mansions she 
 answered heaven is as boundless as the love of our creator the dumb animal is also his creature and i firmly believe that no life will be lost but each will receive as much happiness as he can enjoy which will be sufficient for him 
 
 this world is sufficient for me said the husband throwing 
 his arm round his beautiful wife he sat by her side 
 on the open balcony smoking a cigarette in the cool air which was 
 loaded with the sweet scent of carnations and orange blossoms 
 sounds of music and the clatter of castanets came from the road 
 beneath the stars shone above then and two eyes full of affection 
 those of his wife looked upon him with the expression of undying 
 love such a moment he said makes it worth while to be born to 
 die and to be annihilated he smiled the young wife raised her hand 
 in gentle reproof and the shadow passed away from her mind and 
 they were happy quite happy 
 
 everything seemed to work together for their good they advanced 
 in honour in prosperity and in happiness a change came certainly 
 but it was only a change of place and not of circumstances 
 the young man was sent by his sovereign as ambassador to the 
 russian court this was an office of high dignity but his birth and 
 his acquirements entitled him to the honour he possessed a large 
 fortune and his wife had brought him wealth equal to his own for she 
 was the daughter of a rich and respected merchant one of this 
 largest and finest ships was to be sent that year to 
 stockholm and it was arranged that the dear young couple the 
 daughter and the should travel in it to st petersburg 
 all the arrangements on board were princely and silk and luxury on 
 every side 
 
 in an old war song called the king of son it says 
 farewell he said and sailed away 
 and many recollect that day 
 the ropes were of silk the anchor of gold 
 and everywhere riches and wealth untold 
 these words would aptly describe the vessel from spain for here 
 was the same luxury and the same parting thought naturally arose 
 god grant that we once more may meet 
 in sweet unclouded peace and joy 
 there was a favourable wind blowing as they left the spanish 
 coast and it would be but a short journey for they hoped to reach 
 their destination in a few weeks but when they came out upon the wide ocean the wind dropped the sea became smooth and shining and the stars shone brightly many festive evenings were spent on board at last the travellers began to wish for wind for a favourable breeze but their wish was useless not a breath of air stirred or if it 
 did arise it was contrary weeks passed by in this way two whole 
 months and then at length a fair wind blew from the the 
 ship sailed on the high seas between scotland and jutland then the 
 wind increased just as it did in the old song of the king of 
 son 
 mid storm and wind and pelting hail 
 their efforts were of no avail 
 the golden anchor forth they threw 
 towards denmark the west wind blew 
 this all happened a long time ago king christian vii who sat 
 on the danish throne was still a young man much has happened since then much has altered or been changed sea and moorland have been turned into green meadows stretches of heather have become arable land and in the shelter of the cottages and grow though they certainly require much care as the sharp west wind blows upon them in west jutland one may go back in thought to old times farther back than the days when christian vii ruled the purple heather still extends for miles with its barrows and aerial spectacles intersected with sandy uneven roads just as it did then towards the west where broad streams run into the bays are marshes and meadows encircled by lofty sandy hills which like a chain of alps raise their pointed summits near the sea they are only broken by high ridges of clay from which the sea year by year bites out great mouthfuls so that the overhanging banks fall down as if by the shock of an earthquake thus it is there today and thus it was long ago when the happy pair were sailing in the beautiful ship 
 it was a sunday towards the end of september the sun was 
 shining and the chiming of the church bells in the bay of nissum 
 was carried along by the breeze like a chain of sounds the churches 
 there are almost entirely built of hewn blocks of stone each like a 
 piece of rock the north sea might foam over them and they would not be disturbed nearly all of them are without steeples and the bells 
 are hung outside between two beams the service was over and the 
 congregation passed out into the churchyard where not a tree or 
 bush was to be seen no flowers were planted there and they had not 
 placed a single wreath upon any of the graves it is just the same 
 now rough mounds show where the dead have been buried and rank grass tossed by the wind grows thickly over the whole churchyard here and there a grave has a sort of monument a block of wood rudely cut in the shape of a coffin the blocks are brought from the forest of west jutland but the forest is the sea itself and the inhabitants find beams and planks and fragments which the waves have cast upon the beach one of these blocks had been placed by loving hands on a grave and one of the women who had come out of the church walked up to it she stood there her eyes resting on the memorial and a few moments afterwards her husband joined her they were both silent but he took her hand and they walked together across the purple heath over moor and meadow towards the sandhills for a long time they went on without speaking 
 
 it was a good sermon the man said at last if we had 
 not god to trust in we should have nothing 
 
 yes replied the woman he sends joy and sorrow and he has a 
 right to send them our little son would have been five 
 years old if we had been permitted to keep him 
 
 it is no use fretting wife said the man the boy is well 
 provided for he is where we hope and pray to go to 
 
 they said nothing more but went out towards their houses among 
 the all at once in front of one of the houses where the 
 sea grass did not keep the sand down with its twining roots what 
 seemed to be a column of smoke rose up a gust of wind rushed 
 between the hills hurling the particles of sand high into the air 
 another gust and the strings of fish hung up to dry flapped and 
 beat violently against the walls of the cottage then everything was 
 quiet once more and the sun shone with renewed heat 
 
 the man and his wife went into the cottage they had soon taken 
 off their sunday clothes and come out again hurrying over the dunes 
 which stood there like great waves of sand suddenly arrested in 
 their course while the sandweeds and dune grass with its bluish 
 stalks spread a changing colour over them a few neighbours also 
 came out and helped each other to draw the boats higher up on the 
 beach the wind now blew more keenly it was chilly and cold and when they went back over the sand and little sharp stones 
 blew into their faces the waves rose high crested with white foam 
 and the wind cut off their crests scattering the foam far and wide 
 evening came there was a swelling roar in the air a wailing or 
 moaning like the voices of despairing spirits that sounded above 
 the thunder of the waves the little cottage was on the 
 very margin and the sand rattled against the window panes every 
 now and then a violent gust of wind shook the house to its foundation 
 
 it was dark but about midnight the moon would rise later on the 
 air became clearer but the storm swept over the perturbed sea with 
 undiminished fury the fisher folks had long since gone to bed but in 
 such weather there was no chance of closing an eye presently there 
 was a tapping at the window the door was opened and a voice said 
 a large ship stranded on the farthest reef 
 
 in a moment the fisher people sprung from their beds and hastily 
 dressed themselves the moon had risen and it was light enough to 
 make the surrounding objects visible to those who could open their 
 eyes in the blinding clouds of sand the violence of the wind was 
 terrible and it was only possible to pass among the if one 
 crept forward between the gusts the salt spray flew up from the sea 
 like down and the ocean foamed like a roaring cataract towards the 
 beach only a practised eye could discern the vessel out in the 
 offing she was a fine brig and the waves now lifted her over the 
 reef three or four cables length out of the usual channel she drove 
 towards the shore struck on the second reef and remained fixed 
 it was impossible to render assistance the sea rushed in upon the 
 vessel making a clean breach over her those on shore thought they 
 heard cries for help from those on board and could plainly 
 distinguish the busy but useless efforts made by the stranded sailors 
 now a wave came rolling onward it fell with enormous force on the 
 bowsprit tearing it from the vessel and the stern was lifted high 
 above the water two people were seen to embrace and plunge together into the sea and the next moment one of the largest waves that rolled towards the threw a body on the beach it was a woman the sailors said that she was quite dead but the women thought they saw signs of life in her so the stranger was carried across the to the cottage how beautiful and fair she was 
 
 she must be a great lady they said 
 
 they laid her upon the humble bed there was not a yard of linen 
 on it only a woollen coverlet to keep the occupant warm 
 life returned to her but she was delirious and knew nothing of 
 what had happened or where she was and it was better so for 
 everything she loved and valued lay buried in the sea the same 
 thing happened to her ship as to the one spoken of in the song about 
 the king of son 
 alas how terrible to see 
 the gallant bark sink rapidly 
 fragments of the wreck and pieces of wood were washed ashore they were all that remained of the vessel the wind still blew violently on the coast 
 
 for a few moments the strange lady seemed to rest but she awoke 
 in pain and uttered cries of anguish and fear she opened her 
 wonderfully beautiful eyes and spoke a few words but nobody 
 understood her and lo as a reward for the sorrow and suffering 
 she had undergone she held in her arms a babe the child 
 that was to have rested upon a magnificent couch draped with silken 
 curtains in a luxurious home it was to have been welcomed with joy 
 to a life rich in all the good things of this world and now heaven 
 had ordained that it should be born in this humble retreat that it 
 should not even receive a kiss from its mother for when the 
 wife laid the child upon the bosom it rested 
 on a heart that beat no more she was dead 
 
 the child that was to have been reared amid wealth and luxury 
 was cast into the world washed by the sea among the to 
 share the fate and hardships of the poor 
 
 here we are reminded again of the song about the king of 
 son for in it mention is made of the custom prevalent at 
 the time when knights and squires plundered those who had been 
 saved from shipwreck the ship had stranded some distance south of 
 nissum bay and the cruel inhuman days when as we have just said 
 the inhabitants of jutland treated the shipwrecked people so crudely 
 were past long ago affectionate sympathy and for 
 the unfortunate existed then just as it does in our own time in 
 many a bright example the dying mother and the unfortunate child 
 would have found kindness and help wherever they had been cast by 
 the winds but nowhere would it have been more sincere than in the 
 cottage of the poor wife who had stood only the day 
 before beside her grave who would have been five years old 
 that day if god had spared it to her 
 
 no one knew who the dead stranger was they could not even form 
 a conjecture the fragments of wreckage gave no clue to the matter 
 no tidings reached spain of the fate of the daughter and 
 they did not arrive at their destination and violent 
 storms had raged during the past weeks at last the verdict was given 
 foundered at sea all lost but in the cottage among the 
 near hunsby there lived a little scion of the rich spanish 
 family 
 
 where heaven sends food for two a third can manage to find a 
 meal and in the depth of the sea there is many a dish of fish for the 
 hungry 
 
 they called the boy jurgen 
 
 it must certainly be a jewish child its skin is so dark the 
 people said 
 
 it might be an italian or a spaniard remarked the clergyman 
 but to the wife these nations seemed all the same and 
 she consoled herself with the thought that the child was baptized as a 
 christian 
 
 the boy throve the noble blood in his veins was warm and he 
 became strong on his homely fare he grew apace in the humble cottage and the danish dialect spoken by the west jutes became his language 
 
 the pomegranate seed from spain became a hardy plant on the coast of west jutland thus may circumstances alter the course of a life 
 
 to this home he clung with affection he was to experience cold and hunger and the misfortunes and hardships that surround the poor but he also tasted of their joys 
 
 childhood has bright days for every one and the memory of them 
 shines through the whole the boy had many sources of 
 pleasure and enjoyment the coast for miles and miles was full of 
 playthings for it was a mosaic of pebbles some red as coral or 
 yellow as amber and others again white and rounded like birds eggs 
 and smoothed and prepared by the sea even the bleached fishes 
 skeletons the water plants dried by the wind and seaweed white 
 and shining long bands waving between the stones all these 
 seemed made to give pleasure and occupation for the thoughts 
 and he had an intelligent mind many great talents lay dormant in him 
 how readily he remembered stories and songs that he heard and how 
 dexterous he was with his fingers with stones and he 
 could put together pictures and ships with which one could decorate 
 the room and he could make wonderful things from a stick his 
 said although he was still so young and little he 
 had a sweet voice and every melody seemed to flow naturally from 
 his lips and in his heart were hidden chords which might have 
 sounded far out into the world if he had been placed anywhere else 
 than in the hut by the north sea 
 
 one day another ship was wrecked on the coast and among other 
 things a chest filled with valuable flower bulbs was washed ashore 
 some were put into saucepans and cooked for they were thought to be fit to eat and others lay and shrivelled in the sand they did not 
 accomplish their purpose or unfold their magnificent colours would 
 jurgen fare better the flower bulbs had soon played their part but 
 he had years of apprenticeship before him neither he nor his 
 friends noticed in what a monotonous uniform way one day followed 
 another for there was always plenty to do and see the ocean itself 
 was a great and it unfolded a new leaf each day of calm 
 or storm the crested wave or the smooth surface 
 
 the visits to the church were festive occasions but among the 
 house one was especially looked forward to this was in 
 fact the visit of the brother of the 
 from fjaltring near bovbjerg he came twice a year in a 
 cart painted red with blue and white tulips upon it and full of 
 eels it was covered and locked like a box two dun oxen drew it 
 and jurgen was allowed to guide them 
 
 the was a witty fellow a merry guest and brought a 
 measure of brandy with him they all received a small glassful or a 
 cupful if there were not enough glasses even jurgen had about a 
 thimbleful that he might digest the fat eel as the said 
 he always told one story over and over again and if his hearers 
 laughed he would immediately repeat it to them jurgen while still a 
 boy and also when he was older used phrases from the 
 story on various occasions so it will be as well for us to listen 
 to it it runs thus 
 
 the eels went into the bay and the young ones begged leave to go 
 a little farther out go too far said their mother the ugly 
 might come and snap you all up but they went too far 
 and of eight daughters only three came back to the mother and these 
 wept and said we only went a little way out and the ugly 
 came immediately and stabbed five of our sisters to 
 death come back again said the mother eel oh no 
 exclaimed the daughters for he skinned them cut them in two and 
 fried them oh come back again the mother eel 
 persisted no replied the daughters for he ate them up 
 come back again repeated the mother eel but he drank brandy 
 after them said the daughters ah then never come back 
 said the mother and she burst out crying the brandy that 
 buries the eels 
 
 and therefore said the in conclusion it is always 
 the proper thing to drink brandy after eating eels 
 this story was the tinsel thread the most humorous recollection 
 of life he also wanted to go a little way farther out and up 
 the bay that is to say out into the world in a ship but his 
 mother said like the there are so many bad people 
 eel spearers he wished to go a little way past the out 
 into the dunes and at last he did four happy days the brightest 
 of his childhood fell to his lot and the whole beauty and 
 splendour of jutland all the happiness and sunshine of his home were concentrated in these he went to a festival but it was a burial 
 feast 
 
 a rich relation of the family had died the farm was 
 situated far eastward in the country and a little towards the north 
 foster parents went there and he also went with them from 
 the dunes over heath and moor where the skjaerumaa takes its 
 course through green meadows and contains many eels mother eels 
 live there with their daughters who are caught and eaten up by wicked 
 people but do not men sometimes act quite as cruelly towards their 
 own was not the knight sir bugge murdered by wicked 
 people and though he was well spoken of did he not also wish to kill the architect who built the castle for him with its thick walls and 
 tower at the point where the skjaerumaa falls into the bay jurgen 
 and his parents now stood there the wall and the ramparts still 
 remained and red crumbling fragments lay scattered around here it 
 was that sir bugge after the architect had left him said to one of 
 his men go after him and say master the tower shakes if he 
 turns round kill him and take away the money i paid him but if he 
 does not turn round let him go in peace the man did as he was 
 told the architect did not turn round but called back the tower 
 does not shake in the least but one day a man will come from the west in a blue cloak he will cause it to shake and so indeed it happened a hundred years later for the north sea broke in and cast down the tower but predbjorn gyldenstjerne the man who then possessed the castle built a new castle higher up at the end of the meadow and that one is standing to this day and is called 
 
 jurgen and his foster parents went past this castle they had told 
 him its story during the long winter evenings and now he saw the 
 stately edifice with its double moat and trees and bushes the wall 
 covered with ferns rose within the moat but the lofty 
 were the most beautiful of all they grew up to the highest windows 
 and the air was full of their sweet fragrance in a 
 corner of the garden stood a great bush full of blossom like winter 
 snow amid the green it was a juniper bush the first that 
 jurgen had ever seen in bloom he never forgot it nor the 
 the soul treasured up these memories of beauty and fragrance 
 to gladden the old man 
 
 from where the juniper blossomed the journey 
 became more pleasant for they met some other people who were also 
 going to the funeral and were riding in waggons our travellers had to 
 sit all together on a little box at the back of the waggon but even 
 this they thought was better than walking so they continued their 
 journey across the rugged heath the oxen which drew the waggon 
 stopped every now and then where a patch of fresh grass appeared amid the heather the sun shone with considerable heat and it was 
 wonderful to behold how in the far distance something like smoke 
 seemed to be rising yet this smoke was clearer than the air it was 
 transparent and looked like rays of light rolling and dancing afar 
 over the heath 
 
 that is lokeman driving his sheep said some one 
 and this was enough to excite imagination he felt as 
 if they were now about to enter fairyland though everything was still 
 real how quiet it was the heath stretched far and wide around them 
 like a beautiful carpet the heather was in blossom and the 
 and fresh oak saplings rose like bouquets from the 
 earth an inviting place for a frolic if it had not been for the 
 number of poisonous adders of which the travellers spoke they also 
 mentioned that the place had formerly been infested with wolves and 
 that the district was still called wolfsborg for this reason the 
 old man who was driving the oxen told them that in the lifetime of his 
 father the horses had many a hard battle with the wild beasts that 
 were now exterminated one morning when he himself had gone out to bring in the horses he found one of them standing with its forefeet 
 on a wolf it had killed but the savage animal had torn and 
 lacerated the brave legs 
 
 the journey over the heath and the deep sand was only too 
 quickly at an end they stopped before the house of mourning where 
 they found plenty of guests within and without waggon after waggon 
 stood side by side while the horses and oxen had been turned out to 
 graze on the scanty pasture great like those at home by 
 the north sea rose behind the house and extended far and wide how had they come here so many miles inland they were as large and high as those on the coast and the wind had carried them there there was also a legend attached to them 
 
 psalms were sung and a few of the old people shed tears with 
 this exception the guests were cheerful enough it seemed to 
 jurgen and there was plenty to eat and drink there were eels of 
 the fattest requiring brandy to bury them as the said 
 and certainly they did not forget to carry out his maxim here 
 jurgen went in and out the house and on the third day he felt 
 as much at home as he did in the cottage among the 
 where he had passed his early days here on the heath were riches unknown to him until now for flowers blackberries and 
 bilberries were to be found in profusion so large and sweet that when 
 they were crushed beneath the tread of the heather was 
 stained with their red juice here was a barrow and yonder another 
 then columns of smoke rose into the still air it was a heath fire 
 they told him how brightly it blazed in the dark evening 
 the fourth day came and the funeral festivities were at an end 
 they were to go back from the to the 
 ours are better said the old fisherman 
 these have no strength 
 
 and they spoke of the way in which the had come inland 
 and it seemed very easy to understand this is how they explained it 
 a dead body had been found on the coast and the peasants buried 
 it in the churchyard from that time the sand began to fly about and 
 the sea broke in with violence a wise man in the district advised 
 them to open the grave and see if the buried man was not lying sucking his thumb for if so he must be a sailor and the sea would not rest until it had got him back the grave was opened and he really was found with his thumb in his mouth so they laid him upon a cart and harnessed two oxen to it and the oxen ran off with the sailor over heath and moor to the ocean as if they had been stung by an adder 
 
 then the sand ceased to fly inland but the hills that had been 
 piled up still remained 
 
 all this jurgen listened to and treasured up in his memory of 
 the happiest days of his childhood the days of the burial feast 
 how delightful it was to see fresh places and to mix with 
 strangers and he was to go still farther for he was not yet fourteen 
 years old when he went out in a ship to see the world he 
 encountered bad weather heavy seas unkindness and hard men such were his experiences for he became cold nights bad living and blows had to be endured then he felt his noble spanish blood boil within him and bitter angry words rose to his lips but he gulped them down it was better although he felt as the eel must feel when it is skinned cut up and put into the 
 i shall get over it said a voice within him 
 
 he saw the spanish coast the native land of his parents he 
 even saw the town where they had lived in joy and prosperity but he 
 knew nothing of his home or his relations and his relations knew just 
 as little about him 
 
 the poor ship boy was not permitted to land but on the last day 
 of their stay he managed to get ashore there were several purchases 
 to be made and he was sent to carry them on board 
 
 jurgen stood there in his shabby clothes which looked as if they 
 had been washed in the ditch and dried in the chimney he who had 
 always dwelt among the now saw a great city for the 
 first time how lofty the houses seemed and what a number of people there were in the streets some pushing this way some that a perfect maelstrom of citizens and peasants monks and soldiers the jingling of bells on the trappings of asses and mules the chiming of church bells calling shouting hammering and knocking all going on at once every trade was located in the basement of the houses or in 
 the side thoroughfares and the sun shone with such heat and the 
 air was so close that one seemed to be in an oven full of beetles 
 cockchafers bees and flies all humming and buzzing together 
 jurgen scarcely knew where he was or which way he went then he saw just in front of him the great doorway of a cathedral the lights were gleaming in the dark aisles and the fragrance of incense was wafted towards him even the poorest beggar ventured up the steps into the sanctuary jurgen followed the sailor he was with into the church and stood in the sacred edifice coloured pictures gleamed from their golden background and on the altar stood the figure of the virgin with the child jesus surrounded by lights and flowers priests in festive robes were chanting and choir boys in dazzling attire swung 
 silver censers what splendour and magnificence he saw there it 
 streamed in upon his soul and overpowered him the church and the 
 faith of his parents surrounded him and touched a chord in his 
 heart that caused his eyes to overflow with tears 
 
 they went from the church to the here a quantity 
 of provisions were given him to carry the way to the harbour was 
 long and weary and overcome with various emotions he rested for a 
 few moments before a splendid house with marble pillars statues and broad steps here he rested his burden against the wall then a porter in livery came out lifted up a cane and drove him away him the grandson of that house but no one knew that and he just as little as any one then he went on board again and once more encountered rough words and blows much work and little was his experience of life they say it is good to suffer in 
 young days if age brings something to make up for it 
 
 his period of service on board the ship came to an end and the 
 vessel lay once more at ringkjobing in jutland he came ashore and 
 went home to the near hunsby but his had 
 died during his absence 
 
 a hard winter followed this summer swept over land 
 and sea and there was difficulty in getting from one place to 
 another how unequally things are distributed in this world here 
 there was bitter cold and while in spain there was 
 burning sunshine and oppressive heat yet when a clear frosty day 
 came and jurgen saw the swans flying in numbers from the sea 
 towards the land across to it seemed to him that 
 people could breathe more freely here the summer also in this part of 
 the world was splendid in imagination he saw the heath blossom and 
 become purple with rich juicy berries and the and 
 at norre vosborg in flower he made up his mind to go there again 
 
 spring came and the fishing began jurgen was now an active 
 helper in this for he had grown during the last year and was quick 
 at work he was full of life and knew how to swim to tread water 
 and to turn over and tumble in the strong tide they often warned 
 him to beware of the sharks which seize the best swimmer draw him 
 down and devour him but such was not to be fate 
 
 at a house in the dunes there was a boy named 
 martin with whom jurgen was on very friendly terms and they both 
 took service in the same ship to norway and also went together to 
 holland they never had a quarrel but a person can be easily 
 excited to quarrel when he is naturally hot tempered for he often 
 shows it in many ways and this is just what jurgen did one day when 
 they fell out about the merest trifle they were sitting behind the 
 cabin door eating from a delft plate which they had placed between 
 them jurgen held his in his hand and raised it towards 
 martin and at the same time became ashy pale and his eyes had an 
 ugly look martin only said ah ah you are one of that sort are 
 you fond of using the knife 
 
 the words were scarcely spoken when hand sank down he 
 did not answer a syllable but went on eating and afterwards returned 
 to his work when they were resting again he walked up to martin and 
 said 
 
 hit me in the face i deserve it but sometimes i feel as if i 
 had a pot in me that boils over 
 there let the thing rest replied martin 
 
 and after that they were almost better friends than ever when 
 afterwards they returned to the dunes and began telling their 
 adventures this was told among the rest martin said that jurgen 
 was certainly passionate but a good fellow after all 
 
 they were both young and healthy and strong but 
 jurgen was the cleverer of the two 
 
 in norway the peasants go into the mountains and take the cattle 
 there to find pasture on the west coast of jutland huts have been 
 erected among the they are built of pieces of wreck and 
 thatched with turf and heather there are sleeping places round the 
 walls and here the fishermen live and sleep during the early 
 spring every fisherman has a female helper or manager as she is 
 called who baits his hooks prepares warm beer for him when he 
 comes ashore and gets the dinner cooked and ready for him by the time he comes back to the hut tired and hungry besides this the managers bring up the fish from the boats cut them open prepare them and have generally a great deal to do 
 
 jurgen his father and several other fishermen and their managers 
 inhabited the same hut martin lived in the next one 
 one of the girls whose name was else had known jurgen from 
 childhood they were glad to see each other and were of the same 
 opinion on many points but in appearance they were entirely opposite for he was dark and she was pale and fair and had flaxen hair and eyes as blue as the sea in sunshine 
 
 as they were walking together one day jurgen held her hand very 
 firmly in his and she said to him 
 
 jurgen i have something i want to say to you let me be your 
 manager for you are like a brother to me but martin whose 
 housekeeper i am he is my lover but you need not tell this to the 
 others 
 
 it seemed to jurgen as if the loose sand was giving way under 
 his feet he did not speak a word but nodded his head and that meant yes it was all that was necessary but he suddenly felt in his 
 heart that he hated martin and the more he thought the more he felt 
 convinced that martin had stolen away from him the only being he 
 ever loved and that this was else he had never thought of else in 
 this way before but now it all became plain to him 
 
 when the sea is rather rough and the fishermen are coming home in 
 their great boats it is wonderful to see how they cross the reefs 
 one of them stands upright in the bow of the boat and the others 
 watch him sitting with the oars in their hands outside the reef it 
 looks as if the boat was not approaching land but going back to sea 
 then the man who is standing up gives them the signal that the great 
 wave is coming which is to float them across the reef the boat is 
 lifted high into the air so that the keel is seen from the shore the 
 next moment nothing can be seen mast keel and people are all 
 hidden it seems as though the sea had devoured them but in a few 
 moments they emerge like a great sea animal climbing up the waves and the oars move as if the creature had legs the second and third reef are passed in the same manner then the fishermen jump into the 
 water and push the boat towards the shore every wave helps them 
 and at length they have it drawn up beyond the reach of the breakers 
 
 a wrong order given in front of the reef the slightest hesitation and the boat would be lost then it would be all over with me and martin too this thought passed through mind one day while they 
 were out at sea where his had been taken suddenly 
 ill the fever had seized him they were only a few oars strokes from 
 the reef and jurgen sprang from his seat and stood up in the bow 
 me come he said and he glanced at martin and across 
 the waves every oar bent with the exertions of the rowers as the 
 great wave came towards them and he saw his pale face and 
 dared not obey the evil impulse that had shot through his brain the 
 boat came safely across the reef to land but the evil thought 
 remained in his heart and roused up every little fibre of 
 bitterness which he remembered between himself and martin since they had known each other but he could not weave the fibres together nor did he endeavour to do so he felt that martin had robbed him and this was enough to make him hate his former friend several of the fishermen saw this but martin did not he remained as obliging and talkative as ever in fact he talked rather too much 
 
 took to his bed and it became his for he died a week afterwards and now jurgen was heir to the little house behind the it was small certainly but still it was something and martin had nothing of the kind 
 
 you will not go to sea again jurgen i suppose observed one of 
 the old fishermen you will always stay with us now 
 but this was not intention he wanted to see something of 
 the world the of fjaltring had an uncle at old skjagen 
 who was a fisherman but also a prosperous merchant with ships upon the sea he was said to be a good old man and it would not be a bad thing to enter his service old skjagen lies in the extreme north of jutland as far away from the hunsby dunes as one can travel in that country and this is just what pleased jurgen for he did not want 
 to remain till the wedding of martin and else which would take 
 place in a week or two 
 
 the old fisherman said it was foolish to go away for now that 
 jurgen had a home else would very likely be inclined to take him 
 instead of martin 
 
 jurgen gave such a vague answer that it was not easy to make out 
 what he meant the old man brought else to him and she said 
 you have a home now you ought to think of that 
 
 and jurgen thought of many things 
 
 the sea has heavy waves but there are heavier waves in the 
 human heart many thoughts strong and weak rushed through brain and he said to else 
 
 if martin had a house like mine which of us would you rather 
 have 
 but martin has no house and cannot get one 
 suppose he had one 
 well then i would certainly take martin for that is what my 
 heart tells me but one cannot live upon love 
 
 jurgen turned these things over in his mind all night something 
 was working within him he hardly knew what it was but it was even 
 stronger than his love for else and so he went to and 
 what he said and did there was well considered he let the house to 
 martin on most liberal terms saying that he wished to go to sea 
 again because he loved it and else kissed him when she heard of 
 it for she loved martin best 
 
 jurgen proposed to start early in the morning and on the 
 evening before his departure when it was already getting rather late 
 he felt a wish to visit martin once more he started and among the 
 dunes met the old fisherman who was angry at his leaving the place 
 
 the old man made jokes about martin and declared there must be some magic about that fellow of whom the girls were so fond 
 jurgen did not pay any attention to his remarks but said 
 to the old man and went on towards the house where martin dwelt 
 he heard loud talking inside martin was not alone and this made 
 jurgen waver in his determination for he did not wish to see else 
 again on second thoughts he decided that it was better not to hear 
 any more thanks from martin and so he turned back 
 
 on the following morning before the sun rose he fastened his 
 knapsack on his back took his wooden provision box in his hand and went away among the towards the coast path this way was more pleasant than the heavy sand road and besides it was shorter and he intended to go first to fjaltring near bovbjerg where the lived to whom he had promised a visit 
 
 the sea lay before him clear and blue and the mussel shells 
 and pebbles the playthings of his childhood crunched over his 
 feet while he thus walked on his nose suddenly began to bleed it was a trifling occurrence but trifles sometimes are of great 
 importance a few large drops of blood fell upon one of his sleeves 
 
 he wiped them off and stopped the bleeding and it seemed to him as if this had cleared and lightened his brain the bloomed here 
 and there in the sand as he passed he broke off a spray and stuck 
 it in his hat he determined to be merry and for he was 
 going out into the wide world a little way out beyond the bay 
 as the young eels had said beware of bad people who will catch 
 you and skin you and put you in the he repeated in 
 his mind and smiled for he thought he should find his way through 
 the world good courage is a strong weapon 
 
 the sun was high in the heavens when he approached the narrow 
 entrance to nissum bay he looked back and saw a couple of horsemen galloping a long distance behind him and there were other people with them but this did not concern him 
 
 the was on the opposite side of the bay jurgen 
 called to the and the latter came over with his boat 
 jurgen stepped in but before he had got across the men whom he had seen riding so hastily came up hailed the and commanded him to return in the name of the law jurgen did not 
 understand the reason of this but he thought it would be best to turn 
 back and therefore he himself took an oar and returned as soon as 
 the boat touched the shore the men sprang on board and before he was aware of it they had bound his hands with a rope 
 
 this wicked deed will cost you your life they said it is a 
 good thing we have caught you 
 
 he was accused of nothing less than murder martin had been 
 found dead with his throat cut one of the fishermen late on the 
 previous evening had met jurgen going towards house this 
 was not the first time jurgen had raised his knife against martin 
 so they felt sure that he was the murderer the prison was in a town 
 at a great distance and the wind was contrary for going there by sea 
 but it would not take half an hour to get across the bay and 
 another quarter of an hour would bring them to the 
 great castle with ramparts and moat one of captors was a 
 fisherman a brother of the keeper of the castle and he said it might 
 be managed that jurgen should be placed for the present in the dungeon at vosborg where long martha the gipsy had been shut up till her execution they paid no attention to defence the few drops of blood on his bore heavy witness against him 
 
 but he was conscious of his innocence and as there was no chance of clearing himself at present he submitted to his fate 
 
 the party landed just at the place where sir castle had 
 stood and where jurgen had walked with his after the 
 burial feast during the four happiest days of his childhood he 
 was led by the path over the meadow to vosborg once 
 more the elders were in bloom and the lofty gave forth 
 sweet fragrance and it seemed as if it were but yesterday that he had 
 last seen the spot in each of the two wings of the castle there was a 
 staircase which led to a place below the entrance from whence there 
 is access to a low vaulted cellar in this dungeon long martha had 
 been imprisoned and from here she was led away to the scaffold she had eaten the hearts of five children and had imagined that if she 
 could obtain two more she would be able to fly and make herself 
 invisible in the middle of the roof of the cellar there was a 
 little narrow but no window the flowering lime trees 
 could not breathe refreshing fragrance into that abode where 
 everything was dark and mouldy there was only a rough bench in the cell but a good conscience is a soft pillow and therefore jurgen 
 could sleep well 
 
 the thick oaken door was locked and secured on the outside by 
 an iron bar but the goblin of superstition can creep through a 
 keyhole into a castle just as easily as it can into a 
 cottage and why should he not creep in here where jurgen sat thinking of long martha and her wicked deeds her last thoughts on the night before her execution had filled this place and the magic that tradition asserted to have been practised here in sir 
 time came into mind and made him shudder but a sunbeam a refreshing thought from without penetrated his heart 
 even here it was the remembrance of the flowering elder and the sweet smelling 
 
 he was not left there long they took him away to the town of 
 ringkjobing where he was imprisoned with equal severity 
 those times were not like ours the common people were treated 
 harshly and it was just after the days when farms were converted into 
 knights estates when coachmen and servants were often made 
 magistrates and had power to sentence a poor man for a small 
 offence to lose his property and to corporeal punishment judges of 
 this kind were still to be found and in jutland so far from the 
 capital and from the enlightened head of the 
 government the law was still very loosely administered sometimes the smallest grievance jurgen could expect was that his case should be delayed 
 
 his dwelling was cold and comfortless and how long would he be 
 obliged to bear all this it seemed his fate to suffer misfortune 
 and sorrow innocently he now had plenty of time to reflect on the 
 difference of fortune on earth and to wonder why this fate had been 
 allotted to him yet he felt sure that all would be made clear in 
 the next life the existence that awaits us when this life is over 
 his faith had grown strong in the poor cottage the 
 light which had never shone into his mind in all the 
 richness and sunshine of spain was sent to him to be his comfort in 
 poverty and distress a sign of that mercy of god which never fails 
 the spring storms began to blow the rolling and moaning of the 
 north sea could be heard for miles inland when the wind was blowing and then it sounded like the rushing of a thousand waggons over a hard road with a mine underneath jurgen heard these sounds in his prison and it was a relief to him no music could have touched his heart as did these sounds of the sea the rolling sea the boundless 
 sea on which a man can be borne across the world before the wind 
 carrying his own house with him wherever he goes just as the snail 
 carries its home even into a strange country 
 
 he listened eagerly to its deep murmur and then the thought arose 
 free free how happy to be free even barefooted and in ragged 
 clothes sometimes when such thoughts crossed his mind the fiery 
 nature rose within him and he beat the wall with his clenched fists 
 weeks months a whole year had gone by when niels the thief 
 called also a was arrested and now better times came 
 and it was seen that jurgen had been wrongly accused 
 
 on the afternoon before departure from home and before 
 the murder niels the thief had met martin at a in the 
 neighbourhood of ringkjobing a few glasses were drank not enough to cloud the brain but enough to loosen tongue he began to boast and to say that he had obtained a house and intended to marry and when niels asked him where he was going to get the money he slapped his pocket proudly and said 
 
 the money is here where it ought to be 
 this boast cost him his life for when he went home niels followed 
 him and cut his throat intending to rob the murdered man of the 
 gold which did not exist 
 all this was circumstantially explained but it is enough for us 
 to know that jurgen was set free but what compensation did he get for having been imprisoned a whole year and shut out from all 
 communication with his fellow creatures they told him he was 
 fortunate in being proved innocent and that he might go the 
 burgomaster gave him two dollars for travelling expenses and many 
 citizens offered him provisions and beer there were still good 
 people they were not all hard and pitiless but the best thing of all 
 was that the merchant bronne of skjagen into whose service jurgen 
 had proposed entering the year before was just at that time on 
 business in the town of ringkjobing bronne heard the whole story 
 he was and understood what jurgen must have felt and 
 suffered therefore he made up his mind to make it up to the poor lad and convince him that there were still kind folks in the world 
 so jurgen went forth from prison as if to paradise to find 
 freedom affection and trust he was to travel this path now for 
 no goblet of life is all bitterness no good man would pour out such a 
 draught for his and how should he do it who is love 
 personified 
 
 let everything be buried and forgotten said bronne the 
 merchant let us draw a thick line through last year we will even 
 burn the almanack in two days we will start for dear friendly 
 peaceful skjagen people call it an corner but it is a 
 good warm and its windows open toward every part of the world 
 
 what a journey that was it was like taking fresh breath out of 
 the cold dungeon air into the warm sunshine the heather bloomed in 
 pride and beauty and the sat on a barrow and blew his 
 pipe which he had carved for himself out of a sheep bone fata 
 morgana the beautiful aerial phenomenon of the wilderness appeared 
 with hanging gardens and waving forests and the wonderful cloud 
 called lokeman driving his sheep also was seen 
 
 up towards skjagen they went through the land of the wendels 
 whence the men with long beards the longobardi or lombards had 
 emigrated in the reign of king snio when all the children and old 
 people were to have been killed till the noble dame gambaruk proposed that the young people should emigrate jurgen knew all this he had some little knowledge and although he did not know the land of the lombards beyond the lofty alps he had an idea that it must be 
 there for in his boyhood he had been in the south in spain he 
 thought of the plenteousness of the southern fruit of the red 
 pomegranate flowers of the humming buzzing and toiling in the great beehive of a city he had seen but home is the best place after all and home was denmark 
 
 at last they arrived at vendilskaga as skjagen is called in old 
 norwegian and icelandic writings at that time old skjagen with the 
 eastern and western town extended for miles with sand hills and 
 arable land as far as the lighthouse near grenen then as now 
 the houses were strewn among the a 
 wilderness in which the wind sports with the sand and where the voice of the and wild swan strikes harshly on the ear 
 
 
 in the a mile from grenen lies old skjagen 
 merchant bronne dwelt here and this was also to be home 
 for the future the was tarred and all the small 
 had been put together from pieces of wreck there was no fence for indeed there was nothing to fence in except the long rows of fishes which were hung upon lines one above the other to dry in the wind the entire coast was strewn with spoiled herrings for there were so many of these fish that a net was scarcely thrown into the sea before it was filled they were caught by carloads and many of them were either thrown back into the sea or left to lie on the beach 
 
 the old wife and daughter and his servants also came to meet 
 him with great rejoicing there was a great squeezing of hands and 
 talking and questioning and the daughter what a sweet face and 
 bright eyes she had 
 
 the inside of the house was comfortable and roomy fritters 
 that a king would have looked upon as a dainty dish were placed on 
 the table and there was wine from the skjagen vineyard that is 
 the sea for there the grapes come ashore ready pressed and prepared 
 in barrels and in bottles 
 
 when the mother and daughter heard who jurgen was and how 
 innocently he had suffered they looked at him in a still more 
 friendly way and pretty eyes had a look of especial 
 interest as she listened to his story jurgen found a happy home in 
 old skjagen it did his heart good for it had been sorely tried he 
 had drunk the bitter goblet of love which softens or hardens the 
 heart according to circumstances heart was still soft it 
 was young and therefore it was a good thing that miss clara was going in three weeks time to christiansand in norway in her ship to visit an aunt and to stay there the whole winter 
 on the sunday before she went away they all went to church to the 
 
 holy communion the church was large and handsome and had been built centuries before by scotchmen and dutchmen it stood some little way out of the town it was rather ruinous certainly and the road to it was heavy through deep sand but the people gladly surmounted these difficulties to get to the house of god to sing psalms and to hear the sermon the sand had heaped itself up round the walls of the church but the graves were kept free from it 
 it was the largest church north of the limfjorden the virgin 
 mary with a golden crown on her head and the child jesus in her arms stood lifelike on the altar the holy apostles had been carved in 
 the choir and on the walls there were portraits of the old 
 burgomasters and councillors of skjagen the pulpit was of carved 
 work the sun shone brightly into the church and its radiance fell on 
 the polished brass chandelier and on the little ship that hung from 
 the vaulted roof 
 
 jurgen felt overcome by a holy childlike feeling like that which 
 possessed him when as a boy he stood in the splendid spanish 
 cathedral but here the feeling was different for he felt conscious 
 of being one of the congregation 
 
 after the sermon followed holy communion he partook of the 
 bread and wine and it so happened that he knelt by the side of miss 
 clara but his thoughts were so fixed upon heaven and the holy 
 sacrament that he did not notice his neighbour until he rose from 
 his knees and then he saw tears rolling down her cheeks 
 
 she left skjagen and went to norway two days later he remained 
 behind and made himself useful on the farm and at the fishery he 
 went out fishing and in those days fish were more plentiful and 
 larger than they are now the shoals of the mackerel glittered in 
 the dark nights and indicated where they were swimming the 
 gurnards snarled and the crabs gave forth pitiful yells when they 
 were chased for fish are not so mute as people say 
 
 every sunday jurgen went to church and when his eyes rested on 
 the picture of the virgin mary over the altar as he sat there they 
 often glided away to the spot where they had knelt side by side 
 autumn came and brought rain and snow with it the water rose 
 up right into the town of skjagen the sand could not suck it all 
 in one had to wade through it or go by boat the storms threw 
 vessel after vessel on the fatal reefs there were and 
 the sand flew up to the houses blocking the entrances 
 so that people had to creep up through the chimneys that was 
 nothing at all remarkable here it was pleasant and cheerful 
 indoors where peat fuel and fragments of wood from the wrecks 
 blazed and crackled upon the hearth merchant bronne read aloud 
 from an old chronicle about prince hamlet of denmark who had come over from england landed near bovbjerg and fought a battle close by ramme was his grave only a few miles from the place where the lived hundreds of barrow rose there from the heath forming as it were an enormous churchyard merchant bronne had himself been at grave they spoke about old times and about their neighbours the english and the scotch and jurgen sang the air of the king of son and of his splendid ship and its outfit 
 in the hour of peril when most men fear 
 he clasped the bride that he held so dear 
 and proved himself the son of a king 
 of his courage and valour let us sing 
 this verse jurgen sang with so much feeling that his eyes 
 beamed and they were black and sparkling since his infancy 
 there was wealth comfort and happiness even among the domestic 
 animals for they were all well cared for and well kept the 
 kitchen looked bright with its copper and tin utensils and white 
 plates and from the rafters hung hams beef and winter stores in 
 plenty this can still be seen in many rich farms on the west coast of 
 jutland plenty to eat and drink clean prettily decorated rooms 
 active minds cheerful tempers and hospitality can be found there as 
 in an tent 
 
 jurgen had never spent such a happy time since the famous burial 
 feast and yet miss clara was absent except in the thoughts and 
 memory of all 
 
 in april a ship was to start for norway and jurgen was to sail in 
 it he was full of life and spirits and looked so sturdy and well 
 that dame bronne said it did her good to see him 
 
 and it does one good to look at you also old wife said the 
 merchant jurgen has brought fresh life into our winter evenings and 
 into you too mother you look younger than ever this year and seem 
 well and cheerful but then you were once the prettiest girl in 
 viborg and that is saying a great deal for i have always found the 
 viborg girls the prettiest of any 
 
 jurgen said nothing but he thought of a certain maiden of 
 skjagen whom he was soon to visit the ship set sail for 
 christiansand in norway and as the wind was favourable it soon 
 arrived there 
 
 one morning merchant bronne went out to the lighthouse which 
 stands a little way out of old skjagen not far from grenen the 
 light was out and the sun was already high in the heavens when he 
 mounted the tower the extend a whole mile from the 
 shore beneath the water outside these banks many ships could be 
 seen that day and with the aid of his telescope the old man thought 
 he descried his own ship the karen bronne yes certainly there 
 she was sailing homewards with clara and jurgen on board 
 
 clara sat on deck and saw the gradually appearing in 
 the distance the church and lighthouse looked like a heron and a swan rising from the blue waters if the wind held good they might reach home in about an hour so near they were to home and all its near to death and all its terrors a plank in the ship gave way 
 and the water rushed in the crew flew to the pumps and did their 
 best to stop the leak a signal of distress was hoisted but they were 
 still fully a mile from the shore some fishing boats were in sight 
 but they were too far off to be of any use the wind blew towards 
 the land the tide was in their favour but it was all useless the 
 ship could not be saved 
 
 jurgen threw his right arm round clara and pressed her to him 
 with what a look she gazed up into his face as with a prayer to god 
 for help he breasted the waves which rushed over the sinking ship 
 she uttered a cry but she felt safe and certain that he would not 
 leave her to sink and in this hour of terror and danger jurgen felt 
 as the son did as told in the old song 
 in the hour of peril when most men fear 
 he clasped the bride that he held so dear 
 how glad he felt that he was a good swimmer he worked his way 
 onward with his feet and one arm while he held the young girl up 
 firmly with the other he rested on the waves he trod the water in 
 fact did everything he could think of in order not to fatigue 
 himself and to reserve strength enough to reach land he heard 
 clara sigh and felt her shudder convulsively and he pressed her more closely to him now and then a wave rolled over them the current lifted them the water although deep was so clear that for a 
 moment he imagined he saw the shoals of mackerel glittering or 
 leviathan himself ready to swallow them now the clouds cast a 
 shadow over the water then again came the playing sunbeams flocks of loudly screaming birds passed over him and the plump and lazy wild ducks which allow themselves to be drifted by the waves rose up 
 terrified at the sight of the swimmer he began to feel his strength 
 decreasing but he was only a few cable lengths distance from the 
 shore and help was coming for a boat was approaching him at this 
 moment he distinctly saw a white staring figure under the water a 
 wave lifted him up and he came nearer to the figure he felt a 
 violent shock and everything became dark around him 
 
 on the sand reef lay the wreck of a ship which was covered with 
 water at high tide the white figure head rested against the anchor 
 the sharp iron edge of which rose just above the surface jurgen had 
 come in contact with this the tide had driven him against it with 
 great force he sank down stunned with the blow but the next wave 
 lifted him and the young girl up again some fishermen coming with 
 a boat seized them and dragged them into it the blood streamed 
 down over face he seemed dead but still held the young girl 
 so tightly that they were obliged to take her from him by force she 
 was pale and lifeless they laid her in the boat and rowed as quickly 
 as possible to the shore they tried every means to restore clara to 
 life but it was all of no avail jurgen had been swimming for some 
 distance with a corpse in his arms and had exhausted his strength for 
 one who was dead 
 
 jurgen still breathed so the fishermen carried him to the nearest 
 house upon the where a smith and general dealer lived 
 who knew something of surgery and bound up wounds in a 
 temporary way until a surgeon could be obtained from the nearest 
 town the next day the injured brain was affected and in his 
 delirium he uttered wild cries but on the third day he lay quiet 
 and weak upon his bed his life seemed to hang by a thread and the 
 physician said it would be better for him if this thread broke let 
 us pray that god may take him he said for he will never be the 
 same man again 
 
 but life did not depart from him the thread would not break 
 but the thread of memory was severed the thread of his mind had 
 been cut through and what was still more grievous a body remained a living healthy body that wandered about like a troubled spirit 
 
 jurgen remained in merchant house he was hurt while 
 endeavouring to save our child said the old man and now he is 
 our son people called jurgen insane but that was not exactly the 
 correct term he was like an instrument in which the strings are loose 
 and will give no sound only occasionally they regained their power 
 for a few minutes and then they sounded as they used to do he 
 would sing snatches of songs or old melodies pictures of the past 
 would rise before him and then disappear in the mist as it were but 
 as a general rule he sat staring into vacancy without a thought we 
 may conjecture that he did not suffer but his dark eyes lost their 
 brightness and looked like clouded glass 
 
 poor mad jurgen said the people and this was the end of a life 
 whose infancy was to have been surrounded with wealth and splendour had his parents lived all his great mental abilities had been lost nothing but hardship sorrow and disappointment had been his fate 
 he was like a rare plant torn from its native soil and tossed upon 
 the beach to wither there and was this one of creatures 
 fashioned in his own likeness to have no better fate was he to be 
 only the plaything of fortune no the creator would 
 certainly repay him in the life to come for what he had suffered and 
 lost here the lord is good to all and his mercy is over all his 
 works the pious old wife of the merchant repeated these words from the psalms of david in patience and hope and the prayer of her 
 heart was that jurgen might soon be called away to enter into 
 eternal life 
 
 in the churchyard where the walls were surrounded with sand 
 clara lay buried jurgen did not seem to know this it did not enter 
 his mind which could only retain fragments of the past every 
 sunday he went to church with the old people and sat there 
 silently staring vacantly before him one day when the psalms were 
 being sung he sighed deeply and his eyes became bright they were 
 fixed upon a place near the altar where he had knelt with his friend 
 who was dead he murmured her name and became deadly pale and 
 tears rolled down his cheeks they led him out of church he told 
 those standing round him that he was well and had never been ill he 
 who had been so grievously afflicted the outcast thrown upon the 
 world could not remember his sufferings the lord our creator is wise and full of loving kindness who can doubt it 
 
 in spain where balmy breezes blow over the moorish cupolas and 
 gently stir the orange and myrtle groves where singing and the 
 sound of the castanets are always heard the richest merchant in the 
 place a childless old man sat in a luxurious house while children 
 marched in procession through the streets with waving flags and 
 lighted tapers if he had been able to press his children to his 
 heart his daughter or her child that had perhaps never seen the 
 light of day far less the kingdom of heaven how much of his wealth 
 would he not have given poor child yes poor child a child still 
 yet more than thirty years old for jurgen had arrived at this age 
 in old skjagen 
 
 the shifting sands had covered the graves in the courtyard 
 quite up to the church walls but still the dead must be buried among 
 their relatives and the dear ones who had gone before them merchant 
 bronne and his wife now rested with their children under the white 
 sand 
 
 it was in the spring the season of storms the sand from the 
 dunes was whirled up in clouds the sea was rough and flocks of birds flew like clouds in the storm screaming across the 
 shipwreck followed upon shipwreck on the reefs between old skagen and the hunsby dunes 
 
 one evening jurgen sat in his room alone all at once his mind 
 seemed to become clearer and a restless feeling came over him such 
 as had often in his younger days driven him out to wander over the 
 or on the heath home home he cried no one heard 
 him he went out and walked towards the dunes sand and stones blew into his face and whirled round him he went in the direction of 
 the church the sand was banked up the walls half covering the 
 windows but it had been cleared away in front of the door and the 
 entrance was free and easy to open so jurgen went into the church 
 
 the storm raged over the town of skjagen there had not been 
 such a terrible tempest within the memory of the inhabitants nor such 
 a rough sea but jurgen was in the temple of god and while the 
 darkness of night reigned outside a light arose in his soul that 
 was never to depart from it the heavy weight that pressed on his 
 brain burst asunder he fancied he heard the organ but it was only 
 the storm and the moaning of the sea he sat down on one of the seats and lo the candies were lighted one by one and there was 
 brightness and grandeur such as he had only seen in the spanish 
 cathedral the portraits of the old citizens became alive stepped 
 down from the walls against which they had hung for centuries and 
 took seats near the church door the gates flew open and all the dead people from the churchyard came in and filled the church while 
 beautiful music sounded then the melody of the psalm burst forth 
 like the sound of the waters and jurgen saw that his foster parents 
 from the hunsby dunes were there also old merchant bronne with his 
 wife and their daughter clara who gave him her hand they both went up to the altar where they had knelt before and the priest joined 
 their hands and united them for life then music was heard again it 
 was wonderfully sweet like a voice full of joy and 
 expectation swelling to the powerful tones of a full organ sometimes 
 soft and sweet then like the sounds of a tempest delightful and 
 elevating to hear yet strong enough to burst the stone tombs of the 
 dead then the little ship that hung from the roof of the choir was 
 let down and looked wonderfully large and beautiful with its silken 
 sails and rigging 
 the ropes were of silk the anchor of gold 
 and everywhere riches and pomp the old song says 
 
 the young couple went on board accompanied by the whole 
 congregation for there was room and enjoyment for them all then 
 the walls and arches of the church were covered with flowering 
 junipers and lime trees breathing forth fragrance the branches waved 
 creating a pleasant coolness they bent and parted and the ship 
 sailed between them through the air and over the sea every candle 
 in the church became a star and the wind sang a hymn in which they 
 all joined through love to glory no life is lost the future is 
 full of blessings and happiness hallelujah these were the last 
 words jurgen uttered in this world for the thread that bound his 
 immortal soul was severed and nothing but the dead body lay in the 
 dark church while the storm raged outside covering it with loose 
 sand 
 
 the next day was sunday and the congregation and their pastor 
 went to the church the road had always been heavy but now it was 
 almost unfit for use and when they at last arrived at the church a 
 great heap of sand lay piled up in front of them the whole church was completely buried in sand the clergyman offered a short prayer and said that god had closed the door of his house here and that the 
 congregation must go and build a new one for him somewhere else so they sung a hymn in the open air and went home again 
 
 jurgen could not be found anywhere in the town of skjagen nor 
 on the dunes though they searched for him everywhere they came to the conclusion that one of the great waves which had rolled far up 
 on the beach had carried him away but his body lay buried in a 
 great sepulchre the church itself the lord had thrown down a 
 covering for his grave during the storm and the heavy mound of sand 
 lies upon it to this day the drifting sand had covered the vaulted 
 roof of the church the arched cloisters and the stone aisles the 
 white thorn and the dog rose now blossom above the place where the 
 church lies buried but the spire like an enormous monument over a 
 grave can be seen for miles round no king has a more splendid 
 memorial nothing disturbs the peaceful sleep of the dead i was the 
 first to hear this story for the storm sung it to me among the

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a story from the 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 this story is from the or of jutland but it 
 does not begin there in the north but far away in the south in spain the wide sea is the highroad from nation to nation journey in thought then to sunny spain it is warm and beautiful there 
 the fiery pomegranate flowers peep from among dark laurels a cool 
 refreshing breeze from the mountains blows over the orange gardens 
 over the moorish halls with their golden cupolas and coloured walls 
 
 children go through the streets in procession with candles and 
 waving banners and the sky lofty and clear with its glittering 
 stars rises above them sounds of singing and castanets can be heard and youths and maidens dance upon the flowering acacia trees while even the beggar sits upon a block of marble refreshing himself with a juicy melon and dreamily enjoying life it all seems like a beautiful dream 
 
 here dwelt a newly married couple who completely gave themselves 
 up to the charm of life indeed they possessed every good thing they 
 could desire health and happiness riches and honour 
 
 we are as happy as human beings can be said the young couple 
 from the depths of their hearts they had indeed only one step 
 higher to mount on the ladder of happiness they hoped that god 
 would give them a child a son like them in form and spirit the happy 
 little one was to be welcomed with rejoicing to be cared for with 
 love and tenderness and enjoy every advantage of wealth and luxury 
 that a rich and influential family can give so the days went by 
 like a joyous festival 
 
 life is a gracious gift from god almost too great a gift for 
 us to appreciate said the young wife yet they say that fulness 
 of joy for ever and ever can only be found in the future life i 
 cannot realise it 
 
 the thought arises perhaps from the arrogance of men said the 
 husband it seems a great pride to believe that we shall live for 
 ever that we shall be as gods were not these the words of the 
 serpent the father of lies 
 
 surely you do not doubt the existence of a future life 
 exclaimed the young wife it seemed as if one of the first shadows 
 passed over her sunny thoughts 
 
 faith realises it and the priests tell us so replied her 
 husband but amid all my happiness i feel that it is arrogant to 
 demand a continuation of it another life after this has not so 
 much been given us in this world that we ought to be we must be 
 contented with it 
 
 yes it has been given to us said the young wife but this 
 life is nothing more than one long scene of trial and hardship to many 
 thousands how many have been cast into this world only to endure 
 poverty shame illness and misfortune if there were no future life 
 everything here would be too unequally divided and god would not be the personification of justice 
 
 the beggar there said her husband has joys of his own which 
 seem to him great and cause him as much pleasure as a king would find in the magnificence of his palace and then do you not think that 
 the beast of burden which suffers blows and hunger and works 
 itself to death suffers just as much from its miserable fate the 
 dumb creature might demand a future life also and declare the law 
 unjust that excludes it from the advantages of the higher creation 
 christ said in my house are many mansions she 
 answered heaven is as boundless as the love of our creator the dumb animal is also his creature and i firmly believe that no life will be lost but each will receive as much happiness as he can enjoy which will be sufficient for him 
 
 this world is sufficient for me said the husband throwing 
 his arm round his beautiful wife he sat by her side 
 on the open balcony smoking a cigarette in the cool air which was 
 loaded with the sweet scent of carnations and orange blossoms 
 sounds of music and the clatter of castanets came from the road 
 beneath the stars shone above then and two eyes full of affection 
 those of his wife looked upon him with the expression of undying 
 love such a moment he said makes it worth while to be born to 
 die and to be annihilated he smiled the young wife raised her hand 
 in gentle reproof and the shadow passed away from her mind and 
 they were happy quite happy 
 
 everything seemed to work together for their good they advanced 
 in honour in prosperity and in happiness a change came certainly 
 but it was only a change of place and not of circumstances 
 the young man was sent by his sovereign as ambassador to the 
 russian court this was an office of high dignity but his birth and 
 his acquirements entitled him to the honour he possessed a large 
 fortune and his wife had brought him wealth equal to his own for she 
 was the daughter of a rich and respected merchant one of this 
 largest and finest ships was to be sent that year to 
 stockholm and it was arranged that the dear young couple the 
 daughter and the should travel in it to st petersburg 
 all the arrangements on board were princely and silk and luxury on 
 every side 
 
 in an old war song called the king of son it says 
 farewell he said and sailed away 
 and many recollect that day 
 the ropes were of silk the anchor of gold 
 and everywhere riches and wealth untold 
 these words would aptly describe the vessel from spain for here 
 was the same luxury and the same parting thought naturally arose 
 god grant that we once more may meet 
 in sweet unclouded peace and joy 
 there was a favourable wind blowing as they left the spanish 
 coast and it would be but a short journey for they hoped to reach 
 their destination in a few weeks but when they came out upon the wide ocean the wind dropped the sea became smooth and shining and the stars shone brightly many festive evenings were spent on board at last the travellers began to wish for wind for a favourable breeze but their wish was useless not a breath of air stirred or if it 
 did arise it was contrary weeks passed by in this way two whole 
 months and then at length a fair wind blew from the the 
 ship sailed on the high seas between scotland and jutland then the 
 wind increased just as it did in the old song of the king of 
 son 
 mid storm and wind and pelting hail 
 their efforts were of no avail 
 the golden anchor forth they threw 
 towards denmark the west wind blew 
 this all happened a long time ago king christian vii who sat 
 on the danish throne was still a young man much has happened since then much has altered or been changed sea and moorland have been turned into green meadows stretches of heather have become arable land and in the shelter of the cottages and grow though they certainly require much care as the sharp west wind blows upon them in west jutland one may go back in thought to old times farther back than the days when christian vii ruled the purple heather still extends for miles with its barrows and aerial spectacles intersected with sandy uneven roads just as it did then towards the west where broad streams run into the bays are marshes and meadows encircled by lofty sandy hills which like a chain of alps raise their pointed summits near the sea they are only broken by high ridges of clay from which the sea year by year bites out great mouthfuls so that the overhanging banks fall down as if by the shock of an earthquake thus it is there today and thus it was long ago when the happy pair were sailing in the beautiful ship 
 it was a sunday towards the end of september the sun was 
 shining and the chiming of the church bells in the bay of nissum 
 was carried along by the breeze like a chain of sounds the churches 
 there are almost entirely built of hewn blocks of stone each like a 
 piece of rock the north sea might foam over them and they would not be disturbed nearly all of them are without steeples and the bells 
 are hung outside between two beams the service was over and the 
 congregation passed out into the churchyard where not a tree or 
 bush was to be seen no flowers were planted there and they had not 
 placed a single wreath upon any of the graves it is just the same 
 now rough mounds show where the dead have been buried and rank grass tossed by the wind grows thickly over the whole churchyard here and there a grave has a sort of monument a block of wood rudely cut in the shape of a coffin the blocks are brought from the forest of west jutland but the forest is the sea itself and the inhabitants find beams and planks and fragments which the waves have cast upon the beach one of these blocks had been placed by loving hands on a grave and one of the women who had come out of the church walked up to it she stood there her eyes resting on the memorial and a few moments afterwards her husband joined her they were both silent but he took her hand and they walked together across the purple heath over moor and meadow towards the sandhills for a long time they went on without speaking 
 
 it was a good sermon the man said at last if we had 
 not god to trust in we should have nothing 
 
 yes replied the woman he sends joy and sorrow and he has a 
 right to send them our little son would have been five 
 years old if we had been permitted to keep him 
 
 it is no use fretting wife said the man the boy is well 
 provided for he is where we hope and pray to go to 
 
 they said nothing more but went out towards their houses among 
 the all at once in front of one of the houses where the 
 sea grass did not keep the sand down with its twining roots what 
 seemed to be a column of smoke rose up a gust of wind rushed 
 between the hills hurling the particles of sand high into the air 
 another gust and the strings of fish hung up to dry flapped and 
 beat violently against the walls of the cottage then everything was 
 quiet once more and the sun shone with renewed heat 
 
 the man and his wife went into the cottage they had soon taken 
 off their sunday clothes and come out again hurrying over the dunes 
 which stood there like great waves of sand suddenly arrested in 
 their course while the sandweeds and dune grass with its bluish 
 stalks spread a changing colour over them a few neighbours also 
 came out and helped each other to draw the boats higher up on the 
 beach the wind now blew more keenly it was chilly and cold and when they went back over the sand and little sharp stones 
 blew into their faces the waves rose high crested with white foam 
 and the wind cut off their crests scattering the foam far and wide 
 evening came there was a swelling roar in the air a wailing or 
 moaning like the voices of despairing spirits that sounded above 
 the thunder of the waves the little cottage was on the 
 very margin and the sand rattled against the window panes every 
 now and then a violent gust of wind shook the house to its foundation 
 
 it was dark but about midnight the moon would rise later on the 
 air became clearer but the storm swept over the perturbed sea with 
 undiminished fury the fisher folks had long since gone to bed but in 
 such weather there was no chance of closing an eye presently there 
 was a tapping at the window the door was opened and a voice said 
 a large ship stranded on the farthest reef 
 
 in a moment the fisher people sprung from their beds and hastily 
 dressed themselves the moon had risen and it was light enough to 
 make the surrounding objects visible to those who could open their 
 eyes in the blinding clouds of sand the violence of the wind was 
 terrible and it was only possible to pass among the if one 
 crept forward between the gusts the salt spray flew up from the sea 
 like down and the ocean foamed like a roaring cataract towards the 
 beach only a practised eye could discern the vessel out in the 
 offing she was a fine brig and the waves now lifted her over the 
 reef three or four cables length out of the usual channel she drove 
 towards the shore struck on the second reef and remained fixed 
 it was impossible to render assistance the sea rushed in upon the 
 vessel making a clean breach over her those on shore thought they 
 heard cries for help from those on board and could plainly 
 distinguish the busy but useless efforts made by the stranded sailors 
 now a wave came rolling onward it fell with enormous force on the 
 bowsprit tearing it from the vessel and the stern was lifted high 
 above the water two people were seen to embrace and plunge together into the sea and the next moment one of the largest waves that rolled towards the threw a body on the beach it was a woman the sailors said that she was quite dead but the women thought they saw signs of life in her so the stranger was carried across the to the cottage how beautiful and fair she was 
 
 she must be a great lady they said 
 
 they laid her upon the humble bed there was not a yard of linen 
 on it only a woollen coverlet to keep the occupant warm 
 life returned to her but she was delirious and knew nothing of 
 what had happened or where she was and it was better so for 
 everything she loved and valued lay buried in the sea the same 
 thing happened to her ship as to the one spoken of in the song about 
 the king of son 
 alas how terrible to see 
 the gallant bark sink rapidly 
 fragments of the wreck and pieces of wood were washed ashore they were all that remained of the vessel the wind still blew violently on the coast 
 
 for a few moments the strange lady seemed to rest but she awoke 
 in pain and uttered cries of anguish and fear she opened her 
 wonderfully beautiful eyes and spoke a few words but nobody 
 understood her and lo as a reward for the sorrow and suffering 
 she had undergone she held in her arms a babe the child 
 that was to have rested upon a magnificent couch draped with silken 
 curtains in a luxurious home it was to have been welcomed with joy 
 to a life rich in all the good things of this world and now heaven 
 had ordained that it should be born in this humble retreat that it 
 should not even receive a kiss from its mother for when the 
 wife laid the child upon the bosom it rested 
 on a heart that beat no more she was dead 
 
 the child that was to have been reared amid wealth and luxury 
 was cast into the world washed by the sea among the to 
 share the fate and hardships of the poor 
 
 here we are reminded again of the song about the king of 
 son for in it mention is made of the custom prevalent at 
 the time when knights and squires plundered those who had been 
 saved from shipwreck the ship had stranded some distance south of 
 nissum bay and the cruel inhuman days when as we have just said 
 the inhabitants of jutland treated the shipwrecked people so crudely 
 were past long ago affectionate sympathy and for 
 the unfortunate existed then just as it does in our own time in 
 many a bright example the dying mother and the unfortunate child 
 would have found kindness and help wherever they had been cast by 
 the winds but nowhere would it have been more sincere than in the 
 cottage of the poor wife who had stood only the day 
 before beside her grave who would have been five years old 
 that day if god had spared it to her 
 
 no one knew who the dead stranger was they could not even form 
 a conjecture the fragments of wreckage gave no clue to the matter 
 no tidings reached spain of the fate of the daughter and 
 they did not arrive at their destination and violent 
 storms had raged during the past weeks at last the verdict was given 
 foundered at sea all lost but in the cottage among the 
 near hunsby there lived a little scion of the rich spanish 
 family 
 
 where heaven sends food for two a third can manage to find a 
 meal and in the depth of the sea there is many a dish of fish for the 
 hungry 
 
 they called the boy jurgen 
 
 it must certainly be a jewish child its skin is so dark the 
 people said 
 
 it might be an italian or a spaniard remarked the clergyman 
 but to the wife these nations seemed all the same and 
 she consoled herself with the thought that the child was baptized as a 
 christian 
 
 the boy throve the noble blood in his veins was warm and he 
 became strong on his homely fare he grew apace in the humble cottage and the danish dialect spoken by the west jutes became his language 
 
 the pomegranate seed from spain became a hardy plant on the coast of west jutland thus may circumstances alter the course of a life 
 
 to this home he clung with affection he was to experience cold and hunger and the misfortunes and hardships that surround the poor but he also tasted of their joys 
 
 childhood has bright days for every one and the memory of them 
 shines through the whole the boy had many sources of 
 pleasure and enjoyment the coast for miles and miles was full of 
 playthings for it was a mosaic of pebbles some red as coral or 
 yellow as amber and others again white and rounded like birds eggs 
 and smoothed and prepared by the sea even the bleached fishes 
 skeletons the water plants dried by the wind and seaweed white 
 and shining long bands waving between the stones all these 
 seemed made to give pleasure and occupation for the thoughts 
 and he had an intelligent mind many great talents lay dormant in him 
 how readily he remembered stories and songs that he heard and how 
 dexterous he was with his fingers with stones and he 
 could put together pictures and ships with which one could decorate 
 the room and he could make wonderful things from a stick his 
 said although he was still so young and little he 
 had a sweet voice and every melody seemed to flow naturally from 
 his lips and in his heart were hidden chords which might have 
 sounded far out into the world if he had been placed anywhere else 
 than in the hut by the north sea 
 
 one day another ship was wrecked on the coast and among other 
 things a chest filled with valuable flower bulbs was washed ashore 
 some were put into saucepans and cooked for they were thought to be fit to eat and others lay and shrivelled in the sand they did not 
 accomplish their purpose or unfold their magnificent colours would 
 jurgen fare better the flower bulbs had soon played their part but 
 he had years of apprenticeship before him neither he nor his 
 friends noticed in what a monotonous uniform way one day followed 
 another for there was always plenty to do and see the ocean itself 
 was a great and it unfolded a new leaf each day of calm 
 or storm the crested wave or the smooth surface 
 
 the visits to the church were festive occasions but among the 
 house one was especially looked forward to this was in 
 fact the visit of the brother of the 
 from fjaltring near bovbjerg he came twice a year in a 
 cart painted red with blue and white tulips upon it and full of 
 eels it was covered and locked like a box two dun oxen drew it 
 and jurgen was allowed to guide them 
 
 the was a witty fellow a merry guest and brought a 
 measure of brandy with him they all received a small glassful or a 
 cupful if there were not enough glasses even jurgen had about a 
 thimbleful that he might digest the fat eel as the said 
 he always told one story over and over again and if his hearers 
 laughed he would immediately repeat it to them jurgen while still a 
 boy and also when he was older used phrases from the 
 story on various occasions so it will be as well for us to listen 
 to it it runs thus 
 
 the eels went into the bay and the young ones begged leave to go 
 a little farther out go too far said their mother the ugly 
 might come and snap you all up but they went too far 
 and of eight daughters only three came back to the mother and these 
 wept and said we only went a little way out and the ugly 
 came immediately and stabbed five of our sisters to 
 death come back again said the mother eel oh no 
 exclaimed the daughters for he skinned them cut them in two and 
 fried them oh come back again the mother eel 
 persisted no replied the daughters for he ate them up 
 come back again repeated the mother eel but he drank brandy 
 after them said the daughters ah then never come back 
 said the mother and she burst out crying the brandy that 
 buries the eels 
 
 and therefore said the in conclusion it is always 
 the proper thing to drink brandy after eating eels 
 this story was the tinsel thread the most humorous recollection 
 of life he also wanted to go a little way farther out and up 
 the bay that is to say out into the world in a ship but his 
 mother said like the there are so many bad people 
 eel spearers he wished to go a little way past the out 
 into the dunes and at last he did four happy days the brightest 
 of his childhood fell to his lot and the whole beauty and 
 splendour of jutland all the happiness and sunshine of his home were concentrated in these he went to a festival but it was a burial 
 feast 
 
 a rich relation of the family had died the farm was 
 situated far eastward in the country and a little towards the north 
 foster parents went there and he also went with them from 
 the dunes over heath and moor where the skjaerumaa takes its 
 course through green meadows and contains many eels mother eels 
 live there with their daughters who are caught and eaten up by wicked 
 people but do not men sometimes act quite as cruelly towards their 
 own was not the knight sir bugge murdered by wicked 
 people and though he was well spoken of did he not also wish to kill the architect who built the castle for him with its thick walls and 
 tower at the point where the skjaerumaa falls into the bay jurgen 
 and his parents now stood there the wall and the ramparts still 
 remained and red crumbling fragments lay scattered around here it 
 was that sir bugge after the architect had left him said to one of 
 his men go after him and say master the tower shakes if he 
 turns round kill him and take away the money i paid him but if he 
 does not turn round let him go in peace the man did as he was 
 told the architect did not turn round but called back the tower 
 does not shake in the least but one day a man will come from the west in a blue cloak he will cause it to shake and so indeed it happened a hundred years later for the north sea broke in and cast down the tower but predbjorn gyldenstjerne the man who then possessed the castle built a new castle higher up at the end of the meadow and that one is standing to this day and is called 
 
 jurgen and his foster parents went past this castle they had told 
 him its story during the long winter evenings and now he saw the 
 stately edifice with its double moat and trees and bushes the wall 
 covered with ferns rose within the moat but the lofty 
 were the most beautiful of all they grew up to the highest windows 
 and the air was full of their sweet fragrance in a 
 corner of the garden stood a great bush full of blossom like winter 
 snow amid the green it was a juniper bush the first that 
 jurgen had ever seen in bloom he never forgot it nor the 
 the soul treasured up these memories of beauty and fragrance 
 to gladden the old man 
 
 from where the juniper blossomed the journey 
 became more pleasant for they met some other people who were also 
 going to the funeral and were riding in waggons our travellers had to 
 sit all together on a little box at the back of the waggon but even 
 this they thought was better than walking so they continued their 
 journey across the rugged heath the oxen which drew the waggon 
 stopped every now and then where a patch of fresh grass appeared amid the heather the sun shone with considerable heat and it was 
 wonderful to behold how in the far distance something like smoke 
 seemed to be rising yet this smoke was clearer than the air it was 
 transparent and looked like rays of light rolling and dancing afar 
 over the heath 
 
 that is lokeman driving his sheep said some one 
 and this was enough to excite imagination he felt as 
 if they were now about to enter fairyland though everything was still 
 real how quiet it was the heath stretched far and wide around them 
 like a beautiful carpet the heather was in blossom and the 
 and fresh oak saplings rose like bouquets from the 
 earth an inviting place for a frolic if it had not been for the 
 number of poisonous adders of which the travellers spoke they also 
 mentioned that the place had formerly been infested with wolves and 
 that the district was still called wolfsborg for this reason the 
 old man who was driving the oxen told them that in the lifetime of his 
 father the horses had many a hard battle with the wild beasts that 
 were now exterminated one morning when he himself had gone out to bring in the horses he found one of them standing with its forefeet 
 on a wolf it had killed but the savage animal had torn and 
 lacerated the brave legs 
 
 the journey over the heath and the deep sand was only too 
 quickly at an end they stopped before the house of mourning where 
 they found plenty of guests within and without waggon after waggon 
 stood side by side while the horses and oxen had been turned out to 
 graze on the scanty pasture great like those at home by 
 the north sea rose behind the house and extended far and wide how had they come here so many miles inland they were as large and high as those on the coast and the wind had carried them there there was also a legend attached to them 
 
 psalms were sung and a few of the old people shed tears with 
 this exception the guests were cheerful enough it seemed to 
 jurgen and there was plenty to eat and drink there were eels of 
 the fattest requiring brandy to bury them as the said 
 and certainly they did not forget to carry out his maxim here 
 jurgen went in and out the house and on the third day he felt 
 as much at home as he did in the cottage among the 
 where he had passed his early days here on the heath were riches unknown to him until now for flowers blackberries and 
 bilberries were to be found in profusion so large and sweet that when 
 they were crushed beneath the tread of the heather was 
 stained with their red juice here was a barrow and yonder another 
 then columns of smoke rose into the still air it was a heath fire 
 they told him how brightly it blazed in the dark evening 
 the fourth day came and the funeral festivities were at an end 
 they were to go back from the to the 
 ours are better said the old fisherman 
 these have no strength 
 
 and they spoke of the way in which the had come inland 
 and it seemed very easy to understand this is how they explained it 
 a dead body had been found on the coast and the peasants buried 
 it in the churchyard from that time the sand began to fly about and 
 the sea broke in with violence a wise man in the district advised 
 them to open the grave and see if the buried man was not lying sucking his thumb for if so he must be a sailor and the sea would not rest until it had got him back the grave was opened and he really was found with his thumb in his mouth so they laid him upon a cart and harnessed two oxen to it and the oxen ran off with the sailor over heath and moor to the ocean as if they had been stung by an adder 
 
 then the sand ceased to fly inland but the hills that had been 
 piled up still remained 
 
 all this jurgen listened to and treasured up in his memory of 
 the happiest days of his childhood the days of the burial feast 
 how delightful it was to see fresh places and to mix with 
 strangers and he was to go still farther for he was not yet fourteen 
 years old when he went out in a ship to see the world he 
 encountered bad weather heavy seas unkindness and hard men such were his experiences for he became cold nights bad living and blows had to be endured then he felt his noble spanish blood boil within him and bitter angry words rose to his lips but he gulped them down it was better although he felt as the eel must feel when it is skinned cut up and put into the 
 i shall get over it said a voice within him 
 
 he saw the spanish coast the native land of his parents he 
 even saw the town where they had lived in joy and prosperity but he 
 knew nothing of his home or his relations and his relations knew just 
 as little about him 
 
 the poor ship boy was not permitted to land but on the last day 
 of their stay he managed to get ashore there were several purchases 
 to be made and he was sent to carry them on board 
 
 jurgen stood there in his shabby clothes which looked as if they 
 had been washed in the ditch and dried in the chimney he who had 
 always dwelt among the now saw a great city for the 
 first time how lofty the houses seemed and what a number of people there were in the streets some pushing this way some that a perfect maelstrom of citizens and peasants monks and soldiers the jingling of bells on the trappings of asses and mules the chiming of church bells calling shouting hammering and knocking all going on at once every trade was located in the basement of the houses or in 
 the side thoroughfares and the sun shone with such heat and the 
 air was so close that one seemed to be in an oven full of beetles 
 cockchafers bees and flies all humming and buzzing together 
 jurgen scarcely knew where he was or which way he went then he saw just in front of him the great doorway of a cathedral the lights were gleaming in the dark aisles and the fragrance of incense was wafted towards him even the poorest beggar ventured up the steps into the sanctuary jurgen followed the sailor he was with into the church and stood in the sacred edifice coloured pictures gleamed from their golden background and on the altar stood the figure of the virgin with the child jesus surrounded by lights and flowers priests in festive robes were chanting and choir boys in dazzling attire swung 
 silver censers what splendour and magnificence he saw there it 
 streamed in upon his soul and overpowered him the church and the 
 faith of his parents surrounded him and touched a chord in his 
 heart that caused his eyes to overflow with tears 
 
 they went from the church to the here a quantity 
 of provisions were given him to carry the way to the harbour was 
 long and weary and overcome with various emotions he rested for a 
 few moments before a splendid house with marble pillars statues and broad steps here he rested his burden against the wall then a porter in livery came out lifted up a cane and drove him away him the grandson of that house but no one knew that and he just as little as any one then he went on board again and once more encountered rough words and blows much work and little was his experience of life they say it is good to suffer in 
 young days if age brings something to make up for it 
 
 his period of service on board the ship came to an end and the 
 vessel lay once more at ringkjobing in jutland he came ashore and 
 went home to the near hunsby but his had 
 died during his absence 
 
 a hard winter followed this summer swept over land 
 and sea and there was difficulty in getting from one place to 
 another how unequally things are distributed in this world here 
 there was bitter cold and while in spain there was 
 burning sunshine and oppressive heat yet when a clear frosty day 
 came and jurgen saw the swans flying in numbers from the sea 
 towards the land across to it seemed to him that 
 people could breathe more freely here the summer also in this part of 
 the world was splendid in imagination he saw the heath blossom and 
 become purple with rich juicy berries and the and 
 at norre vosborg in flower he made up his mind to go there again 
 
 spring came and the fishing began jurgen was now an active 
 helper in this for he had grown during the last year and was quick 
 at work he was full of life and knew how to swim to tread water 
 and to turn over and tumble in the strong tide they often warned 
 him to beware of the sharks which seize the best swimmer draw him 
 down and devour him but such was not to be fate 
 
 at a house in the dunes there was a boy named 
 martin with whom jurgen was on very friendly terms and they both 
 took service in the same ship to norway and also went together to 
 holland they never had a quarrel but a person can be easily 
 excited to quarrel when he is naturally hot tempered for he often 
 shows it in many ways and this is just what jurgen did one day when 
 they fell out about the merest trifle they were sitting behind the 
 cabin door eating from a delft plate which they had placed between 
 them jurgen held his in his hand and raised it towards 
 martin and at the same time became ashy pale and his eyes had an 
 ugly look martin only said ah ah you are one of that sort are 
 you fond of using the knife 
 
 the words were scarcely spoken when hand sank down he 
 did not answer a syllable but went on eating and afterwards returned 
 to his work when they were resting again he walked up to martin and 
 said 
 
 hit me in the face i deserve it but sometimes i feel as if i 
 had a pot in me that boils over 
 there let the thing rest replied martin 
 
 and after that they were almost better friends than ever when 
 afterwards they returned to the dunes and began telling their 
 adventures this was told among the rest martin said that jurgen 
 was certainly passionate but a good fellow after all 
 
 they were both young and healthy and strong but 
 jurgen was the cleverer of the two 
 
 in norway the peasants go into the mountains and take the cattle 
 there to find pasture on the west coast of jutland huts have been 
 erected among the they are built of pieces of wreck and 
 thatched with turf and heather there are sleeping places round the 
 walls and here the fishermen live and sleep during the early 
 spring every fisherman has a female helper or manager as she is 
 called who baits his hooks prepares warm beer for him when he 
 comes ashore and gets the dinner cooked and ready for him by the time he comes back to the hut tired and hungry besides this the managers bring up the fish from the boats cut them open prepare them and have generally a great deal to do 
 
 jurgen his father and several other fishermen and their managers 
 inhabited the same hut martin lived in the next one 
 one of the girls whose name was else had known jurgen from 
 childhood they were glad to see each other and were of the same 
 opinion on many points but in appearance they were entirely opposite for he was dark and she was pale and fair and had flaxen hair and eyes as blue as the sea in sunshine 
 
 as they were walking together one day jurgen held her hand very 
 firmly in his and she said to him 
 
 jurgen i have something i want to say to you let me be your 
 manager for you are like a brother to me but martin whose 
 housekeeper i am he is my lover but you need not tell this to the 
 others 
 
 it seemed to jurgen as if the loose sand was giving way under 
 his feet he did not speak a word but nodded his head and that meant yes it was all that was necessary but he suddenly felt in his 
 heart that he hated martin and the more he thought the more he felt 
 convinced that martin had stolen away from him the only being he 
 ever loved and that this was else he had never thought of else in 
 this way before but now it all became plain to him 
 
 when the sea is rather rough and the fishermen are coming home in 
 their great boats it is wonderful to see how they cross the reefs 
 one of them stands upright in the bow of the boat and the others 
 watch him sitting with the oars in their hands outside the reef it 
 looks as if the boat was not approaching land but going back to sea 
 then the man who is standing up gives them the signal that the great 
 wave is coming which is to float them across the reef the boat is 
 lifted high into the air so that the keel is seen from the shore the 
 next moment nothing can be seen mast keel and people are all 
 hidden it seems as though the sea had devoured them but in a few 
 moments they emerge like a great sea animal climbing up the waves and the oars move as if the creature had legs the second and third reef are passed in the same manner then the fishermen jump into the 
 water and push the boat towards the shore every wave helps them 
 and at length they have it drawn up beyond the reach of the breakers 
 
 a wrong order given in front of the reef the slightest hesitation and the boat would be lost then it would be all over with me and martin too this thought passed through mind one day while they 
 were out at sea where his had been taken suddenly 
 ill the fever had seized him they were only a few oars strokes from 
 the reef and jurgen sprang from his seat and stood up in the bow 
 me come he said and he glanced at martin and across 
 the waves every oar bent with the exertions of the rowers as the 
 great wave came towards them and he saw his pale face and 
 dared not obey the evil impulse that had shot through his brain the 
 boat came safely across the reef to land but the evil thought 
 remained in his heart and roused up every little fibre of 
 bitterness which he remembered between himself and martin since they had known each other but he could not weave the fibres together nor did he endeavour to do so he felt that martin had robbed him and this was enough to make him hate his former friend several of the fishermen saw this but martin did not he remained as obliging and talkative as ever in fact he talked rather too much 
 
 took to his bed and it became his for he died a week afterwards and now jurgen was heir to the little house behind the it was small certainly but still it was something and martin had nothing of the kind 
 
 you will not go to sea again jurgen i suppose observed one of 
 the old fishermen you will always stay with us now 
 but this was not intention he wanted to see something of 
 the world the of fjaltring had an uncle at old skjagen 
 who was a fisherman but also a prosperous merchant with ships upon the sea he was said to be a good old man and it would not be a bad thing to enter his service old skjagen lies in the extreme north of jutland as far away from the hunsby dunes as one can travel in that country and this is just what pleased jurgen for he did not want 
 to remain till the wedding of martin and else which would take 
 place in a week or two 
 
 the old fisherman said it was foolish to go away for now that 
 jurgen had a home else would very likely be inclined to take him 
 instead of martin 
 
 jurgen gave such a vague answer that it was not easy to make out 
 what he meant the old man brought else to him and she said 
 you have a home now you ought to think of that 
 
 and jurgen thought of many things 
 
 the sea has heavy waves but there are heavier waves in the 
 human heart many thoughts strong and weak rushed through brain and he said to else 
 
 if martin had a house like mine which of us would you rather 
 have 
 but martin has no house and cannot get one 
 suppose he had one 
 well then i would certainly take martin for that is what my 
 heart tells me but one cannot live upon love 
 
 jurgen turned these things over in his mind all night something 
 was working within him he hardly knew what it was but it was even 
 stronger than his love for else and so he went to and 
 what he said and did there was well considered he let the house to 
 martin on most liberal terms saying that he wished to go to sea 
 again because he loved it and else kissed him when she heard of 
 it for she loved martin best 
 
 jurgen proposed to start early in the morning and on the 
 evening before his departure when it was already getting rather late 
 he felt a wish to visit martin once more he started and among the 
 dunes met the old fisherman who was angry at his leaving the place 
 
 the old man made jokes about martin and declared there must be some magic about that fellow of whom the girls were so fond 
 jurgen did not pay any attention to his remarks but said 
 to the old man and went on towards the house where martin dwelt 
 he heard loud talking inside martin was not alone and this made 
 jurgen waver in his determination for he did not wish to see else 
 again on second thoughts he decided that it was better not to hear 
 any more thanks from martin and so he turned back 
 
 on the following morning before the sun rose he fastened his 
 knapsack on his back took his wooden provision box in his hand and went away among the towards the coast path this way was more pleasant than the heavy sand road and besides it was shorter and he intended to go first to fjaltring near bovbjerg where the lived to whom he had promised a visit 
 
 the sea lay before him clear and blue and the mussel shells 
 and pebbles the playthings of his childhood crunched over his 
 feet while he thus walked on his nose suddenly began to bleed it was a trifling occurrence but trifles sometimes are of great 
 importance a few large drops of blood fell upon one of his sleeves 
 
 he wiped them off and stopped the bleeding and it seemed to him as if this had cleared and lightened his brain the bloomed here 
 and there in the sand as he passed he broke off a spray and stuck 
 it in his hat he determined to be merry and for he was 
 going out into the wide world a little way out beyond the bay 
 as the young eels had said beware of bad people who will catch 
 you and skin you and put you in the he repeated in 
 his mind and smiled for he thought he should find his way through 
 the world good courage is a strong weapon 
 
 the sun was high in the heavens when he approached the narrow 
 entrance to nissum bay he looked back and saw a couple of horsemen galloping a long distance behind him and there were other people with them but this did not concern him 
 
 the was on the opposite side of the bay jurgen 
 called to the and the latter came over with his boat 
 jurgen stepped in but before he had got across the men whom he had seen riding so hastily came up hailed the and commanded him to return in the name of the law jurgen did not 
 understand the reason of this but he thought it would be best to turn 
 back and therefore he himself took an oar and returned as soon as 
 the boat touched the shore the men sprang on board and before he was aware of it they had bound his hands with a rope 
 
 this wicked deed will cost you your life they said it is a 
 good thing we have caught you 
 
 he was accused of nothing less than murder martin had been 
 found dead with his throat cut one of the fishermen late on the 
 previous evening had met jurgen going towards house this 
 was not the first time jurgen had raised his knife against martin 
 so they felt sure that he was the murderer the prison was in a town 
 at a great distance and the wind was contrary for going there by sea 
 but it would not take half an hour to get across the bay and 
 another quarter of an hour would bring them to the 
 great castle with ramparts and moat one of captors was a 
 fisherman a brother of the keeper of the castle and he said it might 
 be managed that jurgen should be placed for the present in the dungeon at vosborg where long martha the gipsy had been shut up till her execution they paid no attention to defence the few drops of blood on his bore heavy witness against him 
 
 but he was conscious of his innocence and as there was no chance of clearing himself at present he submitted to his fate 
 
 the party landed just at the place where sir castle had 
 stood and where jurgen had walked with his after the 
 burial feast during the four happiest days of his childhood he 
 was led by the path over the meadow to vosborg once 
 more the elders were in bloom and the lofty gave forth 
 sweet fragrance and it seemed as if it were but yesterday that he had 
 last seen the spot in each of the two wings of the castle there was a 
 staircase which led to a place below the entrance from whence there 
 is access to a low vaulted cellar in this dungeon long martha had 
 been imprisoned and from here she was led away to the scaffold she had eaten the hearts of five children and had imagined that if she 
 could obtain two more she would be able to fly and make herself 
 invisible in the middle of the roof of the cellar there was a 
 little narrow but no window the flowering lime trees 
 could not breathe refreshing fragrance into that abode where 
 everything was dark and mouldy there was only a rough bench in the cell but a good conscience is a soft pillow and therefore jurgen 
 could sleep well 
 
 the thick oaken door was locked and secured on the outside by 
 an iron bar but the goblin of superstition can creep through a 
 keyhole into a castle just as easily as it can into a 
 cottage and why should he not creep in here where jurgen sat thinking of long martha and her wicked deeds her last thoughts on the night before her execution had filled this place and the magic that tradition asserted to have been practised here in sir 
 time came into mind and made him shudder but a sunbeam a refreshing thought from without penetrated his heart 
 even here it was the remembrance of the flowering elder and the sweet smelling 
 
 he was not left there long they took him away to the town of 
 ringkjobing where he was imprisoned with equal severity 
 those times were not like ours the common people were treated 
 harshly and it was just after the days when farms were converted into 
 knights estates when coachmen and servants were often made 
 magistrates and had power to sentence a poor man for a small 
 offence to lose his property and to corporeal punishment judges of 
 this kind were still to be found and in jutland so far from the 
 capital and from the enlightened head of the 
 government the law was still very loosely administered sometimes the smallest grievance jurgen could expect was that his case should be delayed 
 
 his dwelling was cold and comfortless and how long would he be 
 obliged to bear all this it seemed his fate to suffer misfortune 
 and sorrow innocently he now had plenty of time to reflect on the 
 difference of fortune on earth and to wonder why this fate had been 
 allotted to him yet he felt sure that all would be made clear in 
 the next life the existence that awaits us when this life is over 
 his faith had grown strong in the poor cottage the 
 light which had never shone into his mind in all the 
 richness and sunshine of spain was sent to him to be his comfort in 
 poverty and distress a sign of that mercy of god which never fails 
 the spring storms began to blow the rolling and moaning of the 
 north sea could be heard for miles inland when the wind was blowing and then it sounded like the rushing of a thousand waggons over a hard road with a mine underneath jurgen heard these sounds in his prison and it was a relief to him no music could have touched his heart as did these sounds of the sea the rolling sea the boundless 
 sea on which a man can be borne across the world before the wind 
 carrying his own house with him wherever he goes just as the snail 
 carries its home even into a strange country 
 
 he listened eagerly to its deep murmur and then the thought arose 
 free free how happy to be free even barefooted and in ragged 
 clothes sometimes when such thoughts crossed his mind the fiery 
 nature rose within him and he beat the wall with his clenched fists 
 weeks months a whole year had gone by when niels the thief 
 called also a was arrested and now better times came 
 and it was seen that jurgen had been wrongly accused 
 
 on the afternoon before departure from home and before 
 the murder niels the thief had met martin at a in the 
 neighbourhood of ringkjobing a few glasses were drank not enough to cloud the brain but enough to loosen tongue he began to boast and to say that he had obtained a house and intended to marry and when niels asked him where he was going to get the money he slapped his pocket proudly and said 
 
 the money is here where it ought to be 
 this boast cost him his life for when he went home niels followed 
 him and cut his throat intending to rob the murdered man of the 
 gold which did not exist 
 all this was circumstantially explained but it is enough for us 
 to know that jurgen was set free but what compensation did he get for having been imprisoned a whole year and shut out from all 
 communication with his fellow creatures they told him he was 
 fortunate in being proved innocent and that he might go the 
 burgomaster gave him two dollars for travelling expenses and many 
 citizens offered him provisions and beer there were still good 
 people they were not all hard and pitiless but the best thing of all 
 was that the merchant bronne of skjagen into whose service jurgen 
 had proposed entering the year before was just at that time on 
 business in the town of ringkjobing bronne heard the whole story 
 he was and understood what jurgen must have felt and 
 suffered therefore he made up his mind to make it up to the poor lad and convince him that there were still kind folks in the world 
 so jurgen went forth from prison as if to paradise to find 
 freedom affection and trust he was to travel this path now for 
 no goblet of life is all bitterness no good man would pour out such a 
 draught for his and how should he do it who is love 
 personified 
 
 let everything be buried and forgotten said bronne the 
 merchant let us draw a thick line through last year we will even 
 burn the almanack in two days we will start for dear friendly 
 peaceful skjagen people call it an corner but it is a 
 good warm and its windows open toward every part of the world 
 
 what a journey that was it was like taking fresh breath out of 
 the cold dungeon air into the warm sunshine the heather bloomed in 
 pride and beauty and the sat on a barrow and blew his 
 pipe which he had carved for himself out of a sheep bone fata 
 morgana the beautiful aerial phenomenon of the wilderness appeared 
 with hanging gardens and waving forests and the wonderful cloud 
 called lokeman driving his sheep also was seen 
 
 up towards skjagen they went through the land of the wendels 
 whence the men with long beards the longobardi or lombards had 
 emigrated in the reign of king snio when all the children and old 
 people were to have been killed till the noble dame gambaruk proposed that the young people should emigrate jurgen knew all this he had some little knowledge and although he did not know the land of the lombards beyond the lofty alps he had an idea that it must be 
 there for in his boyhood he had been in the south in spain he 
 thought of the plenteousness of the southern fruit of the red 
 pomegranate flowers of the humming buzzing and toiling in the great beehive of a city he had seen but home is the best place after all and home was denmark 
 
 at last they arrived at vendilskaga as skjagen is called in old 
 norwegian and icelandic writings at that time old skjagen with the 
 eastern and western town extended for miles with sand hills and 
 arable land as far as the lighthouse near grenen then as now 
 the houses were strewn among the a 
 wilderness in which the wind sports with the sand and where the voice of the and wild swan strikes harshly on the ear 
 
 
 in the a mile from grenen lies old skjagen 
 merchant bronne dwelt here and this was also to be home 
 for the future the was tarred and all the small 
 had been put together from pieces of wreck there was no fence for indeed there was nothing to fence in except the long rows of fishes which were hung upon lines one above the other to dry in the wind the entire coast was strewn with spoiled herrings for there were so many of these fish that a net was scarcely thrown into the sea before it was filled they were caught by carloads and many of them were either thrown back into the sea or left to lie on the beach 
 
 the old wife and daughter and his servants also came to meet 
 him with great rejoicing there was a great squeezing of hands and 
 talking and questioning and the daughter what a sweet face and 
 bright eyes she had 
 
 the inside of the house was comfortable and roomy fritters 
 that a king would have looked upon as a dainty dish were placed on 
 the table and there was wine from the skjagen vineyard that is 
 the sea for there the grapes come ashore ready pressed and prepared 
 in barrels and in bottles 
 
 when the mother and daughter heard who jurgen was and how 
 innocently he had suffered they looked at him in a still more 
 friendly way and pretty eyes had a look of especial 
 interest as she listened to his story jurgen found a happy home in 
 old skjagen it did his heart good for it had been sorely tried he 
 had drunk the bitter goblet of love which softens or hardens the 
 heart according to circumstances heart was still soft it 
 was young and therefore it was a good thing that miss clara was going in three weeks time to christiansand in norway in her ship to visit an aunt and to stay there the whole winter 
 on the sunday before she went away they all went to church to the 
 
 holy communion the church was large and handsome and had been built centuries before by scotchmen and dutchmen it stood some little way out of the town it was rather ruinous certainly and the road to it was heavy through deep sand but the people gladly surmounted these difficulties to get to the house of god to sing psalms and to hear the sermon the sand had heaped itself up round the walls of the church but the graves were kept free from it 
 it was the largest church north of the limfjorden the virgin 
 mary with a golden crown on her head and the child jesus in her arms stood lifelike on the altar the holy apostles had been carved in 
 the choir and on the walls there were portraits of the old 
 burgomasters and councillors of skjagen the pulpit was of carved 
 work the sun shone brightly into the church and its radiance fell on 
 the polished brass chandelier and on the little ship that hung from 
 the vaulted roof 
 
 jurgen felt overcome by a holy childlike feeling like that which 
 possessed him when as a boy he stood in the splendid spanish 
 cathedral but here the feeling was different for he felt conscious 
 of being one of the congregation 
 
 after the sermon followed holy communion he partook of the 
 bread and wine and it so happened that he knelt by the side of miss 
 clara but his thoughts were so fixed upon heaven and the holy 
 sacrament that he did not notice his neighbour until he rose from 
 his knees and then he saw tears rolling down her cheeks 
 
 she left skjagen and went to norway two days later he remained 
 behind and made himself useful on the farm and at the fishery he 
 went out fishing and in those days fish were more plentiful and 
 larger than they are now the shoals of the mackerel glittered in 
 the dark nights and indicated where they were swimming the 
 gurnards snarled and the crabs gave forth pitiful yells when they 
 were chased for fish are not so mute as people say 
 
 every sunday jurgen went to church and when his eyes rested on 
 the picture of the virgin mary over the altar as he sat there they 
 often glided away to the spot where they had knelt side by side 
 autumn came and brought rain and snow with it the water rose 
 up right into the town of skjagen the sand could not suck it all 
 in one had to wade through it or go by boat the storms threw 
 vessel after vessel on the fatal reefs there were and 
 the sand flew up to the houses blocking the entrances 
 so that people had to creep up through the chimneys that was 
 nothing at all remarkable here it was pleasant and cheerful 
 indoors where peat fuel and fragments of wood from the wrecks 
 blazed and crackled upon the hearth merchant bronne read aloud 
 from an old chronicle about prince hamlet of denmark who had come over from england landed near bovbjerg and fought a battle close by ramme was his grave only a few miles from the place where the lived hundreds of barrow rose there from the heath forming as it were an enormous churchyard merchant bronne had himself been at grave they spoke about old times and about their neighbours the english and the scotch and jurgen sang the air of the king of son and of his splendid ship and its outfit 
 in the hour of peril when most men fear 
 he clasped the bride that he held so dear 
 and proved himself the son of a king 
 of his courage and valour let us sing 
 this verse jurgen sang with so much feeling that his eyes 
 beamed and they were black and sparkling since his infancy 
 there was wealth comfort and happiness even among the domestic 
 animals for they were all well cared for and well kept the 
 kitchen looked bright with its copper and tin utensils and white 
 plates and from the rafters hung hams beef and winter stores in 
 plenty this can still be seen in many rich farms on the west coast of 
 jutland plenty to eat and drink clean prettily decorated rooms 
 active minds cheerful tempers and hospitality can be found there as 
 in an tent 
 
 jurgen had never spent such a happy time since the famous burial 
 feast and yet miss clara was absent except in the thoughts and 
 memory of all 
 
 in april a ship was to start for norway and jurgen was to sail in 
 it he was full of life and spirits and looked so sturdy and well 
 that dame bronne said it did her good to see him 
 
 and it does one good to look at you also old wife said the 
 merchant jurgen has brought fresh life into our winter evenings and 
 into you too mother you look younger than ever this year and seem 
 well and cheerful but then you were once the prettiest girl in 
 viborg and that is saying a great deal for i have always found the 
 viborg girls the prettiest of any 
 
 jurgen said nothing but he thought of a certain maiden of 
 skjagen whom he was soon to visit the ship set sail for 
 christiansand in norway and as the wind was favourable it soon 
 arrived there 
 
 one morning merchant bronne went out to the lighthouse which 
 stands a little way out of old skjagen not far from grenen the 
 light was out and the sun was already high in the heavens when he 
 mounted the tower the extend a whole mile from the 
 shore beneath the water outside these banks many ships could be 
 seen that day and with the aid of his telescope the old man thought 
 he descried his own ship the karen bronne yes certainly there 
 she was sailing homewards with clara and jurgen on board 
 
 clara sat on deck and saw the gradually appearing in 
 the distance the church and lighthouse looked like a heron and a swan rising from the blue waters if the wind held good they might reach home in about an hour so near they were to home and all its near to death and all its terrors a plank in the ship gave way 
 and the water rushed in the crew flew to the pumps and did their 
 best to stop the leak a signal of distress was hoisted but they were 
 still fully a mile from the shore some fishing boats were in sight 
 but they were too far off to be of any use the wind blew towards 
 the land the tide was in their favour but it was all useless the 
 ship could not be saved 
 
 jurgen threw his right arm round clara and pressed her to him 
 with what a look she gazed up into his face as with a prayer to god 
 for help he breasted the waves which rushed over the sinking ship 
 she uttered a cry but she felt safe and certain that he would not 
 leave her to sink and in this hour of terror and danger jurgen felt 
 as the son did as told in the old song 
 in the hour of peril when most men fear 
 he clasped the bride that he held so dear 
 how glad he felt that he was a good swimmer he worked his way 
 onward with his feet and one arm while he held the young girl up 
 firmly with the other he rested on the waves he trod the water in 
 fact did everything he could think of in order not to fatigue 
 himself and to reserve strength enough to reach land he heard 
 clara sigh and felt her shudder convulsively and he pressed her more closely to him now and then a wave rolled over them the current lifted them the water although deep was so clear that for a 
 moment he imagined he saw the shoals of mackerel glittering or 
 leviathan himself ready to swallow them now the clouds cast a 
 shadow over the water then again came the playing sunbeams flocks of loudly screaming birds passed over him and the plump and lazy wild ducks which allow themselves to be drifted by the waves rose up 
 terrified at the sight of the swimmer he began to feel his strength 
 decreasing but he was only a few cable lengths distance from the 
 shore and help was coming for a boat was approaching him at this 
 moment he distinctly saw a white staring figure under the water a 
 wave lifted him up and he came nearer to the figure he felt a 
 violent shock and everything became dark around him 
 
 on the sand reef lay the wreck of a ship which was covered with 
 water at high tide the white figure head rested against the anchor 
 the sharp iron edge of which rose just above the surface jurgen had 
 come in contact with this the tide had driven him against it with 
 great force he sank down stunned with the blow but the next wave 
 lifted him and the young girl up again some fishermen coming with 
 a boat seized them and dragged them into it the blood streamed 
 down over face he seemed dead but still held the young girl 
 so tightly that they were obliged to take her from him by force she 
 was pale and lifeless they laid her in the boat and rowed as quickly 
 as possible to the shore they tried every means to restore clara to 
 life but it was all of no avail jurgen had been swimming for some 
 distance with a corpse in his arms and had exhausted his strength for 
 one who was dead 
 
 jurgen still breathed so the fishermen carried him to the nearest 
 house upon the where a smith and general dealer lived 
 who knew something of surgery and bound up wounds in a 
 temporary way until a surgeon could be obtained from the nearest 
 town the next day the injured brain was affected and in his 
 delirium he uttered wild cries but on the third day he lay quiet 
 and weak upon his bed his life seemed to hang by a thread and the 
 physician said it would be better for him if this thread broke let 
 us pray that god may take him he said for he will never be the 
 same man again 
 
 but life did not depart from him the thread would not break 
 but the thread of memory was severed the thread of his mind had 
 been cut through and what was still more grievous a body remained a living healthy body that wandered about like a troubled spirit 
 
 jurgen remained in merchant house he was hurt while 
 endeavouring to save our child said the old man and now he is 
 our son people called jurgen insane but that was not exactly the 
 correct term he was like an instrument in which the strings are loose 
 and will give no sound only occasionally they regained their power 
 for a few minutes and then they sounded as they used to do he 
 would sing snatches of songs or old melodies pictures of the past 
 would rise before him and then disappear in the mist as it were but 
 as a general rule he sat staring into vacancy without a thought we 
 may conjecture that he did not suffer but his dark eyes lost their 
 brightness and looked like clouded glass 
 
 poor mad jurgen said the people and this was the end of a life 
 whose infancy was to have been surrounded with wealth and splendour had his parents lived all his great mental abilities had been lost nothing but hardship sorrow and disappointment had been his fate 
 he was like a rare plant torn from its native soil and tossed upon 
 the beach to wither there and was this one of creatures 
 fashioned in his own likeness to have no better fate was he to be 
 only the plaything of fortune no the creator would 
 certainly repay him in the life to come for what he had suffered and 
 lost here the lord is good to all and his mercy is over all his 
 works the pious old wife of the merchant repeated these words from the psalms of david in patience and hope and the prayer of her 
 heart was that jurgen might soon be called away to enter into 
 eternal life 
 
 in the churchyard where the walls were surrounded with sand 
 clara lay buried jurgen did not seem to know this it did not enter 
 his mind which could only retain fragments of the past every 
 sunday he went to church with the old people and sat there 
 silently staring vacantly before him one day when the psalms were 
 being sung he sighed deeply and his eyes became bright they were 
 fixed upon a place near the altar where he had knelt with his friend 
 who was dead he murmured her name and became deadly pale and 
 tears rolled down his cheeks they led him out of church he told 
 those standing round him that he was well and had never been ill he 
 who had been so grievously afflicted the outcast thrown upon the 
 world could not remember his sufferings the lord our creator is wise and full of loving kindness who can doubt it 
 
 in spain where balmy breezes blow over the moorish cupolas and 
 gently stir the orange and myrtle groves where singing and the 
 sound of the castanets are always heard the richest merchant in the 
 place a childless old man sat in a luxurious house while children 
 marched in procession through the streets with waving flags and 
 lighted tapers if he had been able to press his children to his 
 heart his daughter or her child that had perhaps never seen the 
 light of day far less the kingdom of heaven how much of his wealth 
 would he not have given poor child yes poor child a child still 
 yet more than thirty years old for jurgen had arrived at this age 
 in old skjagen 
 
 the shifting sands had covered the graves in the courtyard 
 quite up to the church walls but still the dead must be buried among 
 their relatives and the dear ones who had gone before them merchant 
 bronne and his wife now rested with their children under the white 
 sand 
 
 it was in the spring the season of storms the sand from the 
 dunes was whirled up in clouds the sea was rough and flocks of birds flew like clouds in the storm screaming across the 
 shipwreck followed upon shipwreck on the reefs between old skagen and the hunsby dunes 
 
 one evening jurgen sat in his room alone all at once his mind 
 seemed to become clearer and a restless feeling came over him such 
 as had often in his younger days driven him out to wander over the 
 or on the heath home home he cried no one heard 
 him he went out and walked towards the dunes sand and stones blew into his face and whirled round him he went in the direction of 
 the church the sand was banked up the walls half covering the 
 windows but it had been cleared away in front of the door and the 
 entrance was free and easy to open so jurgen went into the church 
 
 the storm raged over the town of skjagen there had not been 
 such a terrible tempest within the memory of the inhabitants nor such 
 a rough sea but jurgen was in the temple of god and while the 
 darkness of night reigned outside a light arose in his soul that 
 was never to depart from it the heavy weight that pressed on his 
 brain burst asunder he fancied he heard the organ but it was only 
 the storm and the moaning of the sea he sat down on one of the seats and lo the candies were lighted one by one and there was 
 brightness and grandeur such as he had only seen in the spanish 
 cathedral the portraits of the old citizens became alive stepped 
 down from the walls against which they had hung for centuries and 
 took seats near the church door the gates flew open and all the dead people from the churchyard came in and filled the church while 
 beautiful music sounded then the melody of the psalm burst forth 
 like the sound of the waters and jurgen saw that his foster parents 
 from the hunsby dunes were there also old merchant bronne with his 
 wife and their daughter clara who gave him her hand they both went up to the altar where they had knelt before and the priest joined 
 their hands and united them for life then music was heard again it 
 was wonderfully sweet like a voice full of joy and 
 expectation swelling to the powerful tones of a full organ sometimes 
 soft and sweet then like the sounds of a tempest delightful and 
 elevating to hear yet strong enough to burst the stone tombs of the 
 dead then the little ship that hung from the roof of the choir was 
 let down and looked wonderfully large and beautiful with its silken 
 sails and rigging 
 the ropes were of silk the anchor of gold 
 and everywhere riches and pomp the old song says 
 
 the young couple went on board accompanied by the whole 
 congregation for there was room and enjoyment for them all then 
 the walls and arches of the church were covered with flowering 
 junipers and lime trees breathing forth fragrance the branches waved 
 creating a pleasant coolness they bent and parted and the ship 
 sailed between them through the air and over the sea every candle 
 in the church became a star and the wind sang a hymn in which they 
 all joined through love to glory no life is lost the future is 
 full of blessings and happiness hallelujah these were the last 
 words jurgen uttered in this world for the thread that bound his 
 immortal soul was severed and nothing but the dead body lay in the 
 dark church while the storm raged outside covering it with loose 
 sand 
 
 the next day was sunday and the congregation and their pastor 
 went to the church the road had always been heavy but now it was 
 almost unfit for use and when they at last arrived at the church a 
 great heap of sand lay piled up in front of them the whole church was completely buried in sand the clergyman offered a short prayer and said that god had closed the door of his house here and that the 
 congregation must go and build a new one for him somewhere else so they sung a hymn in the open air and went home again 
 
 jurgen could not be found anywhere in the town of skjagen nor 
 on the dunes though they searched for him everywhere they came to the conclusion that one of the great waves which had rolled far up 
 on the beach had carried him away but his body lay buried in a 
 great sepulchre the church itself the lord had thrown down a 
 covering for his grave during the storm and the heavy mound of sand 
 lies upon it to this day the drifting sand had covered the vaulted 
 roof of the church the arched cloisters and the stone aisles the 
 white thorn and the dog rose now blossom above the place where the 
 church lies buried but the spire like an enormous monument over a 
 grave can be seen for miles round no king has a more splendid 
 memorial nothing disturbs the peaceful sleep of the dead i was the 
 first to hear this story for the storm sung it to me among the

 statesman 
 
 by plato 
 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue theodorus socrates the eleatic 
 stranger the younger socrates 
 socrates i owe you many thanks indeed theodorus for the 
 acquaintance both of theaetetus and of the stranger 
 
 theodorus and in a little while socrates you will owe me three 
 times as many when they have completed for you the 
 delineation of the statesman and of the philosopher as well as of the sophist 
 
 soc sophist statesman philosopher o my dear theodorus do my 
 ears truly witness that this is the estimate formed of them by the 
 great calculator and geometrician 
 
 theod what do you mean socrates 
 
 soc i mean that you rate them all at the same value whereas they 
 are really separated by an interval which no geometrical ratio can 
 express 
 
 theod by ammon the god of cyrene socrates that is a very fair 
 hit and shows that you have not forgotten your geometry i will 
 retaliate on you at some other time but i must now ask the 
 stranger who will not i hope tire of his goodness to us 
 to proceed either with the statesman or with the philosopher whichever he prefers 
 
 stranger that is my duty theodorus having begun i must 
 go on and not leave the work unfinished but what shall be done with 
 theaetetus 
 theod in what respect 
 
 str shall we relieve him and take his companion the young 
 socrates instead of him what do you advise 
 
 theod yes give the other a turn as you propose the young 
 always do better when they have intervals of rest 
 
 soc i think stranger that both of them may be said to be in 
 some way related to me for the one as you affirm has the cut of 
 my ugly face the other is called by my name and we should always 
 be on the to recognize a kinsman by the style of his 
 conversation i myself was discoursing with theaetetus yesterday 
 and i have just been listening to his answers my namesake i have 
 not yet examined but i must another time will do for me 
 let him answer you 
 
 str very good young socrates do you hear what the elder 
 socrates is proposing 
 
 young socrates i do 
 
 str and do you agree to his proposal 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str as you do not object still less can i after the sophist 
 then i think that the statesman naturally follows next in the order 
 of enquiry and please to say whether he too should be 
 ranked among those who have science 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str then the sciences must be divided as before 
 
 y soc i dare say 
 
 str but yet the division will not be the same 
 
 y soc how then 
 
 str they will be divided at some other point 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str where shall we discover the path of the statesman we 
 must find and separate off and set our seal upon this and we will 
 set the mark of another class upon all diverging paths thus the soul 
 will conceive of ail kinds of knowledge under two classes 
 
 y soc to find the path is your business stranger and not mine 
 
 str yes socrates but the discovery when once made 
 must be yours as well as mine 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str well and are not arithmetic and certain other kindred arts 
 merely abstract knowledge wholly separated from action 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but in the art of carpentering and all other handicrafts the 
 knowledge of the workman is merged in his work he not only 
 knows but he also makes things which previously did not exist 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str then let us divide sciences in general into those which are 
 practical and those which intellectual 
 
 y soc let us assume these two divisions of science which is one 
 whole 
 
 str and are statesman king master or householder one 
 and the same or is there a science or art answering to each of 
 these names or rather allow me to put the matter in another way 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str if any one who is in a private station has the skill to 
 advise one of the public physicians must not he also be called a 
 physician 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and if any one who is in a private station is able to advise 
 the ruler of a country may not he be said to have the 
 knowledge which the ruler himself ought to have 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but surely the science of a true king is royal science 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and will not he who possesses this knowledge whether he 
 happens to be a ruler or a private man when regarded only in 
 reference to his art be truly called royal 
 
 y soc he certainly ought to be 
 
 str and the householder and master are the same 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str again a large household may be compared to a small 
 they differ at all as far as government is concerned 
 
 y soc they will not 
 
 str then returning to the point which we were just now 
 discussing do we not clearly see that there is one science of all of them and this science may be called either royal or political or 
 economical we will not quarrel with any one about the name 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str this too is evident that the king cannot do much with his 
 hands or with his whole body towards the maintenance of his 
 empire compared with what he does by the intelligence and 
 strength of his mind 
 
 y soc clearly not 
 
 str then shall we say that the king has a greater affinity to 
 knowledge than to manual arts and to practical life in general 
 
 y soc certainly he has 
 
 str then we may put all together as one and the 
 and the kingly science and the king 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str and now we shall only be proceeding in due order if 
 we go on to divide the sphere of knowledge 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str think whether you can find any joint or parting in knowledge 
 
 y soc tell me of what sort 
 
 str such as this you may remember that we made an art of 
 calculation 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str which was unmistakably one of the arts of knowledge 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and to this art of calculation which discerns the differences 
 of numbers shall we assign any other function except to pass 
 judgment on their differences 
 
 y soc how could we 
 
 str you know that the does not work himself but 
 is the ruler of workmen 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str he contributes knowledge not manual labour 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and may therefore be justly said to share in theoretical 
 science 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str but he ought not like the calculator to regard his 
 functions as at and when he has formed a must assign to the individual workmen their appropriate task until they have 
 completed the work 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str are not all such sciences no less than arithmetic and the 
 like subjects of pure knowledge and is not the difference between 
 the two classes that the one sort has the power of judging only 
 and the other of ruling as well 
 
 y soc that is evident 
 
 str may we not very properly say that of all knowledge there 
 are there are two which rules and the other which 
 judges 
 
 y soc i should think so 
 
 str and when men have anything to do in common that they 
 should be of one mind is surely a desirable thing 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then while we are at unity among ourselves we need not mind 
 about the fancies of others 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str and now in which of these divisions shall we place the 
 he a judge and a kind of spectator or shall we 
 assign to him the art of he is a ruler 
 
 y soc the latter clearly 
 str then we must see whether there is any mark of division in the 
 art of command too i am inclined to think that there is a 
 distinction similar to that of manufacturer and retail dealer which 
 parts off the king from the herald 
 
 y soc how is this 
 
 str why does not the retailer receive and sell over again the 
 productions of others which have been sold before 
 
 y soc certainly he does 
 
 str and is not the herald under command and does he not receive 
 orders and in his turn give them to others 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then shall we mingle the kingly art in the same class with 
 the art of the herald the interpreter the boatswain the prophet 
 and the numerous kindred arts which exercise command or as in the 
 preceding comparison we spoke of manufacturers or sellers for 
 themselves and of too that the class of supreme 
 rulers or rulers for themselves is almost we make a 
 word following the same analogy and refer kings to a supreme or 
 science leaving the rest to receive a name from 
 some one else for we are seeking the ruler and our enquiry is not 
 concerned with him who is not a ruler 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str thus a very fair distinction has been attained between the 
 man who gives his own commands and him who gives and now let us see if the supreme power allows of any further division 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str i think that it does and please to assist me in making the 
 division 
 
 y soc at what point 
 
 str may not all rulers be supposed to command for the sake of 
 producing something 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str nor is there any difficulty in dividing the things produced 
 into two classes 
 
 y soc how would you divide them 
 
 str of the whole class some have life and some are without life 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and by the help of this distinction we may make if we 
 please a subdivision of the section of knowledge which commands 
 
 y soc at what point 
 
 str one part may be set over the production of lifeless the 
 other of living objects and in this way the whole will be divided 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str that division then is complete and now we may leave one 
 half and take up the other which may also be divided into two 
 
 y soc which of the two halves do you men 
 
 str of course that which exercises command about animals for 
 surely the royal science is not like that of a a 
 science presiding over lifeless king has a nobler 
 function which is the management and control of living beings 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the breeding and tending of living beings may be observed 
 to be sometimes a tending of the individual in other cases a 
 common care of creatures in flocks 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but the statesman is not a tender of like the 
 driver or groom of a single ox or horse he is rather to be compared 
 with the keeper of a drove of horses or oxen 
 
 y soc yes i see thanks to you 
 
 str shall we call this art of tending many animals together the 
 art of managing a herd or the art of collective management 
 
 y soc no suggests itself to us in the course 
 of conversation 
 
 str very good socrates and if you continue to be not too 
 particular about names you will be all the richer in wisdom when 
 you are an old man and now as you say leaving the 
 discussion of the name can you see a way in which a person by showing the art of herding to be of two kinds may cause that which is now sought amongst twice the number of things to be then sought amongst half that number 
 
 y soc i will appears to me to be one management of 
 men and another of beasts 
 
 str you have certainly divided them in a most straightforward and 
 manly style but you have fallen into an error which hereafter i think 
 that we had better avoid 
 
 y soc what is the error 
 
 str i think that we had better not cut off a single small portion 
 which is not a species from many larger portions the part should 
 be a species to separate off at once the subject of investigation is 
 a most excellent plan if only the separation be rightly 
 made and you were under the impression that you were right because you saw that you would come to man and this led you to hasten the steps but you should not chip off too small a piece my friend the safer way is to cut through the middle which is also the more likely way of finding classes attention to this principle makes all the difference in a process of enquiry 
 
 y soc what do you mean stranger 
 
 str i will endeavour to speak more plainly out of love to 
 your good parts socrates and although i cannot at present entirely explain myself i will try as we proceed to make my meaning a little 
 clearer 
 
 y soc what was the error of which as you say we were guilty in 
 our recent division 
 
 str the error was just as if some one who wanted to divide the 
 human race were to divide them after the fashion which prevails in 
 this part of the world here they cut off the hellenes as 
 one species and all the other species of mankind which are innumerable and have no ties or common language they include under the single name of barbarians and because they have one name they are supposed to be of one species also or suppose that in dividing numbers you were to cut off ten thousand from all the rest and make of it one species comprehending the first under another separate name you might say that here too was a single class because you had given it a single name whereas you would make a much better and more equal and logical classification of numbers if you divided them into odd and even or of the human species if you divided them into male and female and only separated off lydians or phrygians or any other tribe and arrayed them against the rest of the world when you could no longer make a division into parts which were also classes 
 
 y soc very true but i wish that this distinction between a part 
 and a class could still be made somewhat plainer 
 
 str o socrates best of men you are imposing upon me a very 
 difficult task we have already digressed further from our original 
 intention than we ought and you would have us wander still further 
 away but we must now return to our subject and hereafter 
 when there is a leisure hour we will follow up the other track at the 
 same time i wish you to guard against imagining that you ever heard me declare 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str that a class and a part are distinct 
 
 y soc what did i hear then 
 
 str that a class is necessarily a part but there is no similar 
 necessity that a part should be a dass that is the view which i 
 should always wish you to attribute to me socrates 
 
 y soc so be it 
 
 str there is another thing which i should like to know 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str the point at which we digressed for if i am not 
 mistaken the exact place was at the question where you would divide the management of herds to this you appeared rather too ready to answer that them were two species of animals man being one and all brutes making up the other 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str i thought that in taking away a part you imagined that the 
 remainder formed a class because you were able to call them by the 
 common name of brutes 
 
 y soc that again is true 
 
 str suppose now o most courageous of dialecticians that 
 some wise and understanding creature such as a crane is reputed to 
 be were in imitation of you to make a similar division and set up cranes against all other animals to their own special glorification at the same time jumbling together all the others including man under the appellation of would be the sort of error which we must try to avoid 
 
 y soc how can we be safe 
 
 str if we do not divide the whole class of animals we shall be 
 less likely to fall into that error 
 
 y soc we had better not take the whole 
 
 str yes there lay the source of error in our former division 
 
 y soc how 
 
 str you remember how that part of the art of knowledge which was 
 concerned with command had to do with the rearing of living 
 mean with animals in herds 
 y soc yes 
 
 str in that case there was already implied a division of all 
 animals into tame and wild those whose nature can be tamed 
 are called tame and those which cannot be tamed are called wild 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the political science of which we are in search is and 
 ever was concerned with tame animals and is also confined to 
 gregarious animals 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but then ought not to divide as we did taking the 
 whole class at once neither let us be in too great haste to arrive 
 quickly at the political science for this mistake has already brought upon us the misfortune of which the proverb speaks 
 
 y soc what misfortune 
 
 str the misfortune of too much haste which is too little speed 
 
 y soc and all the better got what we deserved 
 
 str very well let us then begin again and endeavour to 
 divide the collective rearing of animals for probably the completion of the argument will best show what you are so anxious to know tell me then 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str have you ever heard as you very likely i do not 
 suppose that you ever actually visited the preserves 
 of fishes in the nile and in the ponds of the great king or you may have seen similar preserves in wells at home 
 
 y soc yes to be sure i have seen them and i have often heard 
 the others described 
 
 str and you may have heard also and may have by 
 report although you have not travelled in those regions of 
 nurseries of geese and cranes in the plains of thessaly 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str i asked you because here is a new division of the management 
 of herds into the management of land and of water herds 
 
 y soc there is 
 
 str and do you agree that we ought to divide the collective rearing 
 of herds into two corresponding parts the one the rearing of water 
 and the other the rearing of land herds 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str there is surely no need to ask which of these two contains 
 the royal art for it is evident to everybody 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str any one can divide the herds which feed on dry land 
 
 y soc how would you divide them 
 
 str i should distinguish between those which fly and those which 
 walk 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str and where shall we look for the political animal might not 
 an idiot so to speak know that he is a pedestrian 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str the art of managing the walking animal has to be further 
 divided just as you might have an even number 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str let me note that here appear in view two ways to that part or 
 class which the argument aims at one is speedier way 
 which cuts off a small portion and leaves a large the other agrees 
 better with the principle which we were laying down that as 
 far as we can we should divide in the middle but it is longer we can take either of them whichever we please 
 
 y soc cannot we have both ways 
 
 str together what a thing to ask but if you take them in turn 
 you clearly may 
 
 y soc then i should like to have them in turn 
 
 str there will be no difficulty as we are near the end if we 
 had been at the beginning or in the middle i should have 
 demurred to your request but now in accordance with your desire let us begin with the longer way while we are fresh we shall get on better and now attend to the division 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str the tame walking herding animals are distributed by 
 nature into two classes 
 
 y soc upon what principle 
 
 str the one grows horns and the other is without horns 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str suppose that you divide the science which manages pedestrian 
 animals into two corresponding parts and define them for if you 
 try to invent names for them you will find the intricacy too great 
 
 y soc how must i speak of them then 
 
 str in this way let the science of managing pedestrian animals 
 be divided into two parts and one part assigned to the 
 horned herd and the other to the herd that has no horns 
 
 y soc all that you say has been abundantly proved and may 
 therefore be assumed 
 
 str the king is clearly the shepherd a polled herd who have no 
 horns 
 
 y soc that is evident 
 
 str shall we break up this hornless herd into sections and 
 endeavour to assign to him what is his 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str shall we distinguish them by their having or not having 
 cloven feet or by their mixing or not mixing the breed you 
 know what i mean 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str i mean that horses and asses naturally breed from one another 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but the remainder of the hornless herd of tame 
 animals will not mix the breed 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and of which has the statesman the mixed or of the 
 unmixed race 
 
 y soc clearly of the unmixed 
 
 str i suppose that we must divide this again as before 
 
 y soc we must 
 
 str every tame and herding animal has now been split up with the 
 exception of two species for i hardly think that dogs should be 
 reckoned among gregarious animals 
 
 y soc certainly not but how shall we divide the two remaining 
 species 
 
 str there is a measure of difference which may be appropriately 
 employed by you and theaetetus who are students of geometry 
 
 y soc what is that 
 
 str the diameter and again the diameter of a diameter 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str how does man walk but as a diameter whose power is two feet 
 
 y soc just so 
 
 str and the power of the remaining kind being the power of twice 
 two feet may be said to be the diameter of our diameter 
 
 y soc certainly and now i think that i pretty nearly understand 
 you 
 
 str in these divisions socrates i descry what would make 
 another famous jest 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str human beings have come out in the same class with the freest 
 and airiest of creation and have been running a race with them 
 
 y soc i remark that very singular coincidence 
 
 str and would you not expect the slowest to arrive last 
 
 y soc indeed i should 
 
 str and there is a still more ridiculous consequence 
 that the king is found running about with the herd and in close 
 competition with the who of all mankind is most of an adept at the airy life 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str then here socrates is still clearer evidence of the truth 
 of what was said in the enquiry about the sophist 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str that the dialectical method is no respecter of persons and 
 does not set the great above the small but always arrives in her 
 own way at the truest result 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str and now i will not wait for you to ask the but will 
 of my own accord take you by the shorter road to the definition of a king 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str i say that we should have begun at first by dividing land 
 animals into biped and quadruped and since the winged herd and 
 that alone comes out in the same class with man should 
 divide bipeds into those which have feathers and those which have not and when they have been divided and the art of the management of mankind is brought to light the time will have come to produce our statesman and ruler and set him like a charioteer in his place and hand over to him the reins of state for that too is a vocation which belongs to him 
 
 y soc very good you have paid me the mean that you have 
 completed the argument and i suppose that you added the 
 digression by way of interest 
 
 str then now let us go back to the beginning and join the 
 links which together make the definition of the name of the 
 art 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str the science of pure knowledge had as we said originally a 
 part which was the science of rule or command and from this was 
 derived another part which was called on the 
 analogy of an important section of this was the 
 management of living animals and this again was further limited to 
 the manage merit of them in herds and again in herds of pedestrian 
 animals the chief division of the latter was the art of managing 
 pedestrian animals which are without horns this again has a part 
 which can only be comprehended under one term by joining together 
 three animals the only further 
 subdivision is the art of man has to do with bipeds 
 and is what we were seeking after and have now found being at once 
 the royal and political 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str and do you think socrates that we really have done as you 
 say 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str do you think i mean that we have really fulfilled our 
 has been a sort of discussion and yet the 
 investigation seems to me not to be perfectly worked out this is 
 where the enquiry fails 
 
 y soc i do not understand 
 
 str i will try to make the thought which is at this 
 moment present in my mind clearer to us both 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str there were many arts of shepherding and one of them was the 
 political which had the charge of one particular herd 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and this the argument defined to be the art of rearing not 
 horses or other brutes but the art of rearing man collectively 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str note however a difference which distinguishes the king from 
 all other shepherds 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str i want to ask whether any one of the other herdsmen has a 
 rival who professes and claims to share with him in the management 
 of the herd 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that merchants husbandmen providers of 
 food and also and physicians will all contend with the herdsmen of humanity whom we call statesmen declaring that they themselves have the care of rearing of managing mankind and 
 that they rear not only the common herd but also the rulers themselves 
 
 y soc are they not right in saying so 
 
 str very likely they may be and we will consider their claim 
 but we are certain of no one will raise a similar claim 
 as against the herdsman who is allowed on all hands to be the sole 
 and only feeder and physician of his herd he is also their 
 matchmaker and accoucheur no one else knows that department of science and he is their and musician as far as their nature is susceptible of such influences and no one can console and soothe his own herd better than he can either with the natural tones of 
 his voice or with instruments and the same may be said of tenders 
 of animals in general 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str but if this is as you say can our argument about the king be 
 true and unimpeachable were we right in selecting him out of ten 
 thousand other claimants to be the shepherd and rearer of the human 
 flock 
 
 y soc surely not 
 
 str had we not reason just to now apprehend that although we may 
 have described a sort of royal form we have not as yet accurately 
 worked out the true image of the statesman and that we cannot 
 reveal him as he truly is in his own nature until we have 
 disengaged and separated him from those who bang about him and claim to share in his prerogatives 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and that socrates is what we must do if we do not mean to 
 bring disgrace upon the argument at its close 
 
 y soc we must certainly avoid that 
 
 str then let us make a new beginning and travel by a different 
 road 
 
 y soc what road 
 
 str i think that we may have a little amusement there is a 
 famous tale of which a good portion may with advantage be 
 interwoven and then we may resume our series of divisions and proceed in the old path until we arrive at the desired summit shall we do as i say 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str listen then to a tale which a child would love to hear and 
 you are not too old for childish amusement 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str there did really happen and will again happen like 
 many other events of which ancient tradition has preserved the record the portent which is traditionally said to have occurred in the 
 quarrel of atreus and thyestes you have heard no doubt and remember what they say happened at that time 
 
 y soc i suppose you to mean the token of the birth of the golden 
 lamb 
 
 str no not that but another part of the story which tells how 
 the sun and the stars once rose in the west and set in the east 
 and that the god reversed their motion and gave them that which 
 they now have as a testimony to the right of atreus 
 
 y soc yes there is that legend also 
 
 str again we have been often told of the reign of cronos 
 
 y soc yes very often 
 
 str did you ever hear that the men of former times were 
 earthborn and not begotten of one another 
 
 y soc yes that is another old tradition 
 
 str all these stories and ten thousand others which are 
 still more wonderful have a common origin many of them have been lost in the lapse of ages or are repeated only in a disconnected form but the origin of them is what no one has told and may as well be told now for the tale is suited to throw light on the nature of the king 
 
 y soc very good and i hope that you will give the whole story 
 and leave out nothing 
 
 str listen then there is a time when god himself guides 
 and helps to roll the world in its course and there is a time on the 
 completion of a certain cycle when he lets go and the world being 
 a living creature and having originally received intelligence from 
 its author and creator turns about and by an inherent necessity 
 revolves in the opposite direction 
 
 y soc why is that 
 
 str why because only the most divine things of all remain ever 
 unchanged and the same and body is not included in this 
 class heaven and the universe as we have termed them although they have been endowed by the creator with many glories partake of a bodily nature and therefore cannot be entirely free from perturbation but their motion is as far as possible single and in the same place and of the same kind and is therefore only subject to a reversal which is the least alteration possible for the lord of all moving things is alone able to move of himself and to think that he moves them at one time in one direction and at another time in another is blasphemy 
 hence we must not say that the world is either always or 
 all made to go round by god in two opposite courses or that 
 two gods 
 having opposite purposes make it move round but as i have already 
 said and this is the only remaining alternative the world is 
 guided at one time by an external power which is divine and receives 
 fresh life and immortality from the renewing hand of the creator 
 and again when let go moves spontaneously being set free at such 
 a time as to have during infinite cycles of years a reverse 
 movement this is due to its perfect balance to its vast 
 size and to the fact that it turns on the smallest pivot 
 
 y soc your account of the world seems to be very reasonable 
 indeed 
 
 str let us now reflect and try to gather from what has been said 
 the nature of the phenomenon which we affirmed to be the cause of 
 all these wonders it is this 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str the reversal which takes place from time to time of the 
 motion of the universe 
 
 y soc how is that the cause 
 
 str of all changes of the heavenly motions we may 
 consider this to be the greatest and most complete 
 
 y soc i should imagine so 
 
 str and it may be supposed to result in the greatest 
 changes to the human beings who are the inhabitants of the world at the time 
 
 y soc such changes would naturally occur 
 
 str and animals as we know survive with difficulty great and 
 serious changes of many different kinds when they come upon them at once 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str hence there necessarily occurs a great destruction of them 
 which extends also life of man few survivors of the race are 
 left and those who remain become the subjects of several novel and 
 remarkable phenomena and of one in particular which takes place at 
 the time when the transition is made to the cycle opposite to that 
 in which we are now living 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str the life of all animals first came to a standstill and the 
 mortal nature ceased to be or look older and was then reversed and 
 grew young and delicate the white locks of the aged darkened again 
 and the cheeks the bearded man became smooth and recovered their 
 former bloom the bodies of youths in their prime grew softer and 
 smaller continually by day and night returning and becoming 
 assimilated to the nature of a child in mind as well as 
 body in the succeeding stage they wasted away and wholly 
 disappeared 
 and the bodies of those who died by violence at that time quickly 
 passed through the like changes and in a few days were no more seen 
 
 y soc then how stranger were the animals created in those 
 days and in what way were they begotten of one another 
 
 str it is evident socrates that there was no such thing in the 
 then order of nature as the procreation of animals from one another 
 the race of which we hear in story was the one which 
 existed in those rose again from the ground and of this 
 tradition which is often unduly discredited our 
 ancestors who were nearest in point of time to the end of the last 
 period and came into being at the beginning of this are to us the 
 heralds and mark how consistent the sequel of the tale is after 
 the return of age to youth follows the return of the dead who are 
 lying in the earth to life simultaneously with the reversal of the 
 world the wheel of their generation has been turned back 
 and they are put together and rise and live in the opposite order unless god has carried any of them away to some other lot according to this tradition they of necessity sprang from the earth and have the name of and so the above legend clings to them 
 
 y soc certainly that is quite consistent with what has preceded 
 but tell me was the life which you said existed in the reign of 
 cronos in that cycle of the world or in this for the change in the 
 course of the stars and the sun must have occurred in both 
 
 str i see that you enter into my that blessed and 
 spontaneous life does not belong to the present cycle of the world 
 but to the previous one in which god superintended the whole 
 revolution of the universe and the several parts the universe were 
 distributed under the rule certain inferior deities as is the way in some places still there were demigods who were the shepherds of the various species and herds of animals and each one was in 
 all respects sufficient for those of whom he was the shepherd neither was there any violence or devouring of one another or war or quarrel among them and i might tell of ten thousand other blessings 
 which belonged to that dispensation the reason why the life of man was as tradition says spontaneous is as follows in those days god himself was their shepherd and ruled over them just as man over them who is by comparison a divine being still rules over the lower animals under him there were no forms of government or separate possession of women and children for all men rose again from the earth having no memory of the past and although they had nothing of this sort the earth gave them fruits in abundance which grew on trees and shrubs unbidden and were not planted by the hand of man and they dwelt naked and mostly in the open air for the temperature of their seasons was mild and they had no beds but lay on soft couches of grass which grew plentifully out of the earth such was the life of man in the days of cronos socrates the character of our present life which is said to be under zeus you know from your own 
 experience can you and will you determine which of them you deem the happier 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str then shall i determine for you as well as i can 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str suppose that the nurslings of cronos having this boundless 
 leisure and the power of holding intercourse not only with men 
 but with the brute creation had used all these advantages 
 with a view to philosophy conversing with the brutes as well as with 
 one another and learning of every nature which was gifted with any special power and was able to contribute some special experience to 
 the store of wisdom there would be no difficulty in deciding that they would be a thousand times happier than the men of our own day or 
 again if they had merely eaten and drunk until they were full and 
 told stories to one another and to the stories as are now attributed to this case also as i should imagine the answer would be easy but until some satisfactory witness can be found of the love of that age for knowledge and discussion we had better let the matter drop and give the reason why we have unearthed this tale 
 and then we shall be able to get on in the fulness of time when the change was to take place and the race had all perished and every soul had completed its proper cycle of births and been sown in the earth her appointed number of times the pilot of the universe let the helm go and retired to his place of view and then fate and innate desire reversed the motion of the world then also all the inferior deities who share the rule of the supreme power being informed of what was happening let go the parts of the world which were under their control and the world turning round with a sudden shock being impelled in an opposite direction from beginning to end was shaken by a mighty earthquake which wrought a new destruction of all manner of animals 
 afterwards when sufficient time had elapsed the tumult and confusion and earthquake ceased and the universal creature once more at peace attained to a calm and settle down into his own orderly and accustomed course having the charge and rule of himself and of all the creatures which are contained in him and executing as far as 
 he remembered them the instructions of his father and creator more 
 precisely at first but afterwords with less exactness the reason 
 of the falling off was the admixture of matter in him this was 
 inherent in the primal nature which was full of disorder until 
 attaining to the present order from god the constructor the world 
 received all that is good in him but from a previous state came 
 elements of evil and unrighteousness which thence derived first 
 of all passed into the world and were then transmitted to the 
 animals while the world was aided by the pilot in nurturing the 
 animals the evil was small and great the good which he 
 produced but after the separation when the world was let go at first all proceeded well enough but as time went there was more and more forgetting and the old discord again held sway and burst forth in full glory and at last small was the good and great was the 
 admixture of evil and there was a danger of universal ruin to the 
 world and the things contained in him wherefore god the orderer 
 of all in his tender care seeing that the world was in great 
 straits and fearing that all might be dissolved in the storm and 
 disappear in infinite chaos again seated himself at the helm and 
 bringing back the elements which had fallen into dissolution and 
 disorder to the motion which had prevailed under his dispensation 
 he set them in order and restored them and made the world 
 imperishable and immortal 
 and this is the whole tale of which the first part will suffice 
 to illustrate the nature of the king for when the world turned 
 towards the present cycle of generation the age of man again stood 
 still and a change opposite to the previous one was the result the 
 small creatures which had almost disappeared grew in and stature 
 and the children of the earth became grey and 
 died and sank into the earth again all things changed imitating and following the condition of the universe and of necessity agreeing with that in their mode of conception and generation and nurture for 
 no animal was any longer allowed to come into being in the earth through the agency of other creative beings but as the world was ordained to be the lord of his own progress in like manner the parts were ordained to grow and generate and give nourishment as far as they could of themselves impelled by a similar movement and so we have arrived at the real end of this discourse for although there might be much to tell of the lower animals and of the condition out of which they changed and of the causes of the change about men there is not much and that little is more to the purpose deprived of the care of god who had possessed and tended them they were left 
 helpless and defenceless and were torn in pieces by the beasts who were naturally fierce and had now grown wild and in the first ages they were still without skill or resource the food which once grew 
 spontaneously had failed and as yet they knew not how to procure 
 it because never felt the pressure of necessity for all 
 these reasons they were in a great strait wherefore also the gifts 
 spoken of in the old tradition were imparted to man by the gods 
 together with so much teaching and education as was indispensable 
 fire was given to them by prometheus the arts by hephaestus and his 
 athene seeds and plants by others from these is 
 derived all that has helped to frame human life since the 
 care of the gods as i was saying had now failed men and they had to order their course of life for themselves and were their own masters just like the universal creature whom they imitate and follow ever changing as he changes and ever living and growing at one time in one manner and at another time in another enough of the story which may be of use in showing us how greatly we erred in the delineation of the king and the statesman in our previous discourse 
 
 y soc what was this great error of which you speak 
 
 str there were two the first a lesser one the other was an 
 error on a much larger and grander scale 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that when we were asked about a king and 
 statesman of the present and generation we told of a shepherd of a 
 human flock who belonged to the other cycle and of one who was a 
 god when he ought to have been a man and this a great error again 
 we declared him to be the ruler of the entire state without 
 explaining how this was not the whole truth nor very intelligible 
 but still it was true and therefore the second error was not so 
 great as the first 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str before we can expect to have a perfect description of the 
 statesman we must define the nature of his office 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and the myth was introduced in order to show not 
 only that all others are rivals of true shepherd who is the object of our search but in order that we might have a clearer view of him who is alone worthy to receive this appellation because he alone of 
 shepherds and herdsmen according to the image which we have employed has the care of human beings 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and i cannot help thinking socrates that the form of the 
 divine shepherd is even higher than that of a king whereas the 
 statesmen who are now on earth seem to be much more like their 
 subjects in character and which more nearly to partake of their 
 breeding and education 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str still they must be investigated all the same to see whether 
 like the divine shepherd they are above their subjects or on a 
 level with them 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str to you remember that we spoke of a 
 exercised over animals not singly but 
 collectively which we called the art of rearing a herd 
 
 y soc yes i remember 
 
 str there somewhere lay our error for we never included or 
 mentioned the statesman and we did not observe that he had no place in our nomenclature 
 
 y soc how was that 
 
 str all other herdsmen rear their herds but this is not a 
 suitable term to apply to the statesman we should use a 
 name which is common to them all 
 
 y soc true if there be such a name 
 
 str why is not care of herds applicable to all for 
 this implies no feeding or any special duty if we say either tending 
 the herds or managing the herds or having the care of them the same word will include all and then we may wrap up the statesman with the rest as the argument seems to require 
 
 y soc quite right but how shall we take step in the 
 division 
 
 str as before we divided the art of rearing herds accordingly 
 as they were land or water herds winged and wingless mixing or not 
 mixing the breed horned and hornless so we may divide by these 
 same differences the teading of herds comprehending in our 
 definition the kingship of and the rule of cronos 
 
 y soc that is clear but i still ask what is to follow 
 
 str if the word had been managing herds instead of feeding or 
 rearing them no one would have argued that there was no care of men in the case of the politician although it was justly contended 
 that there was no human art of feeding them which was worthy of the 
 name or at least if there were many a man had a prior and greater 
 right to share in such an art than any king 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but no other art or science will have a prior or better right 
 than the royal science to care for human society and to rule over 
 men in general 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str in the next place socrates we must surely notice 
 that a great error was committed at the end of our analysis 
 
 y soc what was it 
 
 str why supposing we were ever so sure that there is such an art 
 as the art of rearing or feeding bipeds there was no reason why we 
 should call this the royal or political art as though there were no 
 more to be said 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str our first duty as we were saying was to remodel the name 
 so as to have the notion of care rather than of feeding and then to 
 divide for there may be still considerable divisions 
 
 y soc how can they be made 
 
 str first by separating the divine shepherd from the human 
 guardian or manager 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the art of management which is assigned to man would 
 again have to be subdivided 
 
 y soc on what principle 
 
 str on the principle of voluntary and compulsory 
 
 y soc why 
 
 str because if i am not mistaken there has been an error here 
 for our simplicity led us to rank king and tyrant together whereas 
 they are utterly distinct like their modes of government 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str then now as i said let us make the correction and divide 
 human care into two parts on the principle of voluntary and 
 compulsory 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and if we call the management of violent rulers tyranny and 
 the voluntary management of herds of voluntary bipeds 
 politics may we not further assert that he who has this latter art of management is the true king and statesman 
 
 y soc i think stranger that we have now completed the 
 account of the statesman 
 
 str would that we had socrates but i have to satisfy myself as 
 well as you and in my judgment the figure of the king is not yet 
 perfected like statuaries who in their too great haste having 
 overdone the several parts of their work lose time in cutting them 
 down so too we partly out of haste partly out of haste partly 
 out of a magnanimous desire to expose our former error and also 
 because we imagined that a king required grand illustrations have 
 taken up a marvellous lump of fable and have been obliged 
 to use more than was necessary this made us discourse at large and nevertheless the story never came to an end and our 
 discussion might be compared to a picture of some living being which had been fairly drawn in outline but had not yet attained the life and clearness which is given by the blending of colours now to intelligent persons a living being had better be delineated by language and discourse than by any painting or work of art to the duller sort by works of art 
 
 y soc very true but what is the imperfection which 
 still remains i wish that you would tell me 
 
 str the higher ideas my dear friend can hardly be set forth 
 except through the medium of examples every man seems to know all things in a dreamy sort of way and then again to wake up and to 
 know nothing 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i fear that i have been unfortunate in raising a question about 
 our experience of knowledge 
 
 y soc why so 
 
 str why because my example requires the assistance of another 
 example 
 
 y soc proceed you need not fear that i shall tire 
 
 str i will proceed finding as i do such a ready 
 listener in you when children are beginning to know their letters 
 
 y soc what are you going to say 
 
 str that they distinguish the several letters well enough in very 
 short and easy syllables and are able to tell them correctly 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str whereas in other syllables they do not recognize them and 
 think and speak falsely of them 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str will not the best and easiest way of bringing them to a 
 knowledge of what they do not as yet know be 
 
 y soc be what 
 
 str to refer them first of all to cases in which they judge 
 correctly about the letters in question and then to compare these 
 with the cases in which they do not as yet know and to show 
 them that the letters are the same and have the same character in both 
 combination until all cases in which they are right have been 
 placed side by side with all cases in which they are wrong in this 
 way they have examples and are made to learn that each letter in 
 every combination is always the same and not another and is always 
 called by the same name 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str are not examples formed in this manner we take a thing and 
 compare it with another distinct instance of the same thing of 
 which we have a right conception and out of the comparison there 
 arises one true notion which includes both of them 
 
 y soc exactly 
 
 str can we wonder then that the soul has the same uncertainty 
 about the alphabet of things and sometimes and in some cases is 
 firmly fixed by the truth in each particular and then again in 
 other cases is altogether at sea having somehow or other a 
 correction of combinations but when the elements are transferred into the long and difficult language syllables of facts is again ignorant of them 
 
 y soc there is nothing wonderful in that 
 
 str could any one my friend who began with false opinion ever 
 expect to arrive even at a small portion of truth and to attain 
 wisdom 
 
 y soc hardly 
 
 str then you and i will not be far wrong in trying to see the 
 nature of example in general in a small and particular instance 
 afterwards from lesser things we intend to pass to the royal class 
 which is the highest form of the same nature and endeavour to 
 discover by rules of art what the management of cities is and then 
 the dream will become a reality to us 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then once more let us resume the previous argument and as 
 there were innumerable rivals of the royal race who claim to have 
 the care of states let us part them all off and leave him alone 
 and as i was saying a model or example of this process has first 
 to be framed 
 
 y soc exactly 
 
 str what model is there which is small and yet has any analogy 
 with the political occupation suppose socrates that if we have no 
 other example at hand we choose weaving or more precisely 
 weaving of will be quite enough without taking 
 the whole of weaving to illustrate our meaning 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str why should we not apply to weaving the same processes of 
 division and subdivision which we have already applied to other 
 classes going once more as rapidly as we can through all the steps 
 until we come to that which is needed for our purpose 
 
 y soc how do you mean 
 
 str i shall reply by actually performing the process 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str all things which we make or acquire are either creative or 
 preventive of the preventive class are antidotes divine and human 
 and also defences and defences are either military weapons or 
 protections and protections are veils and also shields against 
 heat and cold and shields against heat and cold are shelters and 
 coverings and coverings are blankets and garments and garments are 
 some of them in one piece and others of them are made in several 
 parts and of these latter some are stitched others are fastened 
 and not stitched and of the not stitched some are made of 
 the sinews of plants and some of hair and of these again some are cemented with water and earth and others are fastened together by 
 themselves and these last defences and coverings which are fastened 
 together by themselves are called clothes and the art which 
 superintends them we may call from the nature of the operation the 
 art of clothing just as before the art of the statesman was derived 
 from the state and may we not say that the art of weaving at least 
 that largest portion of it which was concerned with the making of 
 clothes differs only in name from this art of clothing in the same 
 way that in the previous case the royal science differed from the 
 political 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str in the next place let us make the reflection that the art 
 of weaving clothes which an incompetent person might fancy to have 
 been sufficiently described has been separated off from several 
 others which are of the same family but not from the 
 arts 
 
 y soc and which are the kindred arts 
 
 str i see that i have not taken you with me so i think 
 that we had better go backwards starting from the end we just now parted off from the weaving of clothes the making of blankets which 
 differ from each other in that one is put under and the other is put around and these are what i termed kindred arts 
 
 y soc i understand 
 
 str and we have subtracted the manufacture of all articles made 
 of flax and cords and all that we just now metaphorically termed 
 the sinews of plants and we have also separated off the process of 
 felting and the putting together of materials by stitching 
 and sewing of which the most important part is the art 
 
 y soc precisely 
 str then we separated off the art which prepared 
 coverings in entire pieces and the art of sheltering and 
 subtracted the various arts of making which are employed 
 in building and in general in carpentering and in other crafts 
 and all such arts as furnish impediments to thieving and acts of 
 violence and are concerned with making the lids of boxes and the 
 fixing of doors being divisions of the art of joining and we also 
 cut off the manufacture of arms which is a section of the great and 
 manifold art of making defences and we originally began by parting 
 off the whole of the magic art which is concerned with antidoter 
 and have left as would appear the very art of which we were in 
 search the art of protection against winter cold which fabricates 
 woollen defences and has the name of weaving 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str yes my boy but that is not all for the first process to 
 which the material is subjected is the opposite of weaving 
 
 y soc how so 
 
 str weaving is a sort of uniting 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but the first process is a separation of the clotted 
 and matted fibres 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i mean the work of the art for we cannot say that 
 carding is weaving or that the carder is a weaver 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str again if a person were to say that the art of making the 
 warp and the woof was the art of weaving he would say what was 
 paradoxical and false 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str shall we say that the whole art of the fuller or of the 
 mender has nothing to do with the care and treatment clotes 
 or are we to regard all these as arts of weaving 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str and yet surely all these arts will maintain that they are 
 concerned with the treatment and production of clothes they will 
 dispute the exclusive prerogative of weaving and though assigning a 
 larger sphere to that will still reserve a considerable field for 
 themselves 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str besides these there are the arts which make tools and 
 instruments of weaving and which will claim at least to be 
 cooperative causes in every work of the weaver 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str well then suppose that we define weaving or rather 
 that part of it which has been selected by us to be the greatest and 
 noblest of arts which are concerned with woollen we be right is not the definition although true wanting in clearness and 
 completeness for do not all those other arts require to be first 
 cleared away 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str then the next thing will be to separate them in 
 order that the argument may proceed in a regular manner 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str let us consider in the first place that there are two kinds 
 of arts entering into everything which we do 
 
 y soc what are they 
 
 str the one kind is the conditional or cooperative the other the 
 principal cause 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str the arts which do not manufacture the actual thing but which 
 furnish the necessary tools for the manufacture without which the 
 several arts could not fulfil their appointed work are 
 but those which make the things themselves are causal 
 
 y soc a very reasonable distinction 
 
 str thus the arts which make spindles combs and other 
 instruments of the production of clothes may be called and those which treat and fabricate the things themselves causal 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str the arts of washing and mending and the other 
 preparatory arts which belong to the causal class and form a division of the great art of adornment may be all comprehended under what we call the art 
 
 y soc very good

 statesman 
 
 by plato 
 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue theodorus socrates the eleatic 
 stranger the younger socrates 
 socrates i owe you many thanks indeed theodorus for the 
 acquaintance both of theaetetus and of the stranger 
 
 theodorus and in a little while socrates you will owe me three 
 times as many when they have completed for you the 
 delineation of the statesman and of the philosopher as well as of the sophist 
 
 soc sophist statesman philosopher o my dear theodorus do my 
 ears truly witness that this is the estimate formed of them by the 
 great calculator and geometrician 
 
 theod what do you mean socrates 
 
 soc i mean that you rate them all at the same value whereas they 
 are really separated by an interval which no geometrical ratio can 
 express 
 
 theod by ammon the god of cyrene socrates that is a very fair 
 hit and shows that you have not forgotten your geometry i will 
 retaliate on you at some other time but i must now ask the 
 stranger who will not i hope tire of his goodness to us 
 to proceed either with the statesman or with the philosopher whichever he prefers 
 
 stranger that is my duty theodorus having begun i must 
 go on and not leave the work unfinished but what shall be done with 
 theaetetus 
 theod in what respect 
 
 str shall we relieve him and take his companion the young 
 socrates instead of him what do you advise 
 
 theod yes give the other a turn as you propose the young 
 always do better when they have intervals of rest 
 
 soc i think stranger that both of them may be said to be in 
 some way related to me for the one as you affirm has the cut of 
 my ugly face the other is called by my name and we should always 
 be on the to recognize a kinsman by the style of his 
 conversation i myself was discoursing with theaetetus yesterday 
 and i have just been listening to his answers my namesake i have 
 not yet examined but i must another time will do for me 
 let him answer you 
 
 str very good young socrates do you hear what the elder 
 socrates is proposing 
 
 young socrates i do 
 
 str and do you agree to his proposal 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str as you do not object still less can i after the sophist 
 then i think that the statesman naturally follows next in the order 
 of enquiry and please to say whether he too should be 
 ranked among those who have science 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str then the sciences must be divided as before 
 
 y soc i dare say 
 
 str but yet the division will not be the same 
 
 y soc how then 
 
 str they will be divided at some other point 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str where shall we discover the path of the statesman we 
 must find and separate off and set our seal upon this and we will 
 set the mark of another class upon all diverging paths thus the soul 
 will conceive of ail kinds of knowledge under two classes 
 
 y soc to find the path is your business stranger and not mine 
 
 str yes socrates but the discovery when once made 
 must be yours as well as mine 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str well and are not arithmetic and certain other kindred arts 
 merely abstract knowledge wholly separated from action 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but in the art of carpentering and all other handicrafts the 
 knowledge of the workman is merged in his work he not only 
 knows but he also makes things which previously did not exist 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str then let us divide sciences in general into those which are 
 practical and those which intellectual 
 
 y soc let us assume these two divisions of science which is one 
 whole 
 
 str and are statesman king master or householder one 
 and the same or is there a science or art answering to each of 
 these names or rather allow me to put the matter in another way 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str if any one who is in a private station has the skill to 
 advise one of the public physicians must not he also be called a 
 physician 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and if any one who is in a private station is able to advise 
 the ruler of a country may not he be said to have the 
 knowledge which the ruler himself ought to have 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but surely the science of a true king is royal science 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and will not he who possesses this knowledge whether he 
 happens to be a ruler or a private man when regarded only in 
 reference to his art be truly called royal 
 
 y soc he certainly ought to be 
 
 str and the householder and master are the same 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str again a large household may be compared to a small 
 they differ at all as far as government is concerned 
 
 y soc they will not 
 
 str then returning to the point which we were just now 
 discussing do we not clearly see that there is one science of all of them and this science may be called either royal or political or 
 economical we will not quarrel with any one about the name 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str this too is evident that the king cannot do much with his 
 hands or with his whole body towards the maintenance of his 
 empire compared with what he does by the intelligence and 
 strength of his mind 
 
 y soc clearly not 
 
 str then shall we say that the king has a greater affinity to 
 knowledge than to manual arts and to practical life in general 
 
 y soc certainly he has 
 
 str then we may put all together as one and the 
 and the kingly science and the king 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str and now we shall only be proceeding in due order if 
 we go on to divide the sphere of knowledge 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str think whether you can find any joint or parting in knowledge 
 
 y soc tell me of what sort 
 
 str such as this you may remember that we made an art of 
 calculation 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str which was unmistakably one of the arts of knowledge 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and to this art of calculation which discerns the differences 
 of numbers shall we assign any other function except to pass 
 judgment on their differences 
 
 y soc how could we 
 
 str you know that the does not work himself but 
 is the ruler of workmen 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str he contributes knowledge not manual labour 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and may therefore be justly said to share in theoretical 
 science 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str but he ought not like the calculator to regard his 
 functions as at and when he has formed a must assign to the individual workmen their appropriate task until they have 
 completed the work 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str are not all such sciences no less than arithmetic and the 
 like subjects of pure knowledge and is not the difference between 
 the two classes that the one sort has the power of judging only 
 and the other of ruling as well 
 
 y soc that is evident 
 
 str may we not very properly say that of all knowledge there 
 are there are two which rules and the other which 
 judges 
 
 y soc i should think so 
 
 str and when men have anything to do in common that they 
 should be of one mind is surely a desirable thing 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then while we are at unity among ourselves we need not mind 
 about the fancies of others 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str and now in which of these divisions shall we place the 
 he a judge and a kind of spectator or shall we 
 assign to him the art of he is a ruler 
 
 y soc the latter clearly 
 str then we must see whether there is any mark of division in the 
 art of command too i am inclined to think that there is a 
 distinction similar to that of manufacturer and retail dealer which 
 parts off the king from the herald 
 
 y soc how is this 
 
 str why does not the retailer receive and sell over again the 
 productions of others which have been sold before 
 
 y soc certainly he does 
 
 str and is not the herald under command and does he not receive 
 orders and in his turn give them to others 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then shall we mingle the kingly art in the same class with 
 the art of the herald the interpreter the boatswain the prophet 
 and the numerous kindred arts which exercise command or as in the 
 preceding comparison we spoke of manufacturers or sellers for 
 themselves and of too that the class of supreme 
 rulers or rulers for themselves is almost we make a 
 word following the same analogy and refer kings to a supreme or 
 science leaving the rest to receive a name from 
 some one else for we are seeking the ruler and our enquiry is not 
 concerned with him who is not a ruler 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str thus a very fair distinction has been attained between the 
 man who gives his own commands and him who gives and now let us see if the supreme power allows of any further division 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str i think that it does and please to assist me in making the 
 division 
 
 y soc at what point 
 
 str may not all rulers be supposed to command for the sake of 
 producing something 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str nor is there any difficulty in dividing the things produced 
 into two classes 
 
 y soc how would you divide them 
 
 str of the whole class some have life and some are without life 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and by the help of this distinction we may make if we 
 please a subdivision of the section of knowledge which commands 
 
 y soc at what point 
 
 str one part may be set over the production of lifeless the 
 other of living objects and in this way the whole will be divided 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str that division then is complete and now we may leave one 
 half and take up the other which may also be divided into two 
 
 y soc which of the two halves do you men 
 
 str of course that which exercises command about animals for 
 surely the royal science is not like that of a a 
 science presiding over lifeless king has a nobler 
 function which is the management and control of living beings 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the breeding and tending of living beings may be observed 
 to be sometimes a tending of the individual in other cases a 
 common care of creatures in flocks 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but the statesman is not a tender of like the 
 driver or groom of a single ox or horse he is rather to be compared 
 with the keeper of a drove of horses or oxen 
 
 y soc yes i see thanks to you 
 
 str shall we call this art of tending many animals together the 
 art of managing a herd or the art of collective management 
 
 y soc no suggests itself to us in the course 
 of conversation 
 
 str very good socrates and if you continue to be not too 
 particular about names you will be all the richer in wisdom when 
 you are an old man and now as you say leaving the 
 discussion of the name can you see a way in which a person by showing the art of herding to be of two kinds may cause that which is now sought amongst twice the number of things to be then sought amongst half that number 
 
 y soc i will appears to me to be one management of 
 men and another of beasts 
 
 str you have certainly divided them in a most straightforward and 
 manly style but you have fallen into an error which hereafter i think 
 that we had better avoid 
 
 y soc what is the error 
 
 str i think that we had better not cut off a single small portion 
 which is not a species from many larger portions the part should 
 be a species to separate off at once the subject of investigation is 
 a most excellent plan if only the separation be rightly 
 made and you were under the impression that you were right because you saw that you would come to man and this led you to hasten the steps but you should not chip off too small a piece my friend the safer way is to cut through the middle which is also the more likely way of finding classes attention to this principle makes all the difference in a process of enquiry 
 
 y soc what do you mean stranger 
 
 str i will endeavour to speak more plainly out of love to 
 your good parts socrates and although i cannot at present entirely explain myself i will try as we proceed to make my meaning a little 
 clearer 
 
 y soc what was the error of which as you say we were guilty in 
 our recent division 
 
 str the error was just as if some one who wanted to divide the 
 human race were to divide them after the fashion which prevails in 
 this part of the world here they cut off the hellenes as 
 one species and all the other species of mankind which are innumerable and have no ties or common language they include under the single name of barbarians and because they have one name they are supposed to be of one species also or suppose that in dividing numbers you were to cut off ten thousand from all the rest and make of it one species comprehending the first under another separate name you might say that here too was a single class because you had given it a single name whereas you would make a much better and more equal and logical classification of numbers if you divided them into odd and even or of the human species if you divided them into male and female and only separated off lydians or phrygians or any other tribe and arrayed them against the rest of the world when you could no longer make a division into parts which were also classes 
 
 y soc very true but i wish that this distinction between a part 
 and a class could still be made somewhat plainer 
 
 str o socrates best of men you are imposing upon me a very 
 difficult task we have already digressed further from our original 
 intention than we ought and you would have us wander still further 
 away but we must now return to our subject and hereafter 
 when there is a leisure hour we will follow up the other track at the 
 same time i wish you to guard against imagining that you ever heard me declare 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str that a class and a part are distinct 
 
 y soc what did i hear then 
 
 str that a class is necessarily a part but there is no similar 
 necessity that a part should be a dass that is the view which i 
 should always wish you to attribute to me socrates 
 
 y soc so be it 
 
 str there is another thing which i should like to know 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str the point at which we digressed for if i am not 
 mistaken the exact place was at the question where you would divide the management of herds to this you appeared rather too ready to answer that them were two species of animals man being one and all brutes making up the other 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str i thought that in taking away a part you imagined that the 
 remainder formed a class because you were able to call them by the 
 common name of brutes 
 
 y soc that again is true 
 
 str suppose now o most courageous of dialecticians that 
 some wise and understanding creature such as a crane is reputed to 
 be were in imitation of you to make a similar division and set up cranes against all other animals to their own special glorification at the same time jumbling together all the others including man under the appellation of would be the sort of error which we must try to avoid 
 
 y soc how can we be safe 
 
 str if we do not divide the whole class of animals we shall be 
 less likely to fall into that error 
 
 y soc we had better not take the whole 
 
 str yes there lay the source of error in our former division 
 
 y soc how 
 
 str you remember how that part of the art of knowledge which was 
 concerned with command had to do with the rearing of living 
 mean with animals in herds 
 y soc yes 
 
 str in that case there was already implied a division of all 
 animals into tame and wild those whose nature can be tamed 
 are called tame and those which cannot be tamed are called wild 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the political science of which we are in search is and 
 ever was concerned with tame animals and is also confined to 
 gregarious animals 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but then ought not to divide as we did taking the 
 whole class at once neither let us be in too great haste to arrive 
 quickly at the political science for this mistake has already brought upon us the misfortune of which the proverb speaks 
 
 y soc what misfortune 
 
 str the misfortune of too much haste which is too little speed 
 
 y soc and all the better got what we deserved 
 
 str very well let us then begin again and endeavour to 
 divide the collective rearing of animals for probably the completion of the argument will best show what you are so anxious to know tell me then 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str have you ever heard as you very likely i do not 
 suppose that you ever actually visited the preserves 
 of fishes in the nile and in the ponds of the great king or you may have seen similar preserves in wells at home 
 
 y soc yes to be sure i have seen them and i have often heard 
 the others described 
 
 str and you may have heard also and may have by 
 report although you have not travelled in those regions of 
 nurseries of geese and cranes in the plains of thessaly 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str i asked you because here is a new division of the management 
 of herds into the management of land and of water herds 
 
 y soc there is 
 
 str and do you agree that we ought to divide the collective rearing 
 of herds into two corresponding parts the one the rearing of water 
 and the other the rearing of land herds 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str there is surely no need to ask which of these two contains 
 the royal art for it is evident to everybody 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str any one can divide the herds which feed on dry land 
 
 y soc how would you divide them 
 
 str i should distinguish between those which fly and those which 
 walk 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str and where shall we look for the political animal might not 
 an idiot so to speak know that he is a pedestrian 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str the art of managing the walking animal has to be further 
 divided just as you might have an even number 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str let me note that here appear in view two ways to that part or 
 class which the argument aims at one is speedier way 
 which cuts off a small portion and leaves a large the other agrees 
 better with the principle which we were laying down that as 
 far as we can we should divide in the middle but it is longer we can take either of them whichever we please 
 
 y soc cannot we have both ways 
 
 str together what a thing to ask but if you take them in turn 
 you clearly may 
 
 y soc then i should like to have them in turn 
 
 str there will be no difficulty as we are near the end if we 
 had been at the beginning or in the middle i should have 
 demurred to your request but now in accordance with your desire let us begin with the longer way while we are fresh we shall get on better and now attend to the division 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str the tame walking herding animals are distributed by 
 nature into two classes 
 
 y soc upon what principle 
 
 str the one grows horns and the other is without horns 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str suppose that you divide the science which manages pedestrian 
 animals into two corresponding parts and define them for if you 
 try to invent names for them you will find the intricacy too great 
 
 y soc how must i speak of them then 
 
 str in this way let the science of managing pedestrian animals 
 be divided into two parts and one part assigned to the 
 horned herd and the other to the herd that has no horns 
 
 y soc all that you say has been abundantly proved and may 
 therefore be assumed 
 
 str the king is clearly the shepherd a polled herd who have no 
 horns 
 
 y soc that is evident 
 
 str shall we break up this hornless herd into sections and 
 endeavour to assign to him what is his 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str shall we distinguish them by their having or not having 
 cloven feet or by their mixing or not mixing the breed you 
 know what i mean 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str i mean that horses and asses naturally breed from one another 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but the remainder of the hornless herd of tame 
 animals will not mix the breed 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and of which has the statesman the mixed or of the 
 unmixed race 
 
 y soc clearly of the unmixed 
 
 str i suppose that we must divide this again as before 
 
 y soc we must 
 
 str every tame and herding animal has now been split up with the 
 exception of two species for i hardly think that dogs should be 
 reckoned among gregarious animals 
 
 y soc certainly not but how shall we divide the two remaining 
 species 
 
 str there is a measure of difference which may be appropriately 
 employed by you and theaetetus who are students of geometry 
 
 y soc what is that 
 
 str the diameter and again the diameter of a diameter 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str how does man walk but as a diameter whose power is two feet 
 
 y soc just so 
 
 str and the power of the remaining kind being the power of twice 
 two feet may be said to be the diameter of our diameter 
 
 y soc certainly and now i think that i pretty nearly understand 
 you 
 
 str in these divisions socrates i descry what would make 
 another famous jest 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str human beings have come out in the same class with the freest 
 and airiest of creation and have been running a race with them 
 
 y soc i remark that very singular coincidence 
 
 str and would you not expect the slowest to arrive last 
 
 y soc indeed i should 
 
 str and there is a still more ridiculous consequence 
 that the king is found running about with the herd and in close 
 competition with the who of all mankind is most of an adept at the airy life 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str then here socrates is still clearer evidence of the truth 
 of what was said in the enquiry about the sophist 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str that the dialectical method is no respecter of persons and 
 does not set the great above the small but always arrives in her 
 own way at the truest result 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str and now i will not wait for you to ask the but will 
 of my own accord take you by the shorter road to the definition of a king 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str i say that we should have begun at first by dividing land 
 animals into biped and quadruped and since the winged herd and 
 that alone comes out in the same class with man should 
 divide bipeds into those which have feathers and those which have not and when they have been divided and the art of the management of mankind is brought to light the time will have come to produce our statesman and ruler and set him like a charioteer in his place and hand over to him the reins of state for that too is a vocation which belongs to him 
 
 y soc very good you have paid me the mean that you have 
 completed the argument and i suppose that you added the 
 digression by way of interest 
 
 str then now let us go back to the beginning and join the 
 links which together make the definition of the name of the 
 art 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str the science of pure knowledge had as we said originally a 
 part which was the science of rule or command and from this was 
 derived another part which was called on the 
 analogy of an important section of this was the 
 management of living animals and this again was further limited to 
 the manage merit of them in herds and again in herds of pedestrian 
 animals the chief division of the latter was the art of managing 
 pedestrian animals which are without horns this again has a part 
 which can only be comprehended under one term by joining together 
 three animals the only further 
 subdivision is the art of man has to do with bipeds 
 and is what we were seeking after and have now found being at once 
 the royal and political 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str and do you think socrates that we really have done as you 
 say 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str do you think i mean that we have really fulfilled our 
 has been a sort of discussion and yet the 
 investigation seems to me not to be perfectly worked out this is 
 where the enquiry fails 
 
 y soc i do not understand 
 
 str i will try to make the thought which is at this 
 moment present in my mind clearer to us both 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str there were many arts of shepherding and one of them was the 
 political which had the charge of one particular herd 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and this the argument defined to be the art of rearing not 
 horses or other brutes but the art of rearing man collectively 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str note however a difference which distinguishes the king from 
 all other shepherds 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str i want to ask whether any one of the other herdsmen has a 
 rival who professes and claims to share with him in the management 
 of the herd 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that merchants husbandmen providers of 
 food and also and physicians will all contend with the herdsmen of humanity whom we call statesmen declaring that they themselves have the care of rearing of managing mankind and 
 that they rear not only the common herd but also the rulers themselves 
 
 y soc are they not right in saying so 
 
 str very likely they may be and we will consider their claim 
 but we are certain of no one will raise a similar claim 
 as against the herdsman who is allowed on all hands to be the sole 
 and only feeder and physician of his herd he is also their 
 matchmaker and accoucheur no one else knows that department of science and he is their and musician as far as their nature is susceptible of such influences and no one can console and soothe his own herd better than he can either with the natural tones of 
 his voice or with instruments and the same may be said of tenders 
 of animals in general 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str but if this is as you say can our argument about the king be 
 true and unimpeachable were we right in selecting him out of ten 
 thousand other claimants to be the shepherd and rearer of the human 
 flock 
 
 y soc surely not 
 
 str had we not reason just to now apprehend that although we may 
 have described a sort of royal form we have not as yet accurately 
 worked out the true image of the statesman and that we cannot 
 reveal him as he truly is in his own nature until we have 
 disengaged and separated him from those who bang about him and claim to share in his prerogatives 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and that socrates is what we must do if we do not mean to 
 bring disgrace upon the argument at its close 
 
 y soc we must certainly avoid that 
 
 str then let us make a new beginning and travel by a different 
 road 
 
 y soc what road 
 
 str i think that we may have a little amusement there is a 
 famous tale of which a good portion may with advantage be 
 interwoven and then we may resume our series of divisions and proceed in the old path until we arrive at the desired summit shall we do as i say 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str listen then to a tale which a child would love to hear and 
 you are not too old for childish amusement 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str there did really happen and will again happen like 
 many other events of which ancient tradition has preserved the record the portent which is traditionally said to have occurred in the 
 quarrel of atreus and thyestes you have heard no doubt and remember what they say happened at that time 
 
 y soc i suppose you to mean the token of the birth of the golden 
 lamb 
 
 str no not that but another part of the story which tells how 
 the sun and the stars once rose in the west and set in the east 
 and that the god reversed their motion and gave them that which 
 they now have as a testimony to the right of atreus 
 
 y soc yes there is that legend also 
 
 str again we have been often told of the reign of cronos 
 
 y soc yes very often 
 
 str did you ever hear that the men of former times were 
 earthborn and not begotten of one another 
 
 y soc yes that is another old tradition 
 
 str all these stories and ten thousand others which are 
 still more wonderful have a common origin many of them have been lost in the lapse of ages or are repeated only in a disconnected form but the origin of them is what no one has told and may as well be told now for the tale is suited to throw light on the nature of the king 
 
 y soc very good and i hope that you will give the whole story 
 and leave out nothing 
 
 str listen then there is a time when god himself guides 
 and helps to roll the world in its course and there is a time on the 
 completion of a certain cycle when he lets go and the world being 
 a living creature and having originally received intelligence from 
 its author and creator turns about and by an inherent necessity 
 revolves in the opposite direction 
 
 y soc why is that 
 
 str why because only the most divine things of all remain ever 
 unchanged and the same and body is not included in this 
 class heaven and the universe as we have termed them although they have been endowed by the creator with many glories partake of a bodily nature and therefore cannot be entirely free from perturbation but their motion is as far as possible single and in the same place and of the same kind and is therefore only subject to a reversal which is the least alteration possible for the lord of all moving things is alone able to move of himself and to think that he moves them at one time in one direction and at another time in another is blasphemy 
 hence we must not say that the world is either always or 
 all made to go round by god in two opposite courses or that 
 two gods 
 having opposite purposes make it move round but as i have already 
 said and this is the only remaining alternative the world is 
 guided at one time by an external power which is divine and receives 
 fresh life and immortality from the renewing hand of the creator 
 and again when let go moves spontaneously being set free at such 
 a time as to have during infinite cycles of years a reverse 
 movement this is due to its perfect balance to its vast 
 size and to the fact that it turns on the smallest pivot 
 
 y soc your account of the world seems to be very reasonable 
 indeed 
 
 str let us now reflect and try to gather from what has been said 
 the nature of the phenomenon which we affirmed to be the cause of 
 all these wonders it is this 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str the reversal which takes place from time to time of the 
 motion of the universe 
 
 y soc how is that the cause 
 
 str of all changes of the heavenly motions we may 
 consider this to be the greatest and most complete 
 
 y soc i should imagine so 
 
 str and it may be supposed to result in the greatest 
 changes to the human beings who are the inhabitants of the world at the time 
 
 y soc such changes would naturally occur 
 
 str and animals as we know survive with difficulty great and 
 serious changes of many different kinds when they come upon them at once 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str hence there necessarily occurs a great destruction of them 
 which extends also life of man few survivors of the race are 
 left and those who remain become the subjects of several novel and 
 remarkable phenomena and of one in particular which takes place at 
 the time when the transition is made to the cycle opposite to that 
 in which we are now living 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str the life of all animals first came to a standstill and the 
 mortal nature ceased to be or look older and was then reversed and 
 grew young and delicate the white locks of the aged darkened again 
 and the cheeks the bearded man became smooth and recovered their 
 former bloom the bodies of youths in their prime grew softer and 
 smaller continually by day and night returning and becoming 
 assimilated to the nature of a child in mind as well as 
 body in the succeeding stage they wasted away and wholly 
 disappeared 
 and the bodies of those who died by violence at that time quickly 
 passed through the like changes and in a few days were no more seen 
 
 y soc then how stranger were the animals created in those 
 days and in what way were they begotten of one another 
 
 str it is evident socrates that there was no such thing in the 
 then order of nature as the procreation of animals from one another 
 the race of which we hear in story was the one which 
 existed in those rose again from the ground and of this 
 tradition which is often unduly discredited our 
 ancestors who were nearest in point of time to the end of the last 
 period and came into being at the beginning of this are to us the 
 heralds and mark how consistent the sequel of the tale is after 
 the return of age to youth follows the return of the dead who are 
 lying in the earth to life simultaneously with the reversal of the 
 world the wheel of their generation has been turned back 
 and they are put together and rise and live in the opposite order unless god has carried any of them away to some other lot according to this tradition they of necessity sprang from the earth and have the name of and so the above legend clings to them 
 
 y soc certainly that is quite consistent with what has preceded 
 but tell me was the life which you said existed in the reign of 
 cronos in that cycle of the world or in this for the change in the 
 course of the stars and the sun must have occurred in both 
 
 str i see that you enter into my that blessed and 
 spontaneous life does not belong to the present cycle of the world 
 but to the previous one in which god superintended the whole 
 revolution of the universe and the several parts the universe were 
 distributed under the rule certain inferior deities as is the way in some places still there were demigods who were the shepherds of the various species and herds of animals and each one was in 
 all respects sufficient for those of whom he was the shepherd neither was there any violence or devouring of one another or war or quarrel among them and i might tell of ten thousand other blessings 
 which belonged to that dispensation the reason why the life of man was as tradition says spontaneous is as follows in those days god himself was their shepherd and ruled over them just as man over them who is by comparison a divine being still rules over the lower animals under him there were no forms of government or separate possession of women and children for all men rose again from the earth having no memory of the past and although they had nothing of this sort the earth gave them fruits in abundance which grew on trees and shrubs unbidden and were not planted by the hand of man and they dwelt naked and mostly in the open air for the temperature of their seasons was mild and they had no beds but lay on soft couches of grass which grew plentifully out of the earth such was the life of man in the days of cronos socrates the character of our present life which is said to be under zeus you know from your own 
 experience can you and will you determine which of them you deem the happier 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str then shall i determine for you as well as i can 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str suppose that the nurslings of cronos having this boundless 
 leisure and the power of holding intercourse not only with men 
 but with the brute creation had used all these advantages 
 with a view to philosophy conversing with the brutes as well as with 
 one another and learning of every nature which was gifted with any special power and was able to contribute some special experience to 
 the store of wisdom there would be no difficulty in deciding that they would be a thousand times happier than the men of our own day or 
 again if they had merely eaten and drunk until they were full and 
 told stories to one another and to the stories as are now attributed to this case also as i should imagine the answer would be easy but until some satisfactory witness can be found of the love of that age for knowledge and discussion we had better let the matter drop and give the reason why we have unearthed this tale 
 and then we shall be able to get on in the fulness of time when the change was to take place and the race had all perished and every soul had completed its proper cycle of births and been sown in the earth her appointed number of times the pilot of the universe let the helm go and retired to his place of view and then fate and innate desire reversed the motion of the world then also all the inferior deities who share the rule of the supreme power being informed of what was happening let go the parts of the world which were under their control and the world turning round with a sudden shock being impelled in an opposite direction from beginning to end was shaken by a mighty earthquake which wrought a new destruction of all manner of animals 
 afterwards when sufficient time had elapsed the tumult and confusion and earthquake ceased and the universal creature once more at peace attained to a calm and settle down into his own orderly and accustomed course having the charge and rule of himself and of all the creatures which are contained in him and executing as far as 
 he remembered them the instructions of his father and creator more 
 precisely at first but afterwords with less exactness the reason 
 of the falling off was the admixture of matter in him this was 
 inherent in the primal nature which was full of disorder until 
 attaining to the present order from god the constructor the world 
 received all that is good in him but from a previous state came 
 elements of evil and unrighteousness which thence derived first 
 of all passed into the world and were then transmitted to the 
 animals while the world was aided by the pilot in nurturing the 
 animals the evil was small and great the good which he 
 produced but after the separation when the world was let go at first all proceeded well enough but as time went there was more and more forgetting and the old discord again held sway and burst forth in full glory and at last small was the good and great was the 
 admixture of evil and there was a danger of universal ruin to the 
 world and the things contained in him wherefore god the orderer 
 of all in his tender care seeing that the world was in great 
 straits and fearing that all might be dissolved in the storm and 
 disappear in infinite chaos again seated himself at the helm and 
 bringing back the elements which had fallen into dissolution and 
 disorder to the motion which had prevailed under his dispensation 
 he set them in order and restored them and made the world 
 imperishable and immortal 
 and this is the whole tale of which the first part will suffice 
 to illustrate the nature of the king for when the world turned 
 towards the present cycle of generation the age of man again stood 
 still and a change opposite to the previous one was the result the 
 small creatures which had almost disappeared grew in and stature 
 and the children of the earth became grey and 
 died and sank into the earth again all things changed imitating and following the condition of the universe and of necessity agreeing with that in their mode of conception and generation and nurture for 
 no animal was any longer allowed to come into being in the earth through the agency of other creative beings but as the world was ordained to be the lord of his own progress in like manner the parts were ordained to grow and generate and give nourishment as far as they could of themselves impelled by a similar movement and so we have arrived at the real end of this discourse for although there might be much to tell of the lower animals and of the condition out of which they changed and of the causes of the change about men there is not much and that little is more to the purpose deprived of the care of god who had possessed and tended them they were left 
 helpless and defenceless and were torn in pieces by the beasts who were naturally fierce and had now grown wild and in the first ages they were still without skill or resource the food which once grew 
 spontaneously had failed and as yet they knew not how to procure 
 it because never felt the pressure of necessity for all 
 these reasons they were in a great strait wherefore also the gifts 
 spoken of in the old tradition were imparted to man by the gods 
 together with so much teaching and education as was indispensable 
 fire was given to them by prometheus the arts by hephaestus and his 
 athene seeds and plants by others from these is 
 derived all that has helped to frame human life since the 
 care of the gods as i was saying had now failed men and they had to order their course of life for themselves and were their own masters just like the universal creature whom they imitate and follow ever changing as he changes and ever living and growing at one time in one manner and at another time in another enough of the story which may be of use in showing us how greatly we erred in the delineation of the king and the statesman in our previous discourse 
 
 y soc what was this great error of which you speak 
 
 str there were two the first a lesser one the other was an 
 error on a much larger and grander scale 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that when we were asked about a king and 
 statesman of the present and generation we told of a shepherd of a 
 human flock who belonged to the other cycle and of one who was a 
 god when he ought to have been a man and this a great error again 
 we declared him to be the ruler of the entire state without 
 explaining how this was not the whole truth nor very intelligible 
 but still it was true and therefore the second error was not so 
 great as the first 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str before we can expect to have a perfect description of the 
 statesman we must define the nature of his office 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and the myth was introduced in order to show not 
 only that all others are rivals of true shepherd who is the object of our search but in order that we might have a clearer view of him who is alone worthy to receive this appellation because he alone of 
 shepherds and herdsmen according to the image which we have employed has the care of human beings 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and i cannot help thinking socrates that the form of the 
 divine shepherd is even higher than that of a king whereas the 
 statesmen who are now on earth seem to be much more like their 
 subjects in character and which more nearly to partake of their 
 breeding and education 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str still they must be investigated all the same to see whether 
 like the divine shepherd they are above their subjects or on a 
 level with them 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str to you remember that we spoke of a 
 exercised over animals not singly but 
 collectively which we called the art of rearing a herd 
 
 y soc yes i remember 
 
 str there somewhere lay our error for we never included or 
 mentioned the statesman and we did not observe that he had no place in our nomenclature 
 
 y soc how was that 
 
 str all other herdsmen rear their herds but this is not a 
 suitable term to apply to the statesman we should use a 
 name which is common to them all 
 
 y soc true if there be such a name 
 
 str why is not care of herds applicable to all for 
 this implies no feeding or any special duty if we say either tending 
 the herds or managing the herds or having the care of them the same word will include all and then we may wrap up the statesman with the rest as the argument seems to require 
 
 y soc quite right but how shall we take step in the 
 division 
 
 str as before we divided the art of rearing herds accordingly 
 as they were land or water herds winged and wingless mixing or not 
 mixing the breed horned and hornless so we may divide by these 
 same differences the teading of herds comprehending in our 
 definition the kingship of and the rule of cronos 
 
 y soc that is clear but i still ask what is to follow 
 
 str if the word had been managing herds instead of feeding or 
 rearing them no one would have argued that there was no care of men in the case of the politician although it was justly contended 
 that there was no human art of feeding them which was worthy of the 
 name or at least if there were many a man had a prior and greater 
 right to share in such an art than any king 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but no other art or science will have a prior or better right 
 than the royal science to care for human society and to rule over 
 men in general 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str in the next place socrates we must surely notice 
 that a great error was committed at the end of our analysis 
 
 y soc what was it 
 
 str why supposing we were ever so sure that there is such an art 
 as the art of rearing or feeding bipeds there was no reason why we 
 should call this the royal or political art as though there were no 
 more to be said 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str our first duty as we were saying was to remodel the name 
 so as to have the notion of care rather than of feeding and then to 
 divide for there may be still considerable divisions 
 
 y soc how can they be made 
 
 str first by separating the divine shepherd from the human 
 guardian or manager 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the art of management which is assigned to man would 
 again have to be subdivided 
 
 y soc on what principle 
 
 str on the principle of voluntary and compulsory 
 
 y soc why 
 
 str because if i am not mistaken there has been an error here 
 for our simplicity led us to rank king and tyrant together whereas 
 they are utterly distinct like their modes of government 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str then now as i said let us make the correction and divide 
 human care into two parts on the principle of voluntary and 
 compulsory 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and if we call the management of violent rulers tyranny and 
 the voluntary management of herds of voluntary bipeds 
 politics may we not further assert that he who has this latter art of management is the true king and statesman 
 
 y soc i think stranger that we have now completed the 
 account of the statesman 
 
 str would that we had socrates but i have to satisfy myself as 
 well as you and in my judgment the figure of the king is not yet 
 perfected like statuaries who in their too great haste having 
 overdone the several parts of their work lose time in cutting them 
 down so too we partly out of haste partly out of haste partly 
 out of a magnanimous desire to expose our former error and also 
 because we imagined that a king required grand illustrations have 
 taken up a marvellous lump of fable and have been obliged 
 to use more than was necessary this made us discourse at large and nevertheless the story never came to an end and our 
 discussion might be compared to a picture of some living being which had been fairly drawn in outline but had not yet attained the life and clearness which is given by the blending of colours now to intelligent persons a living being had better be delineated by language and discourse than by any painting or work of art to the duller sort by works of art 
 
 y soc very true but what is the imperfection which 
 still remains i wish that you would tell me 
 
 str the higher ideas my dear friend can hardly be set forth 
 except through the medium of examples every man seems to know all things in a dreamy sort of way and then again to wake up and to 
 know nothing 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i fear that i have been unfortunate in raising a question about 
 our experience of knowledge 
 
 y soc why so 
 
 str why because my example requires the assistance of another 
 example 
 
 y soc proceed you need not fear that i shall tire 
 
 str i will proceed finding as i do such a ready 
 listener in you when children are beginning to know their letters 
 
 y soc what are you going to say 
 
 str that they distinguish the several letters well enough in very 
 short and easy syllables and are able to tell them correctly 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str whereas in other syllables they do not recognize them and 
 think and speak falsely of them 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str will not the best and easiest way of bringing them to a 
 knowledge of what they do not as yet know be 
 
 y soc be what 
 
 str to refer them first of all to cases in which they judge 
 correctly about the letters in question and then to compare these 
 with the cases in which they do not as yet know and to show 
 them that the letters are the same and have the same character in both 
 combination until all cases in which they are right have been 
 placed side by side with all cases in which they are wrong in this 
 way they have examples and are made to learn that each letter in 
 every combination is always the same and not another and is always 
 called by the same name 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str are not examples formed in this manner we take a thing and 
 compare it with another distinct instance of the same thing of 
 which we have a right conception and out of the comparison there 
 arises one true notion which includes both of them 
 
 y soc exactly 
 
 str can we wonder then that the soul has the same uncertainty 
 about the alphabet of things and sometimes and in some cases is 
 firmly fixed by the truth in each particular and then again in 
 other cases is altogether at sea having somehow or other a 
 correction of combinations but when the elements are transferred into the long and difficult language syllables of facts is again ignorant of them 
 
 y soc there is nothing wonderful in that 
 
 str could any one my friend who began with false opinion ever 
 expect to arrive even at a small portion of truth and to attain 
 wisdom 
 
 y soc hardly 
 
 str then you and i will not be far wrong in trying to see the 
 nature of example in general in a small and particular instance 
 afterwards from lesser things we intend to pass to the royal class 
 which is the highest form of the same nature and endeavour to 
 discover by rules of art what the management of cities is and then 
 the dream will become a reality to us 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then once more let us resume the previous argument and as 
 there were innumerable rivals of the royal race who claim to have 
 the care of states let us part them all off and leave him alone 
 and as i was saying a model or example of this process has first 
 to be framed 
 
 y soc exactly 
 
 str what model is there which is small and yet has any analogy 
 with the political occupation suppose socrates that if we have no 
 other example at hand we choose weaving or more precisely 
 weaving of will be quite enough without taking 
 the whole of weaving to illustrate our meaning 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str why should we not apply to weaving the same processes of 
 division and subdivision which we have already applied to other 
 classes going once more as rapidly as we can through all the steps 
 until we come to that which is needed for our purpose 
 
 y soc how do you mean 
 
 str i shall reply by actually performing the process 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str all things which we make or acquire are either creative or 
 preventive of the preventive class are antidotes divine and human 
 and also defences and defences are either military weapons or 
 protections and protections are veils and also shields against 
 heat and cold and shields against heat and cold are shelters and 
 coverings and coverings are blankets and garments and garments are 
 some of them in one piece and others of them are made in several 
 parts and of these latter some are stitched others are fastened 
 and not stitched and of the not stitched some are made of 
 the sinews of plants and some of hair and of these again some are cemented with water and earth and others are fastened together by 
 themselves and these last defences and coverings which are fastened 
 together by themselves are called clothes and the art which 
 superintends them we may call from the nature of the operation the 
 art of clothing just as before the art of the statesman was derived 
 from the state and may we not say that the art of weaving at least 
 that largest portion of it which was concerned with the making of 
 clothes differs only in name from this art of clothing in the same 
 way that in the previous case the royal science differed from the 
 political 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str in the next place let us make the reflection that the art 
 of weaving clothes which an incompetent person might fancy to have 
 been sufficiently described has been separated off from several 
 others which are of the same family but not from the 
 arts 
 
 y soc and which are the kindred arts 
 
 str i see that i have not taken you with me so i think 
 that we had better go backwards starting from the end we just now parted off from the weaving of clothes the making of blankets which 
 differ from each other in that one is put under and the other is put around and these are what i termed kindred arts 
 
 y soc i understand 
 
 str and we have subtracted the manufacture of all articles made 
 of flax and cords and all that we just now metaphorically termed 
 the sinews of plants and we have also separated off the process of 
 felting and the putting together of materials by stitching 
 and sewing of which the most important part is the art 
 
 y soc precisely 
 str then we separated off the art which prepared 
 coverings in entire pieces and the art of sheltering and 
 subtracted the various arts of making which are employed 
 in building and in general in carpentering and in other crafts 
 and all such arts as furnish impediments to thieving and acts of 
 violence and are concerned with making the lids of boxes and the 
 fixing of doors being divisions of the art of joining and we also 
 cut off the manufacture of arms which is a section of the great and 
 manifold art of making defences and we originally began by parting 
 off the whole of the magic art which is concerned with antidoter 
 and have left as would appear the very art of which we were in 
 search the art of protection against winter cold which fabricates 
 woollen defences and has the name of weaving 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str yes my boy but that is not all for the first process to 
 which the material is subjected is the opposite of weaving 
 
 y soc how so 
 
 str weaving is a sort of uniting 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but the first process is a separation of the clotted 
 and matted fibres 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i mean the work of the art for we cannot say that 
 carding is weaving or that the carder is a weaver 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str again if a person were to say that the art of making the 
 warp and the woof was the art of weaving he would say what was 
 paradoxical and false 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str shall we say that the whole art of the fuller or of the 
 mender has nothing to do with the care and treatment clotes 
 or are we to regard all these as arts of weaving 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str and yet surely all these arts will maintain that they are 
 concerned with the treatment and production of clothes they will 
 dispute the exclusive prerogative of weaving and though assigning a 
 larger sphere to that will still reserve a considerable field for 
 themselves 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str besides these there are the arts which make tools and 
 instruments of weaving and which will claim at least to be 
 cooperative causes in every work of the weaver 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str well then suppose that we define weaving or rather 
 that part of it which has been selected by us to be the greatest and 
 noblest of arts which are concerned with woollen we be right is not the definition although true wanting in clearness and 
 completeness for do not all those other arts require to be first 
 cleared away 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str then the next thing will be to separate them in 
 order that the argument may proceed in a regular manner 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str let us consider in the first place that there are two kinds 
 of arts entering into everything which we do 
 
 y soc what are they 
 
 str the one kind is the conditional or cooperative the other the 
 principal cause 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str the arts which do not manufacture the actual thing but which 
 furnish the necessary tools for the manufacture without which the 
 several arts could not fulfil their appointed work are 
 but those which make the things themselves are causal 
 
 y soc a very reasonable distinction 
 
 str thus the arts which make spindles combs and other 
 instruments of the production of clothes may be called and those which treat and fabricate the things themselves causal 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str the arts of washing and mending and the other 
 preparatory arts which belong to the causal class and form a division of the great art of adornment may be all comprehended under what we call the art 
 
 y soc very good

 book 
 
 str carding and spinning threads and all the parts of the process 
 which are concerned with the actual manufacture of a woollen garment form a single art which is one of thow universally art of working in wool 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str of working in wool again there are two divisions and both 
 these are parts of two arts at once 
 
 y soc how is that 
 
 str carding and one half of the use of the comb and the other 
 processes of which separate the composite may 
 be classed together as belonging both to the art of woolworking and also to one of the two great arts which are of universal art of composition and the art of division 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str to the latter belong carding and the other processes 
 of which i was just now speaking the art of discernment or division in wool and yarn which is effected in one manner with the comb and in another with the hands is variously described under all the names which i just now mentioned 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str again let us take some process of woolworking which is also 
 a portion of the art of composition and dismissing the elements of 
 division which we found there make two halves one on the principle 
 of composition and the other on the principle of division 
 
 y soc let that be done 
 
 str and once more socrates we must divide the part which 
 belongs at once both to woolworking and composition if we 
 are ever to discover satisfactorily the aforesaid art of weaving 
 
 y soc we must 
 
 str yes certainly and let us call one part of the art the art 
 of twisting threads the other the art of combining them 
 
 y soc do i understand you in speaking of twisting to be 
 referring to manufacture of the warp 
 
 str yes and of the woof too how if not by twisting is the 
 woof made 
 
 y soc there is no other way 
 
 str then suppose that you define the warp and the woof 
 for i think that the definition will be of use to you 
 
 y soc how shall i define them 
 
 str as thus a piece of carded wool which is drawn out lengthwise 
 and is said to be pulled out 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and the wool thus prepared when twisted by the spindle and 
 made into a firm thread is called the warp and the art which 
 regulates these operations the art of spinning the warp 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the threads which are more loosely spun having a 
 softness proportioned to the intertexture of the warp and to the 
 degree of force used in dressing the threads which are 
 thus spun are called the woof and the art which is set over them 
 may be called the art of spinning the woof 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and now there can be no mistake about the nature of the 
 part of weaving which we have undertaken to define for when 
 that part of the art of composition which is employed in the working of wool forms a web by the regular intertexture of warp and woof the entire woven substance is called by us a woollen garment and the art which presides over this is the art of weaving 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str but why did we not say at once that weaving is the art of 
 entwining warp and woof instead of making a long and 
 useless circuit 
 
 y soc i thought stranger that there was nothing useless in 
 what was said 
 
 str very likely but you may not always think so my sweet 
 friend and in case any feeling of dissatisfaction should hereafter 
 arise in your mind as it very well may let me lay down a principle 
 which will apply to arguments in general 
 
 y soc proceed 
 
 str let us begin by considering the whole nature of excess and 
 defect and then we shall have a rational ground on which we may 
 praise or blame too much length or too much shortness in discussions of this kind 
 
 y soc let us do so 
 
 str the points on which i think that we ought to dwell are the 
 following 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str length and shortness excess and defect with all of 
 these the art of measurement is conversant 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and the art of measurement has to be divided into two parts 
 with a view to our present purpose 
 
 y soc where would you make the division 
 
 str as thus i would make two parts one having regard to the 
 relativity of greatness and smallness to each other and there is 
 another without which the existence of production would be 
 impossible 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str do you not think that it is only natural for the greater to 
 be called greater with reference to the less alone and the less 
 reference to the greater alone 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str well but is there not also something exceeding and 
 exceeded by the principle of the mean both in speech and action and is not this a reality and the chief mark of difference between good and bad men 
 
 y soc plainly 
 
 str then we must suppose that the great and small exist and are 
 discerned in both these ways and not as we were saying before 
 only relatively to one another but there must also be another 
 comparison of them with the mean or ideal standard would you like 
 to hear the reason why 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str if we assume the greater to exist only in relation to 
 the less there will never be any comparison of either with the mean 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and would not this doctrine be the ruin of all the arts and 
 their creations would not the art of the statesman and the 
 aforesaid art of weaving disappear for all these arts are on the 
 watch against excess and defect not as unrealities but as real 
 evils which occasion a difficulty in action and the excellence of 
 beauty of every work of art is due to this observance of measure 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str but if the science of the statesman disappears the search 
 for the royal science will be impossible 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str well then as in the case of the sophist we extorted the 
 inference that had an existence because here was the 
 point at which the argument eluded our grasp so in this we must 
 endeavour to show that the greater and less are not only to be 
 measured with one another but also have to do with the production 
 of the mean for if this is not admitted neither a statesman nor 
 any other man of action can be an undisputed master of his science 
 
 y soc yes we must certainly do again what we did then 
 
 str but this socrates is a greater work than the other of 
 which we only too well remember the length i think however that 
 we may fairly assume something of this sort 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str that we shall some day require this notion of a mean with a 
 view to the demonstration of absolute truth meanwhile the argument 
 that the very existence of the arts must be held to depend on the 
 possibility of measuring more or less not only with one another 
 but also with a view to the attainment of the mean seems to afford 
 a grand support and satisfactory proof of the doctrine which we are 
 maintaining for if there are arts there is a standard of measure 
 and if there is a standard of measure there are arts but if either 
 is wanting there is neither 
 
 y soc true and what is the next step 
 
 str the next step clearly is to divide the art of measurement 
 into two parts all we have said already and to place in 
 the one part all the arts which measure number length depth breadth swiftness with their opposites and to have another part in which they are measured with the mean and the fit and the opportune and the due and with all those words in short which denote a mean or standard removed from the extremes 
 
 y soc here are two vast divisions embracing two very different 
 spheres 
 
 str there are many accomplished men socrates who say believing 
 themselves to speak wisely that the art of measurement is 
 universal and has to do with all things and this means what we are 
 now saying for all things which come within the province of art do 
 certainly in some sense partake of measure but these 
 persons because they are not accustomed to distinguish classes according to real forms jumble together two widely different things relation to one another and to a standard under the idea that they are the same and also fall into the converse error of dividing other things not according to their real parts whereas the right way is if a man 
 has first seen the unity of things to go on with the enquiry and 
 not desist until he has found all the differences contained in it 
 which form distinct classes nor again should he be able to rest 
 contented with the manifold diversities which are seen in a 
 multitude of things until he has comprehended all of them that have 
 any affinity within the bounds of one similarity and embraced them 
 within the reality of a single kind but we have said enough on this 
 head and also of excess and defect we have only to bear in 
 mind that two divisions of the art of measurement have been discovered which are concerned with them and not forget what they are 
 y soc we will not forget 
 
 str and now that this discussion is completed let us go on to 
 consider another question which concerns not this argument only but 
 the conduct of such arguments in general 
 
 y soc what is this new question 
 
 str take the case of a child who is engaged in learning his 
 letters when he is asked what letters make up a word should we say 
 that the question is intended to improve his grammatical knowledge 
 of that particular word or of all words 
 
 y soc clearly in order that he may have a better 
 knowledge of all words 
 
 str and is our enquiry about the statesman intended only 
 to improve our knowledge of politics or our power of reasoning generally 
 
 y soc clearly as in the former example the purpose is general 
 str still less would any rational man seek to analyse the 
 notion of weaving for its own sake but people seem to forget that some things have sensible images which are readily known and can be easily pointed out when any one desires to answer an enquirer without any trouble or argument whereas the greatest and highest truths have no outward image of themselves visible to man which he who wishes to satisfy the soul of the enquirer can adapt to the eye of sense and therefore we ought to train ourselves to give and accept a rational account of them for immaterial things which are the noblest and greatest are shown only in thought and idea and in no 
 other way and all that we are now saying is said for the sake of them moreover there is always less difficulty in fixing the mind on small matters than on great 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str let us call to mind the bearing of all this 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str i wanted to get rid of any impression of tediousness which we 
 may have experienced in the discussion about weaving and 
 the reversal of the universe and in the discussion concerning the sophist and the being of i know that they were felt to be too long and i reproached myself with this fearing that they might be not only tedious but irrelevant and all that i have now said is only 
 designed to prevent the recurrence of any such disagreeables for the 
 future 
 
 y soc very good will you proceed 
 
 str then i would like to observe that you and i remembering what 
 has been said should praise or blame the length or shortness of 
 discussions not by comparing them with one another but with what 
 is fitting having regard to the part of measurement which as we 
 said was to be borne in mind 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and yet not everything is to be judged even with a view to 
 what is fitting for we should only want such a length as is 
 suited to give pleasure if at all as a secondary matter and reason tells us that we should be contented to make the ease or rapidity of an enquiry not our first but our second object the first and highest 
 of all being to assert the great method of division according to 
 the discourse be shorter or longer is not to the 
 point no offence should be taken at length but the longer and 
 shorter are to be employed indifferently according as either of 
 them is better calculated to sharpen the wits of the auditors 
 reason would also say to him who censures the length of discourses 
 on such occasions and cannot away with their circumlocution that he 
 should not be in such a hurry to have done with them when 
 he can only complain that they are tedious but he should prove that if they had been shorter they would have made those who took part in them better dialecticians and more capable of expressing the truth of things about any other praise and blame he need not trouble should pretend not to hear them but we have had enough of this as you will probably agree with me in thinking let us return to our 
 statesman and apply to his case the aforesaid example of weaving 
 
 y soc very us do as you say 
 
 str the art of the king has been separated from the similar arts of 
 shepherds and indeed from all those which have to do with herds 
 at all there still remain however of the causal and 
 arts those which are immediately concerned with states and 
 which must first be distinguished from one another 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str you know that these arts cannot easily be divided into two 
 halves the reason will be very evident as we proceed 
 
 y soc then we had better do so 
 
 str we must carve them like a victim into members or limbs since 
 we cannot bisect them for we certainly should divide everything 
 into as few parts as possible 
 
 y soc what is to be done in this case 
 
 str what we did in the example of those arts which 
 furnish the tools were regarded by us as 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str so now and with still more reason all arts which make any 
 implement in a state whether great or small may be 
 regarded by us as for without them neither state nor statesmanship would be possible and yet we are not inclined to say that any of them is a product of the kingly art 
 
 y soc no indeed 
 
 str the task of separating this class from others is not an easy 
 one for there is plausibility in saying that anything in 
 the world is the instrument of doing something but there is another dass of possessions in a city of which i have a word to say 
 
 y soc what class do you mean 
 
 str a class which may be described as not having this power that 
 is to say not like an instrument framed for production 
 but designed for the preservation of that which is produced 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str to the class of vessels as they are comprehensively termed 
 which are constructed for the preservation of things moist 
 and dry of things prepared in the fire or out of the fire this is a very large class and has if i am not mistaken literally nothing to 
 do with the royal art of which we are in search 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str there is also a third class of possessions to be noted 
 different from these and very extensive moving or resting on land 
 or water honourable and also dishonourable the whole of this class 
 has one name because it is intended to be sat upon being always a 
 seat for something 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str a vehicle which is certainly not the work of the statesman 
 but of the carpenter potter and coppersmith 
 
 y soc i understand 
 
 str and is there not a fourth class which is again different and 
 in which most of the things formerly mentioned are 
 kind of dress most sorts of arms walls and enclosures whether of 
 earth or stone and ten thousand other thing all of which being 
 made for the sake of defence may be truly called defences and are 
 for the most part to be regarded as the work of the builder or of 
 the weaver rather than of the statesman 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str shall we add a fifth class of ornamentation and drawing and 
 of the imitations produced by drawing and music which are designed for amusement only and may be fairly comprehended under one name 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str plaything is the name 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str that one name may be fitly predicated of all of them for 
 none of these things have a serious is their sole 
 aim 
 
 y soc that again i understand 
 
 str then there is a class which provides materials for all these 
 out of which and in which the arts already mentioned fabricate their 
 manifold class i say which is the creation and 
 offspring of many other arts may i not rank sixth 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i am referring to gold silver and other metals and all 
 that and shearing of every sort provides for the art of 
 carpentry and plaiting and there is the process of barking and 
 stripping the cuticle of plants and the art which strips 
 off the skins of animals and other similar arts which manufacture 
 corks and papyri and cords and provide for the manufacture of 
 composite species out of simple whole class may be termed 
 the primitive and simple possession of man and with this the kingly 
 science has no concern at all 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the provision of food and of all other things which mingle 
 their particles with the particles of the human body and minister 
 to the body will form a seventh class which may be called by the 
 general term of nourishment unless you have any better name 
 to however appertains rather to the husbandman 
 huntsman trainer doctor cook and is not to be assigned to the art 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str these seven classes include nearly every description of 
 property with the exception of tame animals was 
 the original material which ought to have been placed first next 
 come instruments vessels vehicles defences playthings 
 nourishment small things which may under one 
 of for example coins seals and stamps are omitted for they have not in them the character of any larger kind which includes 
 them but some of them may with a little forcing be placed among ornaments and others may be made to harmonize with the class of implements the art of herding which has been already divided into parts will include all property in tame animals except slaves 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str the class of slaves and ministers only remains and i suspect 
 that in this the real aspirants for the throne who are the rivals 
 of the king in the formation of the political web will be 
 discovered just as spinners carders and the rest of them were the rivals of the weaver all the others who were termed have been got rid of among the occupations already mentioned and 
 separated from the royal and political science 
 
 y soc i agree 
 
 str let us go a little nearer in order that we may be 
 more certain of the complexion of this remaining class 
 
 y soc let us do so 
 
 str we shall find from our present point of view that the 
 greatest servants are in a case and condition which is the reverse 
 of what we anticipated 
 
 y soc who are they 
 
 str those who have been purchased and have so become 
 possessions these are unmistakably slaves and certainly do 
 not claim royal science 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str again freemen who of their own accord become the servants of 
 the other classes in a state and who exchange and equalise the 
 products of husbandry and the other arts some sitting in the 
 others going from city to city by land or sea and 
 giving money in exchange for money or for other 
 the merchant the the retailer will not 
 put in any claim to statecraft or politics 
 
 y soc no unless indeed to the politics of commerce 
 
 str but surely men whom we see acting as hirelings and serfs and 
 too happy to turn their hand to anything will not profess 
 to share in royal science 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str but what would you say of some other serviceable officials 
 
 y soc who are they and what services do they perform 
 
 str there are heralds and scribes perfected by practice and 
 divers others who have great skill in various sorts of business 
 connected with the government of shall we call them 
 
 y soc they are the officials and servants of the rulers as you 
 just now called them but not themselves rulers 
 
 str there may be something strange in any servant pretending to 
 be a ruler and yet i do not think that i could have been dreaming 
 when i imagined that the principal claimants to political science 
 would be found somewhere in this neighbourhood 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str well let us draw nearer and try the claims of some who have 
 not yet been tested in the first place there are diviners who 
 have a portion of servile or ministerial science and are thought to 
 be the interpreters of the gods to men 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str there is also the priestly class who as the law declares 
 know how to give the gods gifts from men in the form of sacrifices 
 which are acceptable to them and to ask on our behalf blessings in 
 return from them now both these are branches of the servile or 
 ministerial art 
 
 y soc yes clearly 
 
 str and here i think that we seem to be getting on the 
 right track for the priest and the diviner are swollen with pride and 
 prerogative and they create an awful impression of themselves by the magnitude of their enterprises in egypt the king himself is not allowed to reign unless he have priestly powers and if he should be of another class and has thrust himself in he must get enrolled in the 
 priesthood in many parts of hellas the duty of offering the most 
 solemn propitiatory sacrifices is assigned to the highest 
 magistracies and here at athens the most solemn and 
 national of the ancient sacrifices are supposed to be celebrated by him who has been chosen by lot to be the king archon 
 
 y soc precisely 
 
 str but who are these other kings and priests elected by lot who 
 now come into view followed by their retainers and a vast throng as 
 the former class disappears and the scene changes 
 
 y soc whom can you mean 
 
 str they are a strange crew 
 
 y soc why strange 
 
 str a minute ago i thought that they were animals of every tribe 
 for many of them are like lions and centaurs and many more like 
 satyrs and such weak and shifty shapes quickly 
 changing into one forms and natures and now socrates i 
 begin to see who they are 
 
 y soc who are they you seem to be gazing on some strange vision 
 
 str yes every one looks strange when you do not know 
 him and just now i myself fell into this first sight coming suddenly upon him i did not recognize the politician and his troop 
 
 y soc who is he 
 
 str the chief of sophists and most accomplished of wizards who 
 must at any cost be separated from the true king or statesman if we 
 are ever to see daylight in the present enquiry 
 
 y soc that is a hope not lightly to be renounced 
 
 str never if i can help it and first let me ask you a 
 question 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str is not monarchy a recognized form of government 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and after monarchy next in order comes the government of 
 the few 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str is not the third form of government the rule of the 
 multitude which is called by the name of democracy 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and do not these three expand in a manner into five 
 producing out of themselves two other names y soc what are they 
 
 y soc what are they 
 
 str there is a criterion of voluntary and involuntary poverty 
 and riches law and the absence of law which men apply 
 to them the two first they subdivide accordingly and ascribe to 
 monarchy two forms and two corresponding names royalty and tyranny 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and the government of the few they distinguish by the names 
 of aristocracy and oligarchy 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str democracy alone whether rigidly observing the laws 
 or not and whether the multitude rule over the men of property with 
 their consent or against their consent always in ordinary language has the same name 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but do you suppose that any form of government which 
 is defined by these characteristics of the one the few or the many of 
 poverty or wealth of voluntary or compulsory submission of written 
 law or the absence of law can be a right one 
 
 y soc why not 
 
 str reflect and follow me 
 
 y soc in what direction 
 
 str shall we abide by what we said at first or shall we retract 
 our words 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str if i am not mistaken we said that royal power was a science 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and a science of a peculiar kind which was selected 
 out of the rest as having a character which is at once judicial and 
 authoritative 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and there was one kind of authority over lifeless things and 
 another other living animals and so we proceeded in the 
 division step by step up to this point not losing the idea of science but unable as yet to determine the nature of the particular science 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str hence we are led to observe that the distinguishing principle 
 of the state cannot be the few or many the voluntary or 
 involuntary poverty or riches but some notion of science must 
 enter into it if we are to be consistent with what has preceded 
 
 y soc and we must be consistent 
 
 str well then in which of these various forms of states may the 
 science of government which is among the greatest of all 
 sciences and most difficult to acquire be supposed to reside that we must discover and then we shall see who are the false politicians who pretend to be politicians but are not although they persuade many and shall separate them from the wise king 
 
 y soc that as the argument has already intimated will be our 
 duty 
 str do you think that the multitude in a state can attain 
 politicals science 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str but perhaps in a city of a thousand men there would be a 
 hundred or say fifty who could 
 
 y soc in that case political science would certainly be the 
 easiest of all sciences there could not be found in a city of that 
 number as many really if judged by the 
 standard of the rest of hellas and there would certainly not be as 
 many kings for kings we may truly call those who possess royal 
 science whether they rule or not as was shown in the previous 
 argument 
 
 str thank you for reminding me and the consequence is that any 
 true form of government can only be supposed to be the government of one two or at any rate of a few 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and these whether they rule with the will or 
 against the will of their subjects with written laws or without written laws and whether they are poor or rich and whatever be the nature of their rule must be supposed according to our present view to 
 rule on some scientific principle just as the physician whether he cures us against our will or with our will and whatever be his mode of 
 burning or the infliction of some other 
 he practises out of a book or not out of a book and 
 whether he be rich or poor whether he purges or reduces in 
 some other way or even fattens his patients is a physician all the same so long as he exercises authority over them according to rules 
 of art if he only does them good and heals and saves them and this we lay down to be the only proper test of the art of medicine or of any other art of command 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str then that can be the only true form of government in which 
 the governors are really found to possess science and are not mere 
 pretenders whether they rule according to law or without law 
 or unwilling subjects and are rich or poor 
 of these things can with any propriety be included 
 in the notion of the ruler 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and whether with a view to the public good they purge 
 the state by killing some or exiling some whether they reduce the size of the body corporate by sending out from the hive swarms of citizens or by introducing persons from without increase it while they act according to the rules of wisdom and justice and use their 
 power with a view to the general security and improvement the city over which they rule and which has these characteristics may be described as the only true state all other governments are not genuine or real but only imitations of this and some of them are better and some of them are worse the better are said to be well governed but they are mere imitations like the others 
 
 y soc i agree stranger in the greater part of what you say 
 but as to their ruling without expression has a harsh sound 
 
 str you have been too quick for me socrates i was just going to 
 ask you whether you objected to any of my statements and now i see that we shall have to consider this notion of there being good 
 government without laws 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str there can be no doubt that legislation is in a manner the 
 business of a king and yet the best thing of all is not that the 
 law should rule but that a man should rule supposing him to have 
 wisdom and royal power do you see why this is 
 
 y soc why 
 
 str because the law does not perfectly comprehend what is noblest 
 and most just for all and therefore cannot enforce what is best the 
 differences of men and actions and the endless irregular 
 movements of human things do not admit of any universal and simple rule and no art whatsoever can lay down a rule which will last for all time 
 
 y soc of course not 
 
 str but the law is always striving to make an obstinate 
 and ignorant tyrant who will not allow anything to be done contrary 
 to his appointment or any question to be even in sudden 
 changes of circumstances when something happens to be better than 
 what he commanded for some one 
 
 y soc certainly the law treats us all precisely in the manner 
 which you describe 
 
 str a perfectly simple principle can never be applied to 
 a state of things which is the reverse of simple 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str then if the law is not the perfection of right why are we 
 compelled to make laws at all the reason of this has next to be 
 investigated 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str let me ask whether you have not meetings for gymnastic 
 contests in your city such as there are in other cities at 
 which men compete in running wrestling and the like 
 
 y soc yes they are very common among us 
 
 str and what are the rules which are enforced on their pupils by 
 professional trainers or by others having similar authority can you 
 remember 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str the do not issue minute rules for 
 individuals or give every individual what is exactly suited to his constitution they think that they ought to go more roughly to work and to prescribe generally the regimen which will benefit the majority 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and therefore they assign equal amounts of exercise to them 
 all they send them forth together and let them rest together from 
 their running wrestling or whatever the form of bodily exercise 
 may be 
 
 y so true 
 
 str and now observe that the legislator who has to 
 preside over the herd and to enforce justice in their dealings with one another will not be able in enacting for the general good to 
 provide exactly what is suitable for each particular case 
 
 y soc he cannot be expected to do so 
 
 str he will lay down laws in a general form for the majority 
 roughly meeting the cases of individuals and some of them he will 
 deliver in writing and others will be unwritten and these last 
 will be traditional customs of the country 
 
 y soc he will be right 
 
 str yes quite right for how can he sit at every side all 
 through his life prescribing for him the exact particulars of his 
 duty who socrates would be equal to such a task no one who 
 really had the royal science if he had been able to do this would 
 have imposed upon himself the restriction of a written law 
 
 y soc so i should infer from what has now been said 
 
 str or rather my good friend from what is going to be said 
 
 y soc and what is that 
 
 str let us put to ourselves the case of a physician or trainer 
 who is about to go into a far country and is expecting to be a long 
 time away from his that his instructions 
 will not be remembered unless they are written down he will leave notes of them for the use of his pupils or patients 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but what would you say if he came back sooner than he had 
 intended and owing to an unexpected change of the winds or other 
 celestial influences something else happened to be better for 
 he not venture to suggest this new remedy although not 
 contemplated in his former prescription would he persist in 
 observing the original law neither himself giving any few 
 commandments nor the patient daring to do otherwise than was prescribed under the idea that this course only was healthy and medicinal all others noxious and heterodox viewed in the light of science and true art would not all such enactments be utterly ridiculous 
 
 y soc utterly 
 
 str and if he who gave laws written or unwritten 
 determining what was good or bad honourable or dishonourable just or unjust to the tribes of men who flock together in their several cities and are governed accordance with them if i say the wise legislator were suddenly to come again or another like to him is he to be prohibited from changing not this prohibition be in reality quite as ridiculous as the other 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str do you know a plausible saying of the common people 
 which is in point 
 
 y soc i do not recall what you mean at the moment 
 
 str they say that if any one knows how the ancient laws may be 
 improved he must first persuade his own state of the 
 improvement and then he may legislate but not otherwise 
 
 y soc and are they not right 
 
 str i dare say but supposing that he does use some 
 gentle violence for their good what is this violence to be called or rather 
 before you answer let me ask the same question in reference to our 
 previous instances 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str suppose that a skilful physician has a patient of 
 whatever sex or age whom he compels against his will to do something for his good which is contrary to the written rules what is this compulsion to be called would you ever dream of calling it a violation of the art or a breach of the laws of health nothing could be more unjust than for the patient to whom such violence is applied to charge the physician who practises the violence with wanting skill or aggravating his disease 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str in the political art error is not called disease but evil 
 or disgrace or injustice 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str and when the citizen contrary to law and custom is 
 compelled to do what is juster and better and nobler than he did 
 before the last and most absurd thing which he could say about such 
 violence is that he has incurred disgrace or evil or injustice at 
 the hands of those who compelled him 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and shall we say that the violence if exercised by a 
 rich just and if by a poor man unjust may not any man rich or poor with or without laws with the will of the citizens or against 
 the will of the citizens do what is for their interest is not this 
 the true principle of government according to which the 
 wise and good man will order the affairs of his subjects as the pilot by watching continually over the interests of the ship and of the 
 by laying down rules but by making his art a 
 the lives of his even and in the way may 
 there not be a true form of polity created by those who are able to 
 govern in a similar spirit and who show a strength of art which is 
 superior to the law nor can wise rulers ever err while they 
 observing the one great rule of distributing justice to the citizens 
 with intelligence and skill are able to preserve them and 
 as far as may be to make them better from being worse 
 
 y soc no one can deny what has been now said 
 
 str neither if you consider can any one deny the other 
 statement 
 
 y soc what was it 
 
 str we said that no great number of persons whoever they may be 
 can attain political knowledge or order a state wisely but that 
 the true government is to be found in a small body or in an 
 individual and that other states are but imitations of this as we 
 said a little while ago some for the better and some for the worse 
 
 y soc what do you mean i cannot have understood your previous 
 remark about imitations 
 
 str and yet the mere suggestion which i hastily threw out 
 is highly important even if we leave the question where it is and do not seek by the discussion of it to expose the error which prevails in 
 this matter 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str the idea which has to be grasped by us is not easy or 
 familiar but we may attempt to express it the government of which i have been speaking to be the only true model then the others must use the written laws of no other can they be saved they will have to do what is now generally approved although not the best thing in the world 
 
 y soc what is this 
 
 str no citizen should do anything contrary to the laws and any 
 infringement of them should be punished with death and the most 
 extreme penalties and this is very right and good when regarded as 
 the second best thing if you set aside the first of which 
 i was just now speaking shall i explain the nature of what call the 
 second best 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str i must again have recourse to my favourite images through 
 them and them alone can i describe kings and rulers 
 
 y soc what images 
 
 str the noble pilot and the wise physician who is worth many 
 another the similitude of these let us endeavour to discover 
 some image of the king 
 
 y soc what sort of image 
 
 str well such as man will reflect that he suffers 
 strange things at the hands of both of them the physician saves 
 any whom he wishes to save and any whom he wishes to maltreat he 
 or burning them and at the same time 
 requiring thems to bring him patients which are a sort of tribute of which little or nothing is spent upon the sick man and the greater part is consumed by him and his domestics and the finale is that he receives money from the relations of the sick man or from some enemy of his and puts him out of the way and the pilots of ships are guilty of numberless evil deeds of the same kind they intentionally play false and leave you ashore when the hour of sailing arrives or they cause mishaps at sea and cast away their freight and are guilty of 
 other rogueries now suppose that we bearing all this in mind were 
 to determine after consideration that neither of these arts shall 
 any longer be allowed to exercise absolute control either 
 over freemen or over slaves but that we will summon an assembly either of all the people or of the rich only that anybody who likes whatever may be his calling or even if he have no calling may offer an opinion either about seamanship or about as to the manner in which physic or surgical instruments are to be applied to the patient or again about the vessels and the nautical implements 
 which are required in navigation and how to meet the 
 dangers of winds and waves which are incidental to the voyage how to behave when encountering pirates and what is to be done with the old fashioned galleys if they have to fight with others of a similar that whatever shall be decreed by the multitude on these 
 points upon the advice of persons skilled or unskilled shall be written down on triangular tablets and columns or enacted although unwritten to be national customs and that in all future time vessels shall be navigated and remedies administered to the patient after 
 this fashion 
 
 y soc what a strange notion 
 
 str suppose further that the pilots and physicians are appointed 
 annually either out of the rich or out of the whole people and that 
 they are elected by lot and that after their election they navigate 
 vessels and heal the sick according to the written rules 
 
 y soc worse and worse 
 
 str but hear what the year of office has 
 expired the pilot or physician has to come before a court of review in which the judges are either selected from the wealthy classes or chosen by lot out of the whole people and anybody who pleases may be their accuser and may lay to their charge that during the past year they have not navigated their vessels or healed their patients 
 according to the letter of the law and the ancient customs of their and if either of them is condemned some of the judges must fix what he is to suffer or pay 
 y soc he who is willing to take a command under such conditions 
 deserves to suffer any penalty 
 
 str yet once more we shall have to enact that if any one is 
 detected enquiring into piloting and navigation or into health and 
 the true nature of medicine or about the winds or other conditions 
 of the atmosphere contrary to the written rules and has any 
 ingenious notions about such matters he is not to be called a pilot 
 or physician but a cloudy prating on the ground 
 that he is a corrupter of the young who would persuade them to 
 follow the art of medicine or piloting in an unlawful manner and to 
 exercise an arbitrary rule over their patients or ships any one who 
 is qualified by law may inform against him and indict him in some 
 court and then if he is found to be persuading any whether young 
 or old to act contrary to the written law he is to be punished 
 with the utmost rigour for no one should presume to be 
 wiser than the laws and as touching healing and health and piloting and navigation the nature of them is known to all for anybody may 
 learn the written laws and the national customs if such were the mode 
 of procedure socrates about these sciences and about generalship 
 and any branch of hunting or about painting or imitation in 
 general or carpentry or any sort of handicraft or husbandry or 
 planting or if we were to see an art of rearing horses or tending 
 herds or divination or any ministerial service or or any science conversant with number whether simple or square or cube or comprising say if all these things were done in this way according to written regulations and not according to art what would be the result 
 
 y soc all the arts would utterly perish and could never be 
 recovered because enquiry would be unlawful and human 
 life which is bad enough already would then become utterly unendurable 
 
 str but what if while compelling all these operations to be 
 regulated by written law we were to appoint as the guardian of the 
 laws some one elected by a show of hands or by lot and he caring 
 nothing about the laws were to act contrary to them from motives of 
 interest or favour and without not this be a still 
 worse evil than the former 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str to go against the laws which are based upon long experience 
 and the wisdom of counsellors who have graciously 
 recommended them and persuaded the multitude to pass them would be a far greater and more ruinous error than any adherence to written law 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str therefore as there is a danger of this the next 
 best thing in legislating is not to allow either the individual or the multitude to break the law in any respect whatever 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the laws would be copies of the true particulars of action as 
 far as they admit of being written down from the lips of those who 
 have knowledge 
 
 y soc certainly they would 
 
 str and as we were saying he who has knowledge and is a true 
 statesman will do many things within his own sphere of action by 
 his art without regard to the laws when he is of opinion that 
 something other than that which he has written down and 
 enjoined to be observed during his absence would be better 
 
 y soc yes we said so 
 
 str and any individual or any number of men having fixed laws 
 in acting contrary to them with a view to something better 
 would only be acting as far as they are able like the true statesman 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str if they had no knowledge of what they were doing they would 
 imitate the truth and they would always imitate ill but if they 
 had knowledge the imitation would be the perfect truth and an 
 imitation no longer 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str and the principle that no great number of men are able to 
 acquire a knowledge of any art has been already admitted by us 
 
 y soc yes it has 
 
 str then the royal or political art if there be such an art 
 will never be attained either by the wealthy or by the other mob 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str then the nearest approach which these lower forms of 
 government can ever make to the true government of the one scientific ruler is to do nothing contrary to their own written laws and 
 national customs 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str when the rich imitate the true form such a government is 
 called aristocracy and when they are regardless of the laws 
 oligarchy 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str or again when an individual rules according to law in 
 imitation of him who knows we call him a king and if he rules 
 according to law we give him the same name whether he rules with 
 opinion or with knowledge 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str and when an individual truly possessing knowledge rules his 
 name will surely be the will be called a king and thus the 
 five names of governments as they are now reckoned become one 
 
 y soc that is true 
 
 str and when an individual ruler governs neither by law nor by 
 custom but following in the steps of the true man of 
 science pretends that he can only act for the best by violating the laws while in reality appetite and ignorance are the motives of the imitation may not such an one be called a tyrant 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and this we believe to be the origin of the tyrant and the 
 king of oligarchies and aristocracies and men 
 are offended at the one monarch and can never be made to 
 believe that any one can be worthy of such authority or is able and 
 willing in the spirit of virtue and knowledge to act justly and holily to all they fancy that he will be a despot who will wrong and harm and slay whom he pleases of us for if there could be such a despot as we 
 describe they would acknowledge that we ought to be too glad to 
 have him and that he alone would be the happy ruler of a true and 
 perfect state 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str but then as the state is not like a beehive and has no 
 natural head who is at once recognized to be the superior 
 both in body and in mind mankind are obliged to meet and make laws and endeavour to approach as nearly as they can to the true form of government 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and when the foundation of politics is in the letter only and 
 in custom and knowledge is divorced from action can we wonder 
 socrates at the miseries which there are and always will be in 
 states any other art built on such a foundation and thus 
 conducted would ruin all that it touched ought we not rather to 
 wonder at the natural strength of the political bond for states 
 have endured all this time out of mind and yet some of them still 
 remain and are not overthrown though many of them like 
 ships at sea founder from time to time and perish and have perished and will hire after perish through the badness of their pilots and crews who have the worst sort of ignorance of the highest mean to say that they are wholly unaquainted with politics of which above all other sciences they believe themselves to have acquired the 
 most perfect knowledge 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then the question of these untrue forms of 
 government is the least oppressive to their subjects though they 
 are all oppressive and which is the worst of them here is a 
 consideration which is beside our present purpose and yet having 
 regard to the whole it seems to influence all our actions we must 
 examine it 
 
 y soc yes we must 
 
 str you may say that of the three forms the same is at once the 
 hardest and the easiest 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i am speaking of the three forms of government which i 
 mentioned at the beginning of this the rule of 
 the few and the rule of the many 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str if we divide each of these we shall have six from which the 
 true one may be distinguished as a seventh 
 
 y soc how would you make the division 
 
 str monarchy divides into royalty and tyranny the rule of the 
 few into aristocracy which has an auspicious name and 
 oligarchy and democracy or the rule of the many which before was one must now be divided 
 
 y soc on what principle of division 
 
 str on the same principle as before although the name is now 
 discovered to have a twofold the distinction of ruling 
 with law or without applies to this as well as to the rest 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str the division made no difference when we were looking for the 
 perfect state as we showed before but now that this has been 
 separated off and as we said the others alone are left for us 
 the principle of law and the absence of law will bisect them all 
 
 y soc that would seem follow from what has been said 
 
 str then monarchy when bound by good prescriptions or 
 laws is the best of all the six and when lawless is the most bitter and 
 oppressive to the subject 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the government of the few which is intermediate 
 between that of the one and many is also intermediate in good and evil but the government of the many is in every respect weak and unable to do either any great good or any great evil when compared with the others because the offices are too minutely subdivided and too many hold them and this therefore is the worst of all lawful 
 governments and the best of all lawless ones if they are 
 all without the restraints of law democracy is the form in which to 
 live is best if they are well ordered then this is the last which you should choose as royalty the first form is the best with the 
 exception of the seventh for that excels them all and is among states what god is among men 
 
 y soc you are quite right and we should choose that above all 
 
 str the members of all these states with the exception of the 
 one which has knowledge may be set aside as being not statesmen but of the most monstrous idols and 
 themselves being the greatest imitators and magicians they are also the greatest of sophists 
 
 y soc the name of sophist after many windings in the argument 
 appears to have been most justly fixed upon the politicians as they 
 are termed 
 
 str and so our satyric drama has been played out and the troop 
 of centaurs and satyrs however unwilling to leave the stage have 
 at last been separated from the political science 
 
 y soc so i perceive 
 
 str there remain however natures still more troublesome 
 because they are more nearly akin to the king and more difficult to 
 discern the examination of them may be compared to the process of 
 refining gold 
 
 y soc what is your meaning 
 
 str the workmen begin by sifting away the earth and stones and 
 the like there remain in a confused mass the valuable clements akin 
 to gold which can only be separated by silver 
 and other precious metals these are at last refined away by the use of tests until the gold is left quite pure 
 
 y soc yes that is the way in which these things are said to be 
 done 
 
 str in like manner all alien and uncongenial matter has been 
 separated from political science and what is precious and of a 
 kindred nature has been left there remain the nobler arts of the 
 general and the judge and the higher sort of oratory which 
 is an ally of the royal art and persuades men to do justice and assists in guiding the helm of can we best clear away all these 
 leaving him whom we seek alone and unalloyed 
 
 y soc that is obviously what has in some way to be attempted 
 
 str if the attempt is all that is wanting he shall certainly be 
 brought to light and i think that the illustration of music may 
 assist in exhibiting him please to answer me a question 
 
 y soc what question 
 
 str there is such a thing as learning music or handicraft arts in 
 general 
 
 y soc there is 
 
 str and is there any higher art or science having power to 
 decide which of these arts are and are not to be do 
 you say 
 
 y soc i should answer that there is 
 
 str and do we acknowledge this science to be different from the 
 others 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and ought the other sciences to be superior to this or no 
 single science to any other or ought this science to be the 
 overseer and governor of all the others 
 
 y soc the latter 
 
 str you mean to say that the science which judges whether we 
 ought to learn or not must be superior to the science which is 
 learned or which teaches 
 
 y soc far superior 
 
 str and the science which determines whether we ought to persuade 
 or not must be superior to the science which is able to persuade 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str very good and to what science do we assign the power of 
 persuading a multitude by a pleasing tale and not by teaching 
 
 y soc that power i think must clearly be assigned to rhetoric 
 
 str and to what science do we give the power of 
 determining whether we are to employ persuasion or force towards any one or to refrain altogether 
 
 y soc to that science which governs the arts of speech and 
 persuasion 
 
 str which if i am not mistaken will be politics 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str rhetoric seems to be quickly distinguished from 
 politics being a different species yet ministering to it 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but what would you think of another sort of power or science 
 
 y soc what science 
 
 str the science which has to do with military operations against 
 our that to be regarded as a science or not 
 
 y soc how can generalship and military tactics be regarded as 
 other than a science 
 
 str and is the art which is able and knows how to advise when we 
 are to go to war or to make peace the same as this or different 
 
 y soc if we are to be consistent we must say different 
 
 str and we must also suppose that this rules the other if we are 
 not to give up our former notion 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and considering how great and terrible the whole art of war 
 is can we imagine any which is superior to it but the truly royal 
 
 y soc no other 
 
 str the art of the general is only ministerial and therefore not 
 political 
 
 y soc exactly 
 
 str once more let us consider the nature of the righteous judge 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str does he do anything but decide the dealings of men with one 
 another to be just or unjust in accordance with the standard which 
 he receives from the king and his own peculiar 
 virtue only in this that he is not perverted by gifts or fears or 
 pity or by any sort of favour or enmity into deciding the suits of 
 men with one another contrary to the appointment of the legislator 
 
 y soc no his office is such as you describe 
 
 str then the inference is that the power of the judge is 
 not only the power of a guardian of the law which ministers to the royal power 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the review of all these sciences shows that none of them is 
 political or royal for the truly royal ought not itself to act but 
 to rule over those who are able to act the king ought to 
 know what is and what is not a fitting opportunity for taking the initiative in matters of the greatest importance whilst others should execute his orders 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and therefore the arts which we have described as they 
 have no authority over themselves or one another but are 
 each of them concerned with some special action of their own have as they ought to have special names corresponding to their several actions 
 y soc i agree 
 
 str and the science which is over them all and has charge of the 
 laws and of all matters affecting the state and truly weaves them 
 all into one if we would describe under a name characteristic of 
 their common nature most truly we may call politics 
 
 y soc exactly so 
 
 str then now that we have discovered the various classes in a 
 state shall i analyse politics after the pattern which weaving 
 supplied 
 
 y soc i greatly wish that you would 
 
 str then i must describe the nature of the royal web and show 
 how the various threads are woven into one piece 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str a task has to be accomplished which although difficult 
 appears to be necessary 
 
 y soc certainly the attempt must be made 
 
 str to assume that one part of virtue differs in kind 
 from a position easily assailable by contentious disputants who appeal to popular opinion 
 
 y soc i do not understand 
 
 str let me put the matter in another way i suppose that you 
 would consider courage to be a part of virtue 
 
 y soc certainly i should 
 
 str and you would think temperance to be different from courage 
 and likewise to be a part of virtue 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str i shall venture to put forward a strange theory about them 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str that they are two principles which thoroughly hate one 
 another and are antagonistic throughout a great part of nature 
 
 y soc how singular 
 
 str yes all the parts of virtue are commonly said to be 
 friendly to one another 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str then let us carefully investigate whether this is universally 
 true or whether there are not parts of virtue which are at war with 
 their kindred in some respect 
 
 y soc tell me how we shall consider that question 
 
 str we must extend our enquiry to all those things which we 
 consider beautiful and at the same time place in two 
 opposite classes 
 
 y soc explain what are they 
 
 str acuteness and quickness whether in body or soul or in the 
 movement of sound and the imitations of them which painting 
 and music 
 supply you must have praised yourself before now or been present 
 when others praised them 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and do you remember the terms in which they are praised 
 
 y soc i do not 
 
 str i wonder whether i can explain to you in words the thought 
 which is passing in my mind 
 
 y soc why not 
 
 str you fancy that this is all so easy well let us 
 consider these notions with reference to the opposite classes of action under which they fall when we praise quickness and energy and acuteness whether of mind or body or sound we express our praise of the quality which we admire by one word and that one word is manliness or courage 
 
 y soc how 
 
 str we speak of an action as energetic and brave quick and 
 manly and vigorous too and when we apply the name of which i speak as the common attribute of all these natures we certainly praise 
 them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and do we not often praise the quiet strain of action also 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str and do we not then say the opposite of what we said of the 
 other 
 
 y soc how do you mean 
 
 str we exclaim how calm how temperate in admiration of the slow 
 and quiet working of the intellect and of steadiness and gentleness 
 in action of smoothness and depth of voice and of all rhythmical 
 movement and of music in general when these have a proper 
 solemnity of all such actions we predicate not courage but a name 
 indicative of order 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str but when on the other hand either of these is out of place 
 the names of either are changed into terms of censure 
 
 y soc how so 
 
 str too great sharpness or quickness or hardness is 
 termed violence or madness too great slowness or gentleness is called cowardice or sluggishness and we may observe that for the most part these qualities and the temperance and manliness of the opposite characters are arrayed as enemies on opposite sides and do not mingle with one another in their respective actions and if we 
 pursue the enquiry we shall find that men who have these different 
 qualities of mind differ from one another 
 
 y soc in what respect 
 
 str in respect of all the qualities which i mentioned and very 
 likely of many others according to their respective affinities to 
 either class of actions they distribute praise and 
 to the actions which are akin to their own blame to those of the opposite out of this many quarrels and occasions of quarrel arise among them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the difference between the two classes is often a trivial 
 concern but in a state and when affecting really important 
 matters becomes of all disorders the most hateful 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str to nothing short of the whole regulation of human 
 life for the orderly class are always ready to lead a peaceful life quietly doing their own business this is their manner of behaving with all men at home and they are equally ready to find some way of keeping the peace with foreign states and on account of this fondness of theirs for peace which is often out of season where their influence prevails they become by degrees unwarlike and bring up their young men to be like themselves they are at the mercy of their enemies whence in a few years they and their children and the whole 
 city often pass imperceptibly from the condition of freemen into that of slaves 
 y soc what a cruel fate 
 
 str and now think of what happens with the more 
 courageous natures are they not always inciting their country to go to war owing to their excessive love of the military life they raise up enemies against themselves many and mighty and either utterly ruin their native land or enslave and subject it to its foes 
 
 y soc that again is true 
 
 str must we not admit then that where these two classes exist 
 they always feel the greatest antipathy and antagonism towards one 
 another 
 
 y soc we cannot deny it 
 
 str and returning to the enquiry with which we began have we not 
 found that considerable portions of virtue are at variance with one 
 another and give rise to a similar opposition in the characters who 
 are endowed with them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str let us consider a further point 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str i want to know whether any constructive art will make any 
 even the most trivial thing out of bad and good materials 
 indifferently if this can be helped does not all art rather reject 
 the bad as far as possible and accept the good and fit 
 materials and from these elements whether like or unlike gathering them all into one work out some nature or idea 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str then the true and natural art of statesmanship will 
 never allow any state to be formed by a combination of good and bad men if this can be avoided but will begin by testing human natures in play and after testing them will entrust them to proper teachers who are the ministers of her will herself give orders and maintain authority just as the art of weaving continually gives orders and maintains authority over the carders and all the others who prepare the material for the work commanding the subsidiary arts to execute the works which she deems necessary for making the web 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str in like manner the royal science appears to me to be the 
 mistress of all lawful educators and instructors and having this 
 queenly power will not permit them to train men in what will 
 produce characters unsuited to the political constitution which she 
 desires to create but only in what will produce such as are 
 suitable those which have no share of manliness and temperance or any other virtuous inclination and from the necessity of an evil nature are violently carried away to godlessness and insolence and 
 injustice she gets rid of by death and exile and punishes them with the greatest of disgraces 
 
 y soc that is commonly said 
 
 str but those who are wallowing in ignorance and baseness she 
 bows under the yoke of slavery 
 
 y soc quite right 
 
 str the rest of the citizens out of whom if they have 
 education something noble may be made and who are capable of being united by the statesman the kingly art blends and weaves together taking on the one hand those whose natures tend rather to courage which is the stronger element and may be regarded as the warp and on the other hand those which incline to order and gentleness and which are represented in the figure as spun thick and soft after the manner of the which are naturally opposed she seeks to bind and weave together in the following manner 
 
 y soc in what manner 
 
 str first of all she takes the eternal element of the soul and 
 binds it with a divine cord to which it is akin and then the 
 animal nature and binds that with human cords 
 
 y soc i do not understand what you mean 
 
 str the meaning is that the opinion about the honourable and the 
 just and good and their opposites which is true and confirmed by 
 reason is a divine principle and when implanted in the soul is 
 implanted as i maintain in a nature of heavenly birth 
 
 y soc yes what else should it be 
 
 str only the statesman and the good legislator having the 
 inspiration of the royal muse can implant this opinion and he 
 only in the rightly educated whom we were just now describing 
 
 y soc likely enough 
 
 str but him who cannot we will not designate by any of the names 
 which are the subject of the present which are the subject of the 
 present enquiry 
 
 y soc very right 
 
 str the courageous soul when attaining this truth becomes 
 civilized and rendered more capable of partaking of 
 justice but when not partaking is inclined to brutality is not that true 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and again the peaceful and orderly nature if sharing in these 
 opinions becomes temperate and wise as far as this may be in a 
 state but if not deservedly obtains the ignominious name of 
 silliness 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str can we say that such a connection as this will lastingly 
 unite the evil with one another or with the good or that any 
 science would seriously think of using a bond of this kind to join 
 such materials 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str but in those who were originally of a noble nature and who 
 have been nurtured in noble ways and in those only may we not say 
 that union is implanted by law and that this is the medicine which 
 art prescribes for them and of all the bonds which unite the 
 dissimilar and contrary parts of virtue is not this as i was 
 saying the divinest 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str where this divine bond exists there is no difficulty in 
 imagining or when you have imagined in creating the other bonds 
 which are human only 
 
 y soc how is that and what bonds do you mean 
 
 str rights of intermarriage and ties which are formed between 
 states by giving and taking children in marriage or between 
 individuals by private betrothals and espousals for most persons 
 form marriage connection without due regard to what is best for the 
 procreation of children 
 
 y soc in what way 
 
 str they seek after wealth and power which in matrimony are 
 objects not of a serious censure 
 
 y soc there is no need to consider them at all 
 
 str more reason to consider the practice of 
 those who make family their chief aim and to indicate their error 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str they act on no true principle at all they seek their ease 
 and receive with open arms those are like themselves and hate those 
 who are unlike them being too much influenced by feelings 
 of dislike 
 
 y soc how so 
 
 str the quiet orderly class seek for natures like their 
 own and as far as they can they marry and give in marriage exclusively in this class and the courageous do the same they seek natures like their own whereas they should both do precisely the opposite 
 
 y soc how and why is that 
 
 str because courage when untempered by the gentler nature during 
 many generations may at first bloom and strengthen but at last 
 bursts forth into downright madness 
 
 y soc like enough 
 
 str and then again the soul which is of 
 modesty and has no element of courage in many successive generations is apt to grow too indolent and at last to become utterly paralyzed and useless 
 
 y soc that again is quite likely 
 
 str it was of these bonds i said that there would be no 
 difficulty in creating them if only both classes originally held 
 the same opinion about the honourable and in 
 this single work the whole process of royal weaving is to allow temperate natures to be separated from the brave but to weave them together like the warp and the woof by common sentiments and honours and reputation and by the giving of pledges to one another and out of them forming one smooth and even web to entrust to them the offices of state 
 y soc how do you mean 
 str where one officer only is needed you must choose a ruler who has both these many you must mingle some of each 
 for the temperate ruler is very careful and just and safe but is 
 wanting in thoroughness and go 
 
 y soc certainly that is very true 
 
 str the character of the courageous on the other hand 
 falls short of the former in justice and caution but has the power of 
 action in a remarkable degree and where either of these two qualities 
 is wanting there cities cannot altogether prosper either in their public or private life 
 
 y soc certainly they cannot 
 
 str this then we declare to be the completion of the web of 
 political action which is created by a direct intertexture of the 
 brave and temperate natures whenever the royal science has drawn 
 the two minds into communion with one another by unanimity and 
 friendship and having perfected the noblest and best of all the 
 webs which political life admits and enfolding therein all other 
 inhabitants of cities whether slaves or freemen binds them in one 
 fabric and governs and presides over them and in so far as to be 
 happy is vouchsafed to a city in no particular fails to secure 
 their happiness 
 
 y soc your picture stranger of the king and statesman no less 
 than of the sophist is quite perfect

 book 
 
 str carding and spinning threads and all the parts of the process 
 which are concerned with the actual manufacture of a woollen garment form a single art which is one of thow universally art of working in wool 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str of working in wool again there are two divisions and both 
 these are parts of two arts at once 
 
 y soc how is that 
 
 str carding and one half of the use of the comb and the other 
 processes of which separate the composite may 
 be classed together as belonging both to the art of woolworking and also to one of the two great arts which are of universal art of composition and the art of division 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str to the latter belong carding and the other processes 
 of which i was just now speaking the art of discernment or division in wool and yarn which is effected in one manner with the comb and in another with the hands is variously described under all the names which i just now mentioned 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str again let us take some process of woolworking which is also 
 a portion of the art of composition and dismissing the elements of 
 division which we found there make two halves one on the principle 
 of composition and the other on the principle of division 
 
 y soc let that be done 
 
 str and once more socrates we must divide the part which 
 belongs at once both to woolworking and composition if we 
 are ever to discover satisfactorily the aforesaid art of weaving 
 
 y soc we must 
 
 str yes certainly and let us call one part of the art the art 
 of twisting threads the other the art of combining them 
 
 y soc do i understand you in speaking of twisting to be 
 referring to manufacture of the warp 
 
 str yes and of the woof too how if not by twisting is the 
 woof made 
 
 y soc there is no other way 
 
 str then suppose that you define the warp and the woof 
 for i think that the definition will be of use to you 
 
 y soc how shall i define them 
 
 str as thus a piece of carded wool which is drawn out lengthwise 
 and is said to be pulled out 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and the wool thus prepared when twisted by the spindle and 
 made into a firm thread is called the warp and the art which 
 regulates these operations the art of spinning the warp 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the threads which are more loosely spun having a 
 softness proportioned to the intertexture of the warp and to the 
 degree of force used in dressing the threads which are 
 thus spun are called the woof and the art which is set over them 
 may be called the art of spinning the woof 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and now there can be no mistake about the nature of the 
 part of weaving which we have undertaken to define for when 
 that part of the art of composition which is employed in the working of wool forms a web by the regular intertexture of warp and woof the entire woven substance is called by us a woollen garment and the art which presides over this is the art of weaving 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str but why did we not say at once that weaving is the art of 
 entwining warp and woof instead of making a long and 
 useless circuit 
 
 y soc i thought stranger that there was nothing useless in 
 what was said 
 
 str very likely but you may not always think so my sweet 
 friend and in case any feeling of dissatisfaction should hereafter 
 arise in your mind as it very well may let me lay down a principle 
 which will apply to arguments in general 
 
 y soc proceed 
 
 str let us begin by considering the whole nature of excess and 
 defect and then we shall have a rational ground on which we may 
 praise or blame too much length or too much shortness in discussions of this kind 
 
 y soc let us do so 
 
 str the points on which i think that we ought to dwell are the 
 following 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str length and shortness excess and defect with all of 
 these the art of measurement is conversant 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and the art of measurement has to be divided into two parts 
 with a view to our present purpose 
 
 y soc where would you make the division 
 
 str as thus i would make two parts one having regard to the 
 relativity of greatness and smallness to each other and there is 
 another without which the existence of production would be 
 impossible 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str do you not think that it is only natural for the greater to 
 be called greater with reference to the less alone and the less 
 reference to the greater alone 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str well but is there not also something exceeding and 
 exceeded by the principle of the mean both in speech and action and is not this a reality and the chief mark of difference between good and bad men 
 
 y soc plainly 
 
 str then we must suppose that the great and small exist and are 
 discerned in both these ways and not as we were saying before 
 only relatively to one another but there must also be another 
 comparison of them with the mean or ideal standard would you like 
 to hear the reason why 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str if we assume the greater to exist only in relation to 
 the less there will never be any comparison of either with the mean 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and would not this doctrine be the ruin of all the arts and 
 their creations would not the art of the statesman and the 
 aforesaid art of weaving disappear for all these arts are on the 
 watch against excess and defect not as unrealities but as real 
 evils which occasion a difficulty in action and the excellence of 
 beauty of every work of art is due to this observance of measure 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str but if the science of the statesman disappears the search 
 for the royal science will be impossible 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str well then as in the case of the sophist we extorted the 
 inference that had an existence because here was the 
 point at which the argument eluded our grasp so in this we must 
 endeavour to show that the greater and less are not only to be 
 measured with one another but also have to do with the production 
 of the mean for if this is not admitted neither a statesman nor 
 any other man of action can be an undisputed master of his science 
 
 y soc yes we must certainly do again what we did then 
 
 str but this socrates is a greater work than the other of 
 which we only too well remember the length i think however that 
 we may fairly assume something of this sort 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str that we shall some day require this notion of a mean with a 
 view to the demonstration of absolute truth meanwhile the argument 
 that the very existence of the arts must be held to depend on the 
 possibility of measuring more or less not only with one another 
 but also with a view to the attainment of the mean seems to afford 
 a grand support and satisfactory proof of the doctrine which we are 
 maintaining for if there are arts there is a standard of measure 
 and if there is a standard of measure there are arts but if either 
 is wanting there is neither 
 
 y soc true and what is the next step 
 
 str the next step clearly is to divide the art of measurement 
 into two parts all we have said already and to place in 
 the one part all the arts which measure number length depth breadth swiftness with their opposites and to have another part in which they are measured with the mean and the fit and the opportune and the due and with all those words in short which denote a mean or standard removed from the extremes 
 
 y soc here are two vast divisions embracing two very different 
 spheres 
 
 str there are many accomplished men socrates who say believing 
 themselves to speak wisely that the art of measurement is 
 universal and has to do with all things and this means what we are 
 now saying for all things which come within the province of art do 
 certainly in some sense partake of measure but these 
 persons because they are not accustomed to distinguish classes according to real forms jumble together two widely different things relation to one another and to a standard under the idea that they are the same and also fall into the converse error of dividing other things not according to their real parts whereas the right way is if a man 
 has first seen the unity of things to go on with the enquiry and 
 not desist until he has found all the differences contained in it 
 which form distinct classes nor again should he be able to rest 
 contented with the manifold diversities which are seen in a 
 multitude of things until he has comprehended all of them that have 
 any affinity within the bounds of one similarity and embraced them 
 within the reality of a single kind but we have said enough on this 
 head and also of excess and defect we have only to bear in 
 mind that two divisions of the art of measurement have been discovered which are concerned with them and not forget what they are 
 y soc we will not forget 
 
 str and now that this discussion is completed let us go on to 
 consider another question which concerns not this argument only but 
 the conduct of such arguments in general 
 
 y soc what is this new question 
 
 str take the case of a child who is engaged in learning his 
 letters when he is asked what letters make up a word should we say 
 that the question is intended to improve his grammatical knowledge 
 of that particular word or of all words 
 
 y soc clearly in order that he may have a better 
 knowledge of all words 
 
 str and is our enquiry about the statesman intended only 
 to improve our knowledge of politics or our power of reasoning generally 
 
 y soc clearly as in the former example the purpose is general 
 str still less would any rational man seek to analyse the 
 notion of weaving for its own sake but people seem to forget that some things have sensible images which are readily known and can be easily pointed out when any one desires to answer an enquirer without any trouble or argument whereas the greatest and highest truths have no outward image of themselves visible to man which he who wishes to satisfy the soul of the enquirer can adapt to the eye of sense and therefore we ought to train ourselves to give and accept a rational account of them for immaterial things which are the noblest and greatest are shown only in thought and idea and in no 
 other way and all that we are now saying is said for the sake of them moreover there is always less difficulty in fixing the mind on small matters than on great 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str let us call to mind the bearing of all this 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str i wanted to get rid of any impression of tediousness which we 
 may have experienced in the discussion about weaving and 
 the reversal of the universe and in the discussion concerning the sophist and the being of i know that they were felt to be too long and i reproached myself with this fearing that they might be not only tedious but irrelevant and all that i have now said is only 
 designed to prevent the recurrence of any such disagreeables for the 
 future 
 
 y soc very good will you proceed 
 
 str then i would like to observe that you and i remembering what 
 has been said should praise or blame the length or shortness of 
 discussions not by comparing them with one another but with what 
 is fitting having regard to the part of measurement which as we 
 said was to be borne in mind 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and yet not everything is to be judged even with a view to 
 what is fitting for we should only want such a length as is 
 suited to give pleasure if at all as a secondary matter and reason tells us that we should be contented to make the ease or rapidity of an enquiry not our first but our second object the first and highest 
 of all being to assert the great method of division according to 
 the discourse be shorter or longer is not to the 
 point no offence should be taken at length but the longer and 
 shorter are to be employed indifferently according as either of 
 them is better calculated to sharpen the wits of the auditors 
 reason would also say to him who censures the length of discourses 
 on such occasions and cannot away with their circumlocution that he 
 should not be in such a hurry to have done with them when 
 he can only complain that they are tedious but he should prove that if they had been shorter they would have made those who took part in them better dialecticians and more capable of expressing the truth of things about any other praise and blame he need not trouble should pretend not to hear them but we have had enough of this as you will probably agree with me in thinking let us return to our 
 statesman and apply to his case the aforesaid example of weaving 
 
 y soc very us do as you say 
 
 str the art of the king has been separated from the similar arts of 
 shepherds and indeed from all those which have to do with herds 
 at all there still remain however of the causal and 
 arts those which are immediately concerned with states and 
 which must first be distinguished from one another 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str you know that these arts cannot easily be divided into two 
 halves the reason will be very evident as we proceed 
 
 y soc then we had better do so 
 
 str we must carve them like a victim into members or limbs since 
 we cannot bisect them for we certainly should divide everything 
 into as few parts as possible 
 
 y soc what is to be done in this case 
 
 str what we did in the example of those arts which 
 furnish the tools were regarded by us as 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str so now and with still more reason all arts which make any 
 implement in a state whether great or small may be 
 regarded by us as for without them neither state nor statesmanship would be possible and yet we are not inclined to say that any of them is a product of the kingly art 
 
 y soc no indeed 
 
 str the task of separating this class from others is not an easy 
 one for there is plausibility in saying that anything in 
 the world is the instrument of doing something but there is another dass of possessions in a city of which i have a word to say 
 
 y soc what class do you mean 
 
 str a class which may be described as not having this power that 
 is to say not like an instrument framed for production 
 but designed for the preservation of that which is produced 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str to the class of vessels as they are comprehensively termed 
 which are constructed for the preservation of things moist 
 and dry of things prepared in the fire or out of the fire this is a very large class and has if i am not mistaken literally nothing to 
 do with the royal art of which we are in search 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str there is also a third class of possessions to be noted 
 different from these and very extensive moving or resting on land 
 or water honourable and also dishonourable the whole of this class 
 has one name because it is intended to be sat upon being always a 
 seat for something 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str a vehicle which is certainly not the work of the statesman 
 but of the carpenter potter and coppersmith 
 
 y soc i understand 
 
 str and is there not a fourth class which is again different and 
 in which most of the things formerly mentioned are 
 kind of dress most sorts of arms walls and enclosures whether of 
 earth or stone and ten thousand other thing all of which being 
 made for the sake of defence may be truly called defences and are 
 for the most part to be regarded as the work of the builder or of 
 the weaver rather than of the statesman 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str shall we add a fifth class of ornamentation and drawing and 
 of the imitations produced by drawing and music which are designed for amusement only and may be fairly comprehended under one name 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str plaything is the name 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str that one name may be fitly predicated of all of them for 
 none of these things have a serious is their sole 
 aim 
 
 y soc that again i understand 
 
 str then there is a class which provides materials for all these 
 out of which and in which the arts already mentioned fabricate their 
 manifold class i say which is the creation and 
 offspring of many other arts may i not rank sixth 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i am referring to gold silver and other metals and all 
 that and shearing of every sort provides for the art of 
 carpentry and plaiting and there is the process of barking and 
 stripping the cuticle of plants and the art which strips 
 off the skins of animals and other similar arts which manufacture 
 corks and papyri and cords and provide for the manufacture of 
 composite species out of simple whole class may be termed 
 the primitive and simple possession of man and with this the kingly 
 science has no concern at all 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the provision of food and of all other things which mingle 
 their particles with the particles of the human body and minister 
 to the body will form a seventh class which may be called by the 
 general term of nourishment unless you have any better name 
 to however appertains rather to the husbandman 
 huntsman trainer doctor cook and is not to be assigned to the art 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str these seven classes include nearly every description of 
 property with the exception of tame animals was 
 the original material which ought to have been placed first next 
 come instruments vessels vehicles defences playthings 
 nourishment small things which may under one 
 of for example coins seals and stamps are omitted for they have not in them the character of any larger kind which includes 
 them but some of them may with a little forcing be placed among ornaments and others may be made to harmonize with the class of implements the art of herding which has been already divided into parts will include all property in tame animals except slaves 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str the class of slaves and ministers only remains and i suspect 
 that in this the real aspirants for the throne who are the rivals 
 of the king in the formation of the political web will be 
 discovered just as spinners carders and the rest of them were the rivals of the weaver all the others who were termed have been got rid of among the occupations already mentioned and 
 separated from the royal and political science 
 
 y soc i agree 
 
 str let us go a little nearer in order that we may be 
 more certain of the complexion of this remaining class 
 
 y soc let us do so 
 
 str we shall find from our present point of view that the 
 greatest servants are in a case and condition which is the reverse 
 of what we anticipated 
 
 y soc who are they 
 
 str those who have been purchased and have so become 
 possessions these are unmistakably slaves and certainly do 
 not claim royal science 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str again freemen who of their own accord become the servants of 
 the other classes in a state and who exchange and equalise the 
 products of husbandry and the other arts some sitting in the 
 others going from city to city by land or sea and 
 giving money in exchange for money or for other 
 the merchant the the retailer will not 
 put in any claim to statecraft or politics 
 
 y soc no unless indeed to the politics of commerce 
 
 str but surely men whom we see acting as hirelings and serfs and 
 too happy to turn their hand to anything will not profess 
 to share in royal science 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str but what would you say of some other serviceable officials 
 
 y soc who are they and what services do they perform 
 
 str there are heralds and scribes perfected by practice and 
 divers others who have great skill in various sorts of business 
 connected with the government of shall we call them 
 
 y soc they are the officials and servants of the rulers as you 
 just now called them but not themselves rulers 
 
 str there may be something strange in any servant pretending to 
 be a ruler and yet i do not think that i could have been dreaming 
 when i imagined that the principal claimants to political science 
 would be found somewhere in this neighbourhood 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str well let us draw nearer and try the claims of some who have 
 not yet been tested in the first place there are diviners who 
 have a portion of servile or ministerial science and are thought to 
 be the interpreters of the gods to men 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str there is also the priestly class who as the law declares 
 know how to give the gods gifts from men in the form of sacrifices 
 which are acceptable to them and to ask on our behalf blessings in 
 return from them now both these are branches of the servile or 
 ministerial art 
 
 y soc yes clearly 
 
 str and here i think that we seem to be getting on the 
 right track for the priest and the diviner are swollen with pride and 
 prerogative and they create an awful impression of themselves by the magnitude of their enterprises in egypt the king himself is not allowed to reign unless he have priestly powers and if he should be of another class and has thrust himself in he must get enrolled in the 
 priesthood in many parts of hellas the duty of offering the most 
 solemn propitiatory sacrifices is assigned to the highest 
 magistracies and here at athens the most solemn and 
 national of the ancient sacrifices are supposed to be celebrated by him who has been chosen by lot to be the king archon 
 
 y soc precisely 
 
 str but who are these other kings and priests elected by lot who 
 now come into view followed by their retainers and a vast throng as 
 the former class disappears and the scene changes 
 
 y soc whom can you mean 
 
 str they are a strange crew 
 
 y soc why strange 
 
 str a minute ago i thought that they were animals of every tribe 
 for many of them are like lions and centaurs and many more like 
 satyrs and such weak and shifty shapes quickly 
 changing into one forms and natures and now socrates i 
 begin to see who they are 
 
 y soc who are they you seem to be gazing on some strange vision 
 
 str yes every one looks strange when you do not know 
 him and just now i myself fell into this first sight coming suddenly upon him i did not recognize the politician and his troop 
 
 y soc who is he 
 
 str the chief of sophists and most accomplished of wizards who 
 must at any cost be separated from the true king or statesman if we 
 are ever to see daylight in the present enquiry 
 
 y soc that is a hope not lightly to be renounced 
 
 str never if i can help it and first let me ask you a 
 question 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str is not monarchy a recognized form of government 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and after monarchy next in order comes the government of 
 the few 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str is not the third form of government the rule of the 
 multitude which is called by the name of democracy 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and do not these three expand in a manner into five 
 producing out of themselves two other names y soc what are they 
 
 y soc what are they 
 
 str there is a criterion of voluntary and involuntary poverty 
 and riches law and the absence of law which men apply 
 to them the two first they subdivide accordingly and ascribe to 
 monarchy two forms and two corresponding names royalty and tyranny 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and the government of the few they distinguish by the names 
 of aristocracy and oligarchy 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str democracy alone whether rigidly observing the laws 
 or not and whether the multitude rule over the men of property with 
 their consent or against their consent always in ordinary language has the same name 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but do you suppose that any form of government which 
 is defined by these characteristics of the one the few or the many of 
 poverty or wealth of voluntary or compulsory submission of written 
 law or the absence of law can be a right one 
 
 y soc why not 
 
 str reflect and follow me 
 
 y soc in what direction 
 
 str shall we abide by what we said at first or shall we retract 
 our words 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str if i am not mistaken we said that royal power was a science 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and a science of a peculiar kind which was selected 
 out of the rest as having a character which is at once judicial and 
 authoritative 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and there was one kind of authority over lifeless things and 
 another other living animals and so we proceeded in the 
 division step by step up to this point not losing the idea of science but unable as yet to determine the nature of the particular science 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str hence we are led to observe that the distinguishing principle 
 of the state cannot be the few or many the voluntary or 
 involuntary poverty or riches but some notion of science must 
 enter into it if we are to be consistent with what has preceded 
 
 y soc and we must be consistent 
 
 str well then in which of these various forms of states may the 
 science of government which is among the greatest of all 
 sciences and most difficult to acquire be supposed to reside that we must discover and then we shall see who are the false politicians who pretend to be politicians but are not although they persuade many and shall separate them from the wise king 
 
 y soc that as the argument has already intimated will be our 
 duty 
 str do you think that the multitude in a state can attain 
 politicals science 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str but perhaps in a city of a thousand men there would be a 
 hundred or say fifty who could 
 
 y soc in that case political science would certainly be the 
 easiest of all sciences there could not be found in a city of that 
 number as many really if judged by the 
 standard of the rest of hellas and there would certainly not be as 
 many kings for kings we may truly call those who possess royal 
 science whether they rule or not as was shown in the previous 
 argument 
 
 str thank you for reminding me and the consequence is that any 
 true form of government can only be supposed to be the government of one two or at any rate of a few 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and these whether they rule with the will or 
 against the will of their subjects with written laws or without written laws and whether they are poor or rich and whatever be the nature of their rule must be supposed according to our present view to 
 rule on some scientific principle just as the physician whether he cures us against our will or with our will and whatever be his mode of 
 burning or the infliction of some other 
 he practises out of a book or not out of a book and 
 whether he be rich or poor whether he purges or reduces in 
 some other way or even fattens his patients is a physician all the same so long as he exercises authority over them according to rules 
 of art if he only does them good and heals and saves them and this we lay down to be the only proper test of the art of medicine or of any other art of command 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str then that can be the only true form of government in which 
 the governors are really found to possess science and are not mere 
 pretenders whether they rule according to law or without law 
 or unwilling subjects and are rich or poor 
 of these things can with any propriety be included 
 in the notion of the ruler 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and whether with a view to the public good they purge 
 the state by killing some or exiling some whether they reduce the size of the body corporate by sending out from the hive swarms of citizens or by introducing persons from without increase it while they act according to the rules of wisdom and justice and use their 
 power with a view to the general security and improvement the city over which they rule and which has these characteristics may be described as the only true state all other governments are not genuine or real but only imitations of this and some of them are better and some of them are worse the better are said to be well governed but they are mere imitations like the others 
 
 y soc i agree stranger in the greater part of what you say 
 but as to their ruling without expression has a harsh sound 
 
 str you have been too quick for me socrates i was just going to 
 ask you whether you objected to any of my statements and now i see that we shall have to consider this notion of there being good 
 government without laws 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str there can be no doubt that legislation is in a manner the 
 business of a king and yet the best thing of all is not that the 
 law should rule but that a man should rule supposing him to have 
 wisdom and royal power do you see why this is 
 
 y soc why 
 
 str because the law does not perfectly comprehend what is noblest 
 and most just for all and therefore cannot enforce what is best the 
 differences of men and actions and the endless irregular 
 movements of human things do not admit of any universal and simple rule and no art whatsoever can lay down a rule which will last for all time 
 
 y soc of course not 
 
 str but the law is always striving to make an obstinate 
 and ignorant tyrant who will not allow anything to be done contrary 
 to his appointment or any question to be even in sudden 
 changes of circumstances when something happens to be better than 
 what he commanded for some one 
 
 y soc certainly the law treats us all precisely in the manner 
 which you describe 
 
 str a perfectly simple principle can never be applied to 
 a state of things which is the reverse of simple 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str then if the law is not the perfection of right why are we 
 compelled to make laws at all the reason of this has next to be 
 investigated 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str let me ask whether you have not meetings for gymnastic 
 contests in your city such as there are in other cities at 
 which men compete in running wrestling and the like 
 
 y soc yes they are very common among us 
 
 str and what are the rules which are enforced on their pupils by 
 professional trainers or by others having similar authority can you 
 remember 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str the do not issue minute rules for 
 individuals or give every individual what is exactly suited to his constitution they think that they ought to go more roughly to work and to prescribe generally the regimen which will benefit the majority 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and therefore they assign equal amounts of exercise to them 
 all they send them forth together and let them rest together from 
 their running wrestling or whatever the form of bodily exercise 
 may be 
 
 y so true 
 
 str and now observe that the legislator who has to 
 preside over the herd and to enforce justice in their dealings with one another will not be able in enacting for the general good to 
 provide exactly what is suitable for each particular case 
 
 y soc he cannot be expected to do so 
 
 str he will lay down laws in a general form for the majority 
 roughly meeting the cases of individuals and some of them he will 
 deliver in writing and others will be unwritten and these last 
 will be traditional customs of the country 
 
 y soc he will be right 
 
 str yes quite right for how can he sit at every side all 
 through his life prescribing for him the exact particulars of his 
 duty who socrates would be equal to such a task no one who 
 really had the royal science if he had been able to do this would 
 have imposed upon himself the restriction of a written law 
 
 y soc so i should infer from what has now been said 
 
 str or rather my good friend from what is going to be said 
 
 y soc and what is that 
 
 str let us put to ourselves the case of a physician or trainer 
 who is about to go into a far country and is expecting to be a long 
 time away from his that his instructions 
 will not be remembered unless they are written down he will leave notes of them for the use of his pupils or patients 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but what would you say if he came back sooner than he had 
 intended and owing to an unexpected change of the winds or other 
 celestial influences something else happened to be better for 
 he not venture to suggest this new remedy although not 
 contemplated in his former prescription would he persist in 
 observing the original law neither himself giving any few 
 commandments nor the patient daring to do otherwise than was prescribed under the idea that this course only was healthy and medicinal all others noxious and heterodox viewed in the light of science and true art would not all such enactments be utterly ridiculous 
 
 y soc utterly 
 
 str and if he who gave laws written or unwritten 
 determining what was good or bad honourable or dishonourable just or unjust to the tribes of men who flock together in their several cities and are governed accordance with them if i say the wise legislator were suddenly to come again or another like to him is he to be prohibited from changing not this prohibition be in reality quite as ridiculous as the other 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str do you know a plausible saying of the common people 
 which is in point 
 
 y soc i do not recall what you mean at the moment 
 
 str they say that if any one knows how the ancient laws may be 
 improved he must first persuade his own state of the 
 improvement and then he may legislate but not otherwise 
 
 y soc and are they not right 
 
 str i dare say but supposing that he does use some 
 gentle violence for their good what is this violence to be called or rather 
 before you answer let me ask the same question in reference to our 
 previous instances 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str suppose that a skilful physician has a patient of 
 whatever sex or age whom he compels against his will to do something for his good which is contrary to the written rules what is this compulsion to be called would you ever dream of calling it a violation of the art or a breach of the laws of health nothing could be more unjust than for the patient to whom such violence is applied to charge the physician who practises the violence with wanting skill or aggravating his disease 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str in the political art error is not called disease but evil 
 or disgrace or injustice 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str and when the citizen contrary to law and custom is 
 compelled to do what is juster and better and nobler than he did 
 before the last and most absurd thing which he could say about such 
 violence is that he has incurred disgrace or evil or injustice at 
 the hands of those who compelled him 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and shall we say that the violence if exercised by a 
 rich just and if by a poor man unjust may not any man rich or poor with or without laws with the will of the citizens or against 
 the will of the citizens do what is for their interest is not this 
 the true principle of government according to which the 
 wise and good man will order the affairs of his subjects as the pilot by watching continually over the interests of the ship and of the 
 by laying down rules but by making his art a 
 the lives of his even and in the way may 
 there not be a true form of polity created by those who are able to 
 govern in a similar spirit and who show a strength of art which is 
 superior to the law nor can wise rulers ever err while they 
 observing the one great rule of distributing justice to the citizens 
 with intelligence and skill are able to preserve them and 
 as far as may be to make them better from being worse 
 
 y soc no one can deny what has been now said 
 
 str neither if you consider can any one deny the other 
 statement 
 
 y soc what was it 
 
 str we said that no great number of persons whoever they may be 
 can attain political knowledge or order a state wisely but that 
 the true government is to be found in a small body or in an 
 individual and that other states are but imitations of this as we 
 said a little while ago some for the better and some for the worse 
 
 y soc what do you mean i cannot have understood your previous 
 remark about imitations 
 
 str and yet the mere suggestion which i hastily threw out 
 is highly important even if we leave the question where it is and do not seek by the discussion of it to expose the error which prevails in 
 this matter 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str the idea which has to be grasped by us is not easy or 
 familiar but we may attempt to express it the government of which i have been speaking to be the only true model then the others must use the written laws of no other can they be saved they will have to do what is now generally approved although not the best thing in the world 
 
 y soc what is this 
 
 str no citizen should do anything contrary to the laws and any 
 infringement of them should be punished with death and the most 
 extreme penalties and this is very right and good when regarded as 
 the second best thing if you set aside the first of which 
 i was just now speaking shall i explain the nature of what call the 
 second best 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str i must again have recourse to my favourite images through 
 them and them alone can i describe kings and rulers 
 
 y soc what images 
 
 str the noble pilot and the wise physician who is worth many 
 another the similitude of these let us endeavour to discover 
 some image of the king 
 
 y soc what sort of image 
 
 str well such as man will reflect that he suffers 
 strange things at the hands of both of them the physician saves 
 any whom he wishes to save and any whom he wishes to maltreat he 
 or burning them and at the same time 
 requiring thems to bring him patients which are a sort of tribute of which little or nothing is spent upon the sick man and the greater part is consumed by him and his domestics and the finale is that he receives money from the relations of the sick man or from some enemy of his and puts him out of the way and the pilots of ships are guilty of numberless evil deeds of the same kind they intentionally play false and leave you ashore when the hour of sailing arrives or they cause mishaps at sea and cast away their freight and are guilty of 
 other rogueries now suppose that we bearing all this in mind were 
 to determine after consideration that neither of these arts shall 
 any longer be allowed to exercise absolute control either 
 over freemen or over slaves but that we will summon an assembly either of all the people or of the rich only that anybody who likes whatever may be his calling or even if he have no calling may offer an opinion either about seamanship or about as to the manner in which physic or surgical instruments are to be applied to the patient or again about the vessels and the nautical implements 
 which are required in navigation and how to meet the 
 dangers of winds and waves which are incidental to the voyage how to behave when encountering pirates and what is to be done with the old fashioned galleys if they have to fight with others of a similar that whatever shall be decreed by the multitude on these 
 points upon the advice of persons skilled or unskilled shall be written down on triangular tablets and columns or enacted although unwritten to be national customs and that in all future time vessels shall be navigated and remedies administered to the patient after 
 this fashion 
 
 y soc what a strange notion 
 
 str suppose further that the pilots and physicians are appointed 
 annually either out of the rich or out of the whole people and that 
 they are elected by lot and that after their election they navigate 
 vessels and heal the sick according to the written rules 
 
 y soc worse and worse 
 
 str but hear what the year of office has 
 expired the pilot or physician has to come before a court of review in which the judges are either selected from the wealthy classes or chosen by lot out of the whole people and anybody who pleases may be their accuser and may lay to their charge that during the past year they have not navigated their vessels or healed their patients 
 according to the letter of the law and the ancient customs of their and if either of them is condemned some of the judges must fix what he is to suffer or pay 
 y soc he who is willing to take a command under such conditions 
 deserves to suffer any penalty 
 
 str yet once more we shall have to enact that if any one is 
 detected enquiring into piloting and navigation or into health and 
 the true nature of medicine or about the winds or other conditions 
 of the atmosphere contrary to the written rules and has any 
 ingenious notions about such matters he is not to be called a pilot 
 or physician but a cloudy prating on the ground 
 that he is a corrupter of the young who would persuade them to 
 follow the art of medicine or piloting in an unlawful manner and to 
 exercise an arbitrary rule over their patients or ships any one who 
 is qualified by law may inform against him and indict him in some 
 court and then if he is found to be persuading any whether young 
 or old to act contrary to the written law he is to be punished 
 with the utmost rigour for no one should presume to be 
 wiser than the laws and as touching healing and health and piloting and navigation the nature of them is known to all for anybody may 
 learn the written laws and the national customs if such were the mode 
 of procedure socrates about these sciences and about generalship 
 and any branch of hunting or about painting or imitation in 
 general or carpentry or any sort of handicraft or husbandry or 
 planting or if we were to see an art of rearing horses or tending 
 herds or divination or any ministerial service or or any science conversant with number whether simple or square or cube or comprising say if all these things were done in this way according to written regulations and not according to art what would be the result 
 
 y soc all the arts would utterly perish and could never be 
 recovered because enquiry would be unlawful and human 
 life which is bad enough already would then become utterly unendurable 
 
 str but what if while compelling all these operations to be 
 regulated by written law we were to appoint as the guardian of the 
 laws some one elected by a show of hands or by lot and he caring 
 nothing about the laws were to act contrary to them from motives of 
 interest or favour and without not this be a still 
 worse evil than the former 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str to go against the laws which are based upon long experience 
 and the wisdom of counsellors who have graciously 
 recommended them and persuaded the multitude to pass them would be a far greater and more ruinous error than any adherence to written law 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str therefore as there is a danger of this the next 
 best thing in legislating is not to allow either the individual or the multitude to break the law in any respect whatever 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the laws would be copies of the true particulars of action as 
 far as they admit of being written down from the lips of those who 
 have knowledge 
 
 y soc certainly they would 
 
 str and as we were saying he who has knowledge and is a true 
 statesman will do many things within his own sphere of action by 
 his art without regard to the laws when he is of opinion that 
 something other than that which he has written down and 
 enjoined to be observed during his absence would be better 
 
 y soc yes we said so 
 
 str and any individual or any number of men having fixed laws 
 in acting contrary to them with a view to something better 
 would only be acting as far as they are able like the true statesman 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str if they had no knowledge of what they were doing they would 
 imitate the truth and they would always imitate ill but if they 
 had knowledge the imitation would be the perfect truth and an 
 imitation no longer 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str and the principle that no great number of men are able to 
 acquire a knowledge of any art has been already admitted by us 
 
 y soc yes it has 
 
 str then the royal or political art if there be such an art 
 will never be attained either by the wealthy or by the other mob 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str then the nearest approach which these lower forms of 
 government can ever make to the true government of the one scientific ruler is to do nothing contrary to their own written laws and 
 national customs 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str when the rich imitate the true form such a government is 
 called aristocracy and when they are regardless of the laws 
 oligarchy 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str or again when an individual rules according to law in 
 imitation of him who knows we call him a king and if he rules 
 according to law we give him the same name whether he rules with 
 opinion or with knowledge 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str and when an individual truly possessing knowledge rules his 
 name will surely be the will be called a king and thus the 
 five names of governments as they are now reckoned become one 
 
 y soc that is true 
 
 str and when an individual ruler governs neither by law nor by 
 custom but following in the steps of the true man of 
 science pretends that he can only act for the best by violating the laws while in reality appetite and ignorance are the motives of the imitation may not such an one be called a tyrant 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and this we believe to be the origin of the tyrant and the 
 king of oligarchies and aristocracies and men 
 are offended at the one monarch and can never be made to 
 believe that any one can be worthy of such authority or is able and 
 willing in the spirit of virtue and knowledge to act justly and holily to all they fancy that he will be a despot who will wrong and harm and slay whom he pleases of us for if there could be such a despot as we 
 describe they would acknowledge that we ought to be too glad to 
 have him and that he alone would be the happy ruler of a true and 
 perfect state 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str but then as the state is not like a beehive and has no 
 natural head who is at once recognized to be the superior 
 both in body and in mind mankind are obliged to meet and make laws and endeavour to approach as nearly as they can to the true form of government 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and when the foundation of politics is in the letter only and 
 in custom and knowledge is divorced from action can we wonder 
 socrates at the miseries which there are and always will be in 
 states any other art built on such a foundation and thus 
 conducted would ruin all that it touched ought we not rather to 
 wonder at the natural strength of the political bond for states 
 have endured all this time out of mind and yet some of them still 
 remain and are not overthrown though many of them like 
 ships at sea founder from time to time and perish and have perished and will hire after perish through the badness of their pilots and crews who have the worst sort of ignorance of the highest mean to say that they are wholly unaquainted with politics of which above all other sciences they believe themselves to have acquired the 
 most perfect knowledge 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then the question of these untrue forms of 
 government is the least oppressive to their subjects though they 
 are all oppressive and which is the worst of them here is a 
 consideration which is beside our present purpose and yet having 
 regard to the whole it seems to influence all our actions we must 
 examine it 
 
 y soc yes we must 
 
 str you may say that of the three forms the same is at once the 
 hardest and the easiest 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i am speaking of the three forms of government which i 
 mentioned at the beginning of this the rule of 
 the few and the rule of the many 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str if we divide each of these we shall have six from which the 
 true one may be distinguished as a seventh 
 
 y soc how would you make the division 
 
 str monarchy divides into royalty and tyranny the rule of the 
 few into aristocracy which has an auspicious name and 
 oligarchy and democracy or the rule of the many which before was one must now be divided 
 
 y soc on what principle of division 
 
 str on the same principle as before although the name is now 
 discovered to have a twofold the distinction of ruling 
 with law or without applies to this as well as to the rest 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str the division made no difference when we were looking for the 
 perfect state as we showed before but now that this has been 
 separated off and as we said the others alone are left for us 
 the principle of law and the absence of law will bisect them all 
 
 y soc that would seem follow from what has been said 
 
 str then monarchy when bound by good prescriptions or 
 laws is the best of all the six and when lawless is the most bitter and 
 oppressive to the subject 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the government of the few which is intermediate 
 between that of the one and many is also intermediate in good and evil but the government of the many is in every respect weak and unable to do either any great good or any great evil when compared with the others because the offices are too minutely subdivided and too many hold them and this therefore is the worst of all lawful 
 governments and the best of all lawless ones if they are 
 all without the restraints of law democracy is the form in which to 
 live is best if they are well ordered then this is the last which you should choose as royalty the first form is the best with the 
 exception of the seventh for that excels them all and is among states what god is among men 
 
 y soc you are quite right and we should choose that above all 
 
 str the members of all these states with the exception of the 
 one which has knowledge may be set aside as being not statesmen but of the most monstrous idols and 
 themselves being the greatest imitators and magicians they are also the greatest of sophists 
 
 y soc the name of sophist after many windings in the argument 
 appears to have been most justly fixed upon the politicians as they 
 are termed 
 
 str and so our satyric drama has been played out and the troop 
 of centaurs and satyrs however unwilling to leave the stage have 
 at last been separated from the political science 
 
 y soc so i perceive 
 
 str there remain however natures still more troublesome 
 because they are more nearly akin to the king and more difficult to 
 discern the examination of them may be compared to the process of 
 refining gold 
 
 y soc what is your meaning 
 
 str the workmen begin by sifting away the earth and stones and 
 the like there remain in a confused mass the valuable clements akin 
 to gold which can only be separated by silver 
 and other precious metals these are at last refined away by the use of tests until the gold is left quite pure 
 
 y soc yes that is the way in which these things are said to be 
 done 
 
 str in like manner all alien and uncongenial matter has been 
 separated from political science and what is precious and of a 
 kindred nature has been left there remain the nobler arts of the 
 general and the judge and the higher sort of oratory which 
 is an ally of the royal art and persuades men to do justice and assists in guiding the helm of can we best clear away all these 
 leaving him whom we seek alone and unalloyed 
 
 y soc that is obviously what has in some way to be attempted 
 
 str if the attempt is all that is wanting he shall certainly be 
 brought to light and i think that the illustration of music may 
 assist in exhibiting him please to answer me a question 
 
 y soc what question 
 
 str there is such a thing as learning music or handicraft arts in 
 general 
 
 y soc there is 
 
 str and is there any higher art or science having power to 
 decide which of these arts are and are not to be do 
 you say 
 
 y soc i should answer that there is 
 
 str and do we acknowledge this science to be different from the 
 others 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and ought the other sciences to be superior to this or no 
 single science to any other or ought this science to be the 
 overseer and governor of all the others 
 
 y soc the latter 
 
 str you mean to say that the science which judges whether we 
 ought to learn or not must be superior to the science which is 
 learned or which teaches 
 
 y soc far superior 
 
 str and the science which determines whether we ought to persuade 
 or not must be superior to the science which is able to persuade 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str very good and to what science do we assign the power of 
 persuading a multitude by a pleasing tale and not by teaching 
 
 y soc that power i think must clearly be assigned to rhetoric 
 
 str and to what science do we give the power of 
 determining whether we are to employ persuasion or force towards any one or to refrain altogether 
 
 y soc to that science which governs the arts of speech and 
 persuasion 
 
 str which if i am not mistaken will be politics 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str rhetoric seems to be quickly distinguished from 
 politics being a different species yet ministering to it 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but what would you think of another sort of power or science 
 
 y soc what science 
 
 str the science which has to do with military operations against 
 our that to be regarded as a science or not 
 
 y soc how can generalship and military tactics be regarded as 
 other than a science 
 
 str and is the art which is able and knows how to advise when we 
 are to go to war or to make peace the same as this or different 
 
 y soc if we are to be consistent we must say different 
 
 str and we must also suppose that this rules the other if we are 
 not to give up our former notion 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and considering how great and terrible the whole art of war 
 is can we imagine any which is superior to it but the truly royal 
 
 y soc no other 
 
 str the art of the general is only ministerial and therefore not 
 political 
 
 y soc exactly 
 
 str once more let us consider the nature of the righteous judge 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str does he do anything but decide the dealings of men with one 
 another to be just or unjust in accordance with the standard which 
 he receives from the king and his own peculiar 
 virtue only in this that he is not perverted by gifts or fears or 
 pity or by any sort of favour or enmity into deciding the suits of 
 men with one another contrary to the appointment of the legislator 
 
 y soc no his office is such as you describe 
 
 str then the inference is that the power of the judge is 
 not only the power of a guardian of the law which ministers to the royal power 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the review of all these sciences shows that none of them is 
 political or royal for the truly royal ought not itself to act but 
 to rule over those who are able to act the king ought to 
 know what is and what is not a fitting opportunity for taking the initiative in matters of the greatest importance whilst others should execute his orders 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and therefore the arts which we have described as they 
 have no authority over themselves or one another but are 
 each of them concerned with some special action of their own have as they ought to have special names corresponding to their several actions 
 y soc i agree 
 
 str and the science which is over them all and has charge of the 
 laws and of all matters affecting the state and truly weaves them 
 all into one if we would describe under a name characteristic of 
 their common nature most truly we may call politics 
 
 y soc exactly so 
 
 str then now that we have discovered the various classes in a 
 state shall i analyse politics after the pattern which weaving 
 supplied 
 
 y soc i greatly wish that you would 
 
 str then i must describe the nature of the royal web and show 
 how the various threads are woven into one piece 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str a task has to be accomplished which although difficult 
 appears to be necessary 
 
 y soc certainly the attempt must be made 
 
 str to assume that one part of virtue differs in kind 
 from a position easily assailable by contentious disputants who appeal to popular opinion 
 
 y soc i do not understand 
 
 str let me put the matter in another way i suppose that you 
 would consider courage to be a part of virtue 
 
 y soc certainly i should 
 
 str and you would think temperance to be different from courage 
 and likewise to be a part of virtue 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str i shall venture to put forward a strange theory about them 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str that they are two principles which thoroughly hate one 
 another and are antagonistic throughout a great part of nature 
 
 y soc how singular 
 
 str yes all the parts of virtue are commonly said to be 
 friendly to one another 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str then let us carefully investigate whether this is universally 
 true or whether there are not parts of virtue which are at war with 
 their kindred in some respect 
 
 y soc tell me how we shall consider that question 
 
 str we must extend our enquiry to all those things which we 
 consider beautiful and at the same time place in two 
 opposite classes 
 
 y soc explain what are they 
 
 str acuteness and quickness whether in body or soul or in the 
 movement of sound and the imitations of them which painting 
 and music 
 supply you must have praised yourself before now or been present 
 when others praised them 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and do you remember the terms in which they are praised 
 
 y soc i do not 
 
 str i wonder whether i can explain to you in words the thought 
 which is passing in my mind 
 
 y soc why not 
 
 str you fancy that this is all so easy well let us 
 consider these notions with reference to the opposite classes of action under which they fall when we praise quickness and energy and acuteness whether of mind or body or sound we express our praise of the quality which we admire by one word and that one word is manliness or courage 
 
 y soc how 
 
 str we speak of an action as energetic and brave quick and 
 manly and vigorous too and when we apply the name of which i speak as the common attribute of all these natures we certainly praise 
 them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and do we not often praise the quiet strain of action also 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str and do we not then say the opposite of what we said of the 
 other 
 
 y soc how do you mean 
 
 str we exclaim how calm how temperate in admiration of the slow 
 and quiet working of the intellect and of steadiness and gentleness 
 in action of smoothness and depth of voice and of all rhythmical 
 movement and of music in general when these have a proper 
 solemnity of all such actions we predicate not courage but a name 
 indicative of order 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str but when on the other hand either of these is out of place 
 the names of either are changed into terms of censure 
 
 y soc how so 
 
 str too great sharpness or quickness or hardness is 
 termed violence or madness too great slowness or gentleness is called cowardice or sluggishness and we may observe that for the most part these qualities and the temperance and manliness of the opposite characters are arrayed as enemies on opposite sides and do not mingle with one another in their respective actions and if we 
 pursue the enquiry we shall find that men who have these different 
 qualities of mind differ from one another 
 
 y soc in what respect 
 
 str in respect of all the qualities which i mentioned and very 
 likely of many others according to their respective affinities to 
 either class of actions they distribute praise and 
 to the actions which are akin to their own blame to those of the opposite out of this many quarrels and occasions of quarrel arise among them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the difference between the two classes is often a trivial 
 concern but in a state and when affecting really important 
 matters becomes of all disorders the most hateful 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str to nothing short of the whole regulation of human 
 life for the orderly class are always ready to lead a peaceful life quietly doing their own business this is their manner of behaving with all men at home and they are equally ready to find some way of keeping the peace with foreign states and on account of this fondness of theirs for peace which is often out of season where their influence prevails they become by degrees unwarlike and bring up their young men to be like themselves they are at the mercy of their enemies whence in a few years they and their children and the whole 
 city often pass imperceptibly from the condition of freemen into that of slaves 
 y soc what a cruel fate 
 
 str and now think of what happens with the more 
 courageous natures are they not always inciting their country to go to war owing to their excessive love of the military life they raise up enemies against themselves many and mighty and either utterly ruin their native land or enslave and subject it to its foes 
 
 y soc that again is true 
 
 str must we not admit then that where these two classes exist 
 they always feel the greatest antipathy and antagonism towards one 
 another 
 
 y soc we cannot deny it 
 
 str and returning to the enquiry with which we began have we not 
 found that considerable portions of virtue are at variance with one 
 another and give rise to a similar opposition in the characters who 
 are endowed with them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str let us consider a further point 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str i want to know whether any constructive art will make any 
 even the most trivial thing out of bad and good materials 
 indifferently if this can be helped does not all art rather reject 
 the bad as far as possible and accept the good and fit 
 materials and from these elements whether like or unlike gathering them all into one work out some nature or idea 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str then the true and natural art of statesmanship will 
 never allow any state to be formed by a combination of good and bad men if this can be avoided but will begin by testing human natures in play and after testing them will entrust them to proper teachers who are the ministers of her will herself give orders and maintain authority just as the art of weaving continually gives orders and maintains authority over the carders and all the others who prepare the material for the work commanding the subsidiary arts to execute the works which she deems necessary for making the web 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str in like manner the royal science appears to me to be the 
 mistress of all lawful educators and instructors and having this 
 queenly power will not permit them to train men in what will 
 produce characters unsuited to the political constitution which she 
 desires to create but only in what will produce such as are 
 suitable those which have no share of manliness and temperance or any other virtuous inclination and from the necessity of an evil nature are violently carried away to godlessness and insolence and 
 injustice she gets rid of by death and exile and punishes them with the greatest of disgraces 
 
 y soc that is commonly said 
 
 str but those who are wallowing in ignorance and baseness she 
 bows under the yoke of slavery 
 
 y soc quite right 
 
 str the rest of the citizens out of whom if they have 
 education something noble may be made and who are capable of being united by the statesman the kingly art blends and weaves together taking on the one hand those whose natures tend rather to courage which is the stronger element and may be regarded as the warp and on the other hand those which incline to order and gentleness and which are represented in the figure as spun thick and soft after the manner of the which are naturally opposed she seeks to bind and weave together in the following manner 
 
 y soc in what manner 
 
 str first of all she takes the eternal element of the soul and 
 binds it with a divine cord to which it is akin and then the 
 animal nature and binds that with human cords 
 
 y soc i do not understand what you mean 
 
 str the meaning is that the opinion about the honourable and the 
 just and good and their opposites which is true and confirmed by 
 reason is a divine principle and when implanted in the soul is 
 implanted as i maintain in a nature of heavenly birth 
 
 y soc yes what else should it be 
 
 str only the statesman and the good legislator having the 
 inspiration of the royal muse can implant this opinion and he 
 only in the rightly educated whom we were just now describing 
 
 y soc likely enough 
 
 str but him who cannot we will not designate by any of the names 
 which are the subject of the present which are the subject of the 
 present enquiry 
 
 y soc very right 
 
 str the courageous soul when attaining this truth becomes 
 civilized and rendered more capable of partaking of 
 justice but when not partaking is inclined to brutality is not that true 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and again the peaceful and orderly nature if sharing in these 
 opinions becomes temperate and wise as far as this may be in a 
 state but if not deservedly obtains the ignominious name of 
 silliness 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str can we say that such a connection as this will lastingly 
 unite the evil with one another or with the good or that any 
 science would seriously think of using a bond of this kind to join 
 such materials 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str but in those who were originally of a noble nature and who 
 have been nurtured in noble ways and in those only may we not say 
 that union is implanted by law and that this is the medicine which 
 art prescribes for them and of all the bonds which unite the 
 dissimilar and contrary parts of virtue is not this as i was 
 saying the divinest 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str where this divine bond exists there is no difficulty in 
 imagining or when you have imagined in creating the other bonds 
 which are human only 
 
 y soc how is that and what bonds do you mean 
 
 str rights of intermarriage and ties which are formed between 
 states by giving and taking children in marriage or between 
 individuals by private betrothals and espousals for most persons 
 form marriage connection without due regard to what is best for the 
 procreation of children 
 
 y soc in what way 
 
 str they seek after wealth and power which in matrimony are 
 objects not of a serious censure 
 
 y soc there is no need to consider them at all 
 
 str more reason to consider the practice of 
 those who make family their chief aim and to indicate their error 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str they act on no true principle at all they seek their ease 
 and receive with open arms those are like themselves and hate those 
 who are unlike them being too much influenced by feelings 
 of dislike 
 
 y soc how so 
 
 str the quiet orderly class seek for natures like their 
 own and as far as they can they marry and give in marriage exclusively in this class and the courageous do the same they seek natures like their own whereas they should both do precisely the opposite 
 
 y soc how and why is that 
 
 str because courage when untempered by the gentler nature during 
 many generations may at first bloom and strengthen but at last 
 bursts forth into downright madness 
 
 y soc like enough 
 
 str and then again the soul which is of 
 modesty and has no element of courage in many successive generations is apt to grow too indolent and at last to become utterly paralyzed and useless 
 
 y soc that again is quite likely 
 
 str it was of these bonds i said that there would be no 
 difficulty in creating them if only both classes originally held 
 the same opinion about the honourable and in 
 this single work the whole process of royal weaving is to allow temperate natures to be separated from the brave but to weave them together like the warp and the woof by common sentiments and honours and reputation and by the giving of pledges to one another and out of them forming one smooth and even web to entrust to them the offices of state 
 y soc how do you mean 
 str where one officer only is needed you must choose a ruler who has both these many you must mingle some of each 
 for the temperate ruler is very careful and just and safe but is 
 wanting in thoroughness and go 
 
 y soc certainly that is very true 
 
 str the character of the courageous on the other hand 
 falls short of the former in justice and caution but has the power of 
 action in a remarkable degree and where either of these two qualities 
 is wanting there cities cannot altogether prosper either in their public or private life 
 
 y soc certainly they cannot 
 
 str this then we declare to be the completion of the web of 
 political action which is created by a direct intertexture of the 
 brave and temperate natures whenever the royal science has drawn 
 the two minds into communion with one another by unanimity and 
 friendship and having perfected the noblest and best of all the 
 webs which political life admits and enfolding therein all other 
 inhabitants of cities whether slaves or freemen binds them in one 
 fabric and governs and presides over them and in so far as to be 
 happy is vouchsafed to a city in no particular fails to secure 
 their happiness 
 
 y soc your picture stranger of the king and statesman no less 
 than of the sophist is quite perfect 
 
 the end

 book just man 
 chapter v 
 
 monseigneur bienvenu made his cassocks last too long 
 the private life of m myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life 
 the voluntary poverty in which the bishop of d lived would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have viewed it close at hand 
 like all old men and like the majority of thinkers he slept little this brief slumber was profound 
 in the morning he meditated for an hour then he said his mass either at the cathedral or in his own house his mass said he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows 
 then he set to work 
 a bishop is a very busy man 
 he must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric who is generally a canon and nearly every day his he has congregations to reprove privileges to grant a whole ecclesiastical library to examine diocesan catechisms books of hours to write sermons to authorize cures and mayors to reconcile a clerical correspondence an administrative correspondence on one side the state on the other the holy see and a thousand matters of business 
 what time was left to him after these thousand details of business and his offices and his breviary he bestowed first on the necessitous the sick and the afflicted the time which was left to him from the afflicted the sick and the necessitous he devoted to work sometimes he dug in his garden again he read or wrote 
 he had but one word for both these kinds of toil he called them gardening the mind is a garden said he 
 towards when the weather was fine he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town often entering lowly dwellings he was seen walking alone buried in his own thoughts his eyes cast down supporting himself on his long cane clad in his wadded purple garment of silk which was very warm wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points 
 it was a perfect festival wherever he appeared 
 one would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it the children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the bishop as for the sun 
 he bestowed his blessing and they blessed him they pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything 
 here and there he halted accosted the little boys and girls and smiled upon the mothers 
 he visited the poor so long as he had any money when he no longer had any he visited the rich 
 as he made his cassocks last a long while and did not wish to have it noticed he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak 
 this inconvenienced him somewhat in summer 
 on his return he dined 
 the dinner resembled his breakfast 
 at eight in the evening he supped with his sister madame magloire standing behind them and serving them at table nothing could be more frugal than this repast 
 if however the bishop had one of his cures to supper madame magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake or with some fine game from the mountains 
 every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal 
 the bishop did not interfere with that exception his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water and oil soup 
 thus it was said in the town when the bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure he indulges in the cheer of a trappist 
 after supper he conversed for half an hour with mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire then he retired to his own room and set to writing sometimes on loose sheets and again on the margin of some folio he was a man of letters and rather learned 
 he left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts among others a dissertation on this verse in genesis in the beginning the spirit of god floated upon the waters 
 with this verse he compares three texts the arabic verse which says the winds of god blew flavius josephus who says a wind from above was precipitated upon the earth and finally the chaldaic paraphrase of onkelos which renders it a wind coming from god blew upon the face of the waters in another dissertation he examines the theological works of hugo bishop of ptolemais to the writer of this book and establishes the fact that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century under the pseudonym of barleycourt 
 sometimes in the midst of his reading no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself 
 these lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them 
 we now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled correspondence of lord germain with generals clinton cornwallis and the admirals on the american station 
 versailles poincot and paris pissot bookseller quai des augustins 
 here is the note 
 oh you who are 
 ecclesiastes calls you the the maccabees call you the creator the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty baruch calls you immensity the psalms call you wisdom and truth john calls you light the books of kings call you lord exodus calls you providence leviticus sanctity esdras justice the creation calls you god man calls you father but solomon calls you compassion and that is the most beautiful of all your names 
 toward nine in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to their chambers on the first floor leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor

 a new hope 
 v 
 
 it was tall but hardly monstrous artoo frowned inwardly as he checked ocularcircuitry and reactivated his innards 
 the monster looked very much like and old man he was clad in a shabbycloak and loose robes hung with a few small straps packs and unrecognizableinstruments artoo searched the wake but detected no evidence of apursuing nightmare nor did the man appear threatened actually artoo looked kind of pleased 
 it was impossible to tell where the odd overlapping attire ended and hisskin began that aged visage blended into the cloth and his beardappeared but an extension of the loose threads covering his upper chest 
 hints of extreme climates other than desert of ultimate cold and humidity wereetched into that seamed face a questing beak of nose like a high rock protrudedoutward from a flashflood of wrinkles and scars the eyes bordering it were a liquidcrystalazure the man smiled through sand and dust and beard squinting at the sightof the crumpled form lying quietly alongside of the landspeeder 
 convinced that the sandpeople had been the victims of an auditory delusion ofsome ignoring the fact that he had experienced it assured that this stranger meant luke no harm artoo shifted his positionslightly trying to obtain a better view the sound produced by a tiny pebble hedislodged was barely perceptible to his electronic sensors but the man whirled as ifshot he stared straight at alcove still smiling gently 
 hello there he called in a deep surprisingly cheerful voice come here mylittle friend no need to be afraid 
 something forthright and reassuring was in that voice in any case theassociation of an unknown human was preferable to remaining isolated in thiswasteland waddling out into the sunlight artoo made his way over to whereluke lay sprawled the body inclined forward as he examinedthe limp form whistles and beeps of concern came from within 
 walking over the old man bent beside luke and reached out to touch hisforehead then his temple shortly the unconscious youth was stirring andmumbling like a dreaming sleeper 
 worry the human told artoo be all right 
 as if to confirm this opinion luke blinked stared upward muttered what happened 
 rest easy son the man instructed him as he sat back on his heels a busy day again the boyish grin mighty lucky your stillattached to the rest of you 
 luke looked around his gaze coming to rest on the elderly face hovering abovehim recognition did wonders for his condition 
 got to be a sudden remembrance made him look around there was no sign of sandpeople slowly he raised his body to a sitting kenobiam i glad to see you 
 rising the old man surveyed the canyon floor and rolling rimwall above onefoot played with the sand the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly misguided traveler who tempts the hospitality his gaze went back tohis patient tell me young man what brings you out this far into nowhere 
 luke indicated artoo detoo this little droid for a while i thought crazy claiming he was searching for a former master now i think never seen such devotion in a or otherwise there seems tobe no stopping him he even resorted to tricking me 
 gaze shifted upward he claims to be the property of someone kenobi luke watched closely but the man showed no reaction is that arelative of yours my uncle thinks he was a real person or is it just someunimportant bit of scrambled information that got shifted into his primaryperformance bank 
 an introspective frown did remarkable things to that sandlbasted face kenobiappeared to ponder the question scratching absently at his scruffy beard he recited a name i heard in a long long time most curious 
 my uncle said he was dead luke supplied helpfully 
 oh not dead kenobi corrected him easily not yet not yet 
 luke climbed excitedly to his feet all thoughts of tusken raiders forgotten know him then 
 a smile of perverse youthfulness split that collage of wrinkled skin and course i know him me just as you probably suspected luke i by the name though since before you were born 
 then luke essayed gesturing at artoo detoo this droid does belong to he claims 
 now the peculiar part an openly puzzled kenobi confessed regardingthe silent robot i seem to remember owning a droid least of all a modernartoo unit most interesting most interesting 
 something drew the old gaze suddenly to the brow of nearby cliffs ithink best we make use of your landspeeder some the sandpeople are easilystartled but soon return in greater numbers a not a prizereadily conceded and after all jawas not 
 placing both hands over his mouth in a peculiar fashion kenobi inhaled deeplyand let out an unearthly howl that made luke jump that ought to keep anylaggards running for a while yet the old man concluded with satisfaction 
 a krayt dragon call luke gaped in astonishment how did you dothat 
 show you sometime son not too hard just takes the right attitude aset of vocal cords and a lot of wind now if you were an imperialbureaucrat i could teach you right off but not he scanned the and i think this is the time or place for it 
 i argue that luke was rubbing at the back of his head getstarted 
 that was when artoo let out a pathetic beep and whirled luke the electronic squeal but he suddenly comprehended the reason behind luke exclaimed worriedly artoo was already moving as fast aspossible away from the landspeeder come on ben 
 the little robot led them to the edge of a large sandpit it stopped downward and squeaking mournfully luke saw where artoo was started cautiously down the smooth shifting slope while kenobi followedeffortlessly 
 threepio lay in the sand at the base of the slope down which he had rolled andtumbled his casing was dented and badly mangled one arm lay broken and benta short distance away 
 threepio luke called there was no response shaking the droid failed toactivate anything opening a plate on the back luke flipped a hidden switchon and off several times in succession a low hum started stopped started then dropped to a normal purr 
 using his remaining arm threepio rolled over and sat up where am i hemurmured as his photoreceptors continued to clear then he recognized sorry sir i must have taken a bad step 
 lucky any of your main circuits are still operational luke informedhim he looked significantly toward the top of the hill can you stand to get out of here before the sandpeople return 
 servomotors whined in protest until threepio ceased struggling i thinki can make it you go on master luke it make sense to risk yourself onmy account finished 
 no not luke shot back unaccountably affected by this recentlyencountered machine but then threepio was not the usual device luke was accustomed to dealing with what kind of talk isthat 
 logical threepio informed him 
 luke shook his head angrily defeatist 
 with luke and ben aid the battered droid somehow managed tostruggle erect little artoo watched from the rim 
 hesitating part way up the slope kenobi sniffed the air suspiciously on the move again 
 trying to watch the surrounding rocks and his footsteps simultaneously lukefought to drag threepio clear of the pit 
 the dcor of ben cave was spartan without appearinguncomfortable it would not have suited most people reflecting as it did eclectic tastes the living area radiated an aura of lean comfort with moreimportance attached to mental comforts than those of the awkward human body 
 they had succeeded in vacating the canyon before the tusken raiders couldreturn in force under direction luke left a trail behind them so confusingthat not even a hypernasal jawa could have followed it 
 luke spent several hours ignoring the temptations of cave instead heremained in the corner which was equipped as a compact yet complete repair to fix severed arm 
 fortunately the automatic overload disconnects had given way under the severestrain sealing electronic nerves and ganglia without real damage repair wasmerely a matter of reattaching the limb to the shoulder then activating the the arm been broken in instead of at a joint such repairs would havebeen impossible save at a factory shop 
 while luke was thus occupied attention was concentrated on artoodetoo the squat droid sat passively on the cool cavern floor while the old manfiddled with its metal insides finally the man sat back with a humph ofsatisfaction and closed the open panels in the rounded head now seeif we can figure out what you are my little friend and where you came from 
 luke was almost finished anyway and words were sufficient to pullhim away from the repair area i saw part of the message he began and i 
 once more the striking portrait was being projected into empty space from thefront of the little robot luke broke off enraptured by its enigmatic beauty onceagain 
 yes i think got it kenobi murmured contemplatively 
 the image continued to flicker indicating a tape hastily prepared but it wasmuch sharper better defined now luke noted with admiration one thing wasapparent kenobi was skilled in subjects more specific than desert scavenging 
 general kenobi the mellifluous voice was saying i present myselfin the name of the world family of alderaan and of the alliance to restore therepublic i break your solitude at the bidding of my father bail organa viceroyand first chairman of the alderaan system 
 kenobi absorbed this extraordinary declamation while eyes bugged bigenough to fall from his face 
 years ago general the voice continued you served the old republic in theclone wars now my father begs you to aid us again in our most desperate would have you join him on alderaan you must go to him 
 i regret that i am unable to present my request to you in person mymission to meet personally with you has failed hence i have been forced to resortto this secondary method of communication 
 information vital to the survival of the alliance has been secured in the mind ofthis detoo droid my father will know how to retrieve it i plead with you to seethis unit safely delivered to alderaan 
 she paused and when she continued her words were hurried and less laced withformality you must help me kenobi you are my last hope i will becaptured by agents of the empire they will learn nothing from me everything tobe learned lies locked in the memory cells of this droid do not fail us do not fail me 
 a small cloud of tridimensional static replaced the delicate portrait and then itvanished entirely artoo detoo gazed up expectantly at kenobi 
 mind was as muddy as a pond laced with petroleum unanchored histhoughts and eyes turned for stability to the quiet figure seated nearby 
 the old man the crazy wizard the desert bum and characterswhom his uncle and everyone else had known of for as long as luke could recall 
 if the breathless message the unknown woman had just spokeninto the cool air of the cave had affected kenobi in any way he gave no hint of he leaned back against the rock wall and tugged thoughtfully at his slowly on a water pipe of tarnished chrome 
 luke visualized that simple yet lovely portrait his farmingbackground provide him with the requisite words suddenly something in themessage caused him to stare disbelievingly at the oldster general kenobi youfought in the clone wars butthat was so long ago 
 um yes kenobi acknowledged as casually as he might have discussed therecipe for shang stew i guess it was a while back i was a jedi knight he added watching the youth appraisingly your father 
 a jedi knight luke echoed then he looked confused but my fight in the clone wars he was no a navigator on a spacefreighter 
 smile enfolded the mouthpiece or so your uncle has toldyou his attention was suddenly focused elsewhere owen lars agreewith your ideas opinions or with his philosophy of life he believed thatyour father should have stayed here on tatooine and not gotten involved the seemingly indifferent shrug well he thought he should have remainedhere and minded his farming 
 luke said nothing his body tense as the old man related bits and pieces of apersonal history luke had viewed only through his distortions 
 owen was always afraid that your adventurous life might influence pull you away from anchorhead he shook his head slowly regretfully atthe remembrance afraid there much of the farmer in your father 
 luke turned away he returned to cleaning the last particles of sand healing armature i wish known him he finally whispered 
 he was the best pilot i ever knew kenobi went on and a smart fighter theforcethe instinct was strong in him for a brief second kenobi actually appearedold he was also a good friend 
 suddenly the boyish twinkle returned to those piercing eyes along with the natural humor i understand quite a pilot yourself piloting andnavigation hereditary but a number of the things that can combine to make agood pilot are those you may have inherited still even a duck has tobe taught to swim 
 a duck luke asked curiously 
 never mind in many ways you know you are much like your unabashed look of evaluation made luke nervous grown upquite a bit since the last time i saw you 
 having no reply for that luke waited silently as kenobi sank back into deepcontemplation after a while the old man stirred evidently having reached animportant decision 
 all this reminds me he declared with deceptive casualness i have somethinghere for you he rose and walked over to a bulky chest and startedrummaging through it all sorts of intriguing items were removed and shovedaround only to be placed back in the bin a few of them luke recognized askenobi was obviously intent on something important he forbore inquiring about anyof the other tantalizing flotsam 
 when you were old enough kenobi was saying your father want you to havethisif i can ever find the blasted device i tried to give it to you once before butyour uncle allow it he believed you might get some crazy ideas from itand end up following old on some idealistic crusade 
 you see luke where your father and your uncle owen disagreed larsis not a man to let idealism interfere with business whereas your father thinkthe question even worth discussing his decision on such matters came like 
 luke nodded he finished picking out the last of the grit and looked around forone remaining component to snap back in open chest plate locating therestraining module he opened the receiving latches in the machine and set aboutlocking it back in place threepio watched the process and appeared to wince everso perceptibly 
 luke stared into those metal and plastic photoreceptors for a long he set the module pointedly on the workbench and closed the droid said nothing 
 a grunt came from behind them and luke turned to see a pleased kenobiwalking over he handed luke a small device which the youthstudied with interest 
 it consisted primarily of a short thick handgrip with a couple of small switchesset into the grip above this small post was a circular metal disk barely larger indiameter than his spread palm a number of unfamiliar components werebuilt into both handle and disk including what looked like the smallest power cellluke had ever seen the reverse side of the disk was polished to a mirror it was the power cell that puzzled luke the most whatever the thing was itrequired a great deal of energy according to the rating form of the cell 
 despite the claim that it had belonged to his father the gizmo looked newlymanufactured kenobi had obviously kept it carefully only a number of minutescratches on the handgrip hinted at previous usage 
 sir came a familiar voice luke heard in a while 
 what luke was startled out of his examination 
 if not be needing me threepio declared i think shut down for a will help the armature nerves to knit and due for some internal 
 sure go ahead luke said absently returning to his fascinated study of behind him threepio became silent the glow fading temporarilyfrom his eyes luke noticed that kenobi was watching him with interest what isit he finally asked unable despite his best efforts to identify the device 
 your lightsaber kenobi told him at one time they were widelyused still are in certain galactic quarters 
 luke examined the controls on the handle then tentatively touched a brightlycolored button up near the mirrored pommel instantly the disk put forth a beam as thick around as his thumb it was dense to the point of opacity and alittle over a meter in length it did not fade but remained as brilliant and intense atits far end as it did next to the disk strangely luke felt no heat from it though hewas very careful not to touch it he knew what a lightsaber could do though he hadnever seen one before it could drill a hole right through the rock wall of through a human being 
 this was the formal weapon of a jedi knight explained kenobi not asclumsy or random as a blaster more skill than simple sight was required for its elegant weapon it was a symbol as well anyone can use a blaster to use a lightsaber well was a mark of someone a cut above theordinary he was pacing the floor of the cave as he spoke 
 for over a thousand generations luke the jedi knights were the most respected force in the galaxy they served as the guardians and guarantors ofpeace and justice in the old republic 
 when luke failed to ask what had happened to them since kenobi looked up tosee that the youth was staring vacantly into space having absorbed little if any of instruction some men would have chided luke for not paying kenobi more sensitive than most he waited patiently until the silence weighedstrong enough on luke for him to resume speaking 
 how he asked slowly did my father die 
 kenobi hesitated and luke sensed that the old man had no wish to talk aboutthis particular matter unlike owen lars however kenobi was unable to takerefuge in a comfortable lie 
 he was betrayed and murdered kenobi declared solemnly by a very youngjedi named darth vader he was not looking at luke a boy i was of my brightest disciplesone of my greatest failures 
 kenobi resumed his pacing vader used the training i gave him and the forcewithin him for evil to help the later corrupt emperors with the jedi knightsdisbanded disorganized or dead there were few to oppose vader today they areall but extinct 
 an indecipherable expression crossed face in many ways they weretoo good too trusting for their own health they put too much trust in the stabilityof the republic failing to realize that while the body might be sound the head wasgrowing diseased and feeble leaving it open to manipulation by such as the emperor 
 i wish i knew what vader was after sometimes i have the feeling he ismarking time in preparation for some incomprehensible abomination such is thedestiny of one who masters the force and is consumed by its dark side 
 face twisted in confusion a force the second time a force 
 kenobi nodded i forget sometimes in whose presence i babble let us saysimply that the force is something a jedi must deal with while it has never beenproperly explained scientists have theorized it is an energy field generated by livingthings early man suspected its existence yet remained in ignorance of its potentialfor millennia 
 only certain individuals could recognize the force for what it was they weremercilessly labeled charlatans fakers worse even fewer could makeuse of it as it was usually beyond their primitive controls it frequently was toopowerful for them they were misunderstood by their worse 
 kenobi made a wide all encompassing gesture with both arms the forcesurrounds each and every one of us some men believe it directs our actions and notthe other way around knowledge of the force and how to manipulate it was whatgave the jedi his special power 
 the arms came down and kenobi stared at luke until the youth began to fidgetuncomfortably when he spoke again it was in a tone so crisp and unaged that lukejumped in spite of himself you must learn the ways of the force also are to come with me to alderaan 
 alderaan luke hopped off the repair seat looking dazed not going toalderaan i even know where alderaan is vaporators droids the surroundings seemed to close in on him the formerly intriguingfurnishings and alien artifacts now just a mite frightening he looked around to avoid the piercing gaze of ben kenobiold bencrazy bengeneral 
 got to get back home he found himself muttering thickly in for it as it is remembering something he gestured toward the motionlessbulk of artoo detoo you can keep the droid he seems to want you to of something to tell my hope he added forlornly 
 i need your help luke kenobi explained his manner a combination ofsadness and steel getting too old for this kind of thing trust myself tofinish it properly on my own this mission is far too important he noddedtoward artoo detoo you heard and saw the message

 that sounds like your uncle talking kenobi observed without rancor 
 oh my uncle owenhow am i going to explain all this to him

 remember luke the suffering of one man is the suffering of all distancesare irrelevant to injustice if not stopped soon enough evil eventually reaches out toengulf all men whether they have opposed it or ignored it 
 i suppose luke confessed nervously i could take you as far as can get transport from there to mos eisley or wherever it is you want to go 
 very well agreed kenobi that will do for a beginning then you must dowhat you feel is right 
 luke turned away now thoroughly confused okay right now i feeltoo good

 a new hope 
 v 
 
 it was tall but hardly monstrous artoo frowned inwardly as he checked ocularcircuitry and reactivated his innards 
 the monster looked very much like and old man he was clad in a shabbycloak and loose robes hung with a few small straps packs and unrecognizableinstruments artoo searched the wake but detected no evidence of apursuing nightmare nor did the man appear threatened actually artoo looked kind of pleased 
 it was impossible to tell where the odd overlapping attire ended and hisskin began that aged visage blended into the cloth and his beardappeared but an extension of the loose threads covering his upper chest 
 hints of extreme climates other than desert of ultimate cold and humidity wereetched into that seamed face a questing beak of nose like a high rock protrudedoutward from a flashflood of wrinkles and scars the eyes bordering it were a liquidcrystalazure the man smiled through sand and dust and beard squinting at the sightof the crumpled form lying quietly alongside of the landspeeder 
 convinced that the sandpeople had been the victims of an auditory delusion ofsome ignoring the fact that he had experienced it assured that this stranger meant luke no harm artoo shifted his positionslightly trying to obtain a better view the sound produced by a tiny pebble hedislodged was barely perceptible to his electronic sensors but the man whirled as ifshot he stared straight at alcove still smiling gently 
 hello there he called in a deep surprisingly cheerful voice come here mylittle friend no need to be afraid 
 something forthright and reassuring was in that voice in any case theassociation of an unknown human was preferable to remaining isolated in thiswasteland waddling out into the sunlight artoo made his way over to whereluke lay sprawled the body inclined forward as he examinedthe limp form whistles and beeps of concern came from within 
 walking over the old man bent beside luke and reached out to touch hisforehead then his temple shortly the unconscious youth was stirring andmumbling like a dreaming sleeper 
 worry the human told artoo be all right 
 as if to confirm this opinion luke blinked stared upward muttered what happened 
 rest easy son the man instructed him as he sat back on his heels a busy day again the boyish grin mighty lucky your stillattached to the rest of you 
 luke looked around his gaze coming to rest on the elderly face hovering abovehim recognition did wonders for his condition 
 got to be a sudden remembrance made him look around there was no sign of sandpeople slowly he raised his body to a sitting kenobiam i glad to see you 
 rising the old man surveyed the canyon floor and rolling rimwall above onefoot played with the sand the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly misguided traveler who tempts the hospitality his gaze went back tohis patient tell me young man what brings you out this far into nowhere 
 luke indicated artoo detoo this little droid for a while i thought crazy claiming he was searching for a former master now i think never seen such devotion in a or otherwise there seems tobe no stopping him he even resorted to tricking me 
 gaze shifted upward he claims to be the property of someone kenobi luke watched closely but the man showed no reaction is that arelative of yours my uncle thinks he was a real person or is it just someunimportant bit of scrambled information that got shifted into his primaryperformance bank 
 an introspective frown did remarkable things to that sandlbasted face kenobiappeared to ponder the question scratching absently at his scruffy beard he recited a name i heard in a long long time most curious 
 my uncle said he was dead luke supplied helpfully 
 oh not dead kenobi corrected him easily not yet not yet 
 luke climbed excitedly to his feet all thoughts of tusken raiders forgotten know him then 
 a smile of perverse youthfulness split that collage of wrinkled skin and course i know him me just as you probably suspected luke i by the name though since before you were born 
 then luke essayed gesturing at artoo detoo this droid does belong to he claims 
 now the peculiar part an openly puzzled kenobi confessed regardingthe silent robot i seem to remember owning a droid least of all a modernartoo unit most interesting most interesting 
 something drew the old gaze suddenly to the brow of nearby cliffs ithink best we make use of your landspeeder some the sandpeople are easilystartled but soon return in greater numbers a not a prizereadily conceded and after all jawas not 
 placing both hands over his mouth in a peculiar fashion kenobi inhaled deeplyand let out an unearthly howl that made luke jump that ought to keep anylaggards running for a while yet the old man concluded with satisfaction 
 a krayt dragon call luke gaped in astonishment how did you dothat 
 show you sometime son not too hard just takes the right attitude aset of vocal cords and a lot of wind now if you were an imperialbureaucrat i could teach you right off but not he scanned the and i think this is the time or place for it 
 i argue that luke was rubbing at the back of his head getstarted 
 that was when artoo let out a pathetic beep and whirled luke the electronic squeal but he suddenly comprehended the reason behind luke exclaimed worriedly artoo was already moving as fast aspossible away from the landspeeder come on ben 
 the little robot led them to the edge of a large sandpit it stopped downward and squeaking mournfully luke saw where artoo was started cautiously down the smooth shifting slope while kenobi followedeffortlessly 
 threepio lay in the sand at the base of the slope down which he had rolled andtumbled his casing was dented and badly mangled one arm lay broken and benta short distance away 
 threepio luke called there was no response shaking the droid failed toactivate anything opening a plate on the back luke flipped a hidden switchon and off several times in succession a low hum started stopped started then dropped to a normal purr 
 using his remaining arm threepio rolled over and sat up where am i hemurmured as his photoreceptors continued to clear then he recognized sorry sir i must have taken a bad step 
 lucky any of your main circuits are still operational luke informedhim he looked significantly toward the top of the hill can you stand to get out of here before the sandpeople return 
 servomotors whined in protest until threepio ceased struggling i thinki can make it you go on master luke it make sense to risk yourself onmy account finished 
 no not luke shot back unaccountably affected by this recentlyencountered machine but then threepio was not the usual device luke was accustomed to dealing with what kind of talk isthat 
 logical threepio informed him 
 luke shook his head angrily defeatist 
 with luke and ben aid the battered droid somehow managed tostruggle erect little artoo watched from the rim 
 hesitating part way up the slope kenobi sniffed the air suspiciously on the move again 
 trying to watch the surrounding rocks and his footsteps simultaneously lukefought to drag threepio clear of the pit 
 the dcor of ben cave was spartan without appearinguncomfortable it would not have suited most people reflecting as it did eclectic tastes the living area radiated an aura of lean comfort with moreimportance attached to mental comforts than those of the awkward human body 
 they had succeeded in vacating the canyon before the tusken raiders couldreturn in force under direction luke left a trail behind them so confusingthat not even a hypernasal jawa could have followed it 
 luke spent several hours ignoring the temptations of cave instead heremained in the corner which was equipped as a compact yet complete repair to fix severed arm 
 fortunately the automatic overload disconnects had given way under the severestrain sealing electronic nerves and ganglia without real damage repair wasmerely a matter of reattaching the limb to the shoulder then activating the the arm been broken in instead of at a joint such repairs would havebeen impossible save at a factory shop 
 while luke was thus occupied attention was concentrated on artoodetoo the squat droid sat passively on the cool cavern floor while the old manfiddled with its metal insides finally the man sat back with a humph ofsatisfaction and closed the open panels in the rounded head now seeif we can figure out what you are my little friend and where you came from 
 luke was almost finished anyway and words were sufficient to pullhim away from the repair area i saw part of the message he began and i 
 once more the striking portrait was being projected into empty space from thefront of the little robot luke broke off enraptured by its enigmatic beauty onceagain 
 yes i think got it kenobi murmured contemplatively 
 the image continued to flicker indicating a tape hastily prepared but it wasmuch sharper better defined now luke noted with admiration one thing wasapparent kenobi was skilled in subjects more specific than desert scavenging 
 general kenobi the mellifluous voice was saying i present myselfin the name of the world family of alderaan and of the alliance to restore therepublic i break your solitude at the bidding of my father bail organa viceroyand first chairman of the alderaan system 
 kenobi absorbed this extraordinary declamation while eyes bugged bigenough to fall from his face 
 years ago general the voice continued you served the old republic in theclone wars now my father begs you to aid us again in our most desperate would have you join him on alderaan you must go to him 
 i regret that i am unable to present my request to you in person mymission to meet personally with you has failed hence i have been forced to resortto this secondary method of communication 
 information vital to the survival of the alliance has been secured in the mind ofthis detoo droid my father will know how to retrieve it i plead with you to seethis unit safely delivered to alderaan 
 she paused and when she continued her words were hurried and less laced withformality you must help me kenobi you are my last hope i will becaptured by agents of the empire they will learn nothing from me everything tobe learned lies locked in the memory cells of this droid do not fail us do not fail me 
 a small cloud of tridimensional static replaced the delicate portrait and then itvanished entirely artoo detoo gazed up expectantly at kenobi 
 mind was as muddy as a pond laced with petroleum unanchored histhoughts and eyes turned for stability to the quiet figure seated nearby 
 the old man the crazy wizard the desert bum and characterswhom his uncle and everyone else had known of for as long as luke could recall 
 if the breathless message the unknown woman had just spokeninto the cool air of the cave had affected kenobi in any way he gave no hint of he leaned back against the rock wall and tugged thoughtfully at his slowly on a water pipe of tarnished chrome 
 luke visualized that simple yet lovely portrait his farmingbackground provide him with the requisite words suddenly something in themessage caused him to stare disbelievingly at the oldster general kenobi youfought in the clone wars butthat was so long ago 
 um yes kenobi acknowledged as casually as he might have discussed therecipe for shang stew i guess it was a while back i was a jedi knight he added watching the youth appraisingly your father 
 a jedi knight luke echoed then he looked confused but my fight in the clone wars he was no a navigator on a spacefreighter 
 smile enfolded the mouthpiece or so your uncle has toldyou his attention was suddenly focused elsewhere owen lars agreewith your ideas opinions or with his philosophy of life he believed thatyour father should have stayed here on tatooine and not gotten involved the seemingly indifferent shrug well he thought he should have remainedhere and minded his farming 
 luke said nothing his body tense as the old man related bits and pieces of apersonal history luke had viewed only through his distortions 
 owen was always afraid that your adventurous life might influence pull you away from anchorhead he shook his head slowly regretfully atthe remembrance afraid there much of the farmer in your father 
 luke turned away he returned to cleaning the last particles of sand healing armature i wish known him he finally whispered 
 he was the best pilot i ever knew kenobi went on and a smart fighter theforcethe instinct was strong in him for a brief second kenobi actually appearedold he was also a good friend 
 suddenly the boyish twinkle returned to those piercing eyes along with the natural humor i understand quite a pilot yourself piloting andnavigation hereditary but a number of the things that can combine to make agood pilot are those you may have inherited still even a duck has tobe taught to swim 
 a duck luke asked curiously 
 never mind in many ways you know you are much like your unabashed look of evaluation made luke nervous grown upquite a bit since the last time i saw you 
 having no reply for that luke waited silently as kenobi sank back into deepcontemplation after a while the old man stirred evidently having reached animportant decision 
 all this reminds me he declared with deceptive casualness i have somethinghere for you he rose and walked over to a bulky chest and startedrummaging through it all sorts of intriguing items were removed and shovedaround only to be placed back in the bin a few of them luke recognized askenobi was obviously intent on something important he forbore inquiring about anyof the other tantalizing flotsam 
 when you were old enough kenobi was saying your father want you to havethisif i can ever find the blasted device i tried to give it to you once before butyour uncle allow it he believed you might get some crazy ideas from itand end up following old on some idealistic crusade 
 you see luke where your father and your uncle owen disagreed larsis not a man to let idealism interfere with business whereas your father thinkthe question even worth discussing his decision on such matters came like 
 luke nodded he finished picking out the last of the grit and looked around forone remaining component to snap back in open chest plate locating therestraining module he opened the receiving latches in the machine and set aboutlocking it back in place threepio watched the process and appeared to wince everso perceptibly 
 luke stared into those metal and plastic photoreceptors for a long he set the module pointedly on the workbench and closed the droid said nothing 
 a grunt came from behind them and luke turned to see a pleased kenobiwalking over he handed luke a small device which the youthstudied with interest 
 it consisted primarily of a short thick handgrip with a couple of small switchesset into the grip above this small post was a circular metal disk barely larger indiameter than his spread palm a number of unfamiliar components werebuilt into both handle and disk including what looked like the smallest power cellluke had ever seen the reverse side of the disk was polished to a mirror it was the power cell that puzzled luke the most whatever the thing was itrequired a great deal of energy according to the rating form of the cell 
 despite the claim that it had belonged to his father the gizmo looked newlymanufactured kenobi had obviously kept it carefully only a number of minutescratches on the handgrip hinted at previous usage 
 sir came a familiar voice luke heard in a while 
 what luke was startled out of his examination 
 if not be needing me threepio declared i think shut down for a will help the armature nerves to knit and due for some internal 
 sure go ahead luke said absently returning to his fascinated study of behind him threepio became silent the glow fading temporarilyfrom his eyes luke noticed that kenobi was watching him with interest what isit he finally asked unable despite his best efforts to identify the device 
 your lightsaber kenobi told him at one time they were widelyused still are in certain galactic quarters 
 luke examined the controls on the handle then tentatively touched a brightlycolored button up near the mirrored pommel instantly the disk put forth a beam as thick around as his thumb it was dense to the point of opacity and alittle over a meter in length it did not fade but remained as brilliant and intense atits far end as it did next to the disk strangely luke felt no heat from it though hewas very careful not to touch it he knew what a lightsaber could do though he hadnever seen one before it could drill a hole right through the rock wall of through a human being 
 this was the formal weapon of a jedi knight explained kenobi not asclumsy or random as a blaster more skill than simple sight was required for its elegant weapon it was a symbol as well anyone can use a blaster to use a lightsaber well was a mark of someone a cut above theordinary he was pacing the floor of the cave as he spoke 
 for over a thousand generations luke the jedi knights were the most respected force in the galaxy they served as the guardians and guarantors ofpeace and justice in the old republic 
 when luke failed to ask what had happened to them since kenobi looked up tosee that the youth was staring vacantly into space having absorbed little if any of instruction some men would have chided luke for not paying kenobi more sensitive than most he waited patiently until the silence weighedstrong enough on luke for him to resume speaking 
 how he asked slowly did my father die 
 kenobi hesitated and luke sensed that the old man had no wish to talk aboutthis particular matter unlike owen lars however kenobi was unable to takerefuge in a comfortable lie 
 he was betrayed and murdered kenobi declared solemnly by a very youngjedi named darth vader he was not looking at luke a boy i was of my brightest disciplesone of my greatest failures 
 kenobi resumed his pacing vader used the training i gave him and the forcewithin him for evil to help the later corrupt emperors with the jedi knightsdisbanded disorganized or dead there were few to oppose vader today they areall but extinct 
 an indecipherable expression crossed face in many ways they weretoo good too trusting for their own health they put too much trust in the stabilityof the republic failing to realize that while the body might be sound the head wasgrowing diseased and feeble leaving it open to manipulation by such as the emperor 
 i wish i knew what vader was after sometimes i have the feeling he ismarking time in preparation for some incomprehensible abomination such is thedestiny of one who masters the force and is consumed by its dark side 
 face twisted in confusion a force the second time a force 
 kenobi nodded i forget sometimes in whose presence i babble let us saysimply that the force is something a jedi must deal with while it has never beenproperly explained scientists have theorized it is an energy field generated by livingthings early man suspected its existence yet remained in ignorance of its potentialfor millennia 
 only certain individuals could recognize the force for what it was they weremercilessly labeled charlatans fakers worse even fewer could makeuse of it as it was usually beyond their primitive controls it frequently was toopowerful for them they were misunderstood by their worse 
 kenobi made a wide all encompassing gesture with both arms the forcesurrounds each and every one of us some men believe it directs our actions and notthe other way around knowledge of the force and how to manipulate it was whatgave the jedi his special power 
 the arms came down and kenobi stared at luke until the youth began to fidgetuncomfortably when he spoke again it was in a tone so crisp and unaged that lukejumped in spite of himself you must learn the ways of the force also are to come with me to alderaan 
 alderaan luke hopped off the repair seat looking dazed not going toalderaan i even know where alderaan is vaporators droids the surroundings seemed to close in on him the formerly intriguingfurnishings and alien artifacts now just a mite frightening he looked around to avoid the piercing gaze of ben kenobiold bencrazy bengeneral 
 got to get back home he found himself muttering thickly in for it as it is remembering something he gestured toward the motionlessbulk of artoo detoo you can keep the droid he seems to want you to of something to tell my hope he added forlornly 
 i need your help luke kenobi explained his manner a combination ofsadness and steel getting too old for this kind of thing trust myself tofinish it properly on my own this mission is far too important he noddedtoward artoo detoo you heard and saw the message 
 buti get involved with anything like that protested luke gotwork to do got crops to bring though uncle owen could alwaysbreak down and hire a little extra help i mean one i guess but nothing ican do about it not now besides all such a long way from here thewhole thing is really none of my business 
 that sounds like your uncle talking kenobi observed without rancor 
 oh my uncle owenhow am i going to explain all this to him 
 the old man suppressed a smile aware that destiny had already beendetermined for him it had been ordained five minutes before he had learned aboutthe manner of his death it had been ordered before that when he had heardthe complete message it had been fixed in the nature of things when he had firstviewed the pleading portrait of the beautiful senator organa awkwardly projected bythe little droid kenobi shrugged inwardly likely it had been finalized evenbefore the boy was born not that ben believed in predestination but he did believein in the force
