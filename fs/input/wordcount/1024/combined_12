 having thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree the guests began to take their leave 
 pierre was ungainly stout about the average height broad with huge red hands he did not know as the saying is to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one that is how to say something particularly agreeable before going away besides this he was when he rose to go he took up instead of his own the hat and held it pulling at the plume till the general asked him to restore it all his and inability to enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindly simple and modest expression anna pavlovna turned toward him and with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion nodded and said i hope to see you again but i also hope you will change your opinions my dear monsieur pierre 
 when she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps opinions are opinions but you see what a capital fellow i am and everyone including anna pavlovna felt this 
 prince andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak listened indifferently to his chatter with prince hippolyte who had also come into the hall prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnant princess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass 
 go in annette or you will catch cold said the little princess taking leave of anna pavlovna it is settled she added in a low voice 
 anna pavlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match she contemplated between anatole and the little princess 
 i rely on you my dear said anna pavlovna also in a low tone write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter au revoir and she left the hall 
 prince hippolyte approached the little princess and bending his face close to her began to whisper something 
 two footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl and a cloak waiting for the conversation to finish they listened to the french sentences which to them were meaningless with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so the princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh 
 i am very glad i did not go to the said prince hippolyte so dull it has been a delightful evening has it not delightful 
 they say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing up her downy little lip all the pretty women in society will be there 
 not all for you will not be there not all said prince hippolyte smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom he even pushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess either from awkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time as though embracing her 
 still smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at her husband prince eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did he seem 
 are you ready he asked his wife looking past her 
 prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porch following the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriage 
 princesse au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet 
 the princess picking up her dress was taking her seat in the dark carriage her husband was adjusting his saber prince hippolyte under pretense of helping was in way 
 allow me sir said prince andrew in russian in a cold disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path 
 i am expecting you pierre said the same voice but gently and affectionately 
 the postilion started the carriage wheels rattled prince hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home 
 well mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself beside hippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice very nice indeed quite french and he kissed the tips of his fingers hippolyte burst out laughing 
 do you know you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs continued the vicomte i pity the poor husband that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch 
 hippolyte spluttered again and amid his laughter said and you were saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french one has to know how to deal with them 
 pierre reaching the house first went into prince study like one quite at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was commentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middle 
 what have you done to mlle scherer she will be quite ill now said prince andrew as he entered the study rubbing his small white hands 
 pierre turned his whole body making the sofa creak he lifted his eager face to prince andrew smiled and waved his hand 
 that abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light in my opinion perpetual peace is possible but i do not know how to express it not by a balance of political power 
 it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation 
 one everywhere say all one thinks mon cher well have you at last decided on anything are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist asked prince andrew after a momentary silence 
 pierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under him 
 really i yet know i like either the one or the other 
 but you must decide on something your father expects it 
 pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor and had remained away till he was twenty when he returned to moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man now go to petersburg look round and choose your profession i will agree to anything here is a letter to prince vasili and here is money write to me all about it and i will help you in everything pierre had already been choosing a career for three months and had not decided on anything it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking pierre rubbed his forehead 
 but he must be a freemason said he referring to the abbe whom he had met that evening 
 that is all nonsense prince andrew again interrupted him let us talk business have you been to the horse guards 
 no i have not but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to tell you there is a war now against napoleon if it were a war for freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is not right 
 prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at childish words he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one prince andrew gave to this naive question 
 if no one fought except on his own conviction there would be no wars he said 
 and that would be splendid said pierre 
 prince andrew smiled ironically 
 very likely it would be splendid but it will never come about 
 well why are you going to the war asked pierre 
 what for i know i must besides that i am going he paused i am going because the life i am leading here does not suit me

 chapter 
 
 mr hindley came home to the funeral thing that amazed us and set the neighbours gossiping right and brought a wife with him what she was and where she was born he never informed us probably she had neither money nor name to recommend her or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father 
 she was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own account every object she saw the moment she crossed the threshold appeared to delight her and every circumstance that took place about her except the preparing for the burial and the presence of the mourners i thought she was half silly from her behaviour while that went on she ran into her chamber and made me come with her though i should have been dressing the children and there she sat shivering and clasping her hands and asking repeatedly are they gone yet then she began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to see black and started and trembled and at last fell when i asked what was the matter answered she know but she felt so afraid of dying i imagined her as little likely to die as myself she was rather thin but young and and her eyes sparkled as bright as diamonds i did remark to be sure that mounting the stairs made her breathe very quick that the least sudden noise set her all in a quiver and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes but i knew nothing of what these symptoms portended and had no impulse to sympathize with her we in general take to foreigners here mr lockwood unless they take to us first 
 young earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his absence he had grown sparer and lost his colour and spoke and dressed quite differently and on the very day of his return he told joseph and me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back kitchen and leave the house for him indeed he would have carpeted and papered a small spare room for a parlour but his wife expressed such pleasure at the white floor and huge glowing fireplace at the pewter dishes and delf case and dog kennel and the wide space there was to move about in where they usually sat that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort and so dropped the intention 
 she expressed pleasure too at finding a sister among her new acquaintance and she prattled to catherine and kissed her and ran about with her and gave her quantities of presents at the beginning her affection tired very soon however and when she grew peevish hindley became tyrannical a few words from her evincing a dislike to heathcliff were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy he drove him from their company to the servants deprived him of the instructions of the curate and insisted that he should labour out of doors instead compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the farm 
 heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first because cathy taught him what she learnt and worked or played with him in the fields they both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages the young master being entirely negligent how they behaved and what they did so they kept clear of him he would not even have seen after their going to church on sundays only joseph and the curate reprimanded his carelessness when they absented themselves and that reminded him to order heathcliff a flogging and catherine a fast from dinner or supper but it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the morning and remain there all day and the after punishment grew a mere thing to laugh at the curate might set as many chapters as he pleased for catherine to get by heart and joseph might thrash heathcliff till his arm ached they forgot everything the minute they were together again at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of revenge and many a time cried to myself to watch them growing more reckless daily and i not daring to speak a syllable for fear of losing the small power i still retained over the unfriended creatures one sunday evening it chanced that they were banished from the for making a noise or a light offence of the kind and when i went to call them to supper i could discover them nowhere we searched the house above and below and the yard and stables they were invisible and at last hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors and swore nobody should let them in that night the household went to bed and i too anxious to lie down opened my lattice and put my head out to hearken though it rained determined to admit them in spite of the prohibition should they return in a while i distinguished steps coming up the road and the light of a lantern glimmered through the gate i threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking mr earnshaw by knocking there was heathcliff by himself it gave me a start to see him alone 
 where is miss catherine i cried hurriedly no accident i hope 
 at thrushcross grange he answered and i would have been there too but they had not the manners to ask me to stay well you will catch it i said never be content till sent about your business what in the world led you wandering to thrushcross grange 
 let me get off my wet clothes and tell you all about it nelly he replied i bid him beware of rousing the master and while he undressed and i waited to put out the candle he and i escaped from the to have a ramble at liberty and getting a glimpse of the grange lights we thought we would just go and see whether the lintons passed their sunday evenings standing shivering in corners while their father and mother sat eating and drinking and singing and laughing and burning their eyes out before the fire do you think they do or reading sermons and being catechized by their manservant and set to learn a column of scripture names if they answer properly 
 probably not i responded they are good children no doubt and deserve the treatment you receive for your bad conduct 
 you cant nelly he said nonsense we ran from the top of the heights to the park without completely beaten in the race because she was barefoot have to seek for her shoes in the bog tomorrow we crept through a broken hedge groped our way up the path and planted ourselves on a flower plot under the window the light came from thence they had not put up the shutters and the curtains were only half closed both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement and clinging to the ledge and we it was splendid place carpeted with crimson and chairs and tables and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold a shower of glass drops hanging in silver chains from the centre and shimmering with little soft tapers old mr and mrs linton were not there edgar and his sister had it entirely to themselves they have been happy we should have thought ourselves in heaven and now guess what your good children were doing believe she is eleven a year younger than screaming at the farther end of the room shrieking as if witches were running needles into her edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently and in the middle of the table sat a little dog shaking its paw and yelping which from their mutual accusations we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them the idiots that was their pleasure to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair and each begin to cry because both after struggling to get it refused to take it we laughed outright at the petted things we did despise them when would you catch me wishing to have what catherine wanted or find us by ourselves seeking entertainment in yelling and sobbing and rolling on the ground divided by the whole room not exchange for a thousand lives my condition here for edgar at thrushcross if i might have the privilege of off the highest gable and painting the with blood 
 hush hush i interrupted still you have not told me heathcliff how catherine is left behind 
 i told you we laughed he answered the lintons heard us and with one accord they shot like arrows to the door there was silence and then a cry oh mamma mamma oh papa oh mamma come here oh papa oh they really did howl out something in that way we made frightful noises to terrify them still more and then we dropped off the ledge because somebody was drawing the bars and we felt we had better flee i had cathy by the hand and was urging her on when all at once she fell down run heathcliff run she whispered they have let the bulldog loose and he holds me the devil had seized her ankle nelly i heard his abominable snorting she did not yell she would have scorned to do it if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow i did though i vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in christendom and i got a store and thrust it between his jaws and tried with all my might to cram it down his throat a beast of a servant came up with a lantern at last fast skulker keep fast he changed his note he saw game the dog was throttled off his huge purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his mouth and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver the man took cathy up she was sick not from fear certain but from pain he carried her in i followed grumbling execrations and vengeance what prey robert hallooed linton from the entrance skulker has caught a little girl sir he replied and a lad here he added making a clutch at me who looks an very like the robbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to the gang after all were asleep that they might murder us at their ease hold your tongue you thief you you shall go to the gallows for this mr linton sir lay by your gun no no robert said the old fool the rascals knew that yesterday was my rent day they thought to have me cleverly come in furnish them a reception there john fasten the chain give skulker some water jenny to beard a magistrate in his stronghold and on the sabbath too where will their insolence stop oh my dear mary look here be afraid it is but a the villain scowls so plainly in his face would it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once before he shows his nature in acts as well as features he pulled me under the chandelier and mrs linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in horror the cowardly children crept nearer also isabella thing put him in the cellar papa exactly like the son of the that stole my tame pheasant he edgar 
 while they examined me cathy came round she heard the last speech and laughed edgar linton after an inquisitive stare collected sufficient wit to recognize her they see us at church you know though we seldom meet them elsewhere miss earnshaw he whispered to his mother and look how skulker has bitten her foot bleeds 
 miss earnshaw nonsense cried the dame miss earnshaw scouring the country with a gipsy and yet my dear the child is in it she may be lamed for life 
 what culpable carelessness in her brother exclaimed mr linton turning from me to catherine understood from shielders that was the curate sir that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism but who is this where did she pick up this companion oho i declare he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made in his journey to little lascar or an american or spanish castaway 
 a wicked boy at all events remarked the old lady and quite unfit for a decent house did you notice his language linton shocked that my children should have heard it 
 i recommenced be angry so robert was ordered to take me off i refused to go without cathy he dragged me into the garden pushed the lantern into my hand assured me that mr earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour and bidding me march directly secured the door again the curtains were still looped up at one comer and i resumed my station as spy because if catherine had wished to return i intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments unless they let her out she sat on the sofa quietly mrs linton took off the grey cloak of the dairymaid which we had borrowed for our excursion shaking her head and expostulating with her i suppose she was a young lady and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine then the brought a basin of warm water and washed her feet and mr linton mixed a tumbler of negus and isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap and edgar stood gaping at a distance afterwards they dried and combed her beautiful hair and gave her a pair of enormous slippers and wheeled her to the fire and i left her as merry as she could be dividing her food between the little dog and skulker whose nose she pinched as he ate and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the dim reflection from her own enchanting face i saw they were full of stupid admiration she is so immeasurably superior to everybody on earth is she not nelly 
 there will more come of this business than you reckon on i answered covering him up and extinguishing the light you are incurable heathcliff and mr hindley will have to proceed to extremities see if he my words came truer than i desired the luckless adventure made earnshaw furious and then mr linton to mend matters paid us a visit himself on the morrow and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family that he was stirred to look about him in earnest heathcliff received no flogging but he was told that the first word he spoke to miss catherine should ensure a dismissal and mrs earnshaw undertook to keep her in due restraint when she returned home employing art not force with force she would have found it impossible

 what culpable carelessness in her brother exclaimed mr linton turning from me to catherine understood from shielders that was the curate sir that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism but who is this where did she pick up this companion oho i declare he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made in his journey to little lascar or an american or spanish castaway 
 a wicked boy at all events remarked the old lady and quite unfit for a decent house did you notice his language linton shocked that my children should have heard it 
 i recommenced be angry so robert was ordered to take me off i refused to go without cathy he dragged me into the garden pushed the lantern into my hand assured me that mr earnshaw should be informed of my behaviour and bidding me march directly secured the door again the curtains were still looped up at one comer and i resumed my station as spy because if catherine had wished to return i intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of fragments unless they let her out she sat on the sofa quietly mrs linton took off the grey cloak of the dairymaid which we had borrowed for our excursion shaking her head and expostulating with her i suppose she was a young lady and they made a distinction between her treatment and mine then the brought a basin of warm water and washed her feet and mr linton mixed a tumbler of negus and isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap and edgar stood gaping at a distance afterwards they dried and combed her beautiful hair and gave her a pair of enormous slippers and wheeled her to the fire and i left her as merry as she could be dividing her food between the little dog and skulker whose nose she pinched as he ate and kindling a spark of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the dim reflection from her own enchanting face i saw they were full of stupid admiration she is so immeasurably superior to everybody on earth is she not nelly 
 there will more come of this business than you reckon on i answered covering him up and extinguishing the light you are incurable heathcliff and mr hindley will have to proceed to extremities see if he my words came truer than i desired the luckless adventure made earnshaw furious and then mr linton to mend matters paid us a visit himself on the morrow and read the young master such a lecture on the road he guided his family that he was stirred to look about him in earnest heathcliff received no flogging but he was told that the first word he spoke to miss catherine should ensure a dismissal and mrs earnshaw undertook to keep her in due restraint when she returned home employing art not force with force she would have found it impossible

 chapter six 
 
 the big house did prove a palace beautiful though it took some time for all to get in and beth found it very hard to pass the lions old mr laurence was the biggest one but after he had called said something funny or kind to each one of the girls and talked over old times with their mother nobody felt much afraid of him except timid beth the other lion was the fact that they were poor and laurie rich for this made them shy of accepting favors which they could not return but after a while they found that he considered them the benefactors and could not do enough to show how grateful he was for mrs motherly welcome their cheerful society and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs so they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses without stopping to think which was the greater 
 all sorts of pleasant things happened about that time for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring every one liked laurie and he privately informed his tutor that the marches were regularly splendid girls with the delightful enthusiasm of youth they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him and he found something very charming in the innocent companionshipof these girls never having known mother or sisters he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him and their busy lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led he was tired of books and found people so interesting now that mr brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports for laurie was always playing truant and running over to the marches 
 never mind let him take a holiday and make it up afterward said the old gentleman the good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society amusement and exercise i suspect she is right and that been coddling the fellow as if been his grandmother let him do what he likes as long as he is happy he get into mischief in that little nunnery over there and mrs march is doing more for him than we can 
 what good times they had to be sure such plays and tableaux such sleigh rides and skating frolics such pleasant evenings in the old parlor and now and then such gay little parties at the great house meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked and revel in bouquets jo browsed over the new library voraciously and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms amy copied pictures and enjoyed beauty to her content and laurie played lord of the manor in the most delightful style 
 but beth though yearning for the grand piano could not pluck up courage to go to the mansion of bliss as meg called it she went once with jo but the old gentleman not being aware of her infirmity stared at her so hard from under his heavy eyebrows and said hey so loud that he frightened her so much her feet chattered on the floor she never told her mother and she ran away declaring she would never go there any more not even for the dear piano no persuasions orenticements could overcome her fear till the fact coming to mr ear in some mysterious way he set about mending matters during one of the brief calls he made he artfully led the conversation to music and talked away about great singers whom he had seen fine organs he had heard and toldsuch charming anecdotes that beth found it impossible to stay in her distant corner but crept nearer and nearer as if fascinated at the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly mr laurence talked on about lessons and teachers and presently as if the idea had just occurred to him he said to mrs march 
 the boy neglects his music now and glad of it for he was getting too fond of it but the piano suffers for want of use some of your girls like to run over and practice on it now and then just to keep it in tune you know 
 beth took a step forward and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them for this was an irresistible temptation and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away before mrs march could reply mr laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile 
 they see or speak to anyone but run in at any time for shut up in my study at the other end of the house laurie is out a great deal and the servants are never near the drawing room after nine 
 here he rose as if going and beth made up her mind to speak for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired please tell the young ladies what i say and if they care to come why never mind here a little hand slipped into his and beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude as she said in her earnest yet timid way 
 oh sir they do care very very much are you the musical girl he asked without any startling hey as he looked down at her very kindly 
 beth i love it dearly and come if you are quite sure nobody will hear me and be disturbed she added fearing to be rude and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke 
 not a soul my dear the house is empty half the day so come and drum away as much as you like and i shall be obliged toyou 
 how kind you are sir 
 beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore but she was not frightened now and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her the old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead and stooping down he kissed herr saying in a tone few people ever heard 
 i had a little girl once with eyes like these god bless you my dear good day madam and away he went in a great hurry 
 beth had a rapture with her mother and then rushed up to impart the glorious news to her family of invalids as the girls were not home how blithely she sang that evening and how they all laughed at her because she woke amy in the night by playing the piano on her face in her sleep next day having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house beth after two or three retreats fairly got in at the side door and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood quite by accident of course some pretty easy music lay on the piano and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to listen and look about beth at last touched the great instrument and straightway forgot her fear herself and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her for it was like the voice of a beloved friend 
 she stayed till hannah came to take her home to dinner but she had no appetite and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state of beatitude 
 after that the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen she never knew that mr laurence opened his study door to hear the airs he liked she never saw laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away she never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit and when he talked to her about music at home she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much so she enjoyed herself heartily and found what always the case that her granted wish was all she had hoped perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her at any rate she deserved both mother going to work mr laurence a pair of slippers he is so kind to me i must thank him and i know any other way can i do it asked beth a few weeks after that eventful call of his 
 yes dear it will please him very much and be a nice way of thanking him the girls will help you about them and i will pay for the making up replied mrs march who took peculiar pleasure in granting requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself 
 after many serious discussions with meg and jo the pattern was chosen the materials bought and the slippers begun a cluster ofgrave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced very appropriate and pretty and beth worked away early and late with occasional lifts over hard parts she was a nimble little needlewoman and they were finished before anyone got tired of them then she wrote a short simple note and with help got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up 
 when this excitement was over beth waited to see what would happen all day passed a a part of the next before any acknowledgement arrived and she was beginning to fear she had offended her crochety friend on the afternoon of the second day she went out to do an errand and give poor joanna the invalid doll her daily exercise as she came up the street on her return she saw three yes four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows and the moment they saw her several hands were waved and several joyful voices screamed 
 a letter from the old gentleman come quick and read it 
 oh beth sent you began amy gesticulating with unseemly energy but she got no further for jo quenched her by slamming down the window 
 beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense at the door her sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession all pointing and all saying at once look there look there beth did look and turned pale with delight and surprise for there stood a little cabinet piano with a letter lying on the glossy lid directed like a sign board to miss elizabeth march 
 for me gasped beth holding onto jo and feeling as if she should tumble down it was such an overwhelming thing altogether 
 yes all for you my precious it splendid of him you think the dearest old man in the world the key in the letter we open it but we are dying to know what he says cried jo hugging her sister and offering the note 
 you read it i i feel so queer oh it is too lovely and beth hid her face in apron quite upset by her present 
 jo opened the paper and began to laugh for the first worked she saw were 
 miss march 
 dear madam 
 how nice it sounds i wish someone would write to me so said amy who thought the address very elegant 
 i have had many pairs of slippers in my life but i never had any that suited me so well as yours continues jo heartsease is my favorite flower and these will always remind me of the gentle giver i like to pay my debts so i know you will allow the old gentleman to send you something which once belonged to the little grand daughter he lost with hearty thanks and best wishes i remain your grateful friend and humble servant 
 james laurence 
 there beth an honor to be proud of sure laurie told me how fond used to be of the child who died and how he kept all her little things carefully just think given you her piano that comes of having big blue eyes and loving music said jo trying to soothe beth who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before 
 see the cunning brackets to hold candles and the nice green sild puckered up with a gold rose in the middle and the pretty rack and stool all complete added meg opening the instrument and displaying its beauties 
 your humble servant james laurence only think of his writing that to you tell the girls think splendid said amy much impressed by the note 
 try it honey hear the sound of the baby pianny said hannah who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows 
 so beth tried it and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard it had evidently been newly tuned and put in apple pie order but perfect as it was i think the real charm lay in the happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it as beth lovingly touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals 
 have to go and thank him said jo by way of a joke for the idea of the really going never entered her head 
 yes i mean to i guess go no before i get frightened thinking about it and to the utter amazement of the assembled family beth walked deliberately down the garden through the hedge and in at the laurences door 
 well i wish i may die if it the queerest thing i ever see the pianny has turned her head never have gone in her right mind cried hannah staring after her while the girls were rendered quite speechless by the miracle 
 they would have been still more amazed if they had seen what beth did afterward if you will believe me she went and knocked at the study door before she gave herself time to think and when a gruff voice called out come in she did go in right up to mr laurence who looked quite taken aback and held out her hand saying with only a small quaver in her voice i came to thank you sir for but she finish for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved she put both arms round his neck and kissed him 
 if the roof of the house had suddenly flown off the old gentleman have been more astonished but he liked it oh dear yes he liked it amazingly and was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished and he just set her on his knee and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one feeling as if he had got his own little grand daughter back again beth ceased to fear him from that moment and sat there talking to him as cozily as if she had known him all her life for love casts out fear and gratitude can conquer pride when she went home he walked with her to her own gate shook hands cordially and touched his hat as he marched back again looking very stately and erect like a handsome soldierly old gentleman as he was 
 when the girls saw that performance jo began to dance a jig by way of expressing her satisfaction amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise and meg exclaimed with hands well i do believe the world is coming to an end

 into his arms looks down at her and just smiles 
 int imhotepis chamber day

 turns it a series of strange sounds are 
 heard and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a giant hiss 
 evelyn and jonathan all look very very hungover

 pushing shoving and groaning the lid budging inch by inch 
 evelyn

 appalled and embarrassed and when the lid falls off 
 and loudly crashes to the ground all three of them instantly 
 grab their sore heads and moan 
 int anubis chamber day 
 several diggers reach into the 
 secret compartment henderson and burns hold guns on them 
 daniels has his arm in a sling the diggers slowly pull out 
 the ornate chest they set the chest down on the sandy floor 
 beni watches as the egyptologist translates the hieratics 
 egyptologist 
 there is a curse upon this chest 
 daniels 
 curse my ass 
 henderson

 egyptologist 
 in these hallowed grounds that 
 which was set forth in ancient 
 times is as strong today as

 henderson 
 yeah yeah okay it 
 the egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription 
 egyptologist 
 death will come on swift wings 
 to whomever opens this chest 
 a gust of wind blows through the chamber torches flicker 
 diggers suddenly turn tail and run off screaming 
 the americans look at each other suddenly very nervous 
 egyptologist 
 it says there is one the undead 
 who if brought back to life is 
 bound by sacred law to consummate 
 this curse 
 henderson 
 yeah well just make sure 
 we bring anybody back from 
 the dead then huh 
 the three americans laugh 
 egyptologist 
 he will kill all who open this 
 chest and assimilate their 
 organs and fluids 
 daniels 
 assimilate their organs and fluids 
 ya mean eat em 
 egyptologist 
 and in so doing he will regenerate 
 and no longer be the undead but a 
 plague upon this earth 
 
 the wind whistles torches flicker very spooky beni and the 
 egyptologist share a look henderson just shrugs 
 henderson 
 ah hell open it anyways 
 int chamber day 
 wham wooden coffin is dropped to the ground next 
 to his stone sarcophagus evelyn is very excited 
 evelyn

 evelyn just gives him a look then starts brushing dirt and 
 cobwebs off the top of the coffin then she freezes 
 evelyn

 been chiseled off the hieratics 
 and hieroglyphs that protect the 
 deceased on his journey into the 
 afterlife been removed

 evelyn believe these guys jonathan inserts the 
 into the lock turns it the lid cracks open with a 
 hiss they all react to the foul stench then grabs 
 the lid stuck he pulls with all his might jonathan 
 helps him it starts to give way slowly slowly slooooowly 
 and then it suddenly pops open and the most hideous maggot 
 infested rotten corpse imaginable jumps up

 elephant man of corpses twisted and deformed the years 
 have not been kind he slumps back into his coffin 
 int day 
 henderson and daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden 
 chest beni and the egyptologist watch in the background 
 beni starts backing away filled with fear sweating buckets 
 beni 
 the curse beware the curse 
 turns and bolts from the chamber daniels spits 
 daniels 
 stupid superstitious bastard 
 and when the seal breaks a black vapor blasts out 
 of the chest everybody vanishes into the strange cloud 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 evelyn and jonathan slowly creep forward and 
 carefully look back inside coffin

 the mummy 
 part 
 
 ext base camp night 
 jonathan falls into frame hits the ground eyes wide open 
 mouth agape clearly dead a beat and then his eyes close 
 and his mouth widens into a goofy smile drunk 
 and evelyn laugh both themselves 
 the bottle of seagrams is almost gone offers the 
 bottle to evelyn she waves it away slurring badly 
 evelyn 
 unlike my brother sir i know 
 when to say no 
 polishes off the bottle and chucks it away 
 
 unlike your brother miss you 
 i get a whole new brew 
 evelyn 
 i know wondering 
 a place like me doing in a girl 
 like this 
 
 something like that 
 evelyn 
 egypt is in my blood my father 
 was a famous explorer he loved 
 egypt so much that he married 
 an egyptian my mother who 
 was quite an adventurer herself 
 
 okay i get your father i get 
 your mother and i get your brother 
 but what are you doing here 
 evelyn is insulted she staggers to her feet 
 evelyn 
 i may not be an explorer or an 
 adventurer or a treasure hunter 
 or a gunfighter mister 
 but proud of what i am 
 
 and what is that 
 evelyn plops back down beside him really drunk she grins 
 and proudly lifts her head high 
 evelyn

 she leans in very close to his face looks him in the eyes 
 evelyn 
 going to kiss you mister 
 
 
 no not 
 evelyn

 evelyn 
 why would i do that 
 
 because my name 
 she gives him a goofy smile he leans forward and kisses her 
 eyes slowly close and then she passes out slumping 
 into his arms looks down at her and just smiles 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 hand slips the key into the sarcophagus lock and 
 turns it a series of strange sounds are 
 heard and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a giant hiss 
 evelyn and jonathan all look very very hungover 
 they start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus 
 pushing shoving and groaning the lid budging inch by inch 
 evelyn 
 i believe i allowed the 
 two of you to get me drunk 
 jonathan 
 blame me i even 
 remember being there 
 evelyn 
 well neither do i thank you 
 gives her a hurt look 
 
 you 
 evelyn gives a nervous look 
 evelyn 
 no why should i 
 
 gee yeah you told me it was 
 the best time you ever had 
 gives her a big cheesy smile face drops 
 appalled and embarrassed and when the lid falls off 
 and loudly crashes to the ground all three of them instantly 
 grab their sore heads and moan 
 int anubis chamber day 
 several diggers reach into the 
 secret compartment henderson and burns hold guns on them 
 daniels has his arm in a sling the diggers slowly pull out 
 the ornate chest they set the chest down on the sandy floor 
 beni watches as the egyptologist translates the hieratics 
 egyptologist 
 there is a curse upon this chest 
 daniels 
 curse my ass 
 henderson 
 yeah who cares 
 the egyptologist gives them the 
 egyptologist 
 in these hallowed grounds that 
 which was set forth in ancient 
 times is as strong today as 
 it was then 
 henderson 
 yeah yeah okay it 
 the egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription 
 egyptologist 
 death will come on swift wings 
 to whomever opens this chest 
 a gust of wind blows through the chamber torches flicker 
 diggers suddenly turn tail and run off screaming 
 the americans look at each other suddenly very nervous 
 egyptologist 
 it says there is one the undead 
 who if brought back to life is 
 bound by sacred law to consummate 
 this curse 
 henderson 
 yeah well just make sure 
 we bring anybody back from 
 the dead then huh 
 the three americans laugh 
 egyptologist 
 he will kill all who open this 
 chest and assimilate their 
 organs and fluids 
 daniels 
 assimilate their organs and fluids 
 ya mean eat em 
 egyptologist 
 and in so doing he will regenerate 
 and no longer be the undead but a 
 plague upon this earth 
 
 the wind whistles torches flicker very spooky beni and the 
 egyptologist share a look henderson just shrugs 
 henderson 
 ah hell open it anyways 
 int chamber day 
 wham wooden coffin is dropped to the ground next 
 to his stone sarcophagus evelyn is very excited 
 evelyn 
 oh my god love dreamed about 
 this ever since i was a little girl 
 
 you dream about dead guys 
 evelyn just gives him a look then starts brushing dirt and 
 cobwebs off the top of the coffin then she freezes 
 evelyn 
 look all the sacred spells have 
 been chiseled off the hieratics 
 and hieroglyphs that protect the 
 deceased on his journey into the 
 afterlife been removed 
 this man was cursed doomed 
 and jonathan are too excited to care 
 
 tough break 
 jonathan 
 yes all tears now 
 see inside shall we 
 evelyn believe these guys jonathan inserts the 
 into the lock turns it the lid cracks open with a 
 hiss they all react to the foul stench then grabs 
 the lid stuck he pulls with all his might jonathan 
 helps him it starts to give way slowly slowly slooooowly 
 and then it suddenly pops open and the most hideous maggot 
 infested rotten corpse imaginable jumps up 
 
 ahhhhh 
 they all jump back scared to death imhotep is now the 
 elephant man of corpses twisted and deformed the years 
 have not been kind he slumps back into his coffin 
 int day 
 henderson and daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden 
 chest beni and the egyptologist watch in the background 
 beni starts backing away filled with fear sweating buckets 
 beni 
 the curse beware the curse 
 turns and bolts from the chamber daniels spits 
 daniels 
 stupid superstitious bastard 
 and when the seal breaks a black vapor blasts out 
 of the chest everybody vanishes into the strange cloud 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 evelyn and jonathan slowly creep forward and 
 carefully look back inside coffin

 chapter 
 
 for the love of a man 
 
 
 
 when john thornton froze his feet in the previous december his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of for dawson he was still limping slightly at the time he rescued buck but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him and here lying by the river bank through the long spring days watching the running water listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature buck slowly won back his strength 
 a rest comes very good after one has traveled three thousand miles and it must be confessed that buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed his muscles swelled out and the flesh came back to cover his bones for that matter they were all john thornton and skeet and for the raft to come that was to carry them down to dawson skeet was a little irish setter who early made friends with buck who in a dying condition was unable to resent her first advances she had the doctor trait which some dogs possess and as a mother cat washes her kittens so she washed and cleansed wounds regularly each morning after he had finished his breakfast she performed her task till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for nig equally friendly though less demonstrative was a huge black dog and with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature 
 to surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him they seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of john thornton as buck grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games in which thornton himself could not forbear to join and in this fashion buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence love genuine passionate love was his for the first time this he had never experienced at judge down in the santa clara valley with the sons hunting and tramping it had been a working partnership with the grandsons a sort of pompous guardianship and with the judge himself a stately and dignified friendship but love that was feverish and burning that was adoration that was madness it had taken john thornton to arouse 
 this man had saved his life which was something but further he was the ideal master other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a sense of duty and business expediency he saw to the welfare of his as if they were his own children because he could not help it and he saw further he never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word and to sit down for a long talk with he called as much his delight as theirs he had a way of taking head roughly between his hands and resting his own head upon of shaking him back and forth the while calling him ill names that to buck were love names buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of murmured oaths and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy and when released he sprang to his feet his mouth laughing his eyes eloquent his throat vibrant with unuttered sound and in that fashion remained without movement john thornton would reverently exclaim god you can all but speak 
 buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt he would often seize hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward and as buck understood the oaths to be love words so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress 
 for the most part however love was expressed in adoration while he went wild with happiness when thornton touched him or spoke to him he did not seek these tokens unlike skeet who was wont to shove her nose under hand and nudge and nudge till petted or nig who would stalk up and rest his great head on knee buck was content to adore at a distance he would lie by the hour eager alert at feet looking up into his face dwelling upon it studying it following with keenest interest each fleeting expression every movement or change of feature or as chance might have it he would lie farther away to the side or rear watching the outlines of the man and the occasional movements of his body and often such was the communion in which they lived the strength of gaze would draw john head around and he would return the gaze without speech his heart shining out of his eyes as heart shone out 
 for a long time after his rescue buck did not like thornton to get out of his sight from the moment he left the tent to when he entered it again buck would follow at his heels his transient masters since he had come into the northland had bred in him a fear that no master could be permanent he was afraid that thornton would pass out of his life as perrault and francois and the scotch had passed out even in the night in his dreams he was haunted by this fear at such times he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the tent where he would stand and listen to the sound of his breathing 
 but in spite of this great love he bore john thornton which seemed to bespeak the soft civilizing influence the strain of the primitive which the northland had aroused in him remained alive and active faithfulness and devotion things born of fire and roof were his yet he retained his wildness and wiliness he was a thing of the wild come in from the wild to sit by john fire rather than a dog of the soft southland stamped with the marks of generations of civilization because of his very great love he could not steal from this man but from any other man in any other camp he did not hesitate an instant while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection 
 his face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs and he fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly skeet and nig were too for they belonged to john thornton but the strange dog no matter what the breed or valor swiftly acknowledged supremacy or found himself struggling for life with a terrible antagonist and buck was merciless he had learned well the law of club and fang and he never forewent an advantage or drew back from a foe he had started on the way to death he had lessoned from spitz and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail and knew there was no middle course he must master or be mastered while to show mercy was a weakness mercy did not exist in the primordial life it was misunderstood for fear and such misunderstandings made for death kill or be killed eat or be eaten was the law and this mandate down out of the depths of time he obeyed 
 he was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn he linked the past with the present and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed he sat by john fire a dog and but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs half wolves and wild wolves urgent and prompting tasting the savor of the meat he ate thirsting for the water he drank scenting the wind with him listening with him and telling him the sounds made by the wild life in the forest dictating his moods directing his actions lying down to sleep with him when he lay down and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff of his dreams 
 so peremptorily did these shades beckon him that each day mankind and the claims of mankind slipped farther from him deep in the forest a call was sounding and as often as he heard this call mysteriously thrilling and luring he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and the beaten earth around it and to plunge into the forest and on and on he knew not where or why nor did he wonder where or why the call sounding imperiously deep in the forest but as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade the love for john thornton drew him back to the fire again 
 thornton alone held him the rest of mankind was as nothing chance travelers might praise or pet him but he was cold under it all and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away when partners hans and pete arrived on the raft buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to thornton after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting they were of the same large type as thornton living close to the earth thinking simply and seeing clearly and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the at dawson they understood buck and his ways and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with skeet and nig 
 for thornton however his love seemed to grow and grow he alone among men could put a pack upon back in the summer traveling nothing was too great for buck to do when thornton commanded one day they had themselves from the proceeds of the raft and left dawson for the head waters of the tanana the men and dogs were sitting on the crest of a cliff which fell away straight down to naked bedrock three hundred feet below john thornton was sitting near the edge buck at his shoulder a thoughtless whim seized thornton and he drew the attention of hans and pete to the experiment he had in mind jump buck he commanded sweeping his arm out and over the chasm the next instant he was grappling with buck on the extreme edge while hans and pete were dragging them back into safety 
 uncanny pete said after it was over and they had caught their speech 
 thornton shook his head no it is splendid and it is terrible too do you know it sometimes makes me afraid 
 not hankering to be the man that lays hands on you while around pete announced conclusively nodding his head toward buck 
 py jingo was contribution not mineself either 
 it was at circle city ere the year was out that apprehensions were realized black burton a man evil tempered and malicious had been picking a quarrel with a tenderfoot at the bar when thornton stepped good naturedly between buck as was his custom was lying in a corner head on paws watching his every action burton struck out without warning straight from the shoulder thornton was sent spinning and saved himself from falling only by clutching the rail of the bar 
 those who were looking on heard what was neither bark nor yelp but a something which is best described as a roar and they saw body rise up in the air as he left the floor for throat the man saved his life by instinctively throwing out his arm but was hurled backward to the floor with buck on top of him buck loosed his teeth from the flesh of the arm and drove in again for the throat this time the man succeeded only in partly blocking and his throat was torn open then the crowd was upon buck and he was driven off but while a surgeon checked the bleeding he prowled up and down growling furiously attempting to rush in and being forced back by an array of hostile clubs a miners meeting called on the spot decided that the dog had sufficient provocation and buck was discharged but his reputation was made and from that day his name spread through every camp in alaska 
 later on in the fall of the year he saved john life in quite another fashion the three partners were lining a long and narrow poling boat down a bad stretch of rapids on the forty mile creek hans and pete moved along the bank snubbing with a thin manila rope from tree to tree while thornton remained in the boat helping its descent by means of a pole and shouting directions to the shore buck on the bank worried and anxious kept abreast of the boat his eyes never off his master 
 at a particularly bad spot where a ledge of barely submerged rocks jutted out into the river hans cast off the rope and while thornton poled the boat out into the stream ran down the bank with the end in his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared the ledge this it did and was flying in a current as swift as a when hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly the boat flirted over and snubbed in to the bank bottom up while thornton flung sheer out of it was carried toward the worst part of the rapids a stretch of wild water in which no swimmer could live 
 buck had sprung in on the instant and at the end of three hundred yards amid a mad swirl of water he thornton when he felt him grasp his tail buck headed for the bank swimming with all his splendid strength but the progress shoreward was slow the progress amazingly rapid from below came the fatal roaring where the wild current went wilder and was rent in shreds and spray by the rocks which thrust through like the teeth of an enormous comb the suck of the water as it took the beginning of the last steep pitch was frightful and thornton knew that the shore was impossible he scraped furiously over a rock bruised across a second and struck a third with crushing force he clutched its slippery top with both hands releasing buck and above the roar of the churning water shouted go buck go 
 buck could not hold his own and swept on downstream struggling desperately but unable to win back when he heard command repeated he partly reared out of the water throwing his head high as though for a last look then turned obediently toward the bank he swam powerfully and was dragged ashore by pete and hans at the very point where swimming ceased to be possible and destruction began 
 they knew that the time a man could cling to a slippery rock in the face of that driving current was a matter of minutes and they ran as fast as they could up the bank to a point far above where thornton was hanging on they attached the line with which they had been snubbing the boat to neck and shoulders being careful that it should neither strangle him nor impede his swimming and launched him into the stream he struck out boldly but not straight enough into the stream he discovered the mistake too late when thornton was abreast of him and a bare strokes away while he was being carried helplessly past 
 hans promptly snubbed with the rope as though buck were a boat the rope thus tightening on him in the sweep of the current he was jerked under the surface and under the surface he remained till his body struck against the bank and he was hauled out he was half drowned and hans and pete threw themselves upon him pounding the breath into him and the water out of him he staggered to his feet and fell down the faint sound of voice came to them and though they could not make out the words of it they knew that he was in his extremity his voice acted on buck like an electric shock he sprang to his feet and ran up the bank ahead of the men to the point of his previous departure 
 again the rope was attached and he was launched and again he struck out but this time straight into the stream he had miscalculated once but he would not be guilty of it a second time hans paid out the rope permitting no slack while pete kept it clear of coils buck held on till he was on a line straight above thornton then he turned and with the speed of an express train headed down upon him thornton saw him coming and as buck struck him like a battering ram with the whole force of the current behind him he reached up and closed with both arms around the shaggy neck hans snubbed the rope around the tree and buck and thornton were jerked under the water strangling suffocating sometimes one uppermost and sometimes the other dragging over the jagged bottom smashing against rocks and snags they veered in to the bank 
 thornton came to belly downward and being violently propelled back and forth across a drift log by hans and pete his first glance was for buck over whose limp and apparently lifeless body nig was setting up a howl while skeet was licking the wet face and closed eyes thornton was himself bruised and battered and he went carefully over body when he had been brought around finding three broken ribs 
 that settles it he announced we camp right here and camp they did till ribs knitted and he was able to travel 
 that winter at dawson buck performed another exploit not so heroic perhaps but one that puts his name many notches higher on the totem pole of alaskan fame this exploit was particularly gratifying to the three men for they stood in need of the outfit which it furnished and were enabled to make a trip into the virgin east where miners had not yet appeared it was brought about by a conversation in the eldorado saloon in which men waxed boastful of their favorite dogs buck because of his record was the target for these men and thornton was driven stoutly to defend him at the end of half an hour one man stated that his dog could start a sled with five hundred pounds and walk off with it a second bragged six hundred for his dog and a third seven hundred 
 pooh pooh said john thornton buck can start a thousand pounds 
 and break it out and walk off with it for a hundred yards demanded matthewson a bonanza king he of the seven hundred vaunt 
 and break it out and walk off with it for a hundred yards john thornton said cooly 
 well matthewson said slowly and deliberately so that all could hear got a thousand dollars that says he and there it is so saying he slammed a sack of gold dust of the size of a bologna sausage down upon the bar 
 nobody spoke bluff if bluff it was had been called he could feel a flush of warm blood creeping up his face his tongue had tricked him he did not know whether buck could start a thousand pounds half a ton the enormousness of it appalled him he had great faith in strength and had often thought him capable of starting such a load but never as now had he faced the possibility of it the eyes of a dozen men fixed upon him silent and waiting further he had no thousand dollars nor had hans and pete 
 got a sled standing outside now with twenty sacks of flour on it matthewson went on with brutal directness so let that hinder you 
 thornton did not reply he did not know what to say he glanced from face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it going again the face of jim a mastodon king and comrade caught his eyes it was a cue to him seeming to rouse him to do what he would never have dreamed of doing 
 can you lend me a thousand he asked almost in a whisper 
 sure answered thumping down a plethoric sack by the side of though little faith having john that the beast can do the trick 
 the eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test the tables were deserted and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth to see the outcome of the wager and to lay odds several hundred men furred and mittened banked around the sled within easy distance sled loaded with a thousand pounds of flour had been standing for a couple of hours and in the intense cold it was sixty below runners had frozen fast to the snow men offered odds of two to one that buck could not budge the sled a quibble arose concerning the phrase break out contended it was privilege to knock the runners loose leaving buck to break it out from a dead standstill matthewson insisted that the phrase included breaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow a majority of the men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor whereat the odds went up to three to one against buck 
 there were no takers not a man believed him capable of the feat thornton had been hurried into the wager heavy with doubt and now that he looked at the sled itself the concrete fact with the regular team of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it the more impossible the task appeared matthewson waxed jubilant 
 three to one he proclaimed lay you another thousand at that figure thornton what do you say 
 doubt was strong in his face but his fighting spirit was fighting spirit that soars above odds fails to recognize the impossible and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle he called hans and pete to him their sacks were slim and with his own the three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars in the ebb of their fortunes this sum was their total capital yet they laid it unhesitatingly against six hundred 
 the team of ten dogs was unhitched and buck with his own harness was put into the sled he had caught the contagion of the excitement and he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for john thornton murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up he was in perfect condition without an ounce of superfluous flesh and the one hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and virility his furry coat shone with the sheen of silk down the neck and across the shoulders his mane in repose as it was half bristled and seemed to lift with every movement as though excess of vigor made each particular hair alive and active the great breast and heavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of his body where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin men felt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron and the odds went down to two to one 
 gad sir gad sir stuttered a member of the latest dynasty a king of the skookum benches i offer you eight hundred for him sir before the test eight hundred just as he stands 
 thornton shook his head and stepped over to side 
 you must stand off from him matthewson protested free play and plenty of room 
 the crowd fell silent only could be heard the voices of the gamblers vainly offering two to one everybody acknowledged buck a magnificent animal but twenty sacks of flour bulked too large in their eyes for them to loosen their pouch strings 
 thornton knelt down by side he took his head in his hands and rested cheek on cheek he did not playfully shake him as was his wont or murmur soft love curses but he whispered in his ear as you love me buck as you love me was what he whispered buck whined with suppressed eagerness 
 the crowd was watching curiously the affair was growing mysterious it seemed like a conjuration as thornton got to his feet buck seized his mittened hand between his jaws pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly it was the answer in terms not of speech but of love thornton stepped well back 
 now buck he said 
 buck tightened the traces then slacked them for a matter of several inches it was the way he had learned 
 gee voice rang out sharp in the tense silence 
 buck swung to the right ending the movement in a plunge that took up the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty pounds the load quivered and from under the runners arose a crisp crackling 
 haw thornton commanded 
 buck duplicated the maneuver this time to the left the crackling turned into a snapping the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and grating several inches to the side the sled was broken out men were holding their breaths intensely unconscious of the fact 
 now mush 
 command cracked out like a pistol shot buck threw himself forward tightening the traces with a jarring lunge his whole body was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort the muscles writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur his great chest was low to the ground his head forward and down while his feet were flying like mad the claws scarring the snow in parallel grooves the sled swayed and trembled forward one of his feet slipped and one man groaned aloud the sled lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks though it never really came to a dead stop again half an inch an inch two inches the jerks perceptibly diminished as the sled gained momentum he caught them up till it was moving steadily along 
 men gasped and began to breathe again unaware that for a moment they had ceased to breathe thornton was running behind encouraging buck with short cheery words the distance had been measured off and as he neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards a cheer began to grow and grow which burst into a roar as he passed the firewood and halted at command every man was tearing himself loose even matthewson hats and mittens were flying in the air men were shaking hands it did not matter with whom and bubbling over in a general incoherent babel 
 but thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly 
 gad sir gad sir sputtered the skookum bench king give you a thousand for him sir a thousand hundred sir 
 thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir the best i can do for you sir 
 buck seized hand in his teeth thornton shook him back and forth as though animated by a common impulse the onlookers drew back to a respectful distance nor were they again indiscreet enough to interrupt

 chapter 
 
 for the love of a man 
 
 
 
 when john thornton froze his feet in the previous december his partners had made him comfortable and left him to get well going on themselves up the river to get out a raft of for dawson he was still limping slightly at the time he rescued buck but with the continued warm weather even the slight limp left him and here lying by the river bank through the long spring days watching the running water listening lazily to the songs of birds and the hum of nature buck slowly won back his strength 
 a rest comes very good after one has traveled three thousand miles and it must be confessed that buck waxed lazy as his wounds healed his muscles swelled out and the flesh came back to cover his bones for that matter they were all john thornton and skeet and for the raft to come that was to carry them down to dawson skeet was a little irish setter who early made friends with buck who in a dying condition was unable to resent her first advances she had the doctor trait which some dogs possess and as a mother cat washes her kittens so she washed and cleansed wounds regularly each morning after he had finished his breakfast she performed her task till he came to look for her ministrations as much as he did for nig equally friendly though less demonstrative was a huge black dog and with eyes that laughed and a boundless good nature 
 to surprise these dogs manifested no jealousy toward him they seemed to share the kindliness and largeness of john thornton as buck grew stronger they enticed him into all sorts of ridiculous games in which thornton himself could not forbear to join and in this fashion buck romped through his convalescence and into a new existence love genuine passionate love was his for the first time this he had never experienced at judge down in the santa clara valley with the sons hunting and tramping it had been a working partnership with the grandsons a sort of pompous guardianship and with the judge himself a stately and dignified friendship but love that was feverish and burning that was adoration that was madness it had taken john thornton to arouse 
 this man had saved his life which was something but further he was the ideal master other men saw to the welfare of their dogs from a sense of duty and business expediency he saw to the welfare of his as if they were his own children because he could not help it and he saw further he never forgot a kindly greeting or a cheering word and to sit down for a long talk with he called as much his delight as theirs he had a way of taking head roughly between his hands and resting his own head upon of shaking him back and forth the while calling him ill names that to buck were love names buck knew no greater joy than that rough embrace and the sound of murmured oaths and at each jerk back and forth it seemed that his heart would be shaken out of his body so great was its ecstasy and when released he sprang to his feet his mouth laughing his eyes eloquent his throat vibrant with unuttered sound and in that fashion remained without movement john thornton would reverently exclaim god you can all but speak 
 buck had a trick of love expression that was akin to hurt he would often seize hand in his mouth and close so fiercely that the flesh bore the impress of his teeth for some time afterward and as buck understood the oaths to be love words so the man understood this feigned bite for a caress 
 for the most part however love was expressed in adoration while he went wild with happiness when thornton touched him or spoke to him he did not seek these tokens unlike skeet who was wont to shove her nose under hand and nudge and nudge till petted or nig who would stalk up and rest his great head on knee buck was content to adore at a distance he would lie by the hour eager alert at feet looking up into his face dwelling upon it studying it following with keenest interest each fleeting expression every movement or change of feature or as chance might have it he would lie farther away to the side or rear watching the outlines of the man and the occasional movements of his body and often such was the communion in which they lived the strength of gaze would draw john head around and he would return the gaze without speech his heart shining out of his eyes as heart shone out 
 for a long time after his rescue buck did not like thornton to get out of his sight from the moment he left the tent to when he entered it again buck would follow at his heels his transient masters since he had come into the northland had bred in him a fear that no master could be permanent he was afraid that thornton would pass out of his life as perrault and francois and the scotch had passed out even in the night in his dreams he was haunted by this fear at such times he would shake off sleep and creep through the chill to the flap of the tent where he would stand and listen to the sound of his breathing 
 but in spite of this great love he bore john thornton which seemed to bespeak the soft civilizing influence the strain of the primitive which the northland had aroused in him remained alive and active faithfulness and devotion things born of fire and roof were his yet he retained his wildness and wiliness he was a thing of the wild come in from the wild to sit by john fire rather than a dog of the soft southland stamped with the marks of generations of civilization because of his very great love he could not steal from this man but from any other man in any other camp he did not hesitate an instant while the cunning with which he stole enabled him to escape detection 
 his face and body were scored by the teeth of many dogs and he fought as fiercely as ever and more shrewdly skeet and nig were too for they belonged to john thornton but the strange dog no matter what the breed or valor swiftly acknowledged supremacy or found himself struggling for life with a terrible antagonist and buck was merciless he had learned well the law of club and fang and he never forewent an advantage or drew back from a foe he had started on the way to death he had lessoned from spitz and from the chief fighting dogs of the police and mail and knew there was no middle course he must master or be mastered while to show mercy was a weakness mercy did not exist in the primordial life it was misunderstood for fear and such misunderstandings made for death kill or be killed eat or be eaten was the law and this mandate down out of the depths of time he obeyed 
 he was older than the days he had seen and the breaths he had drawn he linked the past with the present and the eternity behind him throbbed through him in a mighty rhythm to which he swayed as the tides and seasons swayed he sat by john fire a dog and but behind him were the shades of all manner of dogs half wolves and wild wolves urgent and prompting tasting the savor of the meat he ate thirsting for the water he drank scenting the wind with him listening with him and telling him the sounds made by the wild life in the forest dictating his moods directing his actions lying down to sleep with him when he lay down and dreaming with him and beyond him and becoming themselves the stuff of his dreams 
 so peremptorily did these shades beckon him that each day mankind and the claims of mankind slipped farther from him deep in the forest a call was sounding and as often as he heard this call mysteriously thrilling and luring he felt compelled to turn his back upon the fire and the beaten earth around it and to plunge into the forest and on and on he knew not where or why nor did he wonder where or why the call sounding imperiously deep in the forest but as often as he gained the soft unbroken earth and the green shade the love for john thornton drew him back to the fire again 
 thornton alone held him the rest of mankind was as nothing chance travelers might praise or pet him but he was cold under it all and from a too demonstrative man he would get up and walk away when partners hans and pete arrived on the raft buck refused to notice them till he learned they were close to thornton after that he tolerated them in a passive sort of way accepting favors from them as though he favored them by accepting they were of the same large type as thornton living close to the earth thinking simply and seeing clearly and ere they swung the raft into the big eddy by the at dawson they understood buck and his ways and did not insist upon an intimacy such as obtained with skeet and nig

 the team of ten dogs was unhitched and buck with his own harness was put into the sled he had caught the contagion of the excitement and he felt that in some way he must do a great thing for john thornton murmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up he was in perfect condition without an ounce of superfluous flesh and the one hundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit and virility his furry coat shone with the sheen of silk down the neck and across the shoulders his mane in repose as it was half bristled and seemed to lift with every movement as though excess of vigor made each particular hair alive and active the great breast and heavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of his body where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin men felt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron and the odds went down to two to one 
 gad sir gad sir stuttered a member of the latest dynasty a king of the skookum benches i offer you eight hundred for him sir before the test eight hundred just as he stands 
 thornton shook his head and stepped over to side 
 you must stand off from him matthewson protested free play and plenty of room 
 the crowd fell silent only could be heard the voices of the gamblers vainly offering two to one everybody acknowledged buck a magnificent animal but twenty sacks of flour bulked too large in their eyes for them to loosen their pouch strings 
 thornton knelt down by side he took his head in his hands and rested cheek on cheek he did not playfully shake him as was his wont or murmur soft love curses but he whispered in his ear as you love me buck as you love me was what he whispered buck whined with suppressed eagerness 
 the crowd was watching curiously the affair was growing mysterious it seemed like a conjuration as thornton got to his feet buck seized his mittened hand between his jaws pressing in with his teeth and releasing slowly it was the answer in terms not of speech but of love thornton stepped well back 
 now buck he said 
 buck tightened the traces then slacked them for a matter of several inches it was the way he had learned 
 gee voice rang out sharp in the tense silence 
 buck swung to the right ending the movement in a plunge that took up the slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty pounds the load quivered and from under the runners arose a crisp crackling 
 haw thornton commanded 
 buck duplicated the maneuver this time to the left the crackling turned into a snapping the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and grating several inches to the side the sled was broken out men were holding their breaths intensely unconscious of the fact 
 now mush 
 command cracked out like a pistol shot buck threw himself forward tightening the traces with a jarring lunge his whole body was gathered compactly together in the tremendous effort the muscles writhing and knotting like live things under the silky fur his great chest was low to the ground his head forward and down while his feet were flying like mad the claws scarring the snow in parallel grooves the sled swayed and trembled forward one of his feet slipped and one man groaned aloud the sled lurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks though it never really came to a dead stop again half an inch an inch two inches the jerks perceptibly diminished as the sled gained momentum he caught them up till it was moving steadily along 
 men gasped and began to breathe again unaware that for a moment they had ceased to breathe thornton was running behind encouraging buck with short cheery words the distance had been measured off and as he neared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards a cheer began to grow and grow which burst into a roar as he passed the firewood and halted at command every man was tearing himself loose even matthewson hats and mittens were flying in the air men were shaking hands it did not matter with whom and bubbling over in a general incoherent babel 
 but thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly 
 gad sir gad sir sputtered the skookum bench king give you a thousand for him sir a thousand hundred sir 
 thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir the best i can do for you sir 
 buck seized hand in his teeth thornton shook him back and forth as though animated by a common impulse the onlookers drew back to a respectful distance nor were they again indiscreet enough to interrupt

lionfish nov chapter six gilderoy lockhartcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the next day however harry barely grinned once things started to go downhill from breakfast in the great hall the four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge plates of kippers mountains of toast and dishes of eggs and bacon beneath the enchanted ceiling today a dull cloudy gray harry and ron sat down at the gryffindor table next to hermione who had her copy of voyages with vampires propped open against a milk jug there was a slight stiffness in the way she said morning which told harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived neville longbottom on the other hand greeted them cheerfully neville was a and boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had ever met 
 
 due any minute i think sending a few things i forgot 
 
 harry had only just started his porridge when sure enough there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd a big lumpy package bounced off head and a second later something large and gray fell into jug spraying them all with milk and feathers 
 
 errol said ron pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet errol slumped unconscious onto the table his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak 
 
 oh no ron gasped 
 
 all right still alive said hermione prodding errol gently with the tip of her finger 
 
 not that that 
 
 ron was pointing at the red envelope it looked quite ordinary to harry but ron and neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode 
 
 the matter said harry 
 
 sent me a howler said ron faintly 
 
 better open it ron said neville in a timid whisper be worse if you my gran sent me one once and i ignored it and he gulped it was horrible 
 
 harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope 
 
 a howler he said 
 
 but whole attention was fixed on the letter which had begun to smoke at the corners 
 
 open it neville urged all be over in a few minutes 
 
 ron stretched out a shaking hand eased the envelope from beak and slit it open neville stuffed his fingers in his ears a split second later harry knew why he thought for a moment it had exploded a roar of sound filled the huge hall shaking dust from the ceiling 
 
 stealing the car i have been surprised if expelled you you wait till i get hold of you i suppose you stopped to think what your father and i went through when we saw it was gone 
 
 mrs weasleys yells a hundred times louder than usual made the plates and spoons rattle on the table and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls people throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the howler and ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen 
 
 letter from dumbledore last night i thought your father would die of shame we bring you up to behave like this you and harry could both have died 
 
 harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up he tried very hard to look as though he hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb 
 
 absolutely disgusted your facing an inquiry at work entirely your fault and if you put another toe out of line bring you straight back home 
 
 a ringing silence fell the red envelope which had dropped from hand burst into flames and curled into ashes harry and ron sat stunned as though a tidal wave had just passed over them a few people laughed and gradually a babble of talk broke out again 
 
 hermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the top of head 
 
 well i know what you expected ron but you 
 
 tell me i deserved it snapped ron 
 
 harry pushed his porridge away his insides were burning with guilt mr weasley was facing an inquiry at work after all mr and mrs weasley had done for him over the summer 
 
 but he had no time to dwell on this professor mcgonagall was moving along the gryffindor table handing out course schedules harry took his and saw that they had double herbology with the hufflepuffs first 
 
 harry ron and hermione left the castle together crossed the vegetable patch and made for the greenhouses where the magical plants were kept at least the howler had done one good thing hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again 
 
 as they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside waiting for professor sprout harry ron and hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart professor arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guilt harry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of its branches now in slings 
 
 professor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faint gilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming 
 
 oh hello there he called beaming around at the assembled students just been showing professor sprout the right way to doctor a whomping willow but i want you running away with the idea that better at herbology than she is i just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels 
 
 greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self 
 
 there was a murmur of interest they had only ever worked in greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants professor sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant flowers dangling from the ceiling he was about to follow ron and hermione inside when hand shot out 
 
 harry been wanting a word you mind if a couple of minutes late do you professor sprout 
 
 judging by professor scowl she did mind but lockhart said the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her face 
 
 harry said lockhart his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head harry harry harry 
 
 completely nonplussed harry said nothing 
 
 when i heard well of course it was all my fault could have kicked myself 
 
 harry had no idea what he was talking about he was about to say so when lockhart went on know when been more shocked flying a car to hogwarts well of course i knew at once why done it stood out a mile harry harry harry 
 
 it was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he talking 
 
 gave you a taste for publicity i said lockhart gave you the bug you got onto the front page of the paper with me and you wait to do it again 
 
 oh no professor see 
 
 harry harry harry said lockhart reaching out and grasping his shoulder i understand natural to want a bit more once had that first taste and i blame myself for giving you that because it was bound to go to your head but see here young man you start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed just calm down all right plenty of time for all that when older yes yes i know what thinking all right for him an internationally famous wizard when i was twelve i was just as much of a nobody as you are now in fact say i was even more of a nobody i mean a few people have heard of you they all that business with he glanced at the lightning scar on forehead i know i know not quite as good as winning witch most charming smile award five times in a row as i have but a start harry a start 
 
 he gave harry a hearty wink and strode off harry stood stunned for a few seconds then remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse he opened the door and slid inside 
 
 professor sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse about twenty pairs of ear muffs were lying on the bench when harry had taken his place between ron and hermione she said be repotting mandrakes today now who can tell me the properties of the mandrake 
 
 to surprise hand was first into the air 
 
 mandrake or mandragora is a powerful restorative said hermione sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook it is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state 
 
 excellent ten points to gryffindor said professor sprout the mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes it is also however dangerous who can tell me why 
 
 hand narrowly missed glasses as it shot up again 
 
 the cry of the mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it she said promptly 
 
 precisely take another ten points said professor sprout now the mandrakes we have here are still very young 
 
 she pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke and everyone shuffled forward for a better look a hundred or so tufty little plants purplish green in color were growing there in rows they looked quite unremarkable to harry who have the slightest idea what hermione meant by the cry of the mandrake 
 
 everyone take a pair of earmuffs said professor sprout 
 
 there was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that pink and fluffy 
 
 when i tell you to put them on make sure your ears are completely covered said professor sprout when it is safe to remove them i will give you the right earmuffs on 
 
 harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears they shut out sound completely professor sprout put the pink fluffy pair over her own ears rolled up the sleeves of her robes grasped one of the tufty plants firmly and pulled hard 
 
 harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear 
 
 instead of roots a small muddy and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth the leaves were growing right out of his head he had pale green mottled skin and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs 
 
 professor sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the mandrake into it burying him in dark damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible professor sprout dusted off her hands gave them all the and removed her own earmuffs 
 
 as our mandrakes are only seedlings their cries kill yet she said calmly as though just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia however they will knock you out for several hours and as sure none of you want to miss your first day back make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work i will attract your attention when it is time to pack up 
 
 four to a tray there is a large supply of pots here compost in the sacks over there and be careful of the venemous tentacula teething 
 
 she gave a sharp slap to a spiky dark red plant as she spoke making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder 
 
 harry ron and hermione were joined at their tray by a hufflepuff boy harry knew by sight but had never spoken to 
 
 justin he said brightly shaking harry by the hand know who you are of course the famous harry potter and hermione granger always top in everything hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too and ron weasley that your flying car 
 
 ron smile the howler was obviously still on his mind 
 
 that something he said justin happily as they began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost awfully brave chap have you read his books have died of fear if id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf but he stayed cool and zap just fantastic 
 
 my name was down for eton you know i tell you how glad i am i came here instead of course mother was slightly disappointed but since i made her read books i think begun to see how useful be to have a fully trained wizard in the family 
 
 after that they have much chance to talk their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the mandrakes professor sprout had made it look extremely easy but it the mandrakes like coming out of the earth but seem to want to go back into it either they squirmed kicked flailed their sharp little fists and gnashed their teeth harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot 
 
 by the end of the class harry like everyone else was sweaty aching and covered in earth everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the gryffindors hurried off to transfiguration 
 
 professor classes were always hard work but today was especially difficult everything harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer he was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand 
 
 ron was having far worse problems he had patched up his wand with some borrowed spellotape but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair it kept crackling and sparking at odd moments and every time ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs unable to see what he was doing ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one professor mcgonagall pleased 
 
 harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell his brain felt like a wrung sponge everyone filed out of the classroom except him and ron who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk 
 
 stupid useless thing 
 
 write home for another one harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker 
 
 oh yeah and get another howler back said ron stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag your own fault your wand got snapped 
 
 they went down to lunch where mood was not improved by showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in transfiguration 
 
 we got this afternoon said harry hastily changing the subject 
 
 defense against the dark arts said hermione at once 
 
 why demanded ron seizing her schedule have you outlined all lessons in little hearts 
 
 hermione snatched the schedule back blushing furiously 
 
 they finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in voyages with vampires again harry and ron stood talking about quidditch for several minutes before harry became aware that he was being closely watched looking up he saw the very small boy seen trying on the sorting hat last night staring at harry as though transfixed he was clutching what looked like an ordinary muggle camera and the moment harry looked at him he went bright red 
 
 all right harry colin creevey he said breathlessly taking a tentative step forward in gryffindor too think would it be all right if can i have a picture he said raising the camera hopefully 
 
 a picture harry repeated blankly 
 
 so i can prove met you said colin creevey eagerly edging further forward i know all about you told me about how you survived when tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how still got a lightning scar on your forehead his eyes raked hairline and a boy in my dormitory said if i develop the film in the right potion the move colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said amazing here it i never knew all the odd stuff i could do was magic till i got the letter from hogwarts my a milkman he believe it either so taking loads of pictures to send home to him and be really good if i had one of you he looked imploringly at harry maybe your friend could take it and i could stand next to you and then could you sign it 
 
 signed photos giving out signed photos potter 
 
 loud and scathing draco voice echoed around the courtyard he had stopped right behind colin flanked as he always was at hogwarts by his large and thuggish cronies crabbe and goyle 
 
 everyone line up malfoy roared to the crowd harry giving out signed photos 
 
 no not said harry angrily his fists clenching shut up malfoy 
 
 just jealous piped up colin whose entire body was about as thick as neck 
 
 jealous said malfoy who need to shout anymore half the courtyard was listening in of what i want a foul scar right across my head thanks i think getting your head cut open makes you that special myself 
 
 crabbe and goyle were sniggering stupidly 
 
 eat slugs malfoy said ron angrily crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way 
 
 be careful weasley sneered malfoy you want to start any trouble or your have to come and take you away from school he put on a shrill piercing voice if you put another toe out of line 
 
 
 
 a knot of slytherin nearby laughed loudly at this 
 
 weasley would like a signed photo potter smirked malfoy be worth more than his whole house 
 
 ron whipped out his spellotaped wand but hermione shut voyages with vampires with a snap and whispered look out 
 
 all this all this gilderoy lockhart was striding toward them his turquoise robes swirling behind him giving out signed photos 
 
 harry started to speak but he was cut short as lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially have asked we meet again harry 
 
 pinned to side and burning with humiliation harry saw malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd 
 
 come on then mr creevey said lockhart beaming at colin a double portrait do better than that and both sign it for you 
 
 colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them signaling the start of afternoon classes 
 
 off you go move along there lockhart called to the crowd and he set off back to the castle with harry who was wishing he knew a good vanishing spell still clasped to his side 
 
 a word to the wise harry said lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door i covered up for you back there with young creevey if he was photographing me too your schoolmates think setting yourself up so much 
 
 deaf to stammers lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase 
 
 let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career sensible looks a tad bigheaded harry to be frank there may well come a time when like me need to keep a stack handy wherever you go but he gave a little chortle i think quite there yet 
 
 they had reached classroom and he let harry go at last harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class where he busied himself with piling all seven of books in front of him so that he could avoid looking at the real thing 
 
 the rest of the class came clattering in and ron and hermione sat down on either side of harry 
 
 you fried an egg on your face said ron better hope creevey meet ginny or be starting a harry potter fan club 
 
 shut up snapped harry the last thing he needed was for lockhart to hear the phrase harry potter fan club 
 
 when the whole class was seated lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell he reached forward picked up neville copy of travels with trolls and held it up to show his own winking portrait on the front 
 
 me he said pointing at it and winking as well gilderoy lockhart order of merlin third class honorary member of the dark force defense league and winner of witch most charming smile award but i talk about that i get rid of the bandon banshee by smiling at her 
 
 he waited for them to laugh a few people smiled weakly 
 
 i see all bought a complete set of my books well done i thought start today with a little quiz nothing to worry about just to check how well read them how much taken in 
 
 when he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said you have thirty minutes start now 
 
 harry looked down at his paper and read 
 
 
 what is gilderoy lockhart s favorite color 
 
 what is gilderoy secret ambition 
 
 what in your opinion is gilderoy greatest achievement to date 
 
 on and on it went over three sides of paper right down to 
 
 when is gilderoy birthday and what would his ideal gift be 
 
 half an hour later lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class 
 
 tut tut hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac i say so in year with the yeti and a few of you need to read wanderings with werewolves more carefully i clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and peoples though i say no to a large bottle of ogdeds old firewhisky 
 
 he gave them another roguish wink ron was now staring at lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were sitting in front were shaking with silent laughter hermione on the other hand was listening to lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name 
 
 but miss hermione granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of potions good girl in fact he flipped her paper over full marks where is miss hermione granger 
 
 hermione raised a trembling hand 
 
 excellent beamed lockhart quite excellent take ten points for gryffindor and so to business 
 
 he bent down behind his desk and lifted a large covered cage onto it 
 
 now be warned it is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind you may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room know only that no harm can befall you whilst i am here all i ask is that you remain calm 
 
 in spite of himself harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage lockhart placed a hand on the cover dean and seamus had stopped laughing now neville was cowering in his front row seat 
 
 i must ask you not to scream said lockhart in a low voice it might provoke them 
 
 as the whole class held its breath lockhart whipped off the cover 
 
 yes he said dramatically freshly caught cornish pixies 
 
 seamus finnigan control himself he let out a snort of laughter that even lockhart mistake for a scream of terror 
 
 yes he smiled at seamus 
 
 well not not very dangerous are they seamus choked 
 
 be so sure said lockhart waggling a finger annoyingly at seamus devilish tricky little blighters they can be 
 
 the pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing the moment the cover had been removed they had started jabbering and rocketing around rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them 
 
 right then lockhart said loudly see what you make of them and he opened the cage 
 
 it was pandemonium the pixies shot in every direction like rockets two of them seized neville by the ears and lifted him into the air several shot straight through the window showering the back row with broken glass the rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino they grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them shredded books and papers tore pictures from the walls the waste basket grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window within minutes half the class was sheltering under desks and neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling 
 
 come on now round them up round them up only pixies lockhart shouted 
 
 he rolled up his sleeves brandished his wand and bellowed peskipiksi pesternomi 
 
 it had absolutely no effect one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window too lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk narrowly avoiding being squashed by neville who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way 
 
 the bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit in the relative calm that followed lockhart straightened up caught sight of harry ron and hermione who were almost at the door and said well ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage he swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him 
 
 can you believe him roared ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear 
 
 he just wants to give us some experience said hermione immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever freezing charm and stuffing them back into their cage 
 
 hands on said harry who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out hermione he have a clue what he was doing 
 
 rubbish said hermione read his books look at all those amazing things done 
 
 he says done ron muttered 
 
 rowling

 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter six gilderoy lockhartcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the next day however harry barely grinned once things started to go downhill from breakfast in the great hall the four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge plates of kippers mountains of toast and dishes of eggs and bacon beneath the enchanted ceiling today a dull cloudy gray harry and ron sat down at the gryffindor table next to hermione who had her copy of voyages with vampires propped open against a milk jug there was a slight stiffness in the way she said morning which told harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived neville longbottom on the other hand greeted them cheerfully neville was a and boy with the worst memory of anyone harry had ever met 
 
 due any minute i think sending a few things i forgot 
 
 harry had only just started his porridge when sure enough there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd a big lumpy package bounced off head and a second later something large and gray fell into jug spraying them all with milk and feathers 
 
 errol said ron pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet errol slumped unconscious onto the table his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak 
 
 oh no ron gasped 
 
 all right still alive said hermione prodding errol gently with the tip of her finger 
 
 not that that 
 
 ron was pointing at the red envelope it looked quite ordinary to harry but ron and neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode 
 
 the matter said harry 
 
 sent me a howler said ron faintly 
 
 better open it ron said neville in a timid whisper be worse if you my gran sent me one once and i ignored it and he gulped it was horrible 
 
 harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope 
 
 a howler he said 
 
 but whole attention was fixed on the letter which had begun to smoke at the corners 
 
 open it neville urged all be over in a few minutes 
 
 ron stretched out a shaking hand eased the envelope from beak and slit it open neville stuffed his fingers in his ears a split second later harry knew why he thought for a moment it had exploded a roar of sound filled the huge hall shaking dust from the ceiling 
 
 stealing the car i have been surprised if expelled you you wait till i get hold of you i suppose you stopped to think what your father and i went through when we saw it was gone 
 
 mrs weasleys yells a hundred times louder than usual made the plates and spoons rattle on the table and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls people throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the howler and ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen 
 
 letter from dumbledore last night i thought your father would die of shame we bring you up to behave like this you and harry could both have died 
 
 harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up he tried very hard to look as though he hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb 
 
 absolutely disgusted your facing an inquiry at work entirely your fault and if you put another toe out of line bring you straight back home 
 
 a ringing silence fell the red envelope which had dropped from hand burst into flames and curled into ashes harry and ron sat stunned as though a tidal wave had just passed over them a few people laughed and gradually a babble of talk broke out again 
 
 hermione closed voyages with vampires and looked down at the top of head 
 
 well i know what you expected ron but you 
 
 tell me i deserved it snapped ron 
 
 harry pushed his porridge away his insides were burning with guilt mr weasley was facing an inquiry at work after all mr and mrs weasley had done for him over the summer 
 
 but he had no time to dwell on this professor mcgonagall was moving along the gryffindor table handing out course schedules harry took his and saw that they had double herbology with the hufflepuffs first 
 
 harry ron and hermione left the castle together crossed the vegetable patch and made for the greenhouses where the magical plants were kept at least the howler had done one good thing hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again 
 
 as they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside waiting for professor sprout harry ron and hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn accompanied by gilderoy lockhart professor arms were full of bandages and with another twinge of guilt harry spotted the whomping willow in the distance several of its branches now in slings 
 
 professor sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made aunt petunia faint gilderoy lockhart however was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming 
 
 oh hello there he called beaming around at the assembled students just been showing professor sprout the right way to doctor a whomping willow but i want you running away with the idea that better at herbology than she is i just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels 
 
 greenhouse three today chaps said professor sprout who was looking distinctly disgruntled not at all her usual cheerful self 
 
 there was a murmur of interest they had only ever worked in greenhouse one before greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants professor sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant flowers dangling from the ceiling he was about to follow ron and hermione inside when hand shot out 
 
 harry been wanting a word you mind if a couple of minutes late do you professor sprout 
 
 judging by professor scowl she did mind but lockhart said the ticket and closed the greenhouse door in her face 
 
 harry said lockhart his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head harry harry harry 
 
 completely nonplussed harry said nothing 
 
 when i heard well of course it was all my fault could have kicked myself 
 
 harry had no idea what he was talking about he was about to say so when lockhart went on know when been more shocked flying a car to hogwarts well of course i knew at once why done it stood out a mile harry harry harry 
 
 it was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he talking 
 
 gave you a taste for publicity i said lockhart gave you the bug you got onto the front page of the paper with me and you wait to do it again 
 
 oh no professor see 
 
 harry harry harry said lockhart reaching out and grasping his shoulder i understand natural to want a bit more once had that first taste and i blame myself for giving you that because it was bound to go to your head but see here young man you start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed just calm down all right plenty of time for all that when older yes yes i know what thinking all right for him an internationally famous wizard when i was twelve i was just as much of a nobody as you are now in fact say i was even more of a nobody i mean a few people have heard of you they all that business with he glanced at the lightning scar on forehead i know i know not quite as good as winning witch most charming smile award five times in a row as i have but a start harry a start 
 
 he gave harry a hearty wink and strode off harry stood stunned for a few seconds then remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse he opened the door and slid inside 
 
 professor sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse about twenty pairs of ear muffs were lying on the bench when harry had taken his place between ron and hermione she said be repotting mandrakes today now who can tell me the properties of the mandrake 
 
 to surprise hand was first into the air 
 
 mandrake or mandragora is a powerful restorative said hermione sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook it is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state 
 
 excellent ten points to gryffindor said professor sprout the mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes it is also however dangerous who can tell me why 
 
 hand narrowly missed glasses as it shot up again 
 
 the cry of the mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it she said promptly 
 
 precisely take another ten points said professor sprout now the mandrakes we have here are still very young 
 
 she pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke and everyone shuffled forward for a better look a hundred or so tufty little plants purplish green in color were growing there in rows they looked quite unremarkable to harry who have the slightest idea what hermione meant by the cry of the mandrake 
 
 everyone take a pair of earmuffs said professor sprout 
 
 there was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that pink and fluffy 
 
 when i tell you to put them on make sure your ears are completely covered said professor sprout when it is safe to remove them i will give you the right earmuffs on 
 
 harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears they shut out sound completely professor sprout put the pink fluffy pair over her own ears rolled up the sleeves of her robes grasped one of the tufty plants firmly and pulled hard 
 
 harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear 
 
 instead of roots a small muddy and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth the leaves were growing right out of his head he had pale green mottled skin and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs 
 
 professor sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the mandrake into it burying him in dark damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible professor sprout dusted off her hands gave them all the and removed her own earmuffs 
 
 as our mandrakes are only seedlings their cries kill yet she said calmly as though just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia however they will knock you out for several hours and as sure none of you want to miss your first day back make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work i will attract your attention when it is time to pack up 
 
 four to a tray there is a large supply of pots here compost in the sacks over there and be careful of the venemous tentacula teething 
 
 she gave a sharp slap to a spiky dark red plant as she spoke making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder 
 
 harry ron and hermione were joined at their tray by a hufflepuff boy harry knew by sight but had never spoken to 
 
 justin he said brightly shaking harry by the hand know who you are of course the famous harry potter and hermione granger always top in everything hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too and ron weasley that your flying car 
 
 ron smile the howler was obviously still on his mind 
 
 that something he said justin happily as they began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost awfully brave chap have you read his books have died of fear if id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf but he stayed cool and zap just fantastic 
 
 my name was down for eton you know i tell you how glad i am i came here instead of course mother was slightly disappointed but since i made her read books i think begun to see how useful be to have a fully trained wizard in the family 
 
 after that they have much chance to talk their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the mandrakes professor sprout had made it look extremely easy but it the mandrakes like coming out of the earth but seem to want to go back into it either they squirmed kicked flailed their sharp little fists and gnashed their teeth harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot 
 
 by the end of the class harry like everyone else was sweaty aching and covered in earth everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the gryffindors hurried off to transfiguration 
 
 professor classes were always hard work but today was especially difficult everything harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer he was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand 
 
 ron was having far worse problems he had patched up his wand with some borrowed spellotape but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair it kept crackling and sparking at odd moments and every time ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs unable to see what he was doing ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one professor mcgonagall pleased 
 
 harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell his brain felt like a wrung sponge everyone filed out of the classroom except him and ron who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk 
 
 stupid useless thing 
 
 write home for another one harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker 
 
 oh yeah and get another howler back said ron stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag your own fault your wand got snapped 
 
 they went down to lunch where mood was not improved by showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in transfiguration 
 
 we got this afternoon said harry hastily changing the subject 
 
 defense against the dark arts said hermione at once 
 
 why demanded ron seizing her schedule have you outlined all lessons in little hearts 
 
 hermione snatched the schedule back blushing furiously 
 
 they finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in voyages with vampires again harry and ron stood talking about quidditch for several minutes before harry became aware that he was being closely watched looking up he saw the very small boy seen trying on the sorting hat last night staring at harry as though transfixed he was clutching what looked like an ordinary muggle camera and the moment harry looked at him he went bright red 
 
 all right harry colin creevey he said breathlessly taking a tentative step forward in gryffindor too think would it be all right if can i have a picture he said raising the camera hopefully 
 
 a picture harry repeated blankly 
 
 so i can prove met you said colin creevey eagerly edging further forward i know all about you told me about how you survived when tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how still got a lightning scar on your forehead his eyes raked hairline and a boy in my dormitory said if i develop the film in the right potion the move colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said amazing here it i never knew all the odd stuff i could do was magic till i got the letter from hogwarts my a milkman he believe it either so taking loads of pictures to send home to him and be really good if i had one of you he looked imploringly at harry maybe your friend could take it and i could stand next to you and then could you sign it 
 
 signed photos giving out signed photos potter 
 
 loud and scathing draco voice echoed around the courtyard he had stopped right behind colin flanked as he always was at hogwarts by his large and thuggish cronies crabbe and goyle 
 
 everyone line up malfoy roared to the crowd harry giving out signed photos 
 
 no not said harry angrily his fists clenching shut up malfoy 
 
 just jealous piped up colin whose entire body was about as thick as neck 
 
 jealous said malfoy who need to shout anymore half the courtyard was listening in of what i want a foul scar right across my head thanks i think getting your head cut open makes you that special myself 
 
 crabbe and goyle were sniggering stupidly 
 
 eat slugs malfoy said ron angrily crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way 
 
 be careful weasley sneered malfoy you want to start any trouble or your have to come and take you away from school he put on a shrill piercing voice if you put another toe out of line 
 
 
 
 a knot of slytherin nearby laughed loudly at this 
 
 weasley would like a signed photo potter smirked malfoy be worth more than his whole house 
 
 ron whipped out his spellotaped wand but hermione shut voyages with vampires with a snap and whispered look out 
 
 all this all this gilderoy lockhart was striding toward them his turquoise robes swirling behind him giving out signed photos 
 
 harry started to speak but he was cut short as lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially have asked we meet again harry 
 
 pinned to side and burning with humiliation harry saw malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd 
 
 come on then mr creevey said lockhart beaming at colin a double portrait do better than that and both sign it for you 
 
 colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them signaling the start of afternoon classes 
 
 off you go move along there lockhart called to the crowd and he set off back to the castle with harry who was wishing he knew a good vanishing spell still clasped to his side 
 
 a word to the wise harry said lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door i covered up for you back there with young creevey if he was photographing me too your schoolmates think setting yourself up so much 
 
 deaf to stammers lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase 
 
 let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career sensible looks a tad bigheaded harry to be frank there may well come a time when like me need to keep a stack handy wherever you go but he gave a little chortle i think quite there yet 
 
 they had reached classroom and he let harry go at last harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class where he busied himself with piling all seven of books in front of him so that he could avoid looking at the real thing 
 
 the rest of the class came clattering in and ron and hermione sat down on either side of harry 
 
 you fried an egg on your face said ron better hope creevey meet ginny or be starting a harry potter fan club 
 
 shut up snapped harry the last thing he needed was for lockhart to hear the phrase harry potter fan club 
 
 when the whole class was seated lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell he reached forward picked up neville copy of travels with trolls and held it up to show his own winking portrait on the front 
 
 me he said pointing at it and winking as well gilderoy lockhart order of merlin third class honorary member of the dark force defense league and winner of witch most charming smile award but i talk about that i get rid of the bandon banshee by smiling at her 
 
 he waited for them to laugh a few people smiled weakly 
 
 i see all bought a complete set of my books well done i thought start today with a little quiz nothing to worry about just to check how well read them how much taken in 
 
 when he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said you have thirty minutes start now 
 
 harry looked down at his paper and read 
 
 
 what is gilderoy lockhart s favorite color 
 
 what is gilderoy secret ambition 
 
 what in your opinion is gilderoy greatest achievement to date 
 
 on and on it went over three sides of paper right down to 
 
 when is gilderoy birthday and what would his ideal gift be 
 
 half an hour later lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class 
 
 tut tut hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac i say so in year with the yeti and a few of you need to read wanderings with werewolves more carefully i clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and peoples though i say no to a large bottle of ogdeds old firewhisky 
 
 he gave them another roguish wink ron was now staring at lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were sitting in front were shaking with silent laughter hermione on the other hand was listening to lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name 
 
 but miss hermione granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of potions good girl in fact he flipped her paper over full marks where is miss hermione granger 
 
 hermione raised a trembling hand 
 
 excellent beamed lockhart quite excellent take ten points for gryffindor and so to business 
 
 he bent down behind his desk and lifted a large covered cage onto it 
 
 now be warned it is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind you may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room know only that no harm can befall you whilst i am here all i ask is that you remain calm 
 
 in spite of himself harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage lockhart placed a hand on the cover dean and seamus had stopped laughing now neville was cowering in his front row seat 
 
 i must ask you not to scream said lockhart in a low voice it might provoke them 
 
 as the whole class held its breath lockhart whipped off the cover 
 
 yes he said dramatically freshly caught cornish pixies 
 
 seamus finnigan control himself he let out a snort of laughter that even lockhart mistake for a scream of terror 
 
 yes he smiled at seamus 
 
 well not not very dangerous are they seamus choked 
 
 be so sure said lockhart waggling a finger annoyingly at seamus devilish tricky little blighters they can be 
 
 the pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing the moment the cover had been removed they had started jabbering and rocketing around rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them 
 
 right then lockhart said loudly see what you make of them and he opened the cage 
 
 it was pandemonium the pixies shot in every direction like rockets two of them seized neville by the ears and lifted him into the air several shot straight through the window showering the back row with broken glass the rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino they grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them shredded books and papers tore pictures from the walls the waste basket grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window within minutes half the class was sheltering under desks and neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling 
 
 come on now round them up round them up only pixies lockhart shouted 
 
 he rolled up his sleeves brandished his wand and bellowed peskipiksi pesternomi 
 
 it had absolutely no effect one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window too lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk narrowly avoiding being squashed by neville who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way 
 
 the bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit in the relative calm that followed lockhart straightened up caught sight of harry ron and hermione who were almost at the door and said well ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage he swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him 
 
 can you believe him roared ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear 
 
 he just wants to give us some experience said hermione immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever freezing charm and stuffing them back into their cage 
 
 hands on said harry who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out hermione he have a clue what he was doing 
 
 rubbish said hermione read his books look at all those amazing things done 
 
 he says done ron muttered 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter six talons and tea leavescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 when harry ron and hermione entered the great hall for breakfast the next day the first thing they saw was draco malfoy who seemed to be entertaining a large group of slytherins with a very funny story as they passed malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter 
 
 ignore him said hermione who was right behind harry just ignore him not worth it 
 
 hey potter shrieked pansy parkinson a slytherin girl with a face like a pug potter the dementors are coming potter woooooooooo 
 
 harry dropped into a seat at the gryffindor table next to george weasley 
 
 new course schedules said george passing then over up with you harry 
 
 malfoy said ron sitting down on other side and glaring over at the slytherin table 
 
 george looked up in time to see malfoy pretending to faint with terror again 
 
 that little git he said calmly he so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train came running into our compartment he fred 
 
 nearly wet himself said fred with a contemptuous glance at malfoy 
 
 i too happy myself said george horrible things those dementors 
 
 sort of freeze your insides they said fred 
 
 you pass out though did you said harry in a low voice 
 
 forget it harry said george bracingly dad had to go out to azkaban one time remember fred and he said it was the worst place ever been he came back all weak and shakingthey suck the happiness out of a place dementors most of the prisoners go mad in there 
 
 anyway see how happy malfoy looks after our first quidditch match said fred gryffindor versus slytherin first game of the season remember 
 
 the only time harry and malfoy had faced each other in a quidditch match malfoy had definitely come off worse feeling slightly more cheerful harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes 
 
 hermione was examining her new schedule 
 
 ooh good starting some new subjects today she said happily 
 
 hermione said ron frowning as he looked over her shoulder messed up your timetable look got you down for about ten subjects a day there enough time 
 
 manage fixed it all with professor mcgonagall 
 
 but look said ron laughing see this morning nine divination and underneath nine muggle studies and ron leaned closer to the timetable disbelieving look underneath that arithmancy nine i mean i know good hermione but no that good you supposed to be in three classes at once 
 
 be silly said hermione shortly of course i be in three classes at once 
 
 well then 
 
 pass the marmalade said hermione 
 
 but 
 
 oh ron it to you if my a bit full hermione snapped i told you fixed it all with professor mcgonagall 
 
 just then hagrid entered the great hall he was wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was swinging a dead polecat from one enormous hand 
 
 all righ he said eagerly pausing on his way to the staff table yer in my firs ever lesson right after lunch bin up since five getting everthin readyhope okme a 
 
 he grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table still swinging the polecat 
 
 wonder what been getting ready said ron a note of anxiety in his voice 
 
 the hall was starting to empty as people headed off towards their first lesson ron checked his schedule 
 
 better go look at the top of north tower take us ten minutes to get there 
 
 they finished breakfast hastily said goodbye to fred and george and walked back through the hall as they passed the slytherin table malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit the shouts of laughter followed harry into the entrance hall 
 
 the journey through the castle to north tower was a long one two years at hogwarts taught them everything about the castle and they had never been inside north tower before 
 
 got to be a short cut ron panted as they climbed the seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing where there was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall 
 
 i think this way said hermione peering down the empty passage to the right 
 
 be said ron south look you can see a bit of the lake outside the window 
 
 harry was watching the painting a fat pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly harry was used to the subjects of hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit each other but he always enjoyed watching them a moment later a short squat knight in a suit of armour had clanked into the picture after his pony by the look of the grass stains on his metal knees he had just fallen off 
 
 aha he yelled seeing harry ron and hermione what villains are these that trespass upon my private lands come to scorn at my fall perchance draw you knaves you dogs 
 
 they watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently hopping up and down in rage but the sword was too long for him a particularly wild swing made him overbalance and he landed facedown in the grass 
 
 are you all right said harry moving closer to the picture 
 
 get back you scurvy braggart back you rogue 
 
 the knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up but the blade sank deeply into the grass and though he pulled with all his might he get it out again finally he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face 
 
 listen said harry taking advantage of the exhaustion looking for the north tower you know the way do you 
 
 a quest the rage seemed to vanish instantly he clanked to his feet and shouted come follow me dear friends and we shall find our goal or else shall perish bravely in the charge 
 
 he gave the sword another fruitless tug tried and failed to mount the fat pony gave up and cried on foot then good sirs and gentle lady on on 
 
 and he ran clanking loudly into the left side of the frame and out of sight 
 
 they hurried after him along the corridor following the sound of his armor every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead 
 
 be of stout heart the worst is yet to come yelled the knight and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase 
 
 puffing loudly harry ron and hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps getting dizzier and dizzier until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom 
 
 farewell cried the knight popping his head into a painting of some monks farewell my if ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew call upon sir cadogan 
 
 yeah call you muttered ron as the knight disappeared if we ever need someone mental 
 
 they climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing where most of the class was already assembled there were no doors off this landing but ron nudged harry and pointed at the ceiling where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it 
 
 sibyll trelawney divination teacher harry read we supposed to get up there 
 
 as though in answer to his question the trapdoor suddenly opened and a silvery ladder descended right at feet everyone got quiet 
 
 after you said ron grinning so harry climbed the ladder first 
 
 he emerged into the classroom he had ever seen in fact it look like a classroom at all more like a cross between attic and an tea shop at least twenty small circular tables were crammed inside it all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs everything was lit with a dim crimson light the curtains at the windows were all closed and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves it was stiflingly warm and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle the shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with feathers stubs of candles many packs of tattered playing cards countless silvery crystal balls and a huge array of teacups 
 
 ron appeared at shoulder as the class assembled around them all talking in whispers 
 
 where is she ron said 
 
 a voice came suddenly out of the shadows a soft misty sort of voice 
 
 welcome it said how nice to see you in the physical world at last 
 
 immediate impression was of a large glittering insect professor trelawney moved into the firelight and they saw that she was very thin her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings 
 
 sit my children sit she said and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs harry ron and hermione sat themselves around the same round table 
 
 welcome to divination said professor trelawney who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire my name is professor trelawney you may not have seen me before i find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my inner eye 
 
 nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement professor trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued so you have chosen to study divination the most difficult of all magical arts i must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the sight there is very little i will be able to teach youbooks can take you only so far in this field 
 
 at these words both harry and ron glanced grinning at hermione who looked startled at the news that books be much help in this subject 
 
 many witches and wizards talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future professor trelawney went on her enormous gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face it is a gift granted to few you boy she said suddenly to neville who almost toppled off his pouf is your grandmother well 
 
 i think so said neville tremulously 
 
 i be so sure if i were you dear said professor trelawney the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings neville gulped professor trelawney continued placidly we will be covering the basic methods of divination this year the first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves next term we shall progress to palmistry by the way my dear she shot suddenly at parvati patil beware a man 
 
 parvati gave a startled look at ron who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him 
 
 in the second term professor trelawney went on we shall progress to the crystal ball if we have finished with fire omens that is unfortunately classes will be disrupted in february by a nasty bout of flu i myself will lose my voice and around easter one of our number will leave us for ever 
 
 a very tense silence followed this pronouncement but professor trelawney seemed unaware of it 
 
 i wonder dear she said to lavender brown who was nearest and shrank back in her chair if you could pass me the largest silver teapot 
 
 lavender looking relieved stood up took an enormous teapot from the shelf and put it down on the table in front of professor trelawney 
 
 thank you my dear incidentally that thing you are dreading it will happen on friday the sixteenth of october 
 
 lavender trembled 
 
 now i want you all to divide into pairs collect a teacup from the shelf come to me and i will fill it then sit down and drink drink until only the dregs remain swill these around the cup three times with the left hand then turn the cup upside down on its saucer wait for the last of the tea to drain away then give your cup to your partner to read you will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of unfogging the future i shall move among you helping and instructing oh and dear she caught neville by the arm as he made to stand up after broken your first cup would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones rather attached to the pink 
 
 sure enough neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china professor trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said one of the blue ones then dear if you mindthank you 
 
 when harry and ron had had their teacups filled they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly they swilled the dregs around as professor trelawney had instructed then drained the cups and swapped over 
 
 right said ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six what can you see in mine 
 
 a load of soggy brown stuff said harry the heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid 
 
 broaden your minds my dears and allow your eyes to see past the mundane professor trelawney cried through the gloom 
 
 harry tried to pull himself together 
 
 right got a crooked sort of cross he consulted unfogging the future that means going to have trials and suffering sorry about that but a thing that could be the sun hang onthat means great going to suffer but be very happy 
 
 you need your inner eye tested if you ask me said ron and they both had to stifle their laughs as professor trelawney gazed in their direction 
 
 my turn ron peered into teacup his forehead wrinkled with effort a blob a bit like a bowler hat he said maybe going to work for the ministry of magic 
 
 he turned the teacup the other way up 
 
 but this way it looks more like an that he scanned his copy of unfogging the future a windfall unexpected gold excellent you can lend me some and a thing here he turned the cup again that looks like an animalyeah if that was its headit looks like a hippono a sheep 
 
 professor trelawney whirled around as harry let out a snort of laughter 
 
 let me see that my dear she said reprovingly to ron sweeping over and snatching cup from him everyone went quiet to watch 
 
 professor trelawney was staring into the teacup rotating it counterclockwise 
 
 the falconmy dear you have a deadly enemy 
 
 but everyone knows that said hermione in a loud whisper professor trelawney stared at her 
 
 well they do said hermione everybody knows about harry and 
 
 harry and ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration they had never heard hermione speak to a teacher like that before professor trelawney chose not to reply she lowered her huge eyes to cup again and continued to turn it 
 
 the cluban attack dear dear this is not a happy cup 
 
 i thought that was a bowler hat said ron sheepishly 
 
 the skulldanger in your path my dear 
 
 everyone was staring transfixed at professor trelawney who gave the cup a final turn gasped and then screamed 
 
 there was another tinkle of breaking china neville had smashed his second cup professor trelawney sank into a vacant armchair her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed 
 
 my dear boy my poor dear boy no it is kinder not to say no ask me 
 
 what is it professor said dean thomas at once everyone had got to their feet and slowly they crowded around harry and table pressing close to professor chair to get a good look at cup 
 
 my dear professor huge eyes opened dramatically you have the grim 
 
 the what said harry 
 
 he could tell that he the only one who understand dean thomas shrugged at him and lavender brown looked puzzled but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror 
 
 the grim my dear the grim cried professor trelawney who looked shocked that harry understood the giant spectral dog that haunts churchyards my dear boy it is an omen the worst omen of death 
 
 stomach lurched that dog on the cover of death omens in flourish and blotts the dog in the shadows of magnolia crescentlavender brown clapped her hands to her mouth too everyone was looking at harry everyone except hermione who had gotten up and moved around to the back of professor chair 
 
 i think it looks like a grim she said flatly 
 
 professor trelawney surveyed hermione with mounting dislike 
 
 forgive me for saying so my dear but i perceive very little aura around you very little receptivity to the resonances of the future 
 
 seamus finnigan was tilting his head from side to side 
 
 it looks like a grim if you do this he said with his eyes almost shut but it looks more like a donkey from here he said leaning to the left 
 
 when all finished deciding whether going to die or not said harry taking even himself by surprise now nobody seemed to want to look at him 
 
 i think we will leave the lesson here for today said professor trelawney in her mistiest voice yesplease pack away your things 
 
 silently the class took their teacups back to professor trelawney packed away their books and closed their bags even ron was avoiding eyes 
 
 until we meet again said professor trelawney faintly fair fortune be yours oh and dear she pointed at neville be late next time so mind you work to catch up 
 
 harry ron and hermione descended professor ladder and the winding stair in silence then set off for professor transfiguration lesson it took them so long to find her classroom that early as they had left divination they were only just in time 
 
 harry chose a seat right at the back of the room feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him as though he were about to drop dead at any moment he hardly heard what professor mcgonagall was telling them about animagi wizards who could transform at will into animals and even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes 
 
 really what has got into you all today said professor mcgonagall turning back into herself with a faint pop and staring around at them all not that it matters but the first time my not got applause from a class 
 
 heads turned toward harry again but nobody spoke then hermione raised her hand 
 
 please professor just had our first divination class and we were reading the tea leaves and 
 
 ah of course said professor mcgonagall suddenly frowning there is no need to say any more miss granger tell me which of you will be dying this year 
 
 everyone stared at her 
 
 me said harry finally 
 
 i see said professor mcgonagall fixing harry with her beady eyes then you should know potter that sibyll trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school none of them has died yet seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class if it were not for the fact that i never speak ill of my colleagues professor mcgonagall broke off and they saw that her nostrils had gone white she went on more calmly divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic i shall not conceal from you that i have very little patience with it true seers are very rare and professor trelawney 
 
 she stopped again and then said in a very tone you look in excellent health to me potter so you will excuse me if i let you off homework today i assure you that if you die you need not hand it in 
 
 hermione laughed harry felt a bit better it was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of professor classroom not everyone was convinced however ron still looked worried and lavender whispered but what about cup 
 
 when the transfiguration class had finished they joined the crowd thundering toward the great hall for lunch 
 
 ron cheer up said hermione pushing a dish of stew toward him you heard what professor mcgonagall said 
 
 ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but start 
 
 harry he said in a low serious voice you seen a great black dog anywhere have you 
 
 yeah i have said harry i saw one the night i left the dursleys 
 
 ron let his fork fall with a clatter 
 
 probably a stray said hermione calmly 
 
 ron looked at hermione as though she had gone mad 
 
 hermione if seen a grim bad he said my my uncle bilius saw one and and he died hours later 
 
 coincidence said hermione airily pouring herself some pumpkin juice 
 
 you know what talking about said ron starting to get angry grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards 
 
 there you are then said hermione in a superior tone they see the grim and die of fright the not an omen the cause of death and still with us because not stupid enough to see one and think right well better kick the bucket then 
 
 ron mouthed wordlessly at hermione who opened her bag took out her new arithmancy book and propped it open against the juice jug 
 
 i think divination seems very woolly she said searching for her page a lot of guesswork if you ask me 
 
 there was nothing woolly about the grim in that cup said ron hotly 
 
 you seem quite so confident when you were telling harry it was a sheep said hermione coolly 
 
 professor trelawney said you have the right aura you just like being bad at something for a change 
 
 he had touched a nerve hermione slammed her arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere 
 
 if being good at divination means i have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves not sure be studying it much longer that lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my arithmancy class 
 
 she snatched up her bag and stalked away 
 
 ron frowned after her 
 
 she talking about he said to harry she been to an arithmancy class yet 
 
 
 
 harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch rain had cleared the sky was a clear pale gray and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever care of magical creatures class 
 
 ron and hermione speaking to each other harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to hut on the edge of the forbidden forest it was only when he spotted three backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these lessons with the slytherins malfoy was talking animatedly to crabbe and goyle who were chortling harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about 
 
 hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut he stood in his moleskin overcoat with fang the boarhound at his heels looking impatient to start 
 
 now get a move on he called as the class approached got a real treat for yeh today great lesson comin up everyone here right follow me 
 
 for one nasty moment harry thought that hagrid was going to lead them into the forest harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime however hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees and five minutes later they found themselves outside a kind of paddock there was nothing in there 
 
 everyone gather round the fence here he called it make sure yeh can see now firs thing want ter do is open yer books 
 
 how said the cold drawling voice of draco malfoy 
 
 eh said hagrid 
 
 how do we open our books malfoy repeated he took out his copy of the monster book of monsters which he had bound shut with a length of rope other people took theirs out too some like harry had belted their book shut others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with binder clips 
 
 hasn hasn anyone bin able ter open their books said hagrid looking crestfallen 
 
 the class all shook their heads 
 
 got ter stroke em said hagrid as though this was the most obvious thing in the world look 
 
 he took copy and ripped off the spellotape that bound it the book tried to bite but hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine and the book shivered and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand 
 
 oh how silly all been malfoy sneered we should have stroked them why we guess 
 
 i i thought they were funny hagrid said uncertainly to hermione 
 
 oh tremendously funny said malfoy really witty giving us books that try and rip our hands off 
 
 shut up malfoy said harry quietly hagrid was looking downcast and harry wanted first lesson to be a success 
 
 righ then said hagrid who seemed to have lost his thread so so got yer books yeh need the magical creatures yeah so go an get em hang on 
 
 he strode away from them into the forest and out of sight 
 
 god this place is going to the dogs said malfoy loudly that oaf teaching classes my have a fit when i tell him 
 
 shut up malfoy harry repeated 
 
 careful potter a dementor behind you 
 
 oooooooh squealed lavender brown pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock 
 
 trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures harry had ever seen they had the bodies hind legs and tails of horses but the front legs wings and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles with cruel beaks and large brilliantly orange eyes the talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck which was attached to a long chain and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of hagrid who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures 
 
 gee up there he roared shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood everyone drew back slightly as hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence 
 
 hippogriffs hagrid roared happily waving a hand at them aren they 
 
 harry could sort of see what hagrid meant once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse half bird you started to appreciate the hippogriffs gleaming coats changing smoothly from feather to hair each of them a different color stormy gray bronze pinkish roan gleaming chestnut and inky black 
 
 so said hagrid rubbing his hands together and beaming around if yeh wan ter come a bit nearer 
 
 no one seemed to want to harry ron and hermione however approached the fence cautiously 
 
 now firs thing yeh gotta know abou hippogriffs is proud said hagrid easily offended hippogriffs are never insult one cause it might be the last thing yeh do 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle listening they were talking in an undertone and harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson 
 
 yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs move hagrid continued polite see yeh walk toward him and yeh bow an yeh wait if he bows back allowed ter touch him if he doesn bow then get away from him sharpish cause those talons hurt 
 
 right who wants ter go first 
 
 most of the class backed farther away in answer even harry ron and hermione had misgivings the hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings they seem to like being tethered like this 
 
 no one said hagrid with a pleading look 
 
 do it said harry 
 
 there was an intake of breath from behind him and both lavender and parvati whispered oooh no harry remember your tea leaves 
 
 harry ignored them he climbed over the paddock fence 
 
 good man harry roared hagrid right then see how yeh get on with buckbeak 
 
 he untied one of the chains pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows and slipped off its leather collar the class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath eyes were narrowed maliciously 
 
 easy now harry said hagrid quietly got eye contact now try not ter blinkhippogriffs don trust yeh if yeh blink too much 
 
 eyes immediately began to water but he shut them buckbeak had turned his great sharp head and was staring at harry with one fierce orange eye it said hagrid it harrynow bow 
 
 harry feel much like exposing the back of his neck to buckbeak but he did as he was told he gave a short bow and then looked up 
 
 the hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him it move 
 
 ah said hagrid sounding worried right back away now harry easy does it 
 
 but then to enormous surprise the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was 
 
 an unmistakable bow 
 
 well done harry said hagrid ecstatic right yeh can touch him pat his beak go on 
 
 feeling that a better reward would have been to back away harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it he patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily as though enjoying it 
 
 the class broke into applause all except for malfoy crabbe and goyle who were looking deeply disappointed 
 
 righ then harry said hagrid i reckon he migh let yeh ride him 
 
 this was more than harry had bargained for he was used to a broomstick but he sure a hippogriff would be quite the same 
 
 yeh climb up there jus behind the wing joint said hagrid an mind yeh don pull any of his feathers out he won like that 
 
 harry put his foot on the top of wing and hoisted himself onto its back buckbeak stood up harry sure where to hold on everything in front of him was covered with feathers 
 
 go on then roared hagrid slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters 
 
 without warning wings flapped open on either side of harry he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward it was nothing like a broomstick and harry knew which one he preferred the wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he dare get a stronger grip instead of the smooth action of his nimbus two thousand he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings 
 
 buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground this was the bit harry had been dreading he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered feeling he was going to slip off over the beak then felt a heavy thud as the four feet hit the ground he just managed to hold on and push himself straight again 
 
 good work harry roared hagrid as everyone except malfoy crabbe and goyle cheered okay who else wants a go 
 
 emboldened by success the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one and soon people were bowing nervously all over the paddock neville ran repeatedly backward from his which seem to want to bend its knees ron and hermione practiced on the chestnut while harry watched 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle had taken over buckbeak he had bowed to malfoy who was now patting his beak looking disdainful 
 
 this is very easy malfoy drawled loud enough for harry to hear him i knew it must have been if potter could do iti bet not dangerous at all are you he said to the hippogriff are you you great ugly brute 
 
 it happened in a flash of steely talons malfoy let out a high pitched scream and next moment hagrid was wrestling buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at malfoy who lay curled in the grass blood blossoming over his robes 
 
 dying malfoy yelled as the class panicked dying look at me killed me 
 
 yer not dyin said hagrid who had gone very white someone help me gotta get him outta here 
 
 hermione ran to hold open the gate as hagrid lifted malfoy easily as they passed harry saw that there was a long deep gash on arm blood splattered the grass and hagrid ran with him up the slope toward the castle 
 
 very shaken the care of magical creatures class followed at a walk the slytherins were all shouting about hagrid 
 
 they should sack him straight away said pansy parkinson who was in tears 
 
 it was fault snapped dean thomas crabbe and goyle flexed their muscles threateningly 
 
 they all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall 
 
 going to see if okay said pansy and they all watched her run up the marble staircase the slytherins still muttering about hagrid headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room harry ron and hermione proceeded upstairs to gryffindor tower 
 
 you think be all right said hermione nervously 
 
 course he will madam pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second said harry who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse 
 
 that was a really bad thing to happen in first class though it said ron looking worried trust malfoy to mess things up for him 
 
 they were among the first to reach the great hall at dinnertime hoping to see hagrid but he there 
 
 they fire him would they said hermione anxiously not touching her pudding 
 
 better not said ron who eating either 
 
 harry was watching the slytherin table a large group including crabbe and goyle was huddled together deep in conversation harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how malfoy had been injured 
 
 well you say it an interesting first day back said ron gloomily 
 
 they went up to the crowded gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework professor mcgonagall had given them but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window 
 
 a light on in window harry said suddenly 
 
 ron looked at his watch 
 
 if we hurried we could go down and see him still quite early 
 
 i know hermione said slowly and harry saw her glance at him 
 
 allowed to walk across the grounds he said pointedly sirius black got past the dementors yet has he 
 
 so they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors as they entirely sure they were supposed to be out 
 
 the grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight when they reached hut they knocked and a voice growled 
 
 hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table his boarhound fang had his head in lap one look told them that hagrid had been drinking a lot there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus 
 
 spect a record he said thickly when he recognized them don reckon ever had a teacher who lasted a day before 
 
 you been fired hagrid gasped hermione 
 
 not yet said hagrid miserably taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard only a matter o time after malfoy 
 
 how is he said ron as they all sat down it serious was it 
 
 madam pomfrey fixed him best she could said hagrid dully but sayin still agonycovered in bandagesmoanin 
 
 faking it said harry at once madam pomfrey can mend anything she regrew half my bones last year trust malfoy to milk it for all worth 
 
 school have bin told o course said hagrid miserably they reckon i started too big shoulda left hippogriffs fer laterone flobberworms or summatjus thought make a good firs all my fault 
 
 all fault hagrid said hermione earnestly 
 
 witnesses said harry you said hippogriffs attack if you insult them problem that he listening tell dumbledore what really happened 
 
 yeah worry hagrid back you up said ron 
 
 tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of eyes he grabbed both harry and ron and pulled them into a hug 
 
 i think had enough to drink hagrid said hermione firmly she took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it 
 
 ah maybe right said hagrid letting go of harry and ron who both staggered away rubbing their ribs hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed hermione unsteadily outside they heard a loud splash 
 
 he done said harry nervously as hermione came back in with the empty tankard 
 
 stuck his head in the water barrel said hermione putting the tankard away 
 
 hagrid came back his long hair and beard sopping wet wiping the water out of his eyes 
 
 better he said shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all listen it was good of yeh ter come an see me i really 
 
 hagrid stopped dead staring at harry as though only just realized he was there 
 
 what think doin eh he roared so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air not to go wanderin around after dark harry an you two lettin him 
 
 hagrid strode over to harry grabbed his arm and pulled him to the door 
 
 hagrid said angrily takin yer all back up ter school an don let me catch yeh walkin down ter see me after dark again not worth that 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter six talons and tea leavescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 when harry ron and hermione entered the great hall for breakfast the next day the first thing they saw was draco malfoy who seemed to be entertaining a large group of slytherins with a very funny story as they passed malfoy did a ridiculous impression of a swooning fit and there was a roar of laughter 
 
 ignore him said hermione who was right behind harry just ignore him not worth it 
 
 hey potter shrieked pansy parkinson a slytherin girl with a face like a pug potter the dementors are coming potter woooooooooo 
 
 harry dropped into a seat at the gryffindor table next to george weasley 
 
 new course schedules said george passing then over up with you harry 
 
 malfoy said ron sitting down on other side and glaring over at the slytherin table 
 
 george looked up in time to see malfoy pretending to faint with terror again 
 
 that little git he said calmly he so cocky last night when the dementors were down at our end of the train came running into our compartment he fred 
 
 nearly wet himself said fred with a contemptuous glance at malfoy 
 
 i too happy myself said george horrible things those dementors 
 
 sort of freeze your insides they said fred 
 
 you pass out though did you said harry in a low voice 
 
 forget it harry said george bracingly dad had to go out to azkaban one time remember fred and he said it was the worst place ever been he came back all weak and shakingthey suck the happiness out of a place dementors most of the prisoners go mad in there 
 
 anyway see how happy malfoy looks after our first quidditch match said fred gryffindor versus slytherin first game of the season remember 
 
 the only time harry and malfoy had faced each other in a quidditch match malfoy had definitely come off worse feeling slightly more cheerful harry helped himself to sausages and fried tomatoes 
 
 hermione was examining her new schedule 
 
 ooh good starting some new subjects today she said happily 
 
 hermione said ron frowning as he looked over her shoulder messed up your timetable look got you down for about ten subjects a day there enough time 
 
 manage fixed it all with professor mcgonagall 
 
 but look said ron laughing see this morning nine divination and underneath nine muggle studies and ron leaned closer to the timetable disbelieving look underneath that arithmancy nine i mean i know good hermione but no that good you supposed to be in three classes at once 
 
 be silly said hermione shortly of course i be in three classes at once 
 
 well then 
 
 pass the marmalade said hermione 
 
 but 
 
 oh ron it to you if my a bit full hermione snapped i told you fixed it all with professor mcgonagall 
 
 just then hagrid entered the great hall he was wearing his long moleskin overcoat and was swinging a dead polecat from one enormous hand 
 
 all righ he said eagerly pausing on his way to the staff table yer in my firs ever lesson right after lunch bin up since five getting everthin readyhope okme a 
 
 he grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table still swinging the polecat 
 
 wonder what been getting ready said ron a note of anxiety in his voice 
 
 the hall was starting to empty as people headed off towards their first lesson ron checked his schedule 
 
 better go look at the top of north tower take us ten minutes to get there 
 
 they finished breakfast hastily said goodbye to fred and george and walked back through the hall as they passed the slytherin table malfoy did yet another impression of a fainting fit the shouts of laughter followed harry into the entrance hall 
 
 the journey through the castle to north tower was a long one two years at hogwarts taught them everything about the castle and they had never been inside north tower before 
 
 got to be a short cut ron panted as they climbed the seventh long staircase and emerged on an unfamiliar landing where there was nothing but a large painting of a bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall 
 
 i think this way said hermione peering down the empty passage to the right 
 
 be said ron south look you can see a bit of the lake outside the window 
 
 harry was watching the painting a fat pony had just ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly harry was used to the subjects of hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit each other but he always enjoyed watching them a moment later a short squat knight in a suit of armour had clanked into the picture after his pony by the look of the grass stains on his metal knees he had just fallen off 
 
 aha he yelled seeing harry ron and hermione what villains are these that trespass upon my private lands come to scorn at my fall perchance draw you knaves you dogs 
 
 they watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his sword out of its scabbard and began brandishing it violently hopping up and down in rage but the sword was too long for him a particularly wild swing made him overbalance and he landed facedown in the grass 
 
 are you all right said harry moving closer to the picture 
 
 get back you scurvy braggart back you rogue 
 
 the knight seized his sword again and used it to push himself back up but the blade sank deeply into the grass and though he pulled with all his might he get it out again finally he had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop his sweating face 
 
 listen said harry taking advantage of the exhaustion looking for the north tower you know the way do you 
 
 a quest the rage seemed to vanish instantly he clanked to his feet and shouted come follow me dear friends and we shall find our goal or else shall perish bravely in the charge 
 
 he gave the sword another fruitless tug tried and failed to mount the fat pony gave up and cried on foot then good sirs and gentle lady on on 
 
 and he ran clanking loudly into the left side of the frame and out of sight 
 
 they hurried after him along the corridor following the sound of his armor every now and then they spotted him running through a picture ahead 
 
 be of stout heart the worst is yet to come yelled the knight and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women in crinolines whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase 
 
 puffing loudly harry ron and hermione climbed the tightly spiraling steps getting dizzier and dizzier until at last they heard the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the classroom 
 
 farewell cried the knight popping his head into a painting of some monks farewell my if ever you have need of noble heart and steely sinew call upon sir cadogan 
 
 yeah call you muttered ron as the knight disappeared if we ever need someone mental 
 
 they climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny landing where most of the class was already assembled there were no doors off this landing but ron nudged harry and pointed at the ceiling where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque on it 
 
 sibyll trelawney divination teacher harry read we supposed to get up there 
 
 as though in answer to his question the trapdoor suddenly opened and a silvery ladder descended right at feet everyone got quiet 
 
 after you said ron grinning so harry climbed the ladder first 
 
 he emerged into the classroom he had ever seen in fact it look like a classroom at all more like a cross between attic and an tea shop at least twenty small circular tables were crammed inside it all surrounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs everything was lit with a dim crimson light the curtains at the windows were all closed and the many lamps were draped with dark red scarves it was stiflingly warm and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy sickly sort of perfume as it heated a large copper kettle the shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with feathers stubs of candles many packs of tattered playing cards countless silvery crystal balls and a huge array of teacups 
 
 ron appeared at shoulder as the class assembled around them all talking in whispers 
 
 where is she ron said 
 
 a voice came suddenly out of the shadows a soft misty sort of voice 
 
 welcome it said how nice to see you in the physical world at last 
 
 immediate impression was of a large glittering insect professor trelawney moved into the firelight and they saw that she was very thin her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times their natural size and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck and her arms and hands were encrusted with bangles and rings 
 
 sit my children sit she said and they all climbed awkwardly into armchairs or sank onto poufs harry ron and hermione sat themselves around the same round table 
 
 welcome to divination said professor trelawney who had seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire my name is professor trelawney you may not have seen me before i find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school clouds my inner eye 
 
 nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement professor trelawney delicately rearranged her shawl and continued so you have chosen to study divination the most difficult of all magical arts i must warn you at the outset that if you do not have the sight there is very little i will be able to teach youbooks can take you only so far in this field 
 
 at these words both harry and ron glanced grinning at hermione who looked startled at the news that books be much help in this subject 
 
 many witches and wizards talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future professor trelawney went on her enormous gleaming eyes moving from face to nervous face it is a gift granted to few you boy she said suddenly to neville who almost toppled off his pouf is your grandmother well 
 
 i think so said neville tremulously 
 
 i be so sure if i were you dear said professor trelawney the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings neville gulped professor trelawney continued placidly we will be covering the basic methods of divination this year the first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves next term we shall progress to palmistry by the way my dear she shot suddenly at parvati patil beware a man 
 
 parvati gave a startled look at ron who was right behind her and edged her chair away from him 
 
 in the second term professor trelawney went on we shall progress to the crystal ball if we have finished with fire omens that is unfortunately classes will be disrupted in february by a nasty bout of flu i myself will lose my voice and around easter one of our number will leave us for ever 
 
 a very tense silence followed this pronouncement but professor trelawney seemed unaware of it 
 
 i wonder dear she said to lavender brown who was nearest and shrank back in her chair if you could pass me the largest silver teapot 
 
 lavender looking relieved stood up took an enormous teapot from the shelf and put it down on the table in front of professor trelawney 
 
 thank you my dear incidentally that thing you are dreading it will happen on friday the sixteenth of october 
 
 lavender trembled 
 
 now i want you all to divide into pairs collect a teacup from the shelf come to me and i will fill it then sit down and drink drink until only the dregs remain swill these around the cup three times with the left hand then turn the cup upside down on its saucer wait for the last of the tea to drain away then give your cup to your partner to read you will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of unfogging the future i shall move among you helping and instructing oh and dear she caught neville by the arm as he made to stand up after broken your first cup would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones rather attached to the pink 
 
 sure enough neville had no sooner reached the shelf of teacups when there was a tinkle of breaking china professor trelawney swept over to him holding a dustpan and brush and said one of the blue ones then dear if you mindthank you 
 
 when harry and ron had had their teacups filled they went back to their table and tried to drink the scalding tea quickly they swilled the dregs around as professor trelawney had instructed then drained the cups and swapped over 
 
 right said ron as they both opened their books at pages five and six what can you see in mine 
 
 a load of soggy brown stuff said harry the heavily perfumed smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid 
 
 broaden your minds my dears and allow your eyes to see past the mundane professor trelawney cried through the gloom 
 
 harry tried to pull himself together 
 
 right got a crooked sort of cross he consulted unfogging the future that means going to have trials and suffering sorry about that but a thing that could be the sun hang onthat means great going to suffer but be very happy 
 
 you need your inner eye tested if you ask me said ron and they both had to stifle their laughs as professor trelawney gazed in their direction 
 
 my turn ron peered into teacup his forehead wrinkled with effort a blob a bit like a bowler hat he said maybe going to work for the ministry of magic 
 
 he turned the teacup the other way up 
 
 but this way it looks more like an that he scanned his copy of unfogging the future a windfall unexpected gold excellent you can lend me some and a thing here he turned the cup again that looks like an animalyeah if that was its headit looks like a hippono a sheep 
 
 professor trelawney whirled around as harry let out a snort of laughter 
 
 let me see that my dear she said reprovingly to ron sweeping over and snatching cup from him everyone went quiet to watch 
 
 professor trelawney was staring into the teacup rotating it counterclockwise 
 
 the falconmy dear you have a deadly enemy 
 
 but everyone knows that said hermione in a loud whisper professor trelawney stared at her 
 
 well they do said hermione everybody knows about harry and 
 
 harry and ron stared at her with a mixture of amazement and admiration they had never heard hermione speak to a teacher like that before professor trelawney chose not to reply she lowered her huge eyes to cup again and continued to turn it 
 
 the cluban attack dear dear this is not a happy cup 
 
 i thought that was a bowler hat said ron sheepishly 
 
 the skulldanger in your path my dear 
 
 everyone was staring transfixed at professor trelawney who gave the cup a final turn gasped and then screamed 
 
 there was another tinkle of breaking china neville had smashed his second cup professor trelawney sank into a vacant armchair her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed 
 
 my dear boy my poor dear boy no it is kinder not to say no ask me 
 
 what is it professor said dean thomas at once everyone had got to their feet and slowly they crowded around harry and table pressing close to professor chair to get a good look at cup 
 
 my dear professor huge eyes opened dramatically you have the grim 
 
 the what said harry 
 
 he could tell that he the only one who understand dean thomas shrugged at him and lavender brown looked puzzled but nearly everybody else clapped their hands to their mouths in horror 
 
 the grim my dear the grim cried professor trelawney who looked shocked that harry understood the giant spectral dog that haunts churchyards my dear boy it is an omen the worst omen of death 
 
 stomach lurched that dog on the cover of death omens in flourish and blotts the dog in the shadows of magnolia crescentlavender brown clapped her hands to her mouth too everyone was looking at harry everyone except hermione who had gotten up and moved around to the back of professor chair 
 
 i think it looks like a grim she said flatly 
 
 professor trelawney surveyed hermione with mounting dislike 
 
 forgive me for saying so my dear but i perceive very little aura around you very little receptivity to the resonances of the future 
 
 seamus finnigan was tilting his head from side to side 
 
 it looks like a grim if you do this he said with his eyes almost shut but it looks more like a donkey from here he said leaning to the left 
 
 when all finished deciding whether going to die or not said harry taking even himself by surprise now nobody seemed to want to look at him 
 
 i think we will leave the lesson here for today said professor trelawney in her mistiest voice yesplease pack away your things 
 
 silently the class took their teacups back to professor trelawney packed away their books and closed their bags even ron was avoiding eyes 
 
 until we meet again said professor trelawney faintly fair fortune be yours oh and dear she pointed at neville be late next time so mind you work to catch up 
 
 harry ron and hermione descended professor ladder and the winding stair in silence then set off for professor transfiguration lesson it took them so long to find her classroom that early as they had left divination they were only just in time 
 
 harry chose a seat right at the back of the room feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him as though he were about to drop dead at any moment he hardly heard what professor mcgonagall was telling them about animagi wizards who could transform at will into animals and even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes 
 
 really what has got into you all today said professor mcgonagall turning back into herself with a faint pop and staring around at them all not that it matters but the first time my not got applause from a class 
 
 heads turned toward harry again but nobody spoke then hermione raised her hand 
 
 please professor just had our first divination class and we were reading the tea leaves and 
 
 ah of course said professor mcgonagall suddenly frowning there is no need to say any more miss granger tell me which of you will be dying this year 
 
 everyone stared at her 
 
 me said harry finally 
 
 i see said professor mcgonagall fixing harry with her beady eyes then you should know potter that sibyll trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school none of them has died yet seeing death omens is her favorite way of greeting a new class if it were not for the fact that i never speak ill of my colleagues professor mcgonagall broke off and they saw that her nostrils had gone white she went on more calmly divination is one of the most imprecise branches of magic i shall not conceal from you that i have very little patience with it true seers are very rare and professor trelawney 
 
 she stopped again and then said in a very tone you look in excellent health to me potter so you will excuse me if i let you off homework today i assure you that if you die you need not hand it in 
 
 hermione laughed harry felt a bit better it was harder to feel scared of a lump of tea leaves away from the dim red light and befuddling perfume of professor classroom not everyone was convinced however ron still looked worried and lavender whispered but what about cup 
 
 when the transfiguration class had finished they joined the crowd thundering toward the great hall for lunch 
 
 ron cheer up said hermione pushing a dish of stew toward him you heard what professor mcgonagall said 
 
 ron spooned stew onto his plate and picked up his fork but start 
 
 harry he said in a low serious voice you seen a great black dog anywhere have you 
 
 yeah i have said harry i saw one the night i left the dursleys 
 
 ron let his fork fall with a clatter 
 
 probably a stray said hermione calmly 
 
 ron looked at hermione as though she had gone mad 
 
 hermione if seen a grim bad he said my my uncle bilius saw one and and he died hours later 
 
 coincidence said hermione airily pouring herself some pumpkin juice 
 
 you know what talking about said ron starting to get angry grims scare the living daylights out of most wizards 
 
 there you are then said hermione in a superior tone they see the grim and die of fright the not an omen the cause of death and still with us because not stupid enough to see one and think right well better kick the bucket then 
 
 ron mouthed wordlessly at hermione who opened her bag took out her new arithmancy book and propped it open against the juice jug 
 
 i think divination seems very woolly she said searching for her page a lot of guesswork if you ask me 
 
 there was nothing woolly about the grim in that cup said ron hotly 
 
 you seem quite so confident when you were telling harry it was a sheep said hermione coolly 
 
 professor trelawney said you have the right aura you just like being bad at something for a change 
 
 he had touched a nerve hermione slammed her arithmancy book down on the table so hard that bits of meat and carrot flew everywhere 
 
 if being good at divination means i have to pretend to see death omens in a lump of tea leaves not sure be studying it much longer that lesson was absolute rubbish compared with my arithmancy class 
 
 she snatched up her bag and stalked away 
 
 ron frowned after her 
 
 she talking about he said to harry she been to an arithmancy class yet 
 
 
 
 harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch rain had cleared the sky was a clear pale gray and the grass was springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever care of magical creatures class 
 
 ron and hermione speaking to each other harry walked beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to hut on the edge of the forbidden forest it was only when he spotted three backs ahead of them that he realized they must be having these lessons with the slytherins malfoy was talking animatedly to crabbe and goyle who were chortling harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about 
 
 hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut he stood in his moleskin overcoat with fang the boarhound at his heels looking impatient to start 
 
 now get a move on he called as the class approached got a real treat for yeh today great lesson comin up everyone here right follow me 
 
 for one nasty moment harry thought that hagrid was going to lead them into the forest harry had had enough unpleasant experiences in there to last him a lifetime however hagrid strolled off around the edge of the trees and five minutes later they found themselves outside a kind of paddock there was nothing in there 
 
 everyone gather round the fence here he called it make sure yeh can see now firs thing want ter do is open yer books 
 
 how said the cold drawling voice of draco malfoy 
 
 eh said hagrid 
 
 how do we open our books malfoy repeated he took out his copy of the monster book of monsters which he had bound shut with a length of rope other people took theirs out too some like harry had belted their book shut others had crammed them inside tight bags or clamped them together with binder clips 
 
 hasn hasn anyone bin able ter open their books said hagrid looking crestfallen 
 
 the class all shook their heads 
 
 got ter stroke em said hagrid as though this was the most obvious thing in the world look 
 
 he took copy and ripped off the spellotape that bound it the book tried to bite but hagrid ran a giant forefinger down its spine and the book shivered and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand 
 
 oh how silly all been malfoy sneered we should have stroked them why we guess 
 
 i i thought they were funny hagrid said uncertainly to hermione 
 
 oh tremendously funny said malfoy really witty giving us books that try and rip our hands off 
 
 shut up malfoy said harry quietly hagrid was looking downcast and harry wanted first lesson to be a success 
 
 righ then said hagrid who seemed to have lost his thread so so got yer books yeh need the magical creatures yeah so go an get em hang on 
 
 he strode away from them into the forest and out of sight 
 
 god this place is going to the dogs said malfoy loudly that oaf teaching classes my have a fit when i tell him 
 
 shut up malfoy harry repeated 
 
 careful potter a dementor behind you 
 
 oooooooh squealed lavender brown pointing toward the opposite side of the paddock 
 
 trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures harry had ever seen they had the bodies hind legs and tails of horses but the front legs wings and heads of what seemed to be giant eagles with cruel beaks and large brilliantly orange eyes the talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly looking each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around its neck which was attached to a long chain and the ends of all of these were held in the vast hands of hagrid who came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures 
 
 gee up there he roared shaking the chains and urging the creatures toward the fence where the class stood everyone drew back slightly as hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to the fence 
 
 hippogriffs hagrid roared happily waving a hand at them aren they 
 
 harry could sort of see what hagrid meant once you got over the first shock of seeing something that was half horse half bird you started to appreciate the hippogriffs gleaming coats changing smoothly from feather to hair each of them a different color stormy gray bronze pinkish roan gleaming chestnut and inky black 
 
 so said hagrid rubbing his hands together and beaming around if yeh wan ter come a bit nearer 
 
 no one seemed to want to harry ron and hermione however approached the fence cautiously 
 
 now firs thing yeh gotta know abou hippogriffs is proud said hagrid easily offended hippogriffs are never insult one cause it might be the last thing yeh do 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle listening they were talking in an undertone and harry had a nasty feeling they were plotting how best to disrupt the lesson 
 
 yeh always wait fer the hippogriff ter make the firs move hagrid continued polite see yeh walk toward him and yeh bow an yeh wait if he bows back allowed ter touch him if he doesn bow then get away from him sharpish cause those talons hurt 
 
 right who wants ter go first 
 
 most of the class backed farther away in answer even harry ron and hermione had misgivings the hippogriffs were tossing their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings they seem to like being tethered like this 
 
 no one said hagrid with a pleading look 
 
 do it said harry 
 
 there was an intake of breath from behind him and both lavender and parvati whispered oooh no harry remember your tea leaves 
 
 harry ignored them he climbed over the paddock fence 
 
 good man harry roared hagrid right then see how yeh get on with buckbeak 
 
 he untied one of the chains pulled the gray hippogriff away from its fellows and slipped off its leather collar the class on the other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath eyes were narrowed maliciously 
 
 easy now harry said hagrid quietly got eye contact now try not ter blinkhippogriffs don trust yeh if yeh blink too much 
 
 eyes immediately began to water but he shut them buckbeak had turned his great sharp head and was staring at harry with one fierce orange eye it said hagrid it harrynow bow 
 
 harry feel much like exposing the back of his neck to buckbeak but he did as he was told he gave a short bow and then looked up 
 
 the hippogriff was still staring haughtily at him it move 
 
 ah said hagrid sounding worried right back away now harry easy does it 
 
 but then to enormous surprise the hippogriff suddenly bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was 
 
 an unmistakable bow 
 
 well done harry said hagrid ecstatic right yeh can touch him pat his beak go on 
 
 feeling that a better reward would have been to back away harry moved slowly toward the hippogriff and reached out toward it he patted the beak several times and the hippogriff closed its eyes lazily as though enjoying it 
 
 the class broke into applause all except for malfoy crabbe and goyle who were looking deeply disappointed 
 
 righ then harry said hagrid i reckon he migh let yeh ride him 
 
 this was more than harry had bargained for he was used to a broomstick but he sure a hippogriff would be quite the same 
 
 yeh climb up there jus behind the wing joint said hagrid an mind yeh don pull any of his feathers out he won like that 
 
 harry put his foot on the top of wing and hoisted himself onto its back buckbeak stood up harry sure where to hold on everything in front of him was covered with feathers 
 
 go on then roared hagrid slapping the hippogriffs hindquarters 
 
 without warning wings flapped open on either side of harry he just had time to seize the hippogriff around the neck before he was soaring upward it was nothing like a broomstick and harry knew which one he preferred the wings beat uncomfortably on either side of him catching him under his legs and making him feel he was about to be thrown off the glossy feathers slipped under his fingers and he dare get a stronger grip instead of the smooth action of his nimbus two thousand he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquarters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings 
 
 buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed back to the ground this was the bit harry had been dreading he leaned back as the smooth neck lowered feeling he was going to slip off over the beak then felt a heavy thud as the four feet hit the ground he just managed to hold on and push himself straight again 
 
 good work harry roared hagrid as everyone except malfoy crabbe and goyle cheered okay who else wants a go 
 
 emboldened by success the rest of the class climbed cautiously into the paddock hagrid untied the hippogriffs one by one and soon people were bowing nervously all over the paddock neville ran repeatedly backward from his which seem to want to bend its knees ron and hermione practiced on the chestnut while harry watched 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle had taken over buckbeak he had bowed to malfoy who was now patting his beak looking disdainful 
 
 this is very easy malfoy drawled loud enough for harry to hear him i knew it must have been if potter could do iti bet not dangerous at all are you he said to the hippogriff are you you great ugly brute 
 
 it happened in a flash of steely talons malfoy let out a high pitched scream and next moment hagrid was wrestling buckbeak back into his collar as he strained to get at malfoy who lay curled in the grass blood blossoming over his robes 
 
 dying malfoy yelled as the class panicked dying look at me killed me 
 
 yer not dyin said hagrid who had gone very white someone help me gotta get him outta here 
 
 hermione ran to hold open the gate as hagrid lifted malfoy easily as they passed harry saw that there was a long deep gash on arm blood splattered the grass and hagrid ran with him up the slope toward the castle 
 
 very shaken the care of magical creatures class followed at a walk the slytherins were all shouting about hagrid 
 
 they should sack him straight away said pansy parkinson who was in tears 
 
 it was fault snapped dean thomas crabbe and goyle flexed their muscles threateningly 
 
 they all climbed the stone steps into the deserted entrance hall 
 
 going to see if okay said pansy and they all watched her run up the marble staircase the slytherins still muttering about hagrid headed away in the direction of their dungeon common room harry ron and hermione proceeded upstairs to gryffindor tower 
 
 you think be all right said hermione nervously 
 
 course he will madam pomfrey can mend cuts in about a second said harry who had had far worse injuries mended magically by the nurse 
 
 that was a really bad thing to happen in first class though it said ron looking worried trust malfoy to mess things up for him 
 
 they were among the first to reach the great hall at dinnertime hoping to see hagrid but he there 
 
 they fire him would they said hermione anxiously not touching her pudding 
 
 better not said ron who eating either 
 
 harry was watching the slytherin table a large group including crabbe and goyle was huddled together deep in conversation harry was sure they were cooking up their own version of how malfoy had been injured 
 
 well you say it an interesting first day back said ron gloomily 
 
 they went up to the crowded gryffindor common room after dinner and tried to do the homework professor mcgonagall had given them but all three of them kept breaking off and glancing out of the tower window 
 
 a light on in window harry said suddenly 
 
 ron looked at his watch 
 
 if we hurried we could go down and see him still quite early 
 
 i know hermione said slowly and harry saw her glance at him 
 
 allowed to walk across the grounds he said pointedly sirius black got past the dementors yet has he 
 
 so they put their things away and headed out of the portrait hole glad to meet nobody on their way to the front doors as they entirely sure they were supposed to be out 
 
 the grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight when they reached hut they knocked and a voice growled 
 
 hagrid was sitting in his shirtsleeves at his scrubbed wooden table his boarhound fang had his head in lap one look told them that hagrid had been drinking a lot there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus 
 
 spect a record he said thickly when he recognized them don reckon ever had a teacher who lasted a day before 
 
 you been fired hagrid gasped hermione 
 
 not yet said hagrid miserably taking a huge gulp of whatever was in the tankard only a matter o time after malfoy 
 
 how is he said ron as they all sat down it serious was it 
 
 madam pomfrey fixed him best she could said hagrid dully but sayin still agonycovered in bandagesmoanin 
 
 faking it said harry at once madam pomfrey can mend anything she regrew half my bones last year trust malfoy to milk it for all worth

 all fault hagrid said hermione earnestly 
 
 witnesses said harry you said hippogriffs attack if you insult them problem that he listening tell dumbledore what really happened 
 
 yeah worry hagrid back you up said ron 
 
 tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of eyes he grabbed both harry and ron and pulled them into a hug 
 
 i think had enough to drink hagrid said hermione firmly she took the tankard from the table and went outside to empty it 
 
 ah maybe right said hagrid letting go of harry and ron who both staggered away rubbing their ribs hagrid heaved himself out of his chair and followed hermione unsteadily outside they heard a loud splash 
 
 he done said harry nervously as hermione came back in with the empty tankard 
 
 stuck his head in the water barrel said hermione putting the tankard away 
 
 hagrid came back his long hair and beard sopping wet wiping the water out of his eyes 
 
 better he said shaking his head like a dog and drenching them all listen it was good of yeh ter come an see me i really 
 
 hagrid stopped dead staring at harry as though only just realized he was there 
 
 what think doin eh he roared so suddenly that they jumped a foot in the air not to go wanderin around after dark harry an you two lettin him 
 
 hagrid strode over to harry grabbed his arm and pulled him to the door 
 
 hagrid said angrily takin yer all back up ter school an don let me catch yeh walkin down ter see me after dark again not worth that 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter six the portkeycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry felt as though he had barely lain down to steep in room when he was being shaken awake by mrs weasley 
 
 time to go harry dear she whispered moving away to wake ron 
 
 harry felt around for his glasses put them on and sat up it was still dark outside ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused him at the foot of mattress he saw two large disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets 
 
 s time already said fred groggily 
 
 they dressed in silence too sleepy to talk then yawning and stretching the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen 
 
 mrs weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove while mr weasley was sitting at the table checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets he looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly he was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt 
 
 what think he asked anxiously supposed to go incognito do i look like a muggle harry 
 
 yeah said harry smiling very good 
 
 bill and charlie and said george failing to stifle a huge yawn 
 
 well apparating they said mrs weasley heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls so they can have a bit of a 
 
 harry knew that apparating meant disappearing from one place and reappearing almost instantly in another but had never known any hogwarts student to do it and understood that it was very difficult 
 
 so still in bed said fred grumpily pulling his bowl of porridge toward him why we apparate too 
 
 because not of age and you passed your test snapped mrs weasley and where have those girls got to 
 
 she bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs 
 
 you have to pass a test to apparate harry asked 
 
 oh yes said mr weasley tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans the department of magical transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for apparating without a license not easy apparition and when not done property it can lead to nasty complications this pair talking about went and splinched themselves 
 
 everyone around the table except harry winced 
 
 er splinched said harry 
 
 they left half of themselves behind said mr weasley now spooning large amounts of treacle onto his porridge so of course they were stuck move either way had to wait for the accidental magic reversal squad to sort them out meant a fair old bit of paperwork i can tell you what with the muggles who spotted the body parts left behind 
 
 harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of privet drive 
 
 were they okay he asked startled 
 
 oh yes said mr weasley but they got a heavy fine and i think be trying it again in a hurry you mess around with apparition there are plenty of adult wizards who bother with it prefer brooms slower but safer 
 
 but bill and charlie and percy can all do it 
 
 charlie had to take the test twice said fred grinning he failed the first time apparated five miles south of where he meant to right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping remember 
 
 yes well he passed the second time said mrs weasley marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers 
 
 percy only passed two weeks ago said george been apparating downstairs every morning since just to prove he can 
 
 there were footsteps down the passageway and hermione and ginny came into the kitchen both looking pale and drowsy 
 
 why do we have to be up so early ginny said rubbing her eyes and sitting down at the table 
 
 got a bit of a walk said mr weasley 
 
 walk said harry what are we walking to the world cup 
 
 no no miles away said mr weasley smiling we only need to walk a short way just that very difficult for a large number of wizards to congregate without attracting muggle attention we have to be very careful about how we travel at the best of times and on a huge occasion like the quidditch world cup 
 
 george said mrs weasley sharply and they all jumped 
 
 what said george in an innocent tone that deceived nobody 
 
 what is that in your pocket 
 
 nothing 
 
 you lie to me 
 
 mrs weasley pointed her wand at pocket and said accio 
 
 several small brightly colored objects zoomed out of pocket he made a grab for them but missed and they sped right into mrs outstretched hand 
 
 we told you to destroy them said mrs weasley furiously holding up what were unmistakably more toffees we told you to get rid of the lot empty your pockets go on both of you 
 
 it was an unpleasant scene the twins had evidently been trying to smuggle as many toffees out of the house as possible and it was only by using her summoning charm that mrs weasley managed to find them all 
 
 accio accio accio she shouted and toffees zoomed from all sorts of unlikely places including the lining of jacket and the of jeans 
 
 we spent six months developing those fred shouted at his mother as she threw the toffees away 
 
 oh a fine way to spend six months she shrieked no wonder you get more 
 
 all in all the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure mrs weasley was still glowering as she kissed mr weasley on the cheek though not nearly as much as the twins who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out without a word to her 
 
 well have a lovely time said mrs weasley and behave yourselves she called after the twins retreating backs but they did not look back or answer send bill charlie and percy along around midday mrs weasley said to mr weasley as he harry ron hermione and ginny set off across the dark yard after fred and george 
 
 it was chilly and the moon was still out only a dull greenish tinge along the horizon to their right showed that daybreak was drawing closer harry having been thinking about thousands of wizards speeding toward the quidditch world cup sped up to walk with mr weasley 
 
 so how does everyone get there without all the muggles noticing he asked 
 
 been a massive organizational problem sighed mr weasley the trouble is about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the world cup and of course we just got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all there are places muggles penetrate but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into diagon alley or platform nine and so we had to find a nice deserted moor and set up as many precautions as possible the whole been working on it for months first of course we have to stagger the arrivals people with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand a limited number use muggle transport but we have too many clogging up their buses and trains remember wizards are coming from all over the world some apparate of course but we have to set up safe points for them to appear well away from muggles i believe a handy wood using as the apparition point for those who want to apparate or we use portkeys objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time you can do large groups at a time if you need to there have been two hundred portkeys placed at strategic points around britain and the nearest one to us is up at the top of stoatshead hill so where headed 
 
 mr weasley pointed ahead of them where a large black mass rose beyond the village of ottery st catchpole 
 
 what sort of objects are portkeys said harry curiously 
 
 well they can be anything said mr weasley unobtrusive things obviously so muggles go picking them up and playing with themstuff just think is litter 
 
 they trudged down the dark dank lane toward the village the silence broken only by their footsteps the sky lightened very slowly as they made their way through the village its inky blackness diluting to deepest blue hands and feet were freezing mr weasley kept checking his watch 
 
 they have breath to spare for talking as they began to climb stoatshead hill stumbling occasionally in hidden rabbit holes slipping on thick black tuffets of grass each breath harry took was sharp in his chest and his legs were starting to seize up when at last his feet found level ground 
 
 whew panted mr weasley taking off his glasses and wiping them on his sweater well made good time got ten minutes 
 
 hermione came over the crest of the hill last clutching a stitch in her side 
 
 now we just need the portkey said mr weasley replacing his glasses and squinting around at the ground it be on 
 
 they spread out searching they had only been at it for a couple of minutes however when a shout rent the still air 
 
 over here arthur over here son got it 
 
 two tall figures were silhouetted against the starry sky on the other side of the hilltop 
 
 amos said mr weasley smiling as he strode over to the man who had shouted the rest of them followed 
 
 mr weasley was shaking hands with a wizard with a scrubby brown beard who was holding a old boot in his other hand 
 
 this is amos diggory everyone said mr weasley he works for the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures and i think you know his son cedric 
 
 cedric diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen he was captain and seeker of the hufflepuff house quidditch team at hogwarts 
 
 hi said cedric looking around at them all 
 
 everybody said hi back except fred and george who merely nodded they had never quite forgiven cedric for beating their team gryffindor in the first quidditch match of the previous year 
 
 long walk arthur father asked not too bad said mr weasley we live just on the other side of the village there you 
 
 had to get up at two we ced i tell you be glad when got his apparition test stillnot complainingquidditch world cup miss it for a sackful of galleons and the tickets cost about that mind you looks like i got off easy amos diggory peered around at the three weasley boys harry hermione and ginny all these yours arthur 
 
 oh no only the redheads said mr weasley pointing out his children this is hermione friend of and harry another friend 
 
 beard said amos diggory his eyes widening harry harry potter 
 
 er yeah said harry 
 
 harry was used to people looking curiously at him when they met him used to the way their eyes moved at once to the lightning scar on his forehead but it always made him feel uncomfortable 
 
 talked about you of course said amos diggory told us all about playing against you last yeari said to him i said ced be something to tell your grandchildren that beat harry potter 
 
 harry think of any reply to this so he remained silent fred and george were both scowling again cedric looked slightly embarrassed 
 
 harry fell off his broom dad he muttered i told youit was an accident 
 
 yes but you fall off did you roared amos genially slapping his son on his back always modest our ced always the gentlemanbut the best man won sure say the same you eh one falls off his broom one stays on you need to be a genius to tell which the better flier 
 
 must be nearly time said mr weasley quickly pulling out his watch again do you know whether waiting for any more amos 
 
 no the lovegoods have been there for a week already and the fawcetts get tickets said mr diggory there any more of us in this area are there 
 
 not that i know of said mr weasley yes a minute better get ready 
 
 he looked around at harry and hermione 
 
 you just need to touch the portkey all a finger will do 
 
 with difficulty owing to their bulky backpacks the nine of them crowded around the old boot held out by amos diggory 
 
 they all stood there in a tight circle as a chill breeze swept over the hilltop nobody spoke it suddenly occurred to harry how odd this would look if a muggle were to walk up here nownine people two of them grown men clutching this manky old boot in the semidarkness waiting 
 
 three muttered mr weasley one eye still on his watch twoone 
 
 it happened immediately harry felt as though a hook just behind his navel had been suddenly jerked irresistibly forward his feet left the ground he could feel ron and hermione on either side of him their shoulders banging into his they were all speeding forward in a howl of wind and swirling color his forefinger was stuck to the boot as though it was pulling him magnetically onward and then 
 
 his feet slammed into the ground ron staggered into him and he fell over the portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud 
 
 harry looked up mr weasley mr diggory and cedric were still standing though looking very windswept everybody else was on the ground 
 
 seven past five from stoatshead hill said a voice 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire

 harry felt as though he had barely lain down to steep in room when he was being shaken awake by mrs weasley 
 
 time to go harry dear she whispered moving away to wake ron 
 
 harry felt around for his glasses put them on and sat up it was still dark outside ron muttered indistinctly as his mother roused him at the foot of mattress he saw two large disheveled shapes emerging from tangles of blankets 
 
 s time already said fred groggily 
 
 they dressed in silence too sleepy to talk then yawning and stretching the four of them headed downstairs into the kitchen 
 
 mrs weasley was stirring the contents of a large pot on the stove while mr weasley was sitting at the table checking a sheaf of large parchment tickets he looked up as the boys entered and spread his arms so that they could see his clothes more clearly he was wearing what appeared to be a golfing sweater and a very old pair of jeans slightly too big for him and held up with a thick leather belt 
 
 what think he asked anxiously supposed to go incognito do i look like a muggle harry 
 
 yeah said harry smiling very good 
 
 bill and charlie and said george failing to stifle a huge yawn 
 
 well apparating they said mrs weasley heaving the large pot over to the table and starting to ladle porridge into bowls so they can have a bit of a 
 
 harry knew that apparating meant disappearing from one place and reappearing almost instantly in another but had never known any hogwarts student to do it and understood that it was very difficult 
 
 so still in bed said fred grumpily pulling his bowl of porridge toward him why we apparate too 
 
 because not of age and you passed your test snapped mrs weasley and where have those girls got to 
 
 she bustled out of the kitchen and they heard her climbing the stairs 
 
 you have to pass a test to apparate harry asked 
 
 oh yes said mr weasley tucking the tickets safely into the back pocket of his jeans the department of magical transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for apparating without a license not easy apparition and when not done property it can lead to nasty complications this pair talking about went and splinched themselves 
 
 everyone around the table except harry winced 
 
 er splinched said harry 
 
 they left half of themselves behind said mr weasley now spooning large amounts of treacle onto his porridge so of course they were stuck move either way had to wait for the accidental magic reversal squad to sort them out meant a fair old bit of paperwork i can tell you what with the muggles who spotted the body parts left behind 
 
 harry had a sudden vision of a pair of legs and an eyeball lying abandoned on the pavement of privet drive 
 
 were they okay he asked startled 
 
 oh yes said mr weasley but they got a heavy fine and i think be trying it again in a hurry you mess around with apparition there are plenty of adult wizards who bother with it prefer brooms slower but safer 
 
 but bill and charlie and percy can all do it 
 
 charlie had to take the test twice said fred grinning he failed the first time apparated five miles south of where he meant to right on top of some poor old dear doing her shopping remember 
 
 yes well he passed the second time said mrs weasley marching back into the kitchen amid hearty sniggers 
 
 percy only passed two weeks ago said george been apparating downstairs every morning since just to prove he can

lionfish nov chapter six the noble and most ancient house of blackcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 mrs weasley followed them upstairs looking grim 
 
 i want you all to go straight to bed no talking she said as they reached the first landing got a busy day tomorrow i expect asleep she added to hermione so try not to wake her up 
 
 asleep yeah right said fred in an undertone after hermione bade them goodnight and they were climbing to the next floor if not lying awake waiting for hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then a flobberworm 
 
 all right ron harry said mrs weasley on the second landing pointing them into their bedroom off to bed with you 
 
 night harry and ron said to the twins 
 
 sleep tight said fred winking 
 
 mrs weasley closed the door behind harry with a sharp snap the bedroom looked if anything even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight the blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply as though its invisible occupant was asleep harry put on his pyjamas took off his glasses and climbed into his chilly bed while ron threw owl treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify hedwig and pigwidgeon who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly 
 
 we let them out to hunt every night ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pyjamas dumbledore want too many owls swooping around the square thinks look suspicious oh yeah i forgot 
 
 he crossed to the door and bolted it 
 
 you doing that for 
 
 kreacher said ron as he turned off the light first night i was here he came wandering in at three in the morning trust me you want to wake up and find him prowling around your room anyway he got into his bed settled down under the covers then turned to look at harry in the darkness harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window what reckon 
 
 harry need to ask what ron meant 
 
 well they tell us much we have guessed did they he said thinking of all that had been said downstairs i mean all really said is that the trying to stop people joining vol 
 
 there was a sharp intake of breath from ron 
 
 demort said harry firmly when are you going to start using his name sirius and lupin do 
 
 ron ignored this last comment 
 
 yeah right he said we already knew nearly everything they told us from using the extendable ears the only new bit was 
 
 crack 
 
 ouch 
 
 keep your voice down ron or be back up here 
 
 you two just apparated on my knees 
 
 yeah well harder in the dark 
 
 harry saw the blurred outlines of fred and george leaping down from bed there was a groan of bedsprings and mattress descended a few inches as george sat down near his feet 
 
 so got there yet said george eagerly 
 
 the weapon sirius mentioned said harry 
 
 let slip more like said fred with relish now sitting next to ron we hear about that on the old extendables did we 
 
 what reckon it is said harry 
 
 could be anything said fred 
 
 but there be anything worse than the avada kedavra curse can there said ron worse than death 
 
 maybe something that can kill loads of people at once suggested george 
 
 maybe some particularly painful way of killing people said ron learfully 
 
 got the cruciatus curse for causing pain said harry he need anything more efficient than that 
 
 there was a pause and harry knew that the others like him were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate 
 
 so who got it now asked george 
 
 i hope our side said ron sounding slightly nervous 
 
 if it is probably keeping it said fred 
 
 where said ron quickly hogwarts 
 
 bet it is said george where he hid the stone 
 
 a going to be a lot bigger than the stone though said ron 
 
 not necessarily said fred 
 
 yeah size is no guarantee of power said george look at ginny 
 
 what mean said harry 
 
 never been on the receiving end of one of her hexes have you 
 
 shhh said fred from the bed listen 
 
 they fell silent footsteps were coming up the stairs 
 
 mum said george and without further ado there was a loud crack and harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed a few seconds later they heard the floorboard creak outside their door mrs weasley was plainly listening to check whether or not they were talking 
 
 hedwig and pigwidgeon hooted dolefully the floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on fred and george 
 
 she trust us at all you know said ron regretfully 
 
 harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over he wanted to continue talking to ron but mrs weasley was now creaking back downstairs again and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs in fact creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door and hagrid the care of magical creatures teacher was saying beauties they eh harry be studyin weapons this term and harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him he ducked 
 
 the next thing he knew he was curled into a warm ball under his bedclothes and loud voice was filling the room 
 
 mum says get up your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room there are loads more doxys than she thought and found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa 
 
 half an hour later harry and ron who had dressed and breakfasted quickly entered the drawing room a long room on the first floor with walls covered in dirty tapestries the carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees it was around these that mrs weasley hermione ginny fred and george were grouped all looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end 
 
 cover your faces and take a spray mrs weasley said to harry and ron the moment she saw them pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a table doxycide never seen an infestation this badwhat that been doing for the last ten years 
 
 face was half concealed by a tea towel but harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at mrs weasley 
 
 really old he probably manage 
 
 be surprised what kreacher can manage when he wants to hermione said sirius who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats just been feeding buckbeak he added in reply to enquiring look i keep him upstairs in my bedroom anyway this writing desk 
 
 he dropped the bag of rats into an armchair then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which harry now noticed for the first time was shaking slightly 
 
 well molly pretty sure this is a boggart said sirius peering through the keyhole but perhaps we ought to let have a shifty at it before we let it outknowing my mother it could be something much worse 
 
 right you are sirius said mrs weasley 
 
 they were both speaking in carefully light polite voices that told harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before 
 
 a loud clanging bell sounded from downstairs followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by tonks knocking over the umbrella stand 
 
 i keep telling them not to ring the doorbell said sirius exasperatedly hurrying out of the room they heard him thundering clown the stairs as mrs screeches echoed up through the house once more stains of dishonour filthy blood traitors children of flith 
 
 close the door please harry said mrs weasley 
 
 harry took as much time as he dared to close the door he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mothers portrait because she had stopped screaming he heard sirius walking down the hall then the clattering of the chain on the front door and then a deep voice he recognised as kingsley saying just relieved me so got cloak now thought leave a report for dumbledore 
 
 feeling mrs eyes on the back of his head harry regretfully closed the door and rejoined the doxy party 
 
 mrs weasley was bending over to check the page on doxys in gilderoy guide to household pests which was lying open on the sofa 
 
 right you lot you need to be careful because doxys bite and their teeth are poisonous got a bottle of antidote here but rather nobody needed it 
 
 she straightened up positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains and beckoned them all forward 
 
 when i say the word start spraying immediately she said come flying out at us i expect but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyse them when immobilized just throw them in this bucket 
 
 she stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own spray 
 
 all rightsquirt 
 
 harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material shiny wings whirring tiny teeth bared its body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury harry caught it full in the face with a blast of doxycide it froze in midair and fell with a surprisingly loud thunk on to the worn carpet below harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket 
 
 fred what are you doing said mrs weasley sharply spray that at once and throw it away 
 
 harry looked round fred was holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumb 
 
 fred said brightly spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted but the moment mrs back was turned he pocketed it with a wink 
 
 we want to experiment with doxy venom for our skiving snackboxes george told harry under his breath 
 
 deftly spraying two doxys at once as they soared straight for his nose harry moved closer to george and muttered out of the corner of his mouth what are skiving snackboxes 
 
 range of sweets to make you ill george whispered keeping a wary eye on mrs back not seriously ill mind just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it fred and i have been developing them this summer chews if you eat the orange half of the puking pastilles you throw up moment been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing you swallow the purple half 
 
 which restores you to full fitness enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom what putting in the adverts anyway whispered fred who had edged over out of mrs line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxys from the floor and adding them to his pocket but they still need a bit of work at the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping themselves puking long enough to swallow the purple end 
 
 testers 
 
 us said fred we take it in turns george did the fainting fancieswe both tried the nosebleed nougat 
 
 mum thought been duelling said george 
 
 joke shop still on then harry muttered pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray 
 
 well we had a chance to get premises yet said fred dropping his voice even lower as mrs weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack so running it as a service at the moment we put advertisements in the daily prophet last week 
 
 all thanks to you mate said george but worry mum got a clue she read the daily prophet any more cause of it telling lies about you and dumbledore 
 
 harry grinned he had forced the weasley twins to take the prize money he had won in the triwizard tournament to help them realise their ambition to open a joke shop but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to mrs weasley she did not think running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons 
 
 the of the curtains took most of the morning it was past midday when mrs weasley finally removed her protective scarf sank into a sagging armchair and sprang up again with a cry of disgust having sat on the bag of dead rats the curtains were no longer buzzing they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying unconscious doxys lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs at which crookshanks was now sniffing and fred and george were shooting covetous looks 
 
 i think tackle those after lunch 
 
 mrs weasley pointed at the dusty cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece they were crammed with an odd assortment of objects a selection of rusty daggers claws a coiled snakeskin a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages harry could not understand and least pleasant of all an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper full of what harry was quite sure was blood 
 
 the clanging doorbell rang again everyone looked at mrs weasley 
 
 stay here she said firmly snatching up the bag of rats as mrs blacks screeches started up again from down below bring up some sandwiches 
 
 she left the room closing the door carefully behind her at once everyone dashed over to the window to look down on the doorstep they could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons 
 
 mundungus said hermione he brought all those cauldrons for 
 
 probably looking for a safe place to keep them said harry that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me picking up dodgy cauldrons 
 
 yeah right said fred as the front door opened mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view blimey mum like that 
 
 he and george crossed to the door and stood beside it listening closely mrs screaming had stopped 
 
 mundungus is talking to sirius and kingsley fred muttered frowning with concentration hear properly reckon we can risk the extendable ears 
 
 might be worth it said george i could sneak upstairs and get a pair 
 
 but at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered extendable ears quite unnecessary all of them could hear exactly what mrs weasley was shouting at the top of her voice 
 
 we are not running a hideout for stolen goods 
 
 i love hearing mum shouting at someone else said fred with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow mrs voice to permeate the room better it makes such a nice change 
 
 completely irresponsible as if we got enough to worry about without you dragging stolen cauldrons into the house 
 
 the idiots are letting her get into her stride said george shaking his head got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours and been dying to have a go at mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you harryand there goes mum again 
 
 mrs voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall 
 
 george made to shut the door to drown the noise but before he could do so a edged into the room 
 
 except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle it was completely naked it looked very old its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and though it was bald like all there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large batlike ears its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike 
 
 the elf took absolutely no notice of harry and the rest acting as though it could not see them it shuffled hunchbacked slowly and doggedly towards the far end of the room all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse deep voice like a smells like a drain and a criminal to boot but no better nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my house oh my poor mistress if she knew if she knew the scum let into her house what would she say to old kreacher oh the shame of it mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves poor old kreacher what can he do 
 
 hello kreacher said fred very loudly closing the door with a snap 
 
 the froze in his tracks stopped muttering and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise 
 
 kreacher did not see young master he said turning around and bowing to fred still lacing the carpet he added perfectly audibly nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is 
 
 sorry said george catch that last bit 
 
 kreacher said nothing said the elf with a second bow to george adding in a clear undertone and its twin unnataral little beasts they are 
 
 harry know whether to laugh or not the elf straightened up eyeing them all malevolently and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter 
 
 and the mudblood standing there bold as brass oh if my mistress knew oh how cry and a new boy kreacher know his name what is he doing here kreacher know 
 
 this is harry kreacher said hermione tentatively harry potter 
 
 pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever 
 
 the mudblood is talking to kreacher as though she is my friend if mistress saw him in such company oh what would she say 
 
 call her a mudblood said ron and ginny together very angrily 
 
 it matter hermione whispered not in his right mind he know what 
 
 kid yourself hermione he knows exactly what saying said fred eyeing kreacher with great dislike 
 
 kreacher was still muttering his eyes on harry 
 
 is it true is it harry potter kreacher can see the scar it must be true the boy who stopped the dark lord kreacher wonders how he did it 
 
 we all kreacher said fred 
 
 what do you want anyway george asked 
 
 huge eyes darted towards george 
 
 kreacher is cleaning he said evasively 
 
 a likely story said a voice behind harry 
 
 sirius had come back he was glowering at the elf from the doorway the noise in the hall had abated perhaps mrs weasley and mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen 
 
 at the sight of sirius kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor 
 
 stand up straight said sirius impatiently now what are you up to 
 
 kreacher is cleaning the elf repeated kreacher lives to serve the noble house of black 
 
 and getting blacker every day filthy said sirius 
 
 master always liked his little joke said kreacher bowing again and continuing in an undertone master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his heart 
 
 my mother have a heart kreacher snapped sirius she kept herself alive out of pure spite 
 
 kreacher bowed again as he spoke 
 
 whatever master says he muttered furiously master is not fit to wipe slime from his boots oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw kreacher serving him how she hated him what a disappointment he was 
 
 i asked you what you were up to said sirius coldly every time you show up pretending to be cleaning you sneak something off to your room so we throw it out 
 
 kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in house said the elf then muttered very fast mistress would never forgive kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out seven centuries been in the family kreacher must save it kreacher will not let master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it 
 
 i thought it might be that said sirius casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall have put another permanent sticking charm on the back of it i doubt but if i can get rid of it i certainly will now go away kreacher 
 
 it seemed that kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order nevertheless the look he gave sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room 
 
 comes back from azkaban ordering kreacher around oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw the house now scum living in it her treasures thrown out she swore he was no son of hers and back they say a murderer too 
 
 keep muttering and i will be a murderer said sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elf 
 
 sirius not right in the head hermione pleaded i think he realises we can hear him 
 
 been alone too long said sirius taking mad orders from my portrait and talking to himself but he was always a foul little 
 
 if you could just set him free said hermione hopefully maybe 
 
 we set him free he knows too much about the order said sirius curtly and anyway the shock would kill him you suggest to him that he leaves this house see how he takes it 
 
 sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall harry and the others followed 
 
 the tapestry looked immensely old it was faded and looked as though doxys had gnawed it in places nevertheless the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back as far as harry could tell to the middle ages large words at the very top of the tapestry read 
 
 the noble and most ancient house of pur 
 
 not on here said harry after scanning the bottom of the tree closely 
 
 i used to be there said sirius pointing at a small round charred hole in the tapestry rather like a cigarette burn my sweet old mother blasted me off after i ran away from home quite fond of muttering the story under his breath 
 
 you ran away from home 
 
 when i was about sixteen said sirius had enough 
 
 where did you go asked harry staring at him 
 
 your place said sirius your grandparents were really good about it they sort of adopted me as a second son yeah i camped out at your in the school holidays and then when i was seventeen i got a place of my own my uncle alphard had left me a decent bit of been wiped off here too probably whyanyway after that i looked after myself i was always welcome at mr and mrs potters for sunday lunch though 
 
 but why did you 
 
 leave sirius smiled bitterly and ran his fingers through his long unkempt hair because i hated the whole lot of them my parents with their mania convinced that to be a black made you practically royal my idiot brother soft enough to believe them him 
 
 sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree at the name regulus black a date of death some fifteen years previously followed the date of birth 
 
 he was younger than me said sirius and a much better son as i was constantly reminded 
 
 but he died said harry 
 
 yeah said sirius stupid idiot he joined the death eaters 
 
 kidding 
 
 come on harry you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were said sirius testily 
 
 werewere your parents death eaters as well 
 
 no no but believe me they thought voldemort had the right idea they were all for the purification of the wizarding race getting rid of and having in charge they alone either there were quite a few people before voldemort showed his true colours who thought he had the right idea about things they got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power though but i bet my parents thought regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first 
 
 was he killed by an auror harry asked tentatively 
 
 oh no said sirius no he was murdered by voldemort or on orders more likely i doubt regulus was ever important enough to be killed by voldemort in person from what i found out after he died he got in so far then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out well you just hand in your resignation to voldemort a lifetime of service or death 
 
 lunch said mrs voice 
 
 she was holding her wand high in front of her balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip she was very red in the face and still looked angry the others moved over to her eager for some food but harry remained with sirius who had bent closer to the tapestry 
 
 i looked at this for years phineas nigellus my see least popular headmaster hogwarts ever had and araminta meliflua cousin of my tried to force through a ministry bill to make legal and dear aunt elladora she started the family tradition of beheading when they got too old to carry tea trays of course any time the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned i see tonks on here maybe why kreacher take orders from supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him 
 
 you and tonks are related harry asked surprised 
 
 oh yeah her mother andromeda was my favourite cousin said sirius examining the tapestry closely no not on here either look 
 
 he pointed to another small round burn mark between two names bellatrix and narcissa 
 
 sisters are still here because they made lovely respectable marriages but andromeda married a ted tonks so 
 
 sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly harry however did not laugh he was too busy staring at the names to the right of burn mark a double line of gold embroidery linked narcissa black with lucius malfoy and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name draco 
 
 related to the malfoys 
 
 the families are all interrelated said sirius if only going to let your sons and daughters marry our choice is very limited there are hardly any of us left molly and i are cousins by marriage and something like my second cousin once removed but no point looking for them on hereif ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors the weasleys 
 
 but harry was now looking at the name to the left of burn bellatrix black which was connected by a double line to rodolphus lestrange 
 
 lestrange harry said aloud the name had stirred something in his memory he knew it from somewhere but for a moment he think where though it gave him an odd creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach 
 
 in azkaban said sirius shortly 
 
 harry looked at him curiously 
 
 bellatrix and her husband rodolphus came in with barty crouch junior said sirius in the same brusque voice brother rabastan was with them too 
 
 then harry remembered he had seen bellatrix lestrange inside pensieve the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored a tall dark woman with eyes who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to lord voldemort her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty 
 
 you never said she was your 
 
 does it matter if my cousin snapped sirius as far as concerned not my family certainly not my family i seen her since i was your age unless you count a glimpse of her coming into azkaban think proud of having a relative like her 
 
 sorry said harry quickly i meani was just surprised all 
 
 it matter apologise sirius mumbled he turned away from the tapestry his hands deep in his pockets i like being back here he said staring across the drawing room i never thought be stuck in this house again 
 
 harry understood completely he knew how he would feel when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place for ever to return and live at number four privet drive 
 
 ideal for headquarters of course sirius said my father put every security measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here unplottable so muggles could never come and callas if ever have wanted toand now added his protection be hard put to find a safer house anywhere for the order you knownobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it isthat note moody showed you last night that was from dumbledore sirius gave a short laugh if my parents could see the use their house was being put to now well my mothers portrait should give you some idea 
 
 he scowled for a moment then sighed 
 
 i mind if i could just get out occasionally and do something useful asked dumbledore whether i can escort you to your hearingas snuffles obviouslyso i can give you a bit of moral support what think 
 
 harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet he had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best and hearing everything that was going on it had completely flown his mind at words however the crushing sense of dread returned to him he stared at hermione and the weasleys all tucking into their sandwiches and thought how he would feel if they went back to hogwarts without him 
 
 worry sirius said harry looked up and realised that sirius had been watching him sure clear you definitely something in the international statute of secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life 
 
 but if they do expel me said harry quietly can i come back here and live with you 
 
 sirius smiled sadly 
 
 see 
 
 feel a lot better about the hearing if i knew i have to go back to the dursleys harry pressed him 
 
 they must be bad if you prefer this place said sirius gloomily 
 
 hurry up you two or there be any food left mrs weasley called 
 
 sirius heaved another great sigh cast a dark look at the tapestry then he and harry went to join the others 
 
 harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while he emptied the cabinets that afternoon fortunately for him it was a job that required a lot of concentration as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox within seconds his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove 
 
 ok he said examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal must be wartcap powder in there 
 
 he threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets harry saw george wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already pocket 
 
 they found an silver instrument something like a pair of tweezers which scuttled up arm like a spider when he picked it up and attempted to puncture his skin sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled nobility a wizarding genealogy there was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister tinkling tune when wound and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut a heavy locket that none of them could open a number of ancient seals and in a dusty box an order of merlin first class that had been awarded to grandfather for services to the ministry 
 
 it means he gave them a load of gold said sirius contemptuously throwing the medal into the rubbish sack 
 
 several times kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it when sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the black crest from his grip kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling sirius names harry had never heard before 
 
 it was my said sirius throwing the ring into the sack kreacher quite as devoted to him as to my mother but i still caught him snogging a pair of my old trousers last week 
 
 mrs weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days the drawing room took three days to decontaminate finally the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the black family tree which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall and the rattling writing desk moody had not dropped by headquarters yet so they could not be sure what was inside it 
 
 they moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spiders as large as saucers lurking in the dresser ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half the china which bore the black crest and motto was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by sirius and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them smashed 
 
 snape might refer to their work as cleaning but in opinion they were really waging war on the house which was putting up a very good fight aided and abetted by kreacher the kept appearing wherever they were congregated his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes but kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said master must do as master wishes before turning away and muttering very loudly but master will not turn kreacher away no because kreacher knows what they are up to oh yes he is plotting against the dark lord yes with these mudblood and traitors and scum 
 
 at which sirius ignoring protests seized kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room 
 
 the doorbell rang several times a day which was the cue for mother to start shrieking again and for harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before mrs weasley recalled them to their tasks snape flitted in and out of the house several times more though to relief they never came face to face harry also caught sight of his transfiguration teacher professor mcgonagall looking very odd in a muggle dress and coat and she also seemed too busy to linger sometimes however the visitors stayed to help tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet and lupin who was staying in the house with sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the order helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at mundungus redeemed himself slightly in mrs eyes by rescuing ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe 
 
 despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer as long as he was busy he was happy when the action abated however whenever he dropped his guard or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling the thought of the looming ministry hearing returned to him fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled the idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud not even to ron and hermione who though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction followed his lead in not mentioning it sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the dursleys but he would not go he was determined on that he would come back here to grimmauld place and live with sirius 
 
 he felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when mrs weasley turned to him during dinner on wednesday evening and said quietly ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning harry and i want you to wash your hair tonight too a good first impression can work wonders 
 
 ron hermione fred george and ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew 
 
 how am i getting there he asked mrs weasley trying to sound unconcerned 
 
 taking you to work with him said mrs weasley gently 
 
 mr weasley smiled encouragingly at harry across the table 
 
 you can wait in my office until time for the hearing he said 
 
 harry looked over at sirius but before he could ask the question mrs weasley had answered it 
 
 professor dumbledore think a good idea for sirius to go with you and i must say i 
 
 think quite right said sirius through clenched teeth 
 
 mrs weasley pursed her lips 
 
 when did dumbledore tell you that harry said staring at sirius 
 
 he came last night when you were in bed said mr weasley 
 
 sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork harry lowered his own eyes to his plate the thought that dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel if it were possible even worse 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter six the noble and most ancient house of blackcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 mrs weasley followed them upstairs looking grim 
 
 i want you all to go straight to bed no talking she said as they reached the first landing got a busy day tomorrow i expect asleep she added to hermione so try not to wake her up 
 
 asleep yeah right said fred in an undertone after hermione bade them goodnight and they were climbing to the next floor if not lying awake waiting for hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then a flobberworm 
 
 all right ron harry said mrs weasley on the second landing pointing them into their bedroom off to bed with you 
 
 night harry and ron said to the twins 
 
 sleep tight said fred winking 
 
 mrs weasley closed the door behind harry with a sharp snap the bedroom looked if anything even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight the blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply as though its invisible occupant was asleep harry put on his pyjamas took off his glasses and climbed into his chilly bed while ron threw owl treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify hedwig and pigwidgeon who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly 
 
 we let them out to hunt every night ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pyjamas dumbledore want too many owls swooping around the square thinks look suspicious oh yeah i forgot 
 
 he crossed to the door and bolted it 
 
 you doing that for 
 
 kreacher said ron as he turned off the light first night i was here he came wandering in at three in the morning trust me you want to wake up and find him prowling around your room anyway he got into his bed settled down under the covers then turned to look at harry in the darkness harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window what reckon 
 
 harry need to ask what ron meant 
 
 well they tell us much we have guessed did they he said thinking of all that had been said downstairs i mean all really said is that the trying to stop people joining vol 
 
 there was a sharp intake of breath from ron 
 
 demort said harry firmly when are you going to start using his name sirius and lupin do 
 
 ron ignored this last comment 
 
 yeah right he said we already knew nearly everything they told us from using the extendable ears the only new bit was 
 
 crack 
 
 ouch 
 
 keep your voice down ron or be back up here 
 
 you two just apparated on my knees 
 
 yeah well harder in the dark 
 
 harry saw the blurred outlines of fred and george leaping down from bed there was a groan of bedsprings and mattress descended a few inches as george sat down near his feet 
 
 so got there yet said george eagerly 
 
 the weapon sirius mentioned said harry 
 
 let slip more like said fred with relish now sitting next to ron we hear about that on the old extendables did we 
 
 what reckon it is said harry 
 
 could be anything said fred 
 
 but there be anything worse than the avada kedavra curse can there said ron worse than death 
 
 maybe something that can kill loads of people at once suggested george 
 
 maybe some particularly painful way of killing people said ron learfully 
 
 got the cruciatus curse for causing pain said harry he need anything more efficient than that 
 
 there was a pause and harry knew that the others like him were wondering what horrors this weapon could perpetrate 
 
 so who got it now asked george 
 
 i hope our side said ron sounding slightly nervous 
 
 if it is probably keeping it said fred 
 
 where said ron quickly hogwarts 
 
 bet it is said george where he hid the stone 
 
 a going to be a lot bigger than the stone though said ron 
 
 not necessarily said fred 
 
 yeah size is no guarantee of power said george look at ginny 
 
 what mean said harry 
 
 never been on the receiving end of one of her hexes have you 
 
 shhh said fred from the bed listen 
 
 they fell silent footsteps were coming up the stairs 
 
 mum said george and without further ado there was a loud crack and harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed a few seconds later they heard the floorboard creak outside their door mrs weasley was plainly listening to check whether or not they were talking 
 
 hedwig and pigwidgeon hooted dolefully the floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on fred and george 
 
 she trust us at all you know said ron regretfully 
 
 harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over he wanted to continue talking to ron but mrs weasley was now creaking back downstairs again and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs in fact creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door and hagrid the care of magical creatures teacher was saying beauties they eh harry be studyin weapons this term and harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him he ducked 
 
 the next thing he knew he was curled into a warm ball under his bedclothes and loud voice was filling the room 
 
 mum says get up your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she needs you in the drawing room there are loads more doxys than she thought and found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa 
 
 half an hour later harry and ron who had dressed and breakfasted quickly entered the drawing room a long room on the first floor with walls covered in dirty tapestries the carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees it was around these that mrs weasley hermione ginny fred and george were grouped all looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end 
 
 cover your faces and take a spray mrs weasley said to harry and ron the moment she saw them pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a table doxycide never seen an infestation this badwhat that been doing for the last ten years 
 
 face was half concealed by a tea towel but harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at mrs weasley 
 
 really old he probably manage 
 
 be surprised what kreacher can manage when he wants to hermione said sirius who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rats just been feeding buckbeak he added in reply to enquiring look i keep him upstairs in my bedroom anyway this writing desk 
 
 he dropped the bag of rats into an armchair then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which harry now noticed for the first time was shaking slightly 
 
 well molly pretty sure this is a boggart said sirius peering through the keyhole but perhaps we ought to let have a shifty at it before we let it outknowing my mother it could be something much worse 
 
 right you are sirius said mrs weasley 
 
 they were both speaking in carefully light polite voices that told harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before 
 
 a loud clanging bell sounded from downstairs followed at once by the cacophony of screams and wails that had been triggered the previous night by tonks knocking over the umbrella stand 
 
 i keep telling them not to ring the doorbell said sirius exasperatedly hurrying out of the room they heard him thundering clown the stairs as mrs screeches echoed up through the house once more stains of dishonour filthy blood traitors children of flith 
 
 close the door please harry said mrs weasley 
 
 harry took as much time as he dared to close the door he wanted to listen to what was going on downstairs sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtains over his mothers portrait because she had stopped screaming he heard sirius walking down the hall then the clattering of the chain on the front door and then a deep voice he recognised as kingsley saying just relieved me so got cloak now thought leave a report for dumbledore 
 
 feeling mrs eyes on the back of his head harry regretfully closed the door and rejoined the doxy party 
 
 mrs weasley was bending over to check the page on doxys in gilderoy guide to household pests which was lying open on the sofa 
 
 right you lot you need to be careful because doxys bite and their teeth are poisonous got a bottle of antidote here but rather nobody needed it 
 
 she straightened up positioned herself squarely in front of the curtains and beckoned them all forward 
 
 when i say the word start spraying immediately she said come flying out at us i expect but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyse them when immobilized just throw them in this bucket 
 
 she stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own spray 
 
 all rightsquirt 
 
 harry had been spraying only a few seconds when a doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material shiny wings whirring tiny teeth bared its body covered with thick black hair and its four tiny fists clenched with fury harry caught it full in the face with a blast of doxycide it froze in midair and fell with a surprisingly loud thunk on to the worn carpet below harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket 
 
 fred what are you doing said mrs weasley sharply spray that at once and throw it away 
 
 harry looked round fred was holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumb 
 
 fred said brightly spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted but the moment mrs back was turned he pocketed it with a wink 
 
 we want to experiment with doxy venom for our skiving snackboxes george told harry under his breath 
 
 deftly spraying two doxys at once as they soared straight for his nose harry moved closer to george and muttered out of the corner of his mouth what are skiving snackboxes 
 
 range of sweets to make you ill george whispered keeping a wary eye on mrs back not seriously ill mind just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it fred and i have been developing them this summer chews if you eat the orange half of the puking pastilles you throw up moment been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing you swallow the purple half 
 
 which restores you to full fitness enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom what putting in the adverts anyway whispered fred who had edged over out of mrs line of vision and was now sweeping a few stray doxys from the floor and adding them to his pocket but they still need a bit of work at the moment our testers are having a bit of trouble stopping themselves puking long enough to swallow the purple end 
 
 testers 
 
 us said fred we take it in turns george did the fainting fancieswe both tried the nosebleed nougat 
 
 mum thought been duelling said george 
 
 joke shop still on then harry muttered pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray 
 
 well we had a chance to get premises yet said fred dropping his voice even lower as mrs weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack so running it as a service at the moment we put advertisements in the daily prophet last week 
 
 all thanks to you mate said george but worry mum got a clue she read the daily prophet any more cause of it telling lies about you and dumbledore 
 
 harry grinned he had forced the weasley twins to take the prize money he had won in the triwizard tournament to help them realise their ambition to open a joke shop but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to mrs weasley she did not think running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons 
 
 the of the curtains took most of the morning it was past midday when mrs weasley finally removed her protective scarf sank into a sagging armchair and sprang up again with a cry of disgust having sat on the bag of dead rats the curtains were no longer buzzing they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying unconscious doxys lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black eggs at which crookshanks was now sniffing and fred and george were shooting covetous looks 
 
 i think tackle those after lunch 
 
 mrs weasley pointed at the dusty cabinets standing on either side of the mantelpiece they were crammed with an odd assortment of objects a selection of rusty daggers claws a coiled snakeskin a number of tarnished silver boxes inscribed with languages harry could not understand and least pleasant of all an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper full of what harry was quite sure was blood 
 
 the clanging doorbell rang again everyone looked at mrs weasley 
 
 stay here she said firmly snatching up the bag of rats as mrs blacks screeches started up again from down below bring up some sandwiches 
 
 she left the room closing the door carefully behind her at once everyone dashed over to the window to look down on the doorstep they could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldrons 
 
 mundungus said hermione he brought all those cauldrons for 
 
 probably looking for a safe place to keep them said harry that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me picking up dodgy cauldrons 
 
 yeah right said fred as the front door opened mundungus heaved his cauldrons through it and disappeared from view blimey mum like that 
 
 he and george crossed to the door and stood beside it listening closely mrs screaming had stopped 
 
 mundungus is talking to sirius and kingsley fred muttered frowning with concentration hear properly reckon we can risk the extendable ears 
 
 might be worth it said george i could sneak upstairs and get a pair 
 
 but at that precise moment there was an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered extendable ears quite unnecessary all of them could hear exactly what mrs weasley was shouting at the top of her voice 
 
 we are not running a hideout for stolen goods 
 
 i love hearing mum shouting at someone else said fred with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow mrs voice to permeate the room better it makes such a nice change 
 
 completely irresponsible as if we got enough to worry about without you dragging stolen cauldrons into the house 
 
 the idiots are letting her get into her stride said george shaking his head got to head her off early otherwise she builds up a head of steam and goes on for hours and been dying to have a go at mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he was supposed to be following you harryand there goes mum again 
 
 mrs voice was lost amid fresh shrieks and screams from the portraits in the hall 
 
 george made to shut the door to drown the noise but before he could do so a edged into the room 
 
 except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around its middle it was completely naked it looked very old its skin seemed to be several times too big for it and though it was bald like all there was a quantity of white hair growing out of its large batlike ears its eyes were a bloodshot and watery grey and its fleshy nose was large and rather snoutlike 
 
 the elf took absolutely no notice of harry and the rest acting as though it could not see them it shuffled hunchbacked slowly and doggedly towards the far end of the room all the while muttering under its breath in a hoarse deep voice like a smells like a drain and a criminal to boot but no better nasty old blood traitor with her brats messing up my house oh my poor mistress if she knew if she knew the scum let into her house what would she say to old kreacher oh the shame of it mudbloods and werewolves and traitors and thieves poor old kreacher what can he do 
 
 hello kreacher said fred very loudly closing the door with a snap 
 
 the froze in his tracks stopped muttering and gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise 
 
 kreacher did not see young master he said turning around and bowing to fred still lacing the carpet he added perfectly audibly nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is 
 
 sorry said george catch that last bit 
 
 kreacher said nothing said the elf with a second bow to george adding in a clear undertone and its twin unnataral little beasts they are 
 
 harry know whether to laugh or not the elf straightened up eyeing them all malevolently and apparently convinced that they could not hear him as he continued to mutter 
 
 and the mudblood standing there bold as brass oh if my mistress knew oh how cry and a new boy kreacher know his name what is he doing here kreacher know 
 
 this is harry kreacher said hermione tentatively harry potter 
 
 pale eyes widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever 
 
 the mudblood is talking to kreacher as though she is my friend if mistress saw him in such company oh what would she say 
 
 call her a mudblood said ron and ginny together very angrily 
 
 it matter hermione whispered not in his right mind he know what 
 
 kid yourself hermione he knows exactly what saying said fred eyeing kreacher with great dislike 
 
 kreacher was still muttering his eyes on harry 
 
 is it true is it harry potter kreacher can see the scar it must be true the boy who stopped the dark lord kreacher wonders how he did it 
 
 we all kreacher said fred 
 
 what do you want anyway george asked 
 
 huge eyes darted towards george 
 
 kreacher is cleaning he said evasively 
 
 a likely story said a voice behind harry 
 
 sirius had come back he was glowering at the elf from the doorway the noise in the hall had abated perhaps mrs weasley and mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen 
 
 at the sight of sirius kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor 
 
 stand up straight said sirius impatiently now what are you up to 
 
 kreacher is cleaning the elf repeated kreacher lives to serve the noble house of black 
 
 and getting blacker every day filthy said sirius 
 
 master always liked his little joke said kreacher bowing again and continuing in an undertone master was a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his heart 
 
 my mother have a heart kreacher snapped sirius she kept herself alive out of pure spite 
 
 kreacher bowed again as he spoke 
 
 whatever master says he muttered furiously master is not fit to wipe slime from his boots oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw kreacher serving him how she hated him what a disappointment he was 
 
 i asked you what you were up to said sirius coldly every time you show up pretending to be cleaning you sneak something off to your room so we throw it out 
 
 kreacher would never move anything from its proper place in house said the elf then muttered very fast mistress would never forgive kreacher if the tapestry was thrown out seven centuries been in the family kreacher must save it kreacher will not let master and the blood traitors and the brats destroy it 
 
 i thought it might be that said sirius casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall have put another permanent sticking charm on the back of it i doubt but if i can get rid of it i certainly will now go away kreacher 
 
 it seemed that kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order nevertheless the look he gave sirius as he shuffled out past him was full of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room 
 
 comes back from azkaban ordering kreacher around oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw the house now scum living in it her treasures thrown out she swore he was no son of hers and back they say a murderer too 
 
 keep muttering and i will be a murderer said sirius irritably as he slammed the door shut on the elf 
 
 sirius not right in the head hermione pleaded i think he realises we can hear him 
 
 been alone too long said sirius taking mad orders from my portrait and talking to himself but he was always a foul little 
 
 if you could just set him free said hermione hopefully maybe 
 
 we set him free he knows too much about the order said sirius curtly and anyway the shock would kill him you suggest to him that he leaves this house see how he takes it 
 
 sirius walked across the room to where the tapestry kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall harry and the others followed 
 
 the tapestry looked immensely old it was faded and looked as though doxys had gnawed it in places nevertheless the golden thread with which it was embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back as far as harry could tell to the middle ages large words at the very top of the tapestry read 
 
 the noble and most ancient house of pur 
 
 not on here said harry after scanning the bottom of the tree closely 
 
 i used to be there said sirius pointing at a small round charred hole in the tapestry rather like a cigarette burn my sweet old mother blasted me off after i ran away from home quite fond of muttering the story under his breath 
 
 you ran away from home 
 
 when i was about sixteen said sirius had enough 
 
 where did you go asked harry staring at him 
 
 your place said sirius your grandparents were really good about it they sort of adopted me as a second son yeah i camped out at your in the school holidays and then when i was seventeen i got a place of my own my uncle alphard had left me a decent bit of been wiped off here too probably whyanyway after that i looked after myself i was always welcome at mr and mrs potters for sunday lunch though 
 
 but why did you 
 
 leave sirius smiled bitterly and ran his fingers through his long unkempt hair because i hated the whole lot of them my parents with their mania convinced that to be a black made you practically royal my idiot brother soft enough to believe them him 
 
 sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree at the name regulus black a date of death some fifteen years previously followed the date of birth 
 
 he was younger than me said sirius and a much better son as i was constantly reminded 
 
 but he died said harry 
 
 yeah said sirius stupid idiot he joined the death eaters 
 
 kidding 
 
 come on harry you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizards my family were said sirius testily 
 
 werewere your parents death eaters as well 
 
 no no but believe me they thought voldemort had the right idea they were all for the purification of the wizarding race getting rid of and having in charge they alone either there were quite a few people before voldemort showed his true colours who thought he had the right idea about things they got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power though but i bet my parents thought regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first 
 
 was he killed by an auror harry asked tentatively 
 
 oh no said sirius no he was murdered by voldemort or on orders more likely i doubt regulus was ever important enough to be killed by voldemort in person from what i found out after he died he got in so far then panicked about what he was being asked to do and tried to back out well you just hand in your resignation to voldemort a lifetime of service or death 
 
 lunch said mrs voice 
 
 she was holding her wand high in front of her balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwiches and cake on its tip she was very red in the face and still looked angry the others moved over to her eager for some food but harry remained with sirius who had bent closer to the tapestry 
 
 i looked at this for years phineas nigellus my see least popular headmaster hogwarts ever had and araminta meliflua cousin of my tried to force through a ministry bill to make legal and dear aunt elladora she started the family tradition of beheading when they got too old to carry tea trays of course any time the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned i see tonks on here maybe why kreacher take orders from supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him 
 
 you and tonks are related harry asked surprised 
 
 oh yeah her mother andromeda was my favourite cousin said sirius examining the tapestry closely no not on here either look 
 
 he pointed to another small round burn mark between two names bellatrix and narcissa 
 
 sisters are still here because they made lovely respectable marriages but andromeda married a ted tonks so 
 
 sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly harry however did not laugh he was too busy staring at the names to the right of burn mark a double line of gold embroidery linked narcissa black with lucius malfoy and a single vertical gold line from their names led to the name draco 
 
 related to the malfoys 
 
 the families are all interrelated said sirius if only going to let your sons and daughters marry our choice is very limited there are hardly any of us left molly and i are cousins by marriage and something like my second cousin once removed but no point looking for them on hereif ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors the weasleys 
 
 but harry was now looking at the name to the left of burn bellatrix black which was connected by a double line to rodolphus lestrange 
 
 lestrange harry said aloud the name had stirred something in his memory he knew it from somewhere but for a moment he think where though it gave him an odd creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach 
 
 in azkaban said sirius shortly 
 
 harry looked at him curiously 
 
 bellatrix and her husband rodolphus came in with barty crouch junior said sirius in the same brusque voice brother rabastan was with them too 
 
 then harry remembered he had seen bellatrix lestrange inside pensieve the strange device in which thoughts and memories could be stored a tall dark woman with eyes who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to lord voldemort her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty 
 
 you never said she was your 
 
 does it matter if my cousin snapped sirius as far as concerned not my family certainly not my family i seen her since i was your age unless you count a glimpse of her coming into azkaban think proud of having a relative like her 
 
 sorry said harry quickly i meani was just surprised all 
 
 it matter apologise sirius mumbled he turned away from the tapestry his hands deep in his pockets i like being back here he said staring across the drawing room i never thought be stuck in this house again 
 
 harry understood completely he knew how he would feel when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place for ever to return and live at number four privet drive 
 
 ideal for headquarters of course sirius said my father put every security measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here unplottable so muggles could never come and callas if ever have wanted toand now added his protection be hard put to find a safer house anywhere for the order you knownobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it isthat note moody showed you last night that was from dumbledore sirius gave a short laugh if my parents could see the use their house was being put to now well my mothers portrait should give you some idea 
 
 he scowled for a moment then sighed 
 
 i mind if i could just get out occasionally and do something useful asked dumbledore whether i can escort you to your hearingas snuffles obviouslyso i can give you a bit of moral support what think 
 
 harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet he had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best and hearing everything that was going on it had completely flown his mind at words however the crushing sense of dread returned to him he stared at hermione and the weasleys all tucking into their sandwiches and thought how he would feel if they went back to hogwarts without him 
 
 worry sirius said harry looked up and realised that sirius had been watching him sure clear you definitely something in the international statute of secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life 
 
 but if they do expel me said harry quietly can i come back here and live with you 
 
 sirius smiled sadly 
 
 see 
 
 feel a lot better about the hearing if i knew i have to go back to the dursleys harry pressed him 
 
 they must be bad if you prefer this place said sirius gloomily 
 
 hurry up you two or there be any food left mrs weasley called 
 
 sirius heaved another great sigh cast a dark look at the tapestry then he and harry went to join the others 
 
 harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while he emptied the cabinets that afternoon fortunately for him it was a job that required a lot of concentration as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox within seconds his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove 
 
 ok he said examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring its skin to normal must be wartcap powder in there 
 
 he threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinets harry saw george wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moments later and sneak the box into his already pocket 
 
 they found an silver instrument something like a pair of tweezers which scuttled up arm like a spider when he picked it up and attempted to puncture his skin sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled nobility a wizarding genealogy there was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister tinkling tune when wound and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut a heavy locket that none of them could open a number of ancient seals and in a dusty box an order of merlin first class that had been awarded to grandfather for services to the ministry 
 
 it means he gave them a load of gold said sirius contemptuously throwing the medal into the rubbish sack 
 
 several times kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it when sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the black crest from his grip kreacher actually burst into furious tears and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling sirius names harry had never heard before 
 
 it was my said sirius throwing the ring into the sack kreacher quite as devoted to him as to my mother but i still caught him snogging a pair of my old trousers last week 
 
 mrs weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days the drawing room took three days to decontaminate finally the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the black family tree which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall and the rattling writing desk moody had not dropped by headquarters yet so they could not be sure what was inside it 
 
 they moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spiders as large as saucers lurking in the dresser ron left the room hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half the china which bore the black crest and motto was all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by sirius and the same fate met a set of old photographs in tarnished silver frames all of whose occupants squealed shrilly as the glass covering them smashed 
 
 snape might refer to their work as cleaning but in opinion they were really waging war on the house which was putting up a very good fight aided and abetted by kreacher the kept appearing wherever they were congregated his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes but kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said master must do as master wishes before turning away and muttering very loudly but master will not turn kreacher away no because kreacher knows what they are up to oh yes he is plotting against the dark lord yes with these mudblood and traitors and scum 
 
 at which sirius ignoring protests seized kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room 
 
 the doorbell rang several times a day which was the cue for mother to start shrieking again and for harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before mrs weasley recalled them to their tasks snape flitted in and out of the house several times more though to relief they never came face to face harry also caught sight of his transfiguration teacher professor mcgonagall looking very odd in a muggle dress and coat and she also seemed too busy to linger sometimes however the visitors stayed to help tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet and lupin who was staying in the house with sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the order helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at mundungus redeemed himself slightly in mrs eyes by rescuing ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe 
 
 despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer as long as he was busy he was happy when the action abated however whenever he dropped his guard or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling the thought of the looming ministry hearing returned to him fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled the idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud not even to ron and hermione who though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction followed his lead in not mentioning it sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the dursleys but he would not go he was determined on that he would come back here to grimmauld place and live with sirius 
 
 he felt as though a brick had dropped into his stomach when mrs weasley turned to him during dinner on wednesday evening and said quietly ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning harry and i want you to wash your hair tonight too a good first impression can work wonders 
 
 ron hermione fred george and ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew 
 
 how am i getting there he asked mrs weasley trying to sound unconcerned 
 
 taking you to work with him said mrs weasley gently 
 
 mr weasley smiled encouragingly at harry across the table 
 
 you can wait in my office until time for the hearing he said 
 
 harry looked over at sirius but before he could ask the question mrs weasley had answered it 
 
 professor dumbledore think a good idea for sirius to go with you and i must say i 
 
 think quite right said sirius through clenched teeth 
 
 mrs weasley pursed her lips 
 
 when did dumbledore tell you that harry said staring at sirius 
 
 he came last night when you were in bed said mr weasley 
 
 sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork harry lowered his own eyes to his plate the thought that dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel if it were possible even worse 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter six detourcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry remained within the confines of the garden over the next few weeks he spent most of his days playing quidditch in the weasleys orchard he and hermione against ron and ginny hermione was dreadful and ginny good so they were reasonably well matched and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything mrs weasley put in front of him 
 
 it would have been a happy peaceful holiday had it not been for the stories of disappearances odd accidents even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the prophet sometimes bill and mr weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper to mrs displeasure sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by remus lupin who was looking gaunt and grim his brown hair streaked liberally with gray his clothes more ragged and patched than ever 
 
 there have been another couple of dementor attacks he announced as mrs weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake and found igor body in a shack up north the dark mark had been set over it well frankly surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the death eaters brother regulus only managed a few days as far as i can remember 
 
 yes well said mrs weasley frowning perhaps we should talk about something diff 
 
 did you hear about florean fortescue remus asked bill who was being plied with wine by fleur the man who ran 
 
 the place in diagon alley harry interrupted with an unpleasant hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach he used to give me free ice creams happened to him 
 
 dragged off by the look of his place 
 
 why asked ron while mrs weasley pointedly glared at bill 
 
 who knows he upset them somehow he was a good man florean 
 
 talking of diagon alley said mr weasley looks like gone too 
 
 the said ginny looking startled 
 
 the one empty no sign of a struggle no one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped 
 
 but people do for wands 
 
 make do with other makers said lupin but ollivander was the best and if the other side have got him not so good for us 
 
 the day after this rather gloomy birthday tea their letters and booklists arrived from hogwarts included a surprise he had been made quidditch captain 
 
 that gives you equal status with prefects cried hermione happily you can use our special bathroom now and everything 
 
 wow i remember when charlie wore one of these said ron examining the badge with glee harry this is so cool my captain if you let me back on the team i suppose ha ha 
 
 well i suppose we can put off a trip to diagon alley much longer now got these sighed mrs weasley looking down booklist go on saturday as long as your father have to go into work again not going there without him 
 
 mum honestly think going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in flourish and blotts sniggered ron 
 
 fortescue and ollivander went on holiday did they said mrs weasley firing up at once if you think a laughing matter you can stay behind and get your things myself 
 
 no i wanna come i want to see fred and shop said ron hastily 
 
 then you just buck up your ideas young man before i decide too immature to come with us said mrs weasley angrily snatching up her clock all nine hands of which were still pointing at mortal peril and balancing it on top of a pile of towels and that goes for returning to hogwarts as well 
 
 ron turned to stare incredulously at harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room 
 
 blimey you even make a joke round here anymore 
 
 but ron was careful not to be flippant about voldemort over the next few days saturday dawned without any more outbursts from mrs weasley though she seemed very tense at breakfast bill who would be staying at home with fleur much to hermione and pleasure passed a full money bag across the table to harry 
 
 mine demanded ron at once his eyes wide 
 
 already idiot said bill i got it out of your vault for you harry because taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment the goblins have tightened security so much two days ago arkie philpott had a probity probe stuck up his well trust me this easier 
 
 thanks bill said harry pocketing his gold 
 
 e is always so thoughtful purred fleur adoringly stroking nose ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind fleur harry choked over his cornflakes and ron thumped him on the back 
 
 it was an overcast murky day one of the special ministry of magic cars in which harry had ridden once before was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house pulling on their cloaks 
 
 good dad can get us these again said ron appreciatively stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the burrow bill and fleur waving from the kitchen window he harry hermione and ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat 
 
 get used to it only because of harry said mr weasley over his shoulder he and mrs weasley were in front with the ministry driver the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a sofa been given security status and be joining up with additional security at the leaky cauldron too 
 
 harry said nothing he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of aurors he had stowed his invisibility cloak in his backpack and felt that if that was good enough for dumbledore it ought to be good enough for the ministry though now he came to think of it he was not sure the ministry knew about his cloak 
 
 here you are then said the driver a surprisingly short while later speaking for the first time as he slowed in charing cross road and stopped outside the leaky cauldron to wait for you any idea how long be 
 
 a couple of hours i expect said mr weasley ah good here 
 
 harry imitated mr weasley and peered through the window his heart leapt there were no aurors waiting outside the inn but instead the gigantic form of rubeus hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper wearing a long beaverskin coat beaming at the sight of face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing muggles 
 
 harry he boomed sweeping harry into a hug the moment harry had stepped out of the car buckbeakwitherwings i meanyeh should see him harry so happy ter be back in the open air 
 
 glad pleased said harry grinning as he massaged his ribs we know security meant you 
 
 i know jus like old times innit see the ministry wanted ter send a bunch o aurors but dumbledore said do said hagrid proudly throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets lets get goin thenafter yeh molly arthur 
 
 the leaky cauldron was for the first time in memory completely empty only tom the landlord wizened and toothless remained of the old crowd he looked up hopefully as they entered but before he could speak hagrid said importantly jus passin through today tom sure yeh understand hogwarts business yeh know 
 
 tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses harry hermione hagrid and the weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street they stepped through the entrance and paused looking around 
 
 diagon alley had changed the colorful glittering window displays of spellbooks potion ingredients and cauldrons were lost to view hidden behind the large ministry of magic posters that had been pasted over them most of these somber purple posters carried versions of the security advice on the ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer but others bore moving photographs of death eaters known to be on the loose bellatrix lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary a few windows were boarded up including those of florean ice cream parlor on the other hand a number of stalls had sprung up along the street the nearest one which had been erected outside flourish and blotts under a striped stained awning had a cardboard sign pinned to its front 
 
 amulets effective against werewolves dementors and inferi 
 a little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby 
 
 one for your little girl madam he called at mrs weasley as they passed leering at ginny protect her pretty neck 
 
 if i were on duty said mr weasley glaring angrily at the amulet seller 
 
 yes but go arresting anyone now dear in a hurry said mrs weasley nervously consulting a list i think better do madam first hermione wants new dress robes and showing much too much ankle in his school robes and you must need new ones too harry grown so much come on everyone 
 
 molly it make sense for all of us to go to madam said mr weasley why those three go with hagrid and we can go to flourish and blotts and get school books 
 
 i know said mrs weasley anxiously clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack hagrid do you think 
 
 don fret be fine with me molly said hagrid soothingly waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid mrs weasley did not look entirely convinced but allowed the separation scurrying off toward flourish and blotts with her husband and ginny while harry ron hermione and hagrid set off for madam 
 
 harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried anxious look as mrs weasley and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups moving intently about their business nobody seemed to be shopping alone 
 
 migh be a bit of a squeeze in there with all o us said hagrid stopping outside madam and bending down to peer through the window stand guard outside all righ 
 
 so harry ron and hermione entered the little shop together it appeared at first glance to be empty but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue 
 
 not a child in case you noticed mother i am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone 
 
 there was a clucking noise and a voice harry recognized as that of madam malkin the owner said now dear your quite right none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore nothing to do with being a child 
 
 watch where sticking that pin will you 
 
 a teenage boy with a pale pointed face and hair appeared from behind the rack wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves he strode to the mirror and examined himself it was a few moments before he noticed harry ron and hermione reflected over his shoulder his light gray eyes narrowed 
 
 if wondering what the smell is mother a mudblood just walked in said draco malfoy 
 
 i think any need for language like that said madam malkin scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand and i want wands drawn in my shop either she added hastily for a glance toward the door had shown her harry and ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at malfoy 
 
 hermione who was standing slightly behind them whispered no honestly not worth it 
 
 yeah like dare do magic out of school sneered malfoy who blacked your eye granger i want to send them flowers 
 
 quite enough said madam malkin sharply looking over her shoulder for support madamplease 
 
 narcissa malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack 
 
 put those away she said coldly to harry and ron if you attack my son again i shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do 
 
 really said harry taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that for all its pallor still resembled her he was as tall as she was now going to get a few death eater pals to do us in are you 
 
 madam malkin squealed and clutched at her heart 
 
 really you accuse dangerous thing to say wands away please 
 
 but harry did not lower his wand narcissa malfoy smiled unpleasantly 
 
 i see that being favorite has given you a false sense of security harry potter but dumbledore always be there to protect you 
 
 harry looked mockingly all around the shop wow look at that not here now so why not have a go they might be able to find you a double cell in azkaban with your loser of a husband 
 
 malfoy made an angry movement toward harry but stumbled over his overlong robe ron laughed loudly 
 
 you dare talk to my mother like that potter malfoy snarled 
 
 all right draco said narcissa restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder i expect potter will be reunited with dear sirius before i am reunited with lucius 
 
 harry raised his wand higher 
 
 harry no moaned hermione grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side think you be in such trouble 
 
 madam malkin dithered for a moment on the spot then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it she bent toward malfoy who was still glaring at harry 
 
 i think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more dear let me just 
 
 ouch bellowed malfoy slapping her hand away watch where putting your pins woman mother i think i want these anymore 
 
 he pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at madam feet 
 
 right draco said narcissa with a contemptuous glance at hermione now i know the kind of scum that shops here do better at twilfitt and 
 
 and with that the pair of them strode out of the shop malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into ron on the way out 
 
 well really said madam malkin snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner so that it removed all the dust 
 
 she was distracted all through the fitting of and new robes tried to sell hermione dress robes instead of and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them 
 
 got asked hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side 
 
 just about said harry did you see the malfoys 
 
 yeah said hagrid unconcerned but they wouldn dare make trouble in the middle o diagon alley harry don worry about them 
 
 harry ron and hermione exchanged looks but before they could disabuse hagrid of this comfortable notion mr and mrs weasley and ginny appeared all clutching heavy packages of books 
 
 everyone all right said mrs weasley got your robes right then we can pop in at the apothecary and eeylops on the way to fred and stick close now 
 
 neither harry nor ron bought any ingredients at the apothecary seeing that they were no longer studying potions but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for hedwig and pigwidgeon at eeylops owl emporium then with mrs weasley checking her watch every minute or so they headed farther along the street in search of weasleys wizard wheezes the joke shop run by fred and george 
 
 we really got too long mrs weasley said so just have a quick look around and then back to the car we must be close number 
 
 ron stopping in his tracks 
 
 set against the dull shop fronts around them fred and georges windows hit the eye like a firework display casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows and a few rather people had actually come to a halt transfixed the window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved popped flashed bounced and shrieked eyes began to water just looking at it the window was covered with a gigantic poster purple like those of the ministry but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters 
 
 why are you worrying about 
 you should be worrying about 
 
 the constipation sensation gripping the nation 
 harry started to laugh he heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see mrs weasley gazing dumbfounded at the poster her lips moved silently mouthing the name 
 
 be murdered in their beds she whispered 
 
 no they said ron who like harry was laughing this is brilliant 
 
 and he and harry led the way into the shop it was packed with customers harry could not get near the shelves he stared around looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling here were the skiving snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last unfinished year at hogwarts harry noticed that the nosebleed nougat was most popular with only one battered box left on the shelf there were bins full of trick wands the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck and boxes of quills which came in and varieties a space cleared in the crowd and harry pushed his way toward the counter where a gaggle of delighted was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows both perched on a box that read reusable hangmanspell it or swing 
 
 patented daydream charms 
 
 hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship 
 
 one simple incantation and you will enter a highly realistic daydream easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling not for sale to you know said hermione looking up at harry that really is extraordinary magic 
 
 for that hermione said a voice behind them you can have one for free 
 
 a beaming fred stood before them wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair 
 
 how are you harry they shook hands and happened to your eye hermione 
 
 your punching telescope she said ruefully 
 
 oh blimey i forgot about those said fred here 
 
 he pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste 
 
 just dab it on that be gone within the hour said fred we had to find a decent testing most of our products on ourselves 
 
 hermione looked nervous it is safe it she asked 
 
 course it is said fred bracingly come on harry give you a tour 
 
 harry left hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed fred toward the back of the shop where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks 
 
 muggle magic tricks said fred happily pointing them out for freaks like dad you know who love muggle stuff not a big earner but we do fairly steady business great novelties oh george 
 
 twin shook hand energetically 
 
 giving him the tour come through the back harry where making the real money pocket anything you and pay in more than galleons he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark make anyone sick 
 
 george pushed back a curtain beside the muggle tricks and harry saw a darker less crowded room the packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued 
 
 just developed this more serious line said fred funny how it happened 
 
 you believe how many people even people who work at the ministry do a decent shield charm said george course they have you teaching them harry 
 
 right well we thought shield hats were a bit of a laugh you know challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off but the ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff and still getting massive orders 
 
 so expanded into a range of shield cloaks shield gloves 
 
 i mean they help much against the unforgivable curses but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes 
 
 and then we thought get into the whole area of defense against the dark arts because such a money spinner continued george enthusiastically this is cool look instant darkness powder importing it from peru handy if you want to make a quick escape 
 
 and our decoy detonators are just walking off the shelves look said fred pointing at a number of black objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight you just drop one surreptitiously and run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight giving you a diversion if you need one 
 
 handy said harry impressed 
 
 here said george catching a couple and throwing them to harry 
 
 a young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes 
 
 a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron mr weasley and mr weasley she said 
 
 harry found it very odd to hear fred and george called mr weasley but they took it in their stride 
 
 right you are verity coming said george promptly harry you help yourself to anything you want all right no charge 
 
 i do that said harry who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the decoy detonators 
 
 you pay here said fred firmly waving away gold 
 
 but 
 
 you gave us our loan we forgotten said george sternly take whatever you like and just remember to tell people where you got it if they ask 
 
 george swept off through the curtain to help with the customers and fred led harry back into the main part of the shop to find hermione and ginny still poring over the patented daydream charms 
 
 you girls found our special wonderwitch products yet asked fred follow me ladies 
 
 near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically hermione and ginny both hung back looking wary 
 
 there you go said fred proudly best range of love potions find anywhere 
 
 ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically do they work she asked 
 
 certainly they work for up to hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question 
 
 and the attractiveness of the girl said george reappearing suddenly at their side but not selling them to our sister he added becoming suddenly stern not when already got about five boys on the go from what 
 
 whatever heard from ron is a big fat lie said ginny calmly leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf this 
 
 guaranteed pimple vanisher said fred excellent on everything from boils to blackheads but change the subject are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called dean thomas 
 
 yes i am said ginny and last time i looked he was definitely one boy not five what are those 
 
 she was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting squeaks 
 
 pygmy puffs said george miniature puffskeins we breed them fast enough so what about michael corner 
 
 i dumped him he was a bad loser said ginny putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the pygmy puffs crowd around it really cute 
 
 fairly cuddly yes conceded fred but moving through boyfriends a bit fast you 
 
 ginny turned to look at him her hands on her hips there was such a mrs glare on her face that harry was surprised fred recoil 
 
 none of your business and thank you she added angrily to ron who had just appeared at elbow laden with merchandise not to tell tales about me to these two 
 
 three galleons nine sickles and a knut said fred examining the many boxes in arms cough up 
 
 your brother 
 
 and our stuff nicking three galleons nine sickles knock off the knut 
 
 but i got three galleons nine sickles 
 
 better put it back then and mind you put it on the right shelves 
 
 ron dropped several boxes swore and made a rude hand gesture at fred that was unfortunately spotted by mrs weasley who had chosen that moment to appear 
 
 if i see you do that again jinx your fingers together she said sharply 
 
 mum can i have a pygmy puff said ginny at once 
 
 a what said mrs weasley warily 
 
 look so sweet 
 
 mrs weasley moved aside to look at the pygmy puffs and harry ron and hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window draco malfoy was hurrying up the street alone as he passed weasleys wizard wheezes he glanced over his shoulder seconds later he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him 
 
 wonder where his mummy is said harry frowning 
 
 given her the slip by the looks of it said ron 
 
 why though said hermione 
 
 harry said nothing he was thinking too hard narcissa malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches 
 
 harry knowing and loathing malfoy was sure the reason could not be innocent 
 
 he glanced around mrs weasley and ginny were bending over the pygmy puffs mr weasley was delightedly examining a pack of muggle marked playing cards fred and george were both helping customers on the other side of the glass hagrid was standing with his back to them looking up and down the street 
 
 get under here quick said harry pulling his invisibility cloak out of his bag 
 
 ohi know harry said hermione looking uncertainly toward mrs weasley 
 
 come on said ron 
 
 she hesitated for a second longer then ducked under the cloak with harry and ron nobody noticed them vanish they were all too interested in fred and products harry ron and hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could but by the time they gained the street malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had 
 
 he was going in that direction murmured harry as quietly as possible so that the humming hagrid would not hear them 
 
 they scurried along peering left and right through shop windows and doors until hermione pointed ahead 
 
 him it she whispered turning left 
 
 big surprise whispered ron 
 
 for malfoy had glanced around then slid into knockturn alley and out of sight 
 
 quick or lose him said harry speeding up 
 
 our be seen said hermione anxiously as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays 
 
 it matter said harry impatiently just hurry 
 
 but knockturn alley the side street devoted to the dark arts looked completely deserted they peered into windows as they passed but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy dark artifacts or at least to be seen buying them 
 
 hermione gave his arm a hard pinch 
 
 ouch 
 
 shh look in there she breathed in ear 
 
 they had drawn level with the only shop in knockturn alley that harry had ever visited borgin and burkes which sold a wide variety of sinister objects there in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood draco malfoy with his back to them just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which harry had once hidden to avoid malfoy and his father judging by the movements of hands he was talking animatedly the proprietor of the shop mr borgin an stooping man stood facing malfoy he was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear 
 
 if only we could hear what saying said hermione 
 
 we can said ron excitedly hang ondamn 
 
 he dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest 
 
 extendable ears look 
 
 fantastic said hermione as ron unraveled the long strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door oh i hope the door imperturbable 
 
 no said ron gleefully listen 
 
 they put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings through which voice could be heard loud and clear as though a radio had been turned on 
 
 you know how to fix it 
 
 possibly said borgin in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself need to see it though why you bring it into the shop 
 
 i said malfoy got to stay put i just need you to tell me how to do it 
 
 harry saw borgin lick his lips nervously 
 
 well without seeing it i must say it will be a very difficult job perhaps impossible i guarantee anything 
 
 no said malfoy and harry knew just by his tone that malfoy was sneering perhaps this will make you more confident 
 
 he moved toward borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet harry ron and hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight but all they could see was borgin looking very frightened 
 
 tell anyone said maifoy and there will be retribution you know fenrir greyback a family friend be dropping in from time to time to make sure giving the problem your full attention 
 
 there will be no need for 
 
 decide that said malfoy well better be off and forget to keep that one safe need it 
 
 perhaps like to take it now 
 
 no of course i you stupid little man how would i look carrying that down the street just sell it 
 
 of course not sir 
 
 borgin made a bow as deep as the one harry had once seen him give lucius malfoy 
 
 not a word to anyone borgin and that includes my mother understand 
 
 naturally naturally murmured borgin bowing again 
 
 next moment the bell over the door tinkled loudly as malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself he passed so close to harry ron and hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again inside the shop borgin remained frozen his unctuous smile had vanished he looked worried 
 
 what was that about whispered ron reeling in the extendable ears 
 
 dunno said harry thinking hard he wants something mended and he wants to reserve something in there could you see what he pointed at when he said that one 
 
 no he was behind that cabinet 
 
 you two stay here whispered hermione 
 
 what are you 
 
 but hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak she checked her hair in the reflection in the glass then marched into the shop setting the bell tinkling again ron hastily fed the extendable ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to harry 
 
 hello horrible morning it hermione said brightly to borgin who did not answer but cast her a suspicious look humming cheerily hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display 
 
 is this necklace for sale she asked pausing beside a case 
 
 if got one and a half thousand galleons said mr borgin coldly 
 
 oherno i got quite that much said hermione walking on and what about this lovelyumskull 
 
 sixteen galleons 
 
 so for sale then it being kept for anyone 
 
 mr borgin squinted at her harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what hermione was up to apparently hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the winds 
 
 the thing is thaterboy who was in here just now draco malfoy well a friend of mine and i want to get him a birthday present but if already reserved anything i obviously want to get him the same thing so um 
 
 it was a pretty lame story in opinion and apparently borgin thought so too 
 
 out he said sharply get out 
 
 hermione did not wait to be asked twice but hurried to the door with borgin at her heels as the bell tinkled again borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign 
 
 ah well said ron throwing the cloak back over hermione worth a try but you were a bit obvious 
 
 well next time you can show me how done master of mystery she snapped 
 
 ron and hermione bickered all the way back to weasleys wizard wheezes where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very mrs weasley and hagrid who had clearly noticed their absence once in the shop harry whipped off the invisibility cloak hid it in his bag and joined in with the other two when they insisted in answer to mrs weasleys accusations that they had been in the back room all along and that she could not have looked properly 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter six detourcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry remained within the confines of the garden over the next few weeks he spent most of his days playing quidditch in the weasleys orchard he and hermione against ron and ginny hermione was dreadful and ginny good so they were reasonably well matched and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything mrs weasley put in front of him 
 
 it would have been a happy peaceful holiday had it not been for the stories of disappearances odd accidents even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the prophet sometimes bill and mr weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper to mrs displeasure sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by remus lupin who was looking gaunt and grim his brown hair streaked liberally with gray his clothes more ragged and patched than ever 
 
 there have been another couple of dementor attacks he announced as mrs weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake and found igor body in a shack up north the dark mark had been set over it well frankly surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the death eaters brother regulus only managed a few days as far as i can remember 
 
 yes well said mrs weasley frowning perhaps we should talk about something diff 
 
 did you hear about florean fortescue remus asked bill who was being plied with wine by fleur the man who ran 
 
 the place in diagon alley harry interrupted with an unpleasant hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach he used to give me free ice creams happened to him 
 
 dragged off by the look of his place 
 
 why asked ron while mrs weasley pointedly glared at bill 
 
 who knows he upset them somehow he was a good man florean 
 
 talking of diagon alley said mr weasley looks like gone too 
 
 the said ginny looking startled 
 
 the one empty no sign of a struggle no one knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped 
 
 but people do for wands 
 
 make do with other makers said lupin but ollivander was the best and if the other side have got him not so good for us 
 
 the day after this rather gloomy birthday tea their letters and booklists arrived from hogwarts included a surprise he had been made quidditch captain 
 
 that gives you equal status with prefects cried hermione happily you can use our special bathroom now and everything 
 
 wow i remember when charlie wore one of these said ron examining the badge with glee harry this is so cool my captain if you let me back on the team i suppose ha ha 
 
 well i suppose we can put off a trip to diagon alley much longer now got these sighed mrs weasley looking down booklist go on saturday as long as your father have to go into work again not going there without him 
 
 mum honestly think going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in flourish and blotts sniggered ron 
 
 fortescue and ollivander went on holiday did they said mrs weasley firing up at once if you think a laughing matter you can stay behind and get your things myself 
 
 no i wanna come i want to see fred and shop said ron hastily 
 
 then you just buck up your ideas young man before i decide too immature to come with us said mrs weasley angrily snatching up her clock all nine hands of which were still pointing at mortal peril and balancing it on top of a pile of towels and that goes for returning to hogwarts as well 
 
 ron turned to stare incredulously at harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room 
 
 blimey you even make a joke round here anymore 
 
 but ron was careful not to be flippant about voldemort over the next few days saturday dawned without any more outbursts from mrs weasley though she seemed very tense at breakfast bill who would be staying at home with fleur much to hermione and pleasure passed a full money bag across the table to harry 
 
 mine demanded ron at once his eyes wide 
 
 already idiot said bill i got it out of your vault for you harry because taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment the goblins have tightened security so much two days ago arkie philpott had a probity probe stuck up his well trust me this easier 
 
 thanks bill said harry pocketing his gold 
 
 e is always so thoughtful purred fleur adoringly stroking nose ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind fleur harry choked over his cornflakes and ron thumped him on the back 
 
 it was an overcast murky day one of the special ministry of magic cars in which harry had ridden once before was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house pulling on their cloaks 
 
 good dad can get us these again said ron appreciatively stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the burrow bill and fleur waving from the kitchen window he harry hermione and ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat 
 
 get used to it only because of harry said mr weasley over his shoulder he and mrs weasley were in front with the ministry driver the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a sofa been given security status and be joining up with additional security at the leaky cauldron too 
 
 harry said nothing he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of aurors he had stowed his invisibility cloak in his backpack and felt that if that was good enough for dumbledore it ought to be good enough for the ministry though now he came to think of it he was not sure the ministry knew about his cloak 
 
 here you are then said the driver a surprisingly short while later speaking for the first time as he slowed in charing cross road and stopped outside the leaky cauldron to wait for you any idea how long be 
 
 a couple of hours i expect said mr weasley ah good here 
 
 harry imitated mr weasley and peered through the window his heart leapt there were no aurors waiting outside the inn but instead the gigantic form of rubeus hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper wearing a long beaverskin coat beaming at the sight of face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing muggles 
 
 harry he boomed sweeping harry into a hug the moment harry had stepped out of the car buckbeakwitherwings i meanyeh should see him harry so happy ter be back in the open air 
 
 glad pleased said harry grinning as he massaged his ribs we know security meant you 
 
 i know jus like old times innit see the ministry wanted ter send a bunch o aurors but dumbledore said do said hagrid proudly throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets lets get goin thenafter yeh molly arthur 
 
 the leaky cauldron was for the first time in memory completely empty only tom the landlord wizened and toothless remained of the old crowd he looked up hopefully as they entered but before he could speak hagrid said importantly jus passin through today tom sure yeh understand hogwarts business yeh know 
 
 tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses harry hermione hagrid and the weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street they stepped through the entrance and paused looking around 
 
 diagon alley had changed the colorful glittering window displays of spellbooks potion ingredients and cauldrons were lost to view hidden behind the large ministry of magic posters that had been pasted over them most of these somber purple posters carried versions of the security advice on the ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer but others bore moving photographs of death eaters known to be on the loose bellatrix lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary a few windows were boarded up including those of florean ice cream parlor on the other hand a number of stalls had sprung up along the street the nearest one which had been erected outside flourish and blotts under a striped stained awning had a cardboard sign pinned to its front 
 
 amulets effective against werewolves dementors and inferi 
 a little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby 
 
 one for your little girl madam he called at mrs weasley as they passed leering at ginny protect her pretty neck 
 
 if i were on duty said mr weasley glaring angrily at the amulet seller 
 
 yes but go arresting anyone now dear in a hurry said mrs weasley nervously consulting a list i think better do madam first hermione wants new dress robes and showing much too much ankle in his school robes and you must need new ones too harry grown so much come on everyone 
 
 molly it make sense for all of us to go to madam said mr weasley why those three go with hagrid and we can go to flourish and blotts and get school books 
 
 i know said mrs weasley anxiously clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack hagrid do you think 
 
 don fret be fine with me molly said hagrid soothingly waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid mrs weasley did not look entirely convinced but allowed the separation scurrying off toward flourish and blotts with her husband and ginny while harry ron hermione and hagrid set off for madam 
 
 harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried anxious look as mrs weasley and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore the shoppers stayed together in their own tightly knit groups moving intently about their business nobody seemed to be shopping alone 
 
 migh be a bit of a squeeze in there with all o us said hagrid stopping outside madam and bending down to peer through the window stand guard outside all righ 
 
 so harry ron and hermione entered the little shop together it appeared at first glance to be empty but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue 
 
 not a child in case you noticed mother i am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone 
 
 there was a clucking noise and a voice harry recognized as that of madam malkin the owner said now dear your quite right none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore nothing to do with being a child 
 
 watch where sticking that pin will you 
 
 a teenage boy with a pale pointed face and hair appeared from behind the rack wearing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the sleeves he strode to the mirror and examined himself it was a few moments before he noticed harry ron and hermione reflected over his shoulder his light gray eyes narrowed 
 
 if wondering what the smell is mother a mudblood just walked in said draco malfoy 
 
 i think any need for language like that said madam malkin scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand and i want wands drawn in my shop either she added hastily for a glance toward the door had shown her harry and ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at malfoy 
 
 hermione who was standing slightly behind them whispered no honestly not worth it 
 
 yeah like dare do magic out of school sneered malfoy who blacked your eye granger i want to send them flowers 
 
 quite enough said madam malkin sharply looking over her shoulder for support madamplease 
 
 narcissa malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack 
 
 put those away she said coldly to harry and ron if you attack my son again i shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do 
 
 really said harry taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that for all its pallor still resembled her he was as tall as she was now going to get a few death eater pals to do us in are you 
 
 madam malkin squealed and clutched at her heart 
 
 really you accuse dangerous thing to say wands away please 
 
 but harry did not lower his wand narcissa malfoy smiled unpleasantly 
 
 i see that being favorite has given you a false sense of security harry potter but dumbledore always be there to protect you 
 
 harry looked mockingly all around the shop wow look at that not here now so why not have a go they might be able to find you a double cell in azkaban with your loser of a husband 
 
 malfoy made an angry movement toward harry but stumbled over his overlong robe ron laughed loudly 
 
 you dare talk to my mother like that potter malfoy snarled 
 
 all right draco said narcissa restraining him with her thin white fingers upon his shoulder i expect potter will be reunited with dear sirius before i am reunited with lucius 
 
 harry raised his wand higher 
 
 harry no moaned hermione grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side think you be in such trouble 
 
 madam malkin dithered for a moment on the spot then seemed to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope that it she bent toward malfoy who was still glaring at harry 
 
 i think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more dear let me just 
 
 ouch bellowed malfoy slapping her hand away watch where putting your pins woman mother i think i want these anymore 
 
 he pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at madam feet 
 
 right draco said narcissa with a contemptuous glance at hermione now i know the kind of scum that shops here do better at twilfitt and 
 
 and with that the pair of them strode out of the shop malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into ron on the way out 
 
 well really said madam malkin snatching up the fallen robes and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner so that it removed all the dust 
 
 she was distracted all through the fitting of and new robes tried to sell hermione dress robes instead of and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them 
 
 got asked hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side 
 
 just about said harry did you see the malfoys 
 
 yeah said hagrid unconcerned but they wouldn dare make trouble in the middle o diagon alley harry don worry about them 
 
 harry ron and hermione exchanged looks but before they could disabuse hagrid of this comfortable notion mr and mrs weasley and ginny appeared all clutching heavy packages of books 
 
 everyone all right said mrs weasley got your robes right then we can pop in at the apothecary and eeylops on the way to fred and stick close now 
 
 neither harry nor ron bought any ingredients at the apothecary seeing that they were no longer studying potions but both bought large boxes of owl nuts for hedwig and pigwidgeon at eeylops owl emporium then with mrs weasley checking her watch every minute or so they headed farther along the street in search of weasleys wizard wheezes the joke shop run by fred and george 
 
 we really got too long mrs weasley said so just have a quick look around and then back to the car we must be close number 
 
 ron stopping in his tracks 
 
 set against the dull shop fronts around them fred and georges windows hit the eye like a firework display casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows and a few rather people had actually come to a halt transfixed the window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved popped flashed bounced and shrieked eyes began to water just looking at it the window was covered with a gigantic poster purple like those of the ministry but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters 
 
 why are you worrying about 
 you should be worrying about 
 
 the constipation sensation gripping the nation 
 harry started to laugh he heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see mrs weasley gazing dumbfounded at the poster her lips moved silently mouthing the name 
 
 be murdered in their beds she whispered 
 
 no they said ron who like harry was laughing this is brilliant 
 
 and he and harry led the way into the shop it was packed with customers harry could not get near the shelves he stared around looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling here were the skiving snackboxes that the twins had perfected during their last unfinished year at hogwarts harry noticed that the nosebleed nougat was most popular with only one battered box left on the shelf there were bins full of trick wands the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck and boxes of quills which came in and varieties a space cleared in the crowd and harry pushed his way toward the counter where a gaggle of delighted was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows both perched on a box that read reusable hangmanspell it or swing 
 
 patented daydream charms 
 
 hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship 
 
 one simple incantation and you will enter a highly realistic daydream easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling not for sale to you know said hermione looking up at harry that really is extraordinary magic 
 
 for that hermione said a voice behind them you can have one for free 
 
 a beaming fred stood before them wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair 
 
 how are you harry they shook hands and happened to your eye hermione 
 
 your punching telescope she said ruefully 
 
 oh blimey i forgot about those said fred here 
 
 he pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste 
 
 just dab it on that be gone within the hour said fred we had to find a decent testing most of our products on ourselves 
 
 hermione looked nervous it is safe it she asked 
 
 course it is said fred bracingly come on harry give you a tour 
 
 harry left hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed fred toward the back of the shop where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks 
 
 muggle magic tricks said fred happily pointing them out for freaks like dad you know who love muggle stuff not a big earner but we do fairly steady business great novelties oh george 
 
 twin shook hand energetically 
 
 giving him the tour come through the back harry where making the real money pocket anything you and pay in more than galleons he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark make anyone sick 
 
 george pushed back a curtain beside the muggle tricks and harry saw a darker less crowded room the packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued 
 
 just developed this more serious line said fred funny how it happened 
 
 you believe how many people even people who work at the ministry do a decent shield charm said george course they have you teaching them harry 
 
 right well we thought shield hats were a bit of a laugh you know challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off but the ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff and still getting massive orders 
 
 so expanded into a range of shield cloaks shield gloves 
 
 i mean they help much against the unforgivable curses but for minor to moderate hexes or jinxes 
 
 and then we thought get into the whole area of defense against the dark arts because such a money spinner continued george enthusiastically this is cool look instant darkness powder importing it from peru handy if you want to make a quick escape 
 
 and our decoy detonators are just walking off the shelves look said fred pointing at a number of black objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight you just drop one surreptitiously and run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight giving you a diversion if you need one 
 
 handy said harry impressed 
 
 here said george catching a couple and throwing them to harry 
 
 a young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain harry saw that she too was wearing magenta staff robes 
 
 a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron mr weasley and mr weasley she said 
 
 harry found it very odd to hear fred and george called mr weasley but they took it in their stride 
 
 right you are verity coming said george promptly harry you help yourself to anything you want all right no charge 
 
 i do that said harry who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the decoy detonators 
 
 you pay here said fred firmly waving away gold 
 
 but 
 
 you gave us our loan we forgotten said george sternly take whatever you like and just remember to tell people where you got it if they ask 
 
 george swept off through the curtain to help with the customers and fred led harry back into the main part of the shop to find hermione and ginny still poring over the patented daydream charms 
 
 you girls found our special wonderwitch products yet asked fred follow me ladies 
 
 near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically hermione and ginny both hung back looking wary 
 
 there you go said fred proudly best range of love potions find anywhere 
 
 ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically do they work she asked 
 
 certainly they work for up to hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question 
 
 and the attractiveness of the girl said george reappearing suddenly at their side but not selling them to our sister he added becoming suddenly stern not when already got about five boys on the go from what 
 
 whatever heard from ron is a big fat lie said ginny calmly leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf this 
 
 guaranteed pimple vanisher said fred excellent on everything from boils to blackheads but change the subject are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called dean thomas 
 
 yes i am said ginny and last time i looked he was definitely one boy not five what are those 
 
 she was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting squeaks 
 
 pygmy puffs said george miniature puffskeins we breed them fast enough so what about michael corner 
 
 i dumped him he was a bad loser said ginny putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the pygmy puffs crowd around it really cute 
 
 fairly cuddly yes conceded fred but moving through boyfriends a bit fast you 
 
 ginny turned to look at him her hands on her hips there was such a mrs glare on her face that harry was surprised fred recoil 
 
 none of your business and thank you she added angrily to ron who had just appeared at elbow laden with merchandise not to tell tales about me to these two 
 
 three galleons nine sickles and a knut said fred examining the many boxes in arms cough up 
 
 your brother 
 
 and our stuff nicking three galleons nine sickles knock off the knut 
 
 but i got three galleons nine sickles 
 
 better put it back then and mind you put it on the right shelves 
 
 ron dropped several boxes swore and made a rude hand gesture at fred that was unfortunately spotted by mrs weasley who had chosen that moment to appear 
 
 if i see you do that again jinx your fingers together she said sharply 
 
 mum can i have a pygmy puff said ginny at once 
 
 a what said mrs weasley warily 
 
 look so sweet 
 
 mrs weasley moved aside to look at the pygmy puffs and harry ron and hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window draco malfoy was hurrying up the street alone as he passed weasleys wizard wheezes he glanced over his shoulder seconds later he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him 
 
 wonder where his mummy is said harry frowning 
 
 given her the slip by the looks of it said ron 
 
 why though said hermione 
 
 harry said nothing he was thinking too hard narcissa malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches 
 
 harry knowing and loathing malfoy was sure the reason could not be innocent 
 
 he glanced around mrs weasley and ginny were bending over the pygmy puffs mr weasley was delightedly examining a pack of muggle marked playing cards fred and george were both helping customers on the other side of the glass hagrid was standing with his back to them looking up and down the street 
 
 get under here quick said harry pulling his invisibility cloak out of his bag 
 
 ohi know harry said hermione looking uncertainly toward mrs weasley 
 
 come on said ron 
 
 she hesitated for a second longer then ducked under the cloak with harry and ron nobody noticed them vanish they were all too interested in fred and products harry ron and hermione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could but by the time they gained the street malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had 
 
 he was going in that direction murmured harry as quietly as possible so that the humming hagrid would not hear them 
 
 they scurried along peering left and right through shop windows and doors until hermione pointed ahead 
 
 him it she whispered turning left 
 
 big surprise whispered ron 
 
 for malfoy had glanced around then slid into knockturn alley and out of sight 
 
 quick or lose him said harry speeding up 
 
 our be seen said hermione anxiously as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays 
 
 it matter said harry impatiently just hurry 
 
 but knockturn alley the side street devoted to the dark arts looked completely deserted they peered into windows as they passed but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy dark artifacts or at least to be seen buying them 
 
 hermione gave his arm a hard pinch 
 
 ouch 
 
 shh look in there she breathed in ear 
 
 they had drawn level with the only shop in knockturn alley that harry had ever visited borgin and burkes which sold a wide variety of sinister objects there in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood draco malfoy with his back to them just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which harry had once hidden to avoid malfoy and his father judging by the movements of hands he was talking animatedly the proprietor of the shop mr borgin an stooping man stood facing malfoy he was wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear 
 
 if only we could hear what saying said hermione 
 
 we can said ron excitedly hang ondamn 
 
 he dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest 
 
 extendable ears look 
 
 fantastic said hermione as ron unraveled the long strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door oh i hope the door imperturbable 
 
 no said ron gleefully listen 
 
 they put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings through which voice could be heard loud and clear as though a radio had been turned on 
 
 you know how to fix it 
 
 possibly said borgin in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself need to see it though why you bring it into the shop 
 
 i said malfoy got to stay put i just need you to tell me how to do it 
 
 harry saw borgin lick his lips nervously 
 
 well without seeing it i must say it will be a very difficult job perhaps impossible i guarantee anything 
 
 no said malfoy and harry knew just by his tone that malfoy was sneering perhaps this will make you more confident 
 
 he moved toward borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet harry ron and hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight but all they could see was borgin looking very frightened 
 
 tell anyone said maifoy and there will be retribution you know fenrir greyback a family friend be dropping in from time to time to make sure giving the problem your full attention 
 
 there will be no need for 
 
 decide that said malfoy well better be off and forget to keep that one safe need it 
 
 perhaps like to take it now 
 
 no of course i you stupid little man how would i look carrying that down the street just sell it 
 
 of course not sir 
 
 borgin made a bow as deep as the one harry had once seen him give lucius malfoy 
 
 not a word to anyone borgin and that includes my mother understand 
 
 naturally naturally murmured borgin bowing again 
 
 next moment the bell over the door tinkled loudly as malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself he passed so close to harry ron and hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again inside the shop borgin remained frozen his unctuous smile had vanished he looked worried 
 
 what was that about whispered ron reeling in the extendable ears 
 
 dunno said harry thinking hard he wants something mended and he wants to reserve something in there could you see what he pointed at when he said that one 
 
 no he was behind that cabinet 
 
 you two stay here whispered hermione 
 
 what are you 
 
 but hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak she checked her hair in the reflection in the glass then marched into the shop setting the bell tinkling again ron hastily fed the extendable ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to harry 
 
 hello horrible morning it hermione said brightly to borgin who did not answer but cast her a suspicious look humming cheerily hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on display 
 
 is this necklace for sale she asked pausing beside a case 
 
 if got one and a half thousand galleons said mr borgin coldly 
 
 oherno i got quite that much said hermione walking on and what about this lovelyumskull 
 
 sixteen galleons 
 
 so for sale then it being kept for anyone 
 
 mr borgin squinted at her harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what hermione was up to apparently hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the winds 
 
 the thing is thaterboy who was in here just now draco malfoy well a friend of mine and i want to get him a birthday present but if already reserved anything i obviously want to get him the same thing so um 
 
 it was a pretty lame story in opinion and apparently borgin thought so too 
 
 out he said sharply get out 
 
 hermione did not wait to be asked twice but hurried to the door with borgin at her heels as the bell tinkled again borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign 
 
 ah well said ron throwing the cloak back over hermione worth a try but you were a bit obvious 
 
 well next time you can show me how done master of mystery she snapped 
 
 ron and hermione bickered all the way back to weasleys wizard wheezes where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very mrs weasley and hagrid who had clearly noticed their absence once in the shop harry whipped off the invisibility cloak hid it in his bag and joined in with the other two when they insisted in answer to mrs weasleys accusations that they had been in the back room all along and that she could not have looked properly

 the shock of losing hung over the house in the days that followed harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other order members who passed in and out to relay news harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy horcruxes as soon as possible 
 
 well you cant do anything about the c ron mouthed the word horcruxes c till youre seventeen youve still got the trace on you and we can plan here as well as anywhere cant we or he dropped his voice to a whisper dyou reckon you already know where the are 
 
 no harry admitted 
 
 i think hermiones been doing a bit of research said ron she said she was saving it for when you got here 
 
 they were sitting at the breakfast table mr weasley and bill had just left for work mrs weasley had gone upstairs to wake hermione and ginny while fleur had drifted off to take a bath 
 
 the tracell break on the said harry that means i only need to stay here four days then i can c 
 
 five days ron corrected him firmly weve got to stay for the wedding theyll kill us if we miss it 
 
 harry understood they to mean fleur and mrs weasley 
 
 its one extra day said ron when harry looked mutinous 
 
 dont they realize how important c 
 
 course they dont said ron they havent got a clue and now you mention it i wanted to talk to you about that 
 
 ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that mrs weasley was not returning yet then leaned in closer to harry 
 
 mums been trying to get it out of hermione and me what were off to do shell try you next so brace yourself dad and lupinve both asked as well but when we said dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us they dropped it not mum though shes determined 
 
 rons prediction came true within hours shortly before lunch mrs weasley detached harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone mans sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen she started 
 
 ron and hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of hogwarts she began in a light casual tone 
 
 oh said harry well yeah we are 
 
 the mangle turned of its own accord in a corner wringing out what looked like one of mr weasleys vests 
 
 may i ask why you are abandoning your education said mrs weasley 
 
 well dumbledore left me stuff to do mumbled harry ron and hermione know about it and they want to come too 
 
 what sort of stuff 
 
 im sorry i cant c 
 
 well frankly i think arthur and i have a right to know and im sure mr and mrs granger would agree said mrs weasley harry had been afraid of the concerned parent attack he forced himself to look directly into her eyes noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as ginnys this did not help 
 
 dumbledore didnt want anyone else to know mrs weasley im sorry ron and hermione dont have to come its their choice c 
 
 i dont see that you have to go either she snapped dropping all pretense now youre barely of age any of you its utter nonsense if dumbledore needed work doing he had the whole order at his command harry you must have misunderstood him probably he was telling you something he wanted done and you took it to mean that he wanted youc 
 
 i didnt misunderstand said harry flatly its got to be me 
 
 he handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying which was patterned with golden bulrushes 
 
 and thats not mine i dont support puddlemere united 
 
 oh of course not said mrs weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone i should have realized well harry while weve still got you here you wont mind helping with the preparations for bill and fleurs wedding will you theres still so much to do 
 
 no c i c of course not said harry disconcerted by this sudden change of subject 
 
 sweet of you she replied and she smiled as she left the scullery 
 
 from that moment on mrs weasley kept harry ron and hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think the kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that mrs weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of and the terrors of their recent journey after two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning of favors ribbons and flowers of the garden and helping mrs weasley cook vast batches of canaps however harry started to suspect her of a different motive all the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him ron and hermione away from one another he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night when he had told them about voldemort torturing ollivander 
 
 i think mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning shell be able to delay you leaving ginny told harry in an undertone as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay 
 
 and then what does she thinks going to happen harry muttered someone else might kill off voldemort while shes holding us here making 
 
 he had spoken without thinking and saw ginnys face whiten 
 
 so its true she said thats what youre trying to do 
 
 i c not c i was joking said harry evasively 
 
 they stared at each other and there was something more than shock in ginnys expression suddenly harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the hogwarts grounds he was sure she was remembering them too both of them jumped as the door opened and mr weasley kingsley and bill walked in 
 
 they were often joined by other order members for dinner now because the burrow had replaced number twelve grimmauld place as the headquarters mr weasley had explained that after the death of dumbledore their each of the people to whom dumbledore had confided grimmauld places location had become a in turn 
 
 and as there are around twenty of us that greatly dilutes the power of the fidelius charm twenty times as many opportunities for the death eaters to get the secret out of somebody we cant expect it to hold much longer 
 
 but surely snape will have told the death eaters the address by now asked harry 
 
 well set up a couple of curses against snape in case he turns up there again we hope theyll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place but we cant be sure it would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky 
 
 the kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks harry found himself crammed beside ginny the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people he was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken 
 
 no news about harry asked bill 
 
 nothing replied bill 
 
 they had not been able to hold a funeral for moody because bill and lupin had failed to recover his body it had been difficult to know where he might have fallen given the darkness and the confusion of the battle 
 
 the daily prophet hasnt said a word about him dying or about finding the body bill went on but that doesnt mean much its keeping a lot quiet these days 
 
 and they still havent called a hearing about all the underage magic i used escaping the death eaters harry called across the table to mr weasley who shook his head 
 
 because they know i had no choice or because they dont want me to tell the world voldemort attacked me 
 
 the latter i think scrimgeour doesnt want to admit that is as powerful as he is nor that azkabans seen a mass breakout 
 
 yeah why tell the public the truth said harry clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out white against his skin i must not tell lies 
 
 isnt anyone at the ministry prepared to stand up to him asked ron angrily 
 
 of course ron but people are terrified mr weasley replied terrified that they will be next to disappear their children the next to be attacked there are nasty rumors going around i for one dont believe the muggle studies professor at hogwarts resigned she hasnt been seen for weeks now meanwhile scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day i just hope hes working on a plan 
 
 there was a pause in which mrs weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart 
 
 we must decide ow you will be disguised arry said fleur once everyone had pudding for ze wedding she added when he looked confused of course none of our guests are death eaters but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ave ad champagne 
 
 from this harry gathered that she still suspected hagrid 
 
 yes good point said mrs weasley from the top of the table where she sat spectacles perched on the end of her nose scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment now ron have you cleaned out your room yet 
 
 why exclaimed ron slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother why does my room have to be cleaned out harry and i are fine with it the way it is 
 
 we are holding your brothers wedding here in a few days time young man c 
 
 and are they getting married in my bedroom asked ron furiously no so why in the name of merlins saggy left c 
 
 dont talk to your mother like that said mr weasley firmly and do as youre told 
 
 ron scowled at both his parents then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart 
 
 i can help some of its my mess harry told ron but mrs weasley cut across him 
 
 no harry dear id much rather you helped arthur much out the chickens and hermione id be ever so grateful if youd change the sheets for monsieur and madame delacour you know theyre arriving at eleven tomorrow morning 
 
 but as it turned out there was very little to do for the chickens theres no need to er mention it to molly mr weasley told harry blocking his access to the coop but er ted tonks sent me most of what was left of siriuss bike and er im hiding c thats to say keeping c it in here fantastic stuff theres an exhaust gaskin as i believe its called the most magnificent battery and itll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work im going to try and put it all back together again when mollys not c i mean when ive got time 
 
 when they returned to the house mrs weasley was nowhere to be seen so harry slipped upstairs to rons attic bedroom 
 
 im doing it im doing c oh its you said ron in relief as harry entered the room ron lay back down on the bed which he had evidently just vacated the room was just as messy as it had been all week the only chance was that hermione was now sitting in the far corner her fluffy ginger cat crookshanks at her feet sorting books some of which harry recognized as his own into two enormous piles 
 
 hi harry she said as he sat down on his camp bed 
 
 and how did you manage to get away 
 
 oh rons mum forgot that she asked ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday said hermione she threw numerology and grammatica onto one pile and the rise and fall of the dark arts onto the other 
 
 we were just talking about ron told harry i reckon he might have survived 
 
 but bill saw him hit by the killing curse said harry 
 
 yeah but bill was under attack too said ron how can he be sure what he saw 
 
 even if the killing curse missed still fell about a thousand feet said hermione now weight quidditch teams of britain and ireland in her hand 
 
 he could have used a shield charm c 
 
 fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand said harry 
 
 well all right if you want him to be dead said ron grumpily punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape 
 
 of course we dont want him to be dead said hermione looking shocked its dreadful that hes dead but were being realistic 
 
 for the first time harry imagined body broken as dumbledores had been yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket he felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh 
 
 the death eaters probably tidied up after themselves thats why no ones found him said ron wisely 
 
 yeah said harry like barty crouch turned into a bone and buried in hagrids front garden they probably transfigured moody and stuffed him c 
 
 dont squealed hermione startled harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of spellmans syllabary 
 
 oh no said harry struggling to get up from the old camp bed hermione i wasnt trying to upset c 
 
 but with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings ron bounded off the bed and got there first one arm around hermione he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier hastily pulling out his wand he pointed it at the rag and said tergeo 
 
 the wand siphoned off most of the grease looking rather pleased with himself ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to hermione 
 
 oh thanks ron im sorry she blew her nose and hiccupped its just so isnt it after dumbledore i imagined dying somehow he seemed so tough 
 
 yeah i know said ron giving her a squeeze but you know what hed say to us if he was here 
 
 vigilance said hermione mopping her eyes 
 
 thats right said ron nodding hed tell us to learn from what happened to him and what ive learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit mundungus 
 
 hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books a second later ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders she had dropped the monster of monsters on his foot the book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at rons ankle 
 
 im sorry im sorry hermione cried as harry wrenched the book from rons leg and retied it shit 
 
 what are you doing with all those books anyway ron asked limping back to his bed 
 
 just trying to decide which ones to take with us said hermione when were looking for the horcruxes 
 
 oh of course said ron clapping a hand to his forehead i forgot well be hunting down voldemort in a mobile library 
 
 ha ha said hermione looking down at spellmans syllabary i wonder will we need to translate runes its possible i think wed better take it to be safe 
 
 she dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up hogwarts a history 
 
 listen said harry 
 
 he had sat up straight ron and hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance 
 
 i know you said after dumbledores funeral that you wanted to come with me harry began 
 
 here he goes ron said to hermione rolling his eyes 
 
 as we knew he would he sighed turning back to the books you know i think i will take hogwarts a history even if were not going back there i dont think id feel right if i didnt have it with c 
 
 listen said harry again 
 
 no harry you listen said hermione were coming with you that was decided months ago c years really 
 
 but c 
 
 shut up ron advised him 
 
 c are you sure youve thought this through harry persisted 
 
 lets see said hermione slamming travels with trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look ive been packing for days so were ready to leave at a moments notice which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic not to mention smuggling whole stock of polyjuice potion right under rons mums nose 
 
 ive also modified my parents memories so that theyre convinced theyre really called wendell and monica wilkins and that their lifes ambition is to move to australia which they have now done thats to make it more difficult for voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me c or you because unfortunately ive told them quite a bit about you 
 
 assuming i survive our hunt for the horcruxes ill find mum and dad and lift the enchantment if i dont c well i think ive cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy wendell and monica wilkins dont know that theyve got a daughter you see 
 
 hermiones eyes were swimming with tears again ron got back off the bed put his arm around her once more and frowned at harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact harry could not think of anything to say not least because it was highly unusual for ron to be teaching anyone else tact 
 
 i c hermione im sorry c i didnt c 
 
 didnt realize that ron and i know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you well we do ron show harry what youve done 
 
 nah hes just eaten said ron 
 
 go on he needs to know 
 
 oh all right harry come here 
 
 for the second time ron withdrew his arm from around hermione and stumped over to the door 
 
 cmon 
 
 why harry asked following ron out of the room onto the tiny landing 
 
 descendo muttered ron pointing his wand at the low ceiling a hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet a horrible sound came out of the square hole along with an unpleasant smell like open drains 
 
 thats your ghoul isnt it asked harry who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence 
 
 yeah it is said ron climbing the ladder come and have a look at him 
 
 harry followed ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space his head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open 
 
 but it it looks do ghouls normally wear pajamas 
 
 no said ron nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules 
 
 harry contemplated the thing slightly revolted it was human in shape and size and was wearing what now that harrys eyes became used to the darkness was clearly an old pair of rons pajamas he was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters 
 
 hes me see said ron 
 
 no said harry i dont 
 
 ill explain it back in my room the smells getting to me said ron they climbed back down the ladder which ron returned to the ceiling and rejoined hermione who was still sorting books 
 
 once weve left the ghouls going to come and live down here in my room said ron i think hes really looking forward to it c well its hard to tell because all he can do is moan and drool c but he nods a lot when you mention it anyway hes going to be me with spattergroit good eh 
 
 harry merely looked his confusion 
 
 it is said ron clearly frustrated that harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan look when we three dont turn up at hogwarts again everyones going to think hermione and i must be with you right which means the death eaters will go straight for our families to see if theyve got information on where you are 
 
 but hopefully itll look like ive gone away with mum and dad a lot of are talking about going into hiding at the moment said hermione 
 
 we cant hide my whole family itll look too fishy and they cant all leave their jobs said ron so were going to put out the story that im seriously ill with spattergroit which is why i cant go back to school if anyone comes calling to investigate mum or dad can show them the ghoul in my bed covered in pustules spattergroits really contagious so theyre not going to want to go near him it wont matter that he cant say anything either because apparently you cant once the fungus has spread to your uvula 
 
 and your mum and dad are in on this plan asked harry 
 
 dad is he helped fred and george transform the ghoul mum well youve seen what shes like she wont accept were going till were gone 
 
 there was silence in the room broken only by gentle thuds as hermione continued to throw books onto one pile or the other ron sat watching her and harry looked from one to the other unable to say anything the measure they had taken to protect their families made him realize more than anything else could have done that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be he wanted to tell them what that meant to him but he simply could not find words important enough 
 
 through the silence came the muffled sounds of mrs weasley shouting from four floors below 
 
 ginnys probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring said ron i dunno why the delacours have got to come two days before the wedding 
 
 fleurs sisters a bridesmaid she needs to be here for the rehearsal and shes too young to come on her own said hermione as she pored indecisively over break with a banshee 
 
 well guests arent going to help mums stress levels said ron 
 
 what we really need to decide said hermione tossing defensive magical theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up an appraisal of magical education in europe is where were going after we leave here i know you said you wanted to go to godrics hollow first harry and i understand why but well shouldnt we make the horcruxes our priority 
 
 if we knew where any of the horcruxes were id agree with you said harry who did not believe that hermione really understood his desire to return to godrics hollow his parents graves were only part of the attraction he had a strong though inexplicable feeling that the place held answers for him perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived voldemorts killing curse now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat harry was drawn to the place where it had happened wanting to understand 
 
 dont you think theres a possibility that voldemorts keeping a watch on godrics hollow hermione asked he might expect you to go back and visit your parents graves once youre free to go wherever you like 
 
 this had not occurred to harry while he struggled to find a counterargument ron spoke up evidently following his own train of thought 
 
 this person he said you know the one who stole the real locket 
 
 hermione nodded 
 
 he said in his note he was going to destroy it didnt he 
 
 harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake horcrux in which note was still folded 
 
 i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as i can harry read out 
 
 well what if he did finish it off said ron 
 
 or she interposed hermione 
 
 whichever said ron itd be one less for us to do 
 
 yes but were still going to have to try and trace the real locket arent we said hermione to find out whether or not its destroyed 
 
 and once we get hold of it how do you destroy a horcrux asked ron 
 
 well said hermione ive been researching that 
 
 how asked harry i didnt think there were any books on horcruxes in the library 
 
 there werent said hermione who had turned pink dumbledore removed them all but he c he didnt destroy them 
 
 ron sat up straight 
 
 how in the name of merlins pants have you managed to get your hands on those horcrux books 
 
 it c it wasnt stealing said hermione looking from harry to ron with a kind of desperation they were still library books even if dumbledore had taken them off the shelves anyway if he really didnt want anyone to get at them im sure he would have made it much harder to c 
 
 get to the point said ron 
 
 well it was easy said hermione in a small voice i just did a summoning charm you know c accio and c they zoomed out of dumbledores study window right into the girls dormitory 
 
 but when did you do this harry asked regarding hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity 
 
 just after his c dumbledores c funeral said hermione in an even smaller voice right after we agreed wed leave school and go and look for the horcruxes when i went back upstairs to get my things it c it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them the better it would be and i was alone in there so i tried and it worked they flew straight in through the open window and i c i packed them 
 
 she swallowed and then said imploringly i cant believe dumbledore would have been angry its not as though were going to use the information to make a horcrux is it 
 
 can you hear us complaining said ron where are these books anyway 
 
 hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume bound in faded black leather she looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead 
 
 this is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a horcrux secrets of the darkest art c its a horrible book really awful full of evil magic i wonder when dumbledore removed it from the library if he didnt do it until he was headmaster i bet voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here 
 
 why did he have to ask slughorn how to make a horcrux then if hed already read that asked ron 
 
 he only approached slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven said harry dumbledore was sure riddle already knew how to make a horcrux by the time he asked slughorn about them i think youre right hermione that could easily have been where he got the information 
 
 and the more ive read about them said hermione the more horrible they seem and the less i can believe that he actually made six it warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it and thats just by making one horcrux 
 
 harry remembered what dumbledore had said about voldemort moving beyond usual evil 
 
 isnt there any way of putting yourself back together ron asked 
 
 yes said hermione with a hollow smile but it would be excruciatingly painful 
 
 why how do you do it asked harry 
 
 remorse said hermione youve got to really feel what youve done theres a footnote apparently the pain of it can destroy you i cant see voldemort attempting it somehow can you 
 
 no said ron before harry could answer so does it say how to destroy horcruxes in that book 
 
 yes said hermione now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails because it warns dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them from all that ive read what harry did to riddles diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a horcrux 
 
 what stabbing it with a basilisk fang asked harry 
 
 oh well lucky weve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs then said ron i was wondering what we were going to do with them 
 
 it doesnt have to be a basilisk fang said hermione patiently it has to be something so destructive that the horcrux cant repair itself basilisk venom only has one antidote and its incredibly rare c 
 
 c phoenix tears said harry nodding 
 
 exactly said hermione our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom and theyre all dangerous to carry around with you thats a problem were going to have to solve though because ripping smashing or crushing a horcrux wont do the trick youve got to put it beyond magical repair 
 
 but even if we wreck the thing it lives in said ron why cant the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else 
 
 because a horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being 
 
 seeing that harry and ron looked thoroughly confused hermione hurried on look if i picked up a sword right now ron and ran you through with it i wouldnt damage your soul at all 
 
 which would be a real comfort to me im sure said ron harry laughed 
 
 it should be actually but my point is that whatever happens to your body your soul will survive untouched said hermione but its the other way round with a horcrux the fragment of soul inside it depends on its container its enchanted body for survival it cant exist without it 
 
 that diary sort of died when i stabbed it said harry remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages and the screams of the piece of voldemorts soul as it vanished 
 
 and once the diary was properly destroyed the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did flushing it away but obviously it came back good as new 
 
 hang on said ron frowning the bit of soul in that diary was possessing ginny wasnt it how does that work then 
 
 while the magical container is still intact the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object i dont mean holding it for too long its nothing to do with touching it she added before ron could speak i mean close emotionally ginny poured her heart out into that diary she made herself incredibly vulnerable youre in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the horcrux 
 
 i wonder how dumbledore destroyed the ring said harry why didnt i ask him i never really 
 
 his voice trailed away he was thinking of all the things he should have asked dumbledore and of how since the headmaster had died it seemed to harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when dumbledore had been alive to find out more to find out everything 
 
 the silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a crash hermione shrieked and dropped secrets of the darkest art crookshanks streaked under the bed hissing indignantly ron jumped off the bed skidded on a discarded chocolate frog wrapper and smacked his head on the opposite wall and harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at mrs weasley whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage 
 
 im so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering she said her voice trembling im sure you all need your rest but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and i was under the impression that you had agreed to help 
 
 oh yes said hermione looking terrified as she leapt to her feet sending books flying in every direction we will were sorry 
 
 with an anguished look at harry and ron hermione hurried out of the room after mrs weasley 
 
 its like being a complained ron in an undertone still massaging his head as he and harry followed except without the job satisfaction the sooner this weddings over the happier ill be 
 
 yeah said harry then well have nothing to do except find horcruxes itll be like a holiday wont it 
 
 ron started to laugh but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them in mrs weasleys room stopped quite abruptly 
 
 the delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o clock harry ron hermione and ginny were feeling quite resentful toward fleurs family by this time and it was with ill grace that ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks and harry attempted to flatten his hair once they had all been deemed smart enough they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors 
 
 harry had never seen the place looking so tidy the rusty cauldrons and old wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone replaced by two new flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots though there was no breeze the leaves waved lazily giving an attractive rippling effect the chickens had been shut away the yard had been swept and the nearby garden had been pruned plucked and generally spruced up although harry who liked it in its overgrown state thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes 
 
 he had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the burrow by both the order and the ministry all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place mr weasley had therefore gone to meet the delacours on top of a nearby hill where they were to arrive by portkey the first sound of their approach was an unusually laugh which turned out to be coming from mr weasley who appeared at the gate moments later laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long leaf green robes who could be fleurs mother 
 
 maman cried fleur rushing forward to embrace her papa 
 
 monsieur delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife he was a head shorter and extremely plumb with a little pointed black beard however he looked bouncing towards mrs weasley on boots he kissed her twice on each cheek leaving her flustered 
 
 you ave been so much trouble he said in a deep voice fleur tells us you ave been working very ard 
 
 oh its been nothing nothing trilled mrs weasley no trouble at all 
 
 ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of the new flutterby bushes 
 
 dear lady said monsieur delacour still holding mrs weasleys hand between his own two plump ones and beaming we are most honored at the approaching union of our two families let me present my wife apolline 
 
 madame delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss mrs weasley too 
 
 enchante she said your usband as been telling us such amusing stories 
 
 mr weasley gave a maniacal laugh mrs weasley threw him a look upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend 
 
 and of course you ave met my leetle daughter gabrielle said monsieur delacour gabrielle was fleur in miniature eleven years old with hair of pure silvery blonde she gave mrs weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her then threw harry a glowing look batting her eyelashes ginny cleared her throat loudly 
 
 well come in do said mrs weasley brightly and she ushered the delacours into the house with many no and after and not at 
 
 the delacours it soon transpired were helpful pleasant guests they were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding monsieur delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids shoes charmant madame delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice gabrielle followed her elder sister around trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid french 
 
 on the downside the burrow was not built to accommodate so many people mr and mrs weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room having shouted down monsieur and madame delacours protests and insisted they take their bedroom gabrielle was sleeping with fleur in percys old room and bill would be sharing with charlie his best man once charlie arrived from romania opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent and it was in desperation that harry ron and hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house 
 
 but she still wont leave us alone snarled ron and their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of mrs weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms 
 
 oh good youve fed the chickens she called as she approached them wed better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow to put up the tent for the wedding she explained pausing to lean against the henhouse she looked exhausted millamants magic marquees theyre very good bills escorting them youd better stay inside while theyre here harry i must say it does complicate organizing a wedding having all these security spells around the place 
 
 im sorry said harry humbly 
 
 oh dont be silly dear said mrs weasley at once i didnt mean c well your safetys much more important actually ive been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday harry seventeen after all its an important day 
 
 i dont want a fuss said harry quickly envisaging the additional strain this would put on them all really mrs weasley just a normal dinner would be fine its the day before the wedding 
 
 oh well if youre sure dear ill invite remus and tonks shall i and how about hagrid 
 
 thatd be great said harry but please dont go to loads of trouble 
 
 not at all not at all its no trouble 
 
 she looked at him a long searching look then smiled a little sadly straightened up and walked away harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her 
 
 rowling

 the deathly hallows 
 

lionfish nov chapter six the ghoul in pajamascontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the shock of losing hung over the house in the days that followed harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other order members who passed in and out to relay news harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy horcruxes as soon as possible 
 
 well you cant do anything about the c ron mouthed the word horcruxes c till youre seventeen youve still got the trace on you and we can plan here as well as anywhere cant we or he dropped his voice to a whisper dyou reckon you already know where the are 
 
 no harry admitted 
 
 i think hermiones been doing a bit of research said ron she said she was saving it for when you got here 
 
 they were sitting at the breakfast table mr weasley and bill had just left for work mrs weasley had gone upstairs to wake hermione and ginny while fleur had drifted off to take a bath 
 
 the tracell break on the said harry that means i only need to stay here four days then i can c 
 
 five days ron corrected him firmly weve got to stay for the wedding theyll kill us if we miss it 
 
 harry understood they to mean fleur and mrs weasley 
 
 its one extra day said ron when harry looked mutinous 
 
 dont they realize how important c 
 
 course they dont said ron they havent got a clue and now you mention it i wanted to talk to you about that 
 
 ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that mrs weasley was not returning yet then leaned in closer to harry 
 
 mums been trying to get it out of hermione and me what were off to do shell try you next so brace yourself dad and lupinve both asked as well but when we said dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us they dropped it not mum though shes determined 
 
 rons prediction came true within hours shortly before lunch mrs weasley detached harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone mans sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen she started 
 
 ron and hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of hogwarts she began in a light casual tone 
 
 oh said harry well yeah we are 
 
 the mangle turned of its own accord in a corner wringing out what looked like one of mr weasleys vests 
 
 may i ask why you are abandoning your education said mrs weasley 
 
 well dumbledore left me stuff to do mumbled harry ron and hermione know about it and they want to come too 
 
 what sort of stuff 
 
 im sorry i cant c 
 
 well frankly i think arthur and i have a right to know and im sure mr and mrs granger would agree said mrs weasley harry had been afraid of the concerned parent attack he forced himself to look directly into her eyes noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as ginnys this did not help 
 
 dumbledore didnt want anyone else to know mrs weasley im sorry ron and hermione dont have to come its their choice c 
 
 i dont see that you have to go either she snapped dropping all pretense now youre barely of age any of you its utter nonsense if dumbledore needed work doing he had the whole order at his command harry you must have misunderstood him probably he was telling you something he wanted done and you took it to mean that he wanted youc 
 
 i didnt misunderstand said harry flatly its got to be me 
 
 he handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying which was patterned with golden bulrushes 
 
 and thats not mine i dont support puddlemere united 
 
 oh of course not said mrs weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone i should have realized well harry while weve still got you here you wont mind helping with the preparations for bill and fleurs wedding will you theres still so much to do 
 
 no c i c of course not said harry disconcerted by this sudden change of subject 
 
 sweet of you she replied and she smiled as she left the scullery 
 
 from that moment on mrs weasley kept harry ron and hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think the kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that mrs weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of and the terrors of their recent journey after two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning of favors ribbons and flowers of the garden and helping mrs weasley cook vast batches of canaps however harry started to suspect her of a different motive all the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him ron and hermione away from one another he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night when he had told them about voldemort torturing ollivander 
 
 i think mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning shell be able to delay you leaving ginny told harry in an undertone as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay 
 
 and then what does she thinks going to happen harry muttered someone else might kill off voldemort while shes holding us here making 
 
 he had spoken without thinking and saw ginnys face whiten 
 
 so its true she said thats what youre trying to do 
 
 i c not c i was joking said harry evasively 
 
 they stared at each other and there was something more than shock in ginnys expression suddenly harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the hogwarts grounds he was sure she was remembering them too both of them jumped as the door opened and mr weasley kingsley and bill walked in 
 
 they were often joined by other order members for dinner now because the burrow had replaced number twelve grimmauld place as the headquarters mr weasley had explained that after the death of dumbledore their each of the people to whom dumbledore had confided grimmauld places location had become a in turn 
 
 and as there are around twenty of us that greatly dilutes the power of the fidelius charm twenty times as many opportunities for the death eaters to get the secret out of somebody we cant expect it to hold much longer 
 
 but surely snape will have told the death eaters the address by now asked harry 
 
 well set up a couple of curses against snape in case he turns up there again we hope theyll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place but we cant be sure it would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky 
 
 the kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks harry found himself crammed beside ginny the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people he was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken 
 
 no news about harry asked bill 
 
 nothing replied bill 
 
 they had not been able to hold a funeral for moody because bill and lupin had failed to recover his body it had been difficult to know where he might have fallen given the darkness and the confusion of the battle 
 
 the daily prophet hasnt said a word about him dying or about finding the body bill went on but that doesnt mean much its keeping a lot quiet these days 
 
 and they still havent called a hearing about all the underage magic i used escaping the death eaters harry called across the table to mr weasley who shook his head 
 
 because they know i had no choice or because they dont want me to tell the world voldemort attacked me 
 
 the latter i think scrimgeour doesnt want to admit that is as powerful as he is nor that azkabans seen a mass breakout 
 
 yeah why tell the public the truth said harry clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out white against his skin i must not tell lies 
 
 isnt anyone at the ministry prepared to stand up to him asked ron angrily 
 
 of course ron but people are terrified mr weasley replied terrified that they will be next to disappear their children the next to be attacked there are nasty rumors going around i for one dont believe the muggle studies professor at hogwarts resigned she hasnt been seen for weeks now meanwhile scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day i just hope hes working on a plan 
 
 there was a pause in which mrs weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart 
 
 we must decide ow you will be disguised arry said fleur once everyone had pudding for ze wedding she added when he looked confused of course none of our guests are death eaters but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ave ad champagne 
 
 from this harry gathered that she still suspected hagrid 
 
 yes good point said mrs weasley from the top of the table where she sat spectacles perched on the end of her nose scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment now ron have you cleaned out your room yet 
 
 why exclaimed ron slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother why does my room have to be cleaned out harry and i are fine with it the way it is 
 
 we are holding your brothers wedding here in a few days time young man c 
 
 and are they getting married in my bedroom asked ron furiously no so why in the name of merlins saggy left c 
 
 dont talk to your mother like that said mr weasley firmly and do as youre told 
 
 ron scowled at both his parents then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart 
 
 i can help some of its my mess harry told ron but mrs weasley cut across him 
 
 no harry dear id much rather you helped arthur much out the chickens and hermione id be ever so grateful if youd change the sheets for monsieur and madame delacour you know theyre arriving at eleven tomorrow morning 
 
 but as it turned out there was very little to do for the chickens theres no need to er mention it to molly mr weasley told harry blocking his access to the coop but er ted tonks sent me most of what was left of siriuss bike and er im hiding c thats to say keeping c it in here fantastic stuff theres an exhaust gaskin as i believe its called the most magnificent battery and itll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work im going to try and put it all back together again when mollys not c i mean when ive got time 
 
 when they returned to the house mrs weasley was nowhere to be seen so harry slipped upstairs to rons attic bedroom 
 
 im doing it im doing c oh its you said ron in relief as harry entered the room ron lay back down on the bed which he had evidently just vacated the room was just as messy as it had been all week the only chance was that hermione was now sitting in the far corner her fluffy ginger cat crookshanks at her feet sorting books some of which harry recognized as his own into two enormous piles 
 
 hi harry she said as he sat down on his camp bed 
 
 and how did you manage to get away 
 
 oh rons mum forgot that she asked ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday said hermione she threw numerology and grammatica onto one pile and the rise and fall of the dark arts onto the other 
 
 we were just talking about ron told harry i reckon he might have survived 
 
 but bill saw him hit by the killing curse said harry 
 
 yeah but bill was under attack too said ron how can he be sure what he saw 
 
 even if the killing curse missed still fell about a thousand feet said hermione now weight quidditch teams of britain and ireland in her hand 
 
 he could have used a shield charm c 
 
 fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand said harry 
 
 well all right if you want him to be dead said ron grumpily punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape 
 
 of course we dont want him to be dead said hermione looking shocked its dreadful that hes dead but were being realistic 
 
 for the first time harry imagined body broken as dumbledores had been yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket he felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh 
 
 the death eaters probably tidied up after themselves thats why no ones found him said ron wisely 
 
 yeah said harry like barty crouch turned into a bone and buried in hagrids front garden they probably transfigured moody and stuffed him c 
 
 dont squealed hermione startled harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of spellmans syllabary 
 
 oh no said harry struggling to get up from the old camp bed hermione i wasnt trying to upset c 
 
 but with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings ron bounded off the bed and got there first one arm around hermione he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier hastily pulling out his wand he pointed it at the rag and said tergeo 
 
 the wand siphoned off most of the grease looking rather pleased with himself ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to hermione 
 
 oh thanks ron im sorry she blew her nose and hiccupped its just so isnt it after dumbledore i imagined dying somehow he seemed so tough 
 
 yeah i know said ron giving her a squeeze but you know what hed say to us if he was here 
 
 vigilance said hermione mopping her eyes 
 
 thats right said ron nodding hed tell us to learn from what happened to him and what ive learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit mundungus 
 
 hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books a second later ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders she had dropped the monster of monsters on his foot the book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at rons ankle 
 
 im sorry im sorry hermione cried as harry wrenched the book from rons leg and retied it shit 
 
 what are you doing with all those books anyway ron asked limping back to his bed 
 
 just trying to decide which ones to take with us said hermione when were looking for the horcruxes 
 
 oh of course said ron clapping a hand to his forehead i forgot well be hunting down voldemort in a mobile library 
 
 ha ha said hermione looking down at spellmans syllabary i wonder will we need to translate runes its possible i think wed better take it to be safe 
 
 she dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up hogwarts a history 
 
 listen said harry 
 
 he had sat up straight ron and hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance 
 
 i know you said after dumbledores funeral that you wanted to come with me harry began 
 
 here he goes ron said to hermione rolling his eyes 
 
 as we knew he would he sighed turning back to the books you know i think i will take hogwarts a history even if were not going back there i dont think id feel right if i didnt have it with c 
 
 listen said harry again 
 
 no harry you listen said hermione were coming with you that was decided months ago c years really 
 
 but c 
 
 shut up ron advised him 
 
 c are you sure youve thought this through harry persisted 
 
 lets see said hermione slamming travels with trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look ive been packing for days so were ready to leave at a moments notice which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic not to mention smuggling whole stock of polyjuice potion right under rons mums nose 
 
 ive also modified my parents memories so that theyre convinced theyre really called wendell and monica wilkins and that their lifes ambition is to move to australia which they have now done thats to make it more difficult for voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me c or you because unfortunately ive told them quite a bit about you 
 
 assuming i survive our hunt for the horcruxes ill find mum and dad and lift the enchantment if i dont c well i think ive cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy wendell and monica wilkins dont know that theyve got a daughter you see 
 
 hermiones eyes were swimming with tears again ron got back off the bed put his arm around her once more and frowned at harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact harry could not think of anything to say not least because it was highly unusual for ron to be teaching anyone else tact 
 
 i c hermione im sorry c i didnt c 
 
 didnt realize that ron and i know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you well we do ron show harry what youve done 
 
 nah hes just eaten said ron 
 
 go on he needs to know 
 
 oh all right harry come here 
 
 for the second time ron withdrew his arm from around hermione and stumped over to the door 
 
 cmon 
 
 why harry asked following ron out of the room onto the tiny landing 
 
 descendo muttered ron pointing his wand at the low ceiling a hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet a horrible sound came out of the square hole along with an unpleasant smell like open drains 
 
 thats your ghoul isnt it asked harry who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence 
 
 yeah it is said ron climbing the ladder come and have a look at him 
 
 harry followed ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space his head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open 
 
 but it it looks do ghouls normally wear pajamas 
 
 no said ron nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules 
 
 harry contemplated the thing slightly revolted it was human in shape and size and was wearing what now that harrys eyes became used to the darkness was clearly an old pair of rons pajamas he was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters 
 
 hes me see said ron 
 
 no said harry i dont 
 
 ill explain it back in my room the smells getting to me said ron they climbed back down the ladder which ron returned to the ceiling and rejoined hermione who was still sorting books 
 
 once weve left the ghouls going to come and live down here in my room said ron i think hes really looking forward to it c well its hard to tell because all he can do is moan and drool c but he nods a lot when you mention it anyway hes going to be me with spattergroit good eh 
 
 harry merely looked his confusion 
 
 it is said ron clearly frustrated that harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan look when we three dont turn up at hogwarts again everyones going to think hermione and i must be with you right which means the death eaters will go straight for our families to see if theyve got information on where you are 
 
 but hopefully itll look like ive gone away with mum and dad a lot of are talking about going into hiding at the moment said hermione 
 
 we cant hide my whole family itll look too fishy and they cant all leave their jobs said ron so were going to put out the story that im seriously ill with spattergroit which is why i cant go back to school if anyone comes calling to investigate mum or dad can show them the ghoul in my bed covered in pustules spattergroits really contagious so theyre not going to want to go near him it wont matter that he cant say anything either because apparently you cant once the fungus has spread to your uvula 
 
 and your mum and dad are in on this plan asked harry 
 
 dad is he helped fred and george transform the ghoul mum well youve seen what shes like she wont accept were going till were gone 
 
 there was silence in the room broken only by gentle thuds as hermione continued to throw books onto one pile or the other ron sat watching her and harry looked from one to the other unable to say anything the measure they had taken to protect their families made him realize more than anything else could have done that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be he wanted to tell them what that meant to him but he simply could not find words important enough 
 
 through the silence came the muffled sounds of mrs weasley shouting from four floors below 
 
 ginnys probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring said ron i dunno why the delacours have got to come two days before the wedding 
 
 fleurs sisters a bridesmaid she needs to be here for the rehearsal and shes too young to come on her own said hermione as she pored indecisively over break with a banshee 
 
 well guests arent going to help mums stress levels said ron 
 
 what we really need to decide said hermione tossing defensive magical theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up an appraisal of magical education in europe is where were going after we leave here i know you said you wanted to go to godrics hollow first harry and i understand why but well shouldnt we make the horcruxes our priority 
 
 if we knew where any of the horcruxes were id agree with you said harry who did not believe that hermione really understood his desire to return to godrics hollow his parents graves were only part of the attraction he had a strong though inexplicable feeling that the place held answers for him perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived voldemorts killing curse now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat harry was drawn to the place where it had happened wanting to understand 
 
 dont you think theres a possibility that voldemorts keeping a watch on godrics hollow hermione asked he might expect you to go back and visit your parents graves once youre free to go wherever you like 
 
 this had not occurred to harry while he struggled to find a counterargument ron spoke up evidently following his own train of thought 
 
 this person he said you know the one who stole the real locket 
 
 hermione nodded 
 
 he said in his note he was going to destroy it didnt he 
 
 harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake horcrux in which note was still folded 
 
 i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as i can harry read out 
 
 well what if he did finish it off said ron 
 
 or she interposed hermione 
 
 whichever said ron itd be one less for us to do 
 
 yes but were still going to have to try and trace the real locket arent we said hermione to find out whether or not its destroyed 
 
 and once we get hold of it how do you destroy a horcrux asked ron 
 
 well said hermione ive been researching that 
 
 how asked harry i didnt think there were any books on horcruxes in the library 
 
 there werent said hermione who had turned pink dumbledore removed them all but he c he didnt destroy them 
 
 ron sat up straight 
 
 how in the name of merlins pants have you managed to get your hands on those horcrux books 
 
 it c it wasnt stealing said hermione looking from harry to ron with a kind of desperation they were still library books even if dumbledore had taken them off the shelves anyway if he really didnt want anyone to get at them im sure he would have made it much harder to c 
 
 get to the point said ron 
 
 well it was easy said hermione in a small voice i just did a summoning charm you know c accio and c they zoomed out of dumbledores study window right into the girls dormitory 
 
 but when did you do this harry asked regarding hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity 
 
 just after his c dumbledores c funeral said hermione in an even smaller voice right after we agreed wed leave school and go and look for the horcruxes when i went back upstairs to get my things it c it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them the better it would be and i was alone in there so i tried and it worked they flew straight in through the open window and i c i packed them 
 
 she swallowed and then said imploringly i cant believe dumbledore would have been angry its not as though were going to use the information to make a horcrux is it 
 
 can you hear us complaining said ron where are these books anyway 
 
 hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume bound in faded black leather she looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead 
 
 this is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a horcrux secrets of the darkest art c its a horrible book really awful full of evil magic i wonder when dumbledore removed it from the library if he didnt do it until he was headmaster i bet voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here 
 
 why did he have to ask slughorn how to make a horcrux then if hed already read that asked ron 
 
 he only approached slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven said harry dumbledore was sure riddle already knew how to make a horcrux by the time he asked slughorn about them i think youre right hermione that could easily have been where he got the information 
 
 and the more ive read about them said hermione the more horrible they seem and the less i can believe that he actually made six it warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it and thats just by making one horcrux 
 
 harry remembered what dumbledore had said about voldemort moving beyond usual evil 
 
 isnt there any way of putting yourself back together ron asked 
 
 yes said hermione with a hollow smile but it would be excruciatingly painful 
 
 why how do you do it asked harry 
 
 remorse said hermione youve got to really feel what youve done theres a footnote apparently the pain of it can destroy you i cant see voldemort attempting it somehow can you 
 
 no said ron before harry could answer so does it say how to destroy horcruxes in that book 
 
 yes said hermione now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails because it warns dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them from all that ive read what harry did to riddles diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a horcrux 
 
 what stabbing it with a basilisk fang asked harry 
 
 oh well lucky weve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs then said ron i was wondering what we were going to do with them 
 
 it doesnt have to be a basilisk fang said hermione patiently it has to be something so destructive that the horcrux cant repair itself basilisk venom only has one antidote and its incredibly rare c 
 
 c phoenix tears said harry nodding 
 
 exactly said hermione our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom and theyre all dangerous to carry around with you thats a problem were going to have to solve though because ripping smashing or crushing a horcrux wont do the trick youve got to put it beyond magical repair 
 
 but even if we wreck the thing it lives in said ron why cant the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else 
 
 because a horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being 
 
 seeing that harry and ron looked thoroughly confused hermione hurried on look if i picked up a sword right now ron and ran you through with it i wouldnt damage your soul at all 
 
 which would be a real comfort to me im sure said ron harry laughed 
 
 it should be actually but my point is that whatever happens to your body your soul will survive untouched said hermione but its the other way round with a horcrux the fragment of soul inside it depends on its container its enchanted body for survival it cant exist without it 
 
 that diary sort of died when i stabbed it said harry remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages and the screams of the piece of voldemorts soul as it vanished 
 
 and once the diary was properly destroyed the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did flushing it away but obviously it came back good as new 
 
 hang on said ron frowning the bit of soul in that diary was possessing ginny wasnt it how does that work then 
 
 while the magical container is still intact the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object i dont mean holding it for too long its nothing to do with touching it she added before ron could speak i mean close emotionally ginny poured her heart out into that diary she made herself incredibly vulnerable youre in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the horcrux 
 
 i wonder how dumbledore destroyed the ring said harry why didnt i ask him i never really 
 
 his voice trailed away he was thinking of all the things he should have asked dumbledore and of how since the headmaster had died it seemed to harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when dumbledore had been alive to find out more to find out everything 
 
 the silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a crash hermione shrieked and dropped secrets of the darkest art crookshanks streaked under the bed hissing indignantly ron jumped off the bed skidded on a discarded chocolate frog wrapper and smacked his head on the opposite wall and harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at mrs weasley whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage 
 
 im so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering she said her voice trembling im sure you all need your rest but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and i was under the impression that you had agreed to help 
 
 oh yes said hermione looking terrified as she leapt to her feet sending books flying in every direction we will were sorry 
 
 with an anguished look at harry and ron hermione hurried out of the room after mrs weasley 
 
 its like being a complained ron in an undertone still massaging his head as he and harry followed except without the job satisfaction the sooner this weddings over the happier ill be 
 
 yeah said harry then well have nothing to do except find horcruxes itll be like a holiday wont it 
 
 ron started to laugh but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them in mrs weasleys room stopped quite abruptly 
 
 the delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o clock harry ron hermione and ginny were feeling quite resentful toward fleurs family by this time and it was with ill grace that ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks and harry attempted to flatten his hair once they had all been deemed smart enough they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors 
 
 harry had never seen the place looking so tidy the rusty cauldrons and old wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone replaced by two new flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots though there was no breeze the leaves waved lazily giving an attractive rippling effect the chickens had been shut away the yard had been swept and the nearby garden had been pruned plucked and generally spruced up although harry who liked it in its overgrown state thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes 
 
 he had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the burrow by both the order and the ministry all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place mr weasley had therefore gone to meet the delacours on top of a nearby hill where they were to arrive by portkey the first sound of their approach was an unusually laugh which turned out to be coming from mr weasley who appeared at the gate moments later laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long leaf green robes who could be fleurs mother 
 
 maman cried fleur rushing forward to embrace her papa 
 
 monsieur delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife he was a head shorter and extremely plumb with a little pointed black beard however he looked bouncing towards mrs weasley on boots he kissed her twice on each cheek leaving her flustered 
 
 you ave been so much trouble he said in a deep voice fleur tells us you ave been working very ard 
 
 oh its been nothing nothing trilled mrs weasley no trouble at all 
 
 ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of the new flutterby bushes 
 
 dear lady said monsieur delacour still holding mrs weasleys hand between his own two plump ones and beaming we are most honored at the approaching union of our two families let me present my wife apolline 
 
 madame delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss mrs weasley too 
 
 enchante she said your usband as been telling us such amusing stories 
 
 mr weasley gave a maniacal laugh mrs weasley threw him a look upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend 
 
 and of course you ave met my leetle daughter gabrielle said monsieur delacour gabrielle was fleur in miniature eleven years old with hair of pure silvery blonde she gave mrs weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her then threw harry a glowing look batting her eyelashes ginny cleared her throat loudly 
 
 well come in do said mrs weasley brightly and she ushered the delacours into the house with many no and after and not at 
 
 the delacours it soon transpired were helpful pleasant guests they were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding monsieur delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids shoes charmant madame delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice gabrielle followed her elder sister around trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid french 
 
 on the downside the burrow was not built to accommodate so many people mr and mrs weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room having shouted down monsieur and madame delacours protests and insisted they take their bedroom gabrielle was sleeping with fleur in percys old room and bill would be sharing with charlie his best man once charlie arrived from romania opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent and it was in desperation that harry ron and hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house 
 
 but she still wont leave us alone snarled ron and their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of mrs weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms 
 
 oh good youve fed the chickens she called as she approached them wed better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow to put up the tent for the wedding she explained pausing to lean against the henhouse she looked exhausted millamants magic marquees theyre very good bills escorting them youd better stay inside while theyre here harry i must say it does complicate organizing a wedding having all these security spells around the place 
 
 im sorry said harry humbly 
 
 oh dont be silly dear said mrs weasley at once i didnt mean c well your safetys much more important actually ive been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday harry seventeen after all its an important day 
 
 i dont want a fuss said harry quickly envisaging the additional strain this would put on them all really mrs weasley just a normal dinner would be fine its the day before the wedding 
 
 oh well if youre sure dear ill invite remus and tonks shall i and how about hagrid 
 
 thatd be great said harry but please dont go to loads of trouble 
 
 not at all not at all its no trouble 
 
 she looked at him a long searching look then smiled a little sadly straightened up and walked away harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her
