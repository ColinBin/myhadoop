 luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon interview with harry would appear in the quibbler that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of snorkacks and of course be a very important story so might have to wait for the following issue said luna 
 
 harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when voldemort had returned rita had pressed him for every little detail and he had given her everything he could remember knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth he wondered how people would react to the story he guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about snorkacks but the breakout of bellatrix lestrange and her fellow death eaters had given harry a burning desire to do something whether or not it worked 
 
 wait to see what umbridge thinks of you going public said dean sounding awestruck at dinner on monday night seamus was shovelling down large amounts of chicken and ham pie on other side but harry knew he was listening 
 
 the right thing to do harry said neville who was sitting opposite him he was rather pale but went on in a low voice it must have been tough talking about it was it 
 
 yeah mumbled harry but people have got to know what capable of they 
 
 right said neville nodding and his death eaters too people should know 
 
 neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato seamus looked up but when he caught eye he looked quickly back at his plate again after a while dean seamus and neville departed for the common room leaving harry and hermione at the table waiting for ron who had not yet had dinner because of quidditch practice 
 
 cho chang walked into the hall with her friend marietta stomach gave an unpleasant lurch but she did not look over at the gryffindor table and sat down with her back to him 
 
 oh i forgot to ask you said hermione brightly glancing over at the ravenclaw table what happened on your date with cho how come you were back so early 
 
 er well it was said harry pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble towards him and helping himself to seconds a complete fiasco now you mention it 
 
 and he told her what had happened in madam teashop 
 
 so then he finished several minutes later as the final bit of crumble disappeared she jumps up right and says see you around harry and runs out of the place he put down his spoon and looked at hermione i mean what was all that about what was going on 
 
 hermione glanced over at the back of head and sighed 
 
 oh harry she said sadly well sorry but you were a bit tactless 
 
 me tactless said harry outraged one minute we were getting on fine next minute she was telling me that roger davies asked her out and how she used to go and snog cedric in that stupid teashophow was i supposed to feel about that 
 
 well you see said hermione with the patient air of someone explaining that one plus one equals two to an toddler you have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date 
 
 but but spluttered harry butyou told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along how was i supposed to do that without telling her 
 
 you should have told her differently said hermione still with that maddeningly patient air you should have said it was really annoying but made you promise to come along to the three broomsticks and you really want to go much rather spend the whole day with her but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please please come along with you and hopefully be able to get away more quickly and it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think i am too hermione added as an afterthought 
 
 but i think ugly said harry bemused 
 
 hermione laughed 
 
 harry worse than ron well no not she sighed as ron himself came stumping into the hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy lookyou upset cho when you said you were going to meet me so she tried to make you jealous it was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her 
 
 is that what she was doing said harry as ron dropped onto the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach towards him well it have been easier if just asked me whether i liked her better than you 
 
 girls often ask questions like that said hermione 
 
 well they should said harry forcefully then i just told her i fancy her and she have had to get herself all worked up again about cedric dying 
 
 not saying what she did was sensible said hermione as ginny joined them just as muddy as ron and looking equally disgruntled just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time 
 
 you should write a book ron told hermione as he cut up his potatoes translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them 
 
 yeah said harry fervently looking over at the ravenclaw table cho had just got up and still not looking at him she left the great hall feeling rather depressed he looked back at ron and ginny so how was quidditch practice 
 
 it was a nightmare said ron in a surly voice 
 
 oh come on said hermione looking at ginny sure it that 
 
 yes it was said ginny it was appalling angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it 
 
 ron and ginny went off for baths after dinner harry and hermione returned to the busy gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework harry had been struggling with a new for astronomy for half an hour when fred and george turned up 
 
 ron and ginny not here asked fred looking around as he pulled up a chair and when harry shook his head he said good we were watching their practice going to be slaughtered complete rubbish without us 
 
 come on not bad said george fairly sitting down next to fred actually i dunno how she got so good seeing how we never let her play with us 
 
 been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you looking said hermione from behind her tottering pile of ancient rune books 
 
 oh said george looking mildly impressed explain it 
 
 has ron saved a goal yet asked hermione peering over the top of magical hieroglyphs and logograms 
 
 well he can do it if he think watching him said fred rolling his eyes so all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the quaffle goes up his end on saturday 
 
 he got up again and moved restlessly to the window staring out across the dark grounds 
 
 you know quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for 
 
 hermione cast him a stern look 
 
 got exams coming 
 
 told you already not fussed about newts said fred the snackboxes are ready to roll we found out how to get rid of those boils just a couple of drops of murtlap essence sorts them lee put us on to it 
 
 george yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky 
 
 i dunno if i even want to watch this match if zacharias smith beats us i might have to kill myself 
 
 kill him more like said fred firmly 
 
 the trouble with quidditch said hermione once again bent over her runes translation it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the houses 
 
 she looked up to find her copy of syllabary and caught fred george and harry all staring at her with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces 
 
 well it does she said impatiently only a game it 
 
 hermione said harry shaking his head good on feelings and stuff but you just understand about quidditch 
 
 maybe not she said darkly returning to her translation but at least my happiness depend on goalkeeping ability 
 
 and though harry would rather have jumped off the astronomy tower than admit it to her by the time he had watched the game the following saturday he would have given any number of galleons not to care about quidditch either 
 
 the very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short the gryffindor spectators had to endure only minutes of agony it was hard to say what the worst thing was harry thought it was a contest between fourteenth failed save sloper missing the bludger but hitting angelina in the mouth with his bat and kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom when zacharias smith zoomed at him carrying the quaffle the miracle was that gryffindor only lost by ten points ginny managed to snatch the snitch from right under hufflepuff seeker nose so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty 
 
 good catch harry told ginny back in the common room where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral 
 
 i was lucky she shrugged it a very fast snitch and got a cold he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment anyway once back on the team 
 
 ginny got a lifelong ban 
 
 banned as long as umbridge is in the school ginny corrected him a difference anyway once back i think try out for chaser angelina and alicia are both leaving next year and i prefer to seeking anyway 
 
 harry looked over at ron who was hunched in a corner staring at his knees a bottle of butlerbeer clutched in his hand 
 
 angelina still let him resign ginny said as though reading mind she says she knows got it in him 
 
 harry liked angelina for the faith she was showing in ron but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of weasley is our king sung with great gusto by the slytherins who were now favourites to win the quidditch cup 
 
 fred and george wandered over 
 
 i even got the heart to take the mickey out of him said fred looking over at crumpled figure mind you when he missed the fourteenth 
 
 he made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright 
 
 well save it for parties eh 
 
 ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this out of respect for his feelings harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself so that ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to sure enough when harry finally entered the room ron was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible 
 
 harry got into bed thinking about the match it had been immensely frustrating watching from the sidelines he was quite impressed by performance but he knew if he had been playing he could have caught the snitch sooner there had been a moment when it had been fluttering near ankle if ginny hesitated she might have been able to scrape a win for gryffindor 
 
 umbridge had been sitting a few rows below harry and hermione once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him her wide mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating smile the memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark after a few minutes however he remembered that he was supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept as snape kept instructing him at the end of every occlumency lesson 
 
 he tried for a moment or two but the thought of snape on top of memories of umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them slowly snores died away to be replaced by the sound of deep slow breathing it took harry much longer to get to sleep his body was tired but it took his brain a long time to close down 
 
 he dreamed that neville and professor sprout were waltzing around the room of requirement while professor mcgonagall played the bagpipes he watched them happily for a while then decided to go and find the other members of the da 
 
 but when he left the room he found himself facing not the tapestry of barnabas the barmy but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall he turned his head slowly to the left there at the far end of the windowless passage was a plain black door 
 
 he walked towards it with a sense of mounting excitement he had the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last and find the way to open it he was feet from it and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the side the door was ajar he stretched out his hand to push it wide and 
 
 ron gave a loud rasping genuine snore and harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness to open a door that was hundreds of miles away he let it fall with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt he knew he should not have seen the door but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with ron if only he could have saved his snore for just another minute 
 
 they entered the great hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on monday morning hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her daily prophet nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped death eaters who despite many reported sightings had still not been caught she gave the delivery owl a knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while harry helped himself to orange juice as he had only received one note during the entire year he was sure when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him that it had made a mistake 
 
 you after he asked it languidly removing his orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forwards to see the name and address 
 
 harry potter 
 
 great hall 
 
 hogwarts school 
 
 frowning he made to take the letter from the owl but before he could do so three four five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position treading in the butter and knocking over the salt as each one attempted to give him their letter first 
 
 going on ron asked in amazement as the whole of gryffindor table leaned forwards to watch and another seven owls landed amongst the first ones screeching hooting and flapping their wings 
 
 harry said hermione breathlessly plunging her hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long cylindrical package i think i know what this meansopen this one first 
 
 harry ripped off the brown packaging out rolled a tightly furled copy of the march edition of the unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover in large red letters across this picture were the words 
 
 harry potter speaks out at last 
 
 the truth about he who must not be named 
 
 and the night i saw him return 
 
 good it said luna who had drifted over to the gryffindor table and now squeezed herself on to the bench between fred and ron it came out yesterday i asked dad to send you a free copy i expect all these she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of harry are letters from readers 
 
 what i thought said hermione eagerly harry mind if we 
 
 help yourself said harry feeling slightly bemused 
 
 ron and hermione both started ripping open envelopes 
 
 this from a bloke who thinks off your rocker said ron glancing down his letter ah well 
 
 this woman recommends you try a good course of shock spells at st said hermione looking disappointed and crumpling up a second 
 
 this one looks ok though said harry slowly scanning a long letter from a witch in paisley hey she says she believes me 
 
 this in two minds said fred who had joined in the with enthusiasm says you come across as a mad person but he really want to believe back so he know what to think now blimey what a waste of parchment 
 
 another one convinced harry said hermione excitedly having read your side of the story i am forced to the conclusion that the daily prophet has treated you very unfairly little though i want to think that he who must not be named has returned i am forced to accept that you are telling the truth oh this is wonderful 
 
 another one who thinks barking said ron throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder but this one says got her converted and she now thinks a real put in a photograph toowow 
 
 what is going on here said a falsely sweet girlish voice 
 
 harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes professor umbridge was standing behind fred and luna her bulging eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of harry behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly 
 
 why have you got all these letters mr potter she asked slowly 
 
 is that a crime now said fred loudly getting mail 
 
 be careful mr weasley or i shall have to put you in detention said umbridge well mr potter 
 
 harry hesitated but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of the quibbler came to attention 
 
 people have written to me because i gave an interview said harry about what happened to me last june 
 
 for some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this harry had the strangest feeling that dumbledore had been watching him a second before but when he looked towards the headmaster he seemed to be absorbed in conversation with professor flitwick 
 
 an interview repeated umbridge her voice thinner and higher than ever what do you mean 
 
 i mean a reporter asked me questions and i answered them said harry here 
 
 and he threw the copy of the quibbler to her she caught it and stared down at the cover her pale doughy face turned an ugly patchy violet 
 
 when did you do this she asked her voice trembling slightly 
 
 last hogsmeade weekend said harry 
 
 she looked up at him incandescent with rage the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers 
 
 there will be no more hogsmeade trips for you mr potter she whispered how you dare how you could she took a deep breath i have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies the message apparently has still not sunk in fifty points from gryffindor and another worth of detentions 
 
 she stalked away clutching the quibbler to her chest the eyes of many students following her 
 
 by enormous signs had been put up all over the school not just on house noticeboards but in the corridors and classrooms too 
 
 by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts 
 
 
 
 any student found in possession of the magazine 
 
 the quibblerwill be expelled 
 
 
 
 the above is in accordance with educational decree number 
 
 
 
 signed dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor 
 
 for some reason every time hermione caught sight of one of these signs she beamed with pleasure 
 
 what exactly are you so happy about harry asked her 
 
 oh harry you see hermione breathed if she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview it was banning it 
 
 and it seemed that hermione was quite right by the end of the day though harry had not seen so much as a corner of the quibbler anywhere in the school the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview to each other harry heard them whispering about it as they queued up outside classes discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons while hermione even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before ancient runes 
 
 then they spotted me and obviously they know i know you so they bombarded me with questions hermione told harry her eyes shining and harry i think they believe you i really do i think finally got them convinced 
 
 meanwhile professor umbridge was stalking the school stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets harry knew she was looking for copies of the quibbler but the students were several steps ahead of her the pages carrying interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from textbooks if anyone but themselves read it or else wiped magically blank until they wanted to peruse it again soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it 
 
 the teachers were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by educational decree number but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same professor sprout awarded gryffindor twenty points when harry passed her a watering can a beaming professor flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on him at the end of charms said shh and hurried away and professor trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during divination and announced to the startled class and a very disapproving umbridge that harry was not going to suffer an early death after all but would live to a ripe old age become minister for magic and have twelve children 
 
 but what made harry happiest was cho catching up with him as he was hurrying along to transfiguration the next day before he knew what had happened her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear really really sorry that interview was so brave it made me cry 
 
 he was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it but very glad they were on speaking terms again and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again and unbelievably no sooner had he arrived outside transfiguration than something just as good happened seamus stepped out of the queue to face him 
 
 i just wanted to say he mumbled squinting at left knee i believe you and sent a copy of that magazine to me mam 
 
 if anything more was needed to complete happiness it was the reaction he got from malfoy crabbe and goyle he saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library they were with a boy hermione whispered was called theodore nott they looked round at harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he needed on partial vanishment goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to crabbe harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this he had named all of their fathers as death eaters 
 
 and the best bit whispered hermione gleefully as they left the library is they contradict you because they admit read the article 
 
 to cap it all luna told him over dinner that no issue of the quibbler had ever sold out faster 
 
 reprinting she told harry her eyes popping excitedly he believe it he says people seem even more interested in this than the snorkacks 
 
 harry was a hero in the gryffindor common room that night daringly fred and george had put an enlargement charm on the front cover of the quibbler and hung it on the wall so that giant head gazed down upon the proceedings occasionally saying things like the ministry are morons and eat dung umbridge in a booming voice hermione did not find this very amusing she said it interfered with her concentration and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two especially when the talking spell had started to wear off so that it merely shouted disconnected words like dung and umbridge at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice in fact it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again to disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around him asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time he announced that he too needed an early night 
 
 the dormitory was empty when he reached it he rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed it felt soothing against his scar then he undressed and got into bed wishing his headache would go away he also felt slightly sick he rolled over on to his side closed his eyes and fell asleep almost at once 
 
 he was standing in a dark curtained room lit by a single branch of candles his hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him they were and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large pale spiders agairst the dark velvet of the chair 
 
 beyond the chair in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles knelt a man in black robes 
 
 i have been badly advised it seems said harry in a high cold voice that pulsed with anger 
 
 master i crave your pardon croaked the man kneeling on the floor the back of his head glimmered in the candlelight he seemed to be trembling 
 
 i do not blame you rookwood said harry in that cold cruel voice 
 
 he relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it closer to the man cowering on the floor until he stood directly over him in the darkness looking down from a far greater height than usual 
 
 you are sure of your facts rookwood asked harry 
 
 yes my lord yes i used to work in the department aftetafter all 
 
 avery told me bode would be able to remove it 
 
 bode could never have taken it master bode would have known he could not undoubtedly that is why he fought so hard against imperius curse 
 
 stand up rookwood whispered harry 
 
 the kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey his face was pockmarked the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight he remained a little stooped when standing as though halfway through a bow and he darted terrified looks up at face 
 
 you have done well to tell me this said harry very well i have wasted months on fruitless schemes it seems but no matter we begin again from now you have lord gratitude rookwood 
 
 my lord yes my lord gasped rookwood his voice hoarse with relief 
 
 i shall need your help i shall need all the information you can give me 
 
 of course my lord of course anything 
 
 very well you may go send avery to me 
 
 rookwood scurried backwards bowing and disappeared through a door 
 
 left alone in the dark room harry turned towards the wall a cracked mirror hung on the wall in the shadows harry moved towards it his reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness a face whiter than a skull red eyes with slits for pupils 
 
 nooooooooo 
 
 what yelled a voice nearby 
 
 harry hailed around madly became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his bed for a few seconds he did not know where he was he was convinced he was about to see the white lace looming at him out of the dark again then very near to him voice spoke 
 
 will you stop acting like a maniac so i can get you out of here 
 
 ron wrenched the hangings apart and harry stared up at him in the moonlight flat on his back his scar searing with pain ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed one arm was out of his robes 
 
 has someone been attacked again asked ron pulling harry roughly to his feet is it dad is it that snake 
 
 fine gasped harry whose forehead felt as though it were on fire well avery in trouble he gave him the wrong information really angry 
 
 harry groaned and sank shaking on to his bed rubbing his scar 
 
 but going to help him now on the right track again 
 
 what are you talking about said ron sounding scared mean did you just see 
 
 i was said harry and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face to check that they were no longer deathly white and he was with rookwood one of the death eaters who escaped from azkaban remember just told him bode have done it 
 
 done what 
 
 remove something he said bode would have known he have done it bode was under the imperius curse i think he said dad put it on him 
 
 bode was bewitched to remove something ron said butharry got to be 
 
 the weapon harry finished the sentence for him i know 
 
 the dormitory door opened dean and seamus came in harry swung his legs back into bed he did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened seeing as seamus had only just stopped thinking harry was a nutter 
 
 did you say murmured ron putting his head close to on the pretence of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table that you were 
 
 yeah said harry quietly 
 
 ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water harry saw it spill over his chin on to his chest 
 
 harry he said as dean and seamus clattered around noisily pulling off their robes and talking got to tell 
 
 i got to tell anyone said harry shortly i have seen it at all if i could do occlumency supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out what they want 
 
 by they he meant dumbledore he got back into bed and rolled over on to his side with his back to ron and after a while he heard mattress creak as he too lay back down scar began to burn he bit hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise somewhere he knew avery was being punished 
 
 harry and ron waited until break next morning to tell hermione exactly what had happened they wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember when he had finished she said nothing at all for a few moments but stared with a kind of painful intensity at fred and george who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard 
 
 so why they killed him she said quietly withdrawing her gaze from fred and george at last when bode tried to steal this weapon something funny happened to him i think there must be defensive spells on it or around it to stop people touching it why he was in st mungos his brain had gone all funny and he talk but remember what the healer told us he was recovering and they risk him getting better could they i mean the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the imperius curse lift once got his voice back explain what been doing he they would have known been sent to steal the weapon of course it would have been easy for lucius malfoy to put the curse on him never out of the ministry is he 
 
 he was even hanging around that day i had my hearing said harry in thehang on he said slowly he was in the department of mysteries corridor that day your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing but what if 
 
 sturgis gasped hermione looking thunderstruck 
 
 sorry said ron looking bewildered 
 
 sturgis podmore said hermione breathlessly arrested for trying to get through a door lucius malfoy must have got him too i bet he did it the day you saw him there harry sturgis had invisibility cloak right so what if he was standing guard by the door invisible and malfoy heard him moveor guessed someone was thereor just did the imperius curse on the be a guard there so when sturgis next had an opportunityprobably when it was his turn on guard duty againhe tried to get into the department to steal the weapon for voldemortron be quietbut he got caught and sent to azkaban 
 
 she gazed at harry 
 
 and now told voldemort how to get the weapon 
 
 i hear all the conversation but what it sounded like said harry rookwood used to work there maybe send rookwood to do it 
 
 hermione nodded apparently still lost in thought then quite abruptly she said but you have seen this at all harry 
 
 what he said taken aback 
 
 supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing said hermione suddenly stern 
 
 i know i am said harry but 
 
 well i think we should just try and forget what you saw said hermione firmly and you ought to put in a bit more effort on your occlumency from now on 
 
 harry was so angry with her he did not talk to her for the rest of the day which proved to be another bad one when people were not discussing the escaped death eaters in the corridors they were laughing at abysmal performance in their match against hufflepuff the slytherins were singing weasley is our king so loudly and frequently that by sundown filch had banned it from the corridors out of sheer irritation 
 
 the week did not improve as it progressed harry received two more ds in potions he was still on tenterhooks that hagrid might get the sack and he stop himself dwelling on the dream in which he had been voldemortthough he bring it up with ron and hermione again he want another from hermione he wished very much that he could have talked to sirius about it but that was out of the question so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind 
 
 unfortunately the back of his mind was no longer the secure place it had once been 
 
 get up potter 
 
 a couple of weeks after his dream of rookwood harry was to be found yet again kneeling on the floor of office trying to clear his head he had just been forced yet again to relive a stream of very early memories he had not even realised he still had most of them concerning humiliations dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school 
 
 that last memory said snape what was it 
 
 i know said harry getting wearily to his feet he was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that snape kept calling forth you mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet 
 
 no said snape softly i mean the one with a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room 
 
 nothing said harry 
 
 dark eyes bored into remembering what snape had said about eye contact being crucial to legilimency harry blinked and looked away 
 
 how do that man and that room come to be inside your head potter said snape 
 
 it said harry looking everywhere but at snape it wasjust a dream i had 
 
 a dream repeated snape 
 
 there was a pause during which harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a jar of purple liquid 
 
 you do know why we are here you potter said snape in a low dangerous voice you do know why i am giving up my evenings to this tedious job 
 
 yes said harry stiffly 
 
 remind me why we are here potter 
 
 so i can learn occlumency said harry now glaring at a dead eel 
 
 correct potter and dim though you may be harry looked back at snape hating him i would have thought that after over two months of lessons you might have made some progress how many other dreams about the dark lord have you had 
 
 just that one lied harry 
 
 perhaps said snape his dark cold eyes narrowing slightly perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams potter maybe they make you feel special important 
 
 no they said harry his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand 
 
 that is just as well potter said snape coldly because you are neither special nor important and it is not up to you to find out what the dark lord is saying to his death eaters 
 
 your job it harry shot at him 
 
 he had not meant to say it it had burst out of him in temper for a long moment they stared at each other harry convinced he had gone too far but there was a curious almost satisfied expression on face when he answered 
 
 yes potter he said his eyes glinting that is my job now if you are ready we will start again 
 
 he raised his wand onetwothreelegilimens 
 
 a hundred dementors were swooping towards harry across the lake in the grounds he screwed up his face in concentration they were coming closer he could see the dark holes beneath their hoods yet he could also see snape standing in front of him his eyes fixed on face muttering under his breath and somehow snape was growing clearer and the dementors were growing fainter 
 
 harry raised his own wand 
 
 protego 
 
 snape staggered his wand flew upwards away from harryand suddenly mind was teeming with memories that were not his a man was shouting at a cowering woman while a small boy cried in a corner a teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom pointing his wand at the ceiling shooting down flies a girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick 
 
 enough 
 
 harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest he staggered several steps backwards hit some of the shelves covering walls and heard something crack snape was shaking slightly and was very white in the face 
 
 the back of robes was damp one of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion 
 
 reparo hissed snape and the jar sealed itself at once well potter that was certainly an improvement panting slightly snape straightened the pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thoughts before starting the lesson almost as though he was checking they were still there i remember telling you to use a shield charm but there is no doubt that it was effective 
 
 harry did not speak he felt that to say anything might be dangerous he was sure he had just broken into memories that he had just seen scenes from childhood it was unnerving to think that the little boy who had been crying as he watched his parents shouting was actually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes 
 
 try again shall we said snape 
 
 harry felt a thrill of dread he was about to pay for what had just happened he was sure of it they moved back into position with the desk between them harry feeling he was going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time 
 
 on the count of three then said snape raising his wand once more onetwo 
 
 harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind before snape cried legilimens 
 
 he was hurtling along the corridor towards the department of masteries past the blank stone walls past the torchesthe plain black door was growing ever larger he was moving so fast he was going to collide with it he was feet from it and again he could see that chink of faint blue light 
 
 the door had flown open he was through it at last inside a circular room lit with candles and there were more doors all around himhe needed to go onbut which door ought he to take 
 
 p otter 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was flat on his back again with no memory of having got there he was also panting as though his really had run the length of the department of mysteries corridor really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room 
 
 explain yourself said snape who was standing over him looking furious 
 
 i dunno what happened said harry truthfully standing up there was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish never seen that before i mean i told you dreamed about the door but never opened before 
 
 you are not working hard enough 
 
 for some reason snape seemed even angrier than he had done two minutes before when harry had seen into his memories 
 
 you are lazy and sloppy potter it is small wonder that the dark lord 
 
 can you tell me something sir said harry firing up again why do you call voldemort the dark lord only ever heard death eaters call him that 
 
 snape opened his mouth in a snarland a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room 
 
 head jerked upwards he was gazing at the ceiling 
 
 what the he muttered 
 
 harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he thought might be the entrance hall snape looked round at him frowning 
 
 did you see anything unusual on your way down here potter 
 
 harry shook his head somewhere above them the woman screamed again snape strode to his office door his wand still held at the ready and swept out of sight harry hesitated for a moment then followed 
 
 the screams were indeed coming from the entrance hall they grew louder as harry ran towards the stone steps leading up from the dungeons when he reached the top he found the entrance hall packed students had come flooding out of the great hall where dinner was still in progress to see what was going on others had crammed themselves on to the marble staircase harry pushed forwards through a knot of tall slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring some of them looking shocked others even frightened professor mcgonagall was directly opposite harry en the other side of the hall she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly sick 
 
 professor trelawney was standing in the middle of the entrance hall with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other looking utterly mad her hair was sticking up on end her glasses were lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other her innumerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her shoulders giving the impression that she was falling apart at the seams two large trunks lay on the floor beside her one of them it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her professor trelawney was staring apparently terrified at something harry could not see but which seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs 
 
 no she shrieked no this cannot be happening it cannot i retuse to accept it 
 
 you realise this was coming said a high girlish voice sounding callously amused and harry moving slightly to his right saw that terrifying vision was nothing other than professor umbridge incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrows weather you must surely have realised that your pitiful performance during my inspections and lack of any improvement would make it inevitable that you would be sacked 
 
 you howled professor trelawney tears streaming down her face from behind her enormous lenses you sack me bbeen here sixteen years h hogwarts is mmy hhome 
 
 it was your home said professor umbridge and harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched professor trelawney sink sobbing uncontrollably on to one of her trunks until an hour ago when the minister for magic countersigned your order of dismissal now kindly remove yourself from this hall you are embarrassing us 
 
 but she stood and watched with an expression of gloating enjoyment as professor trelawney shuddered and moaned rocking backwards and forwards on her trunk in paroxysms of grief harry heard a muffled sob to his left and looked around lavender and parvati were both crying quietly their arms round each other then he heard footsteps professor mcgonagall had broken away from the spectators marched straight up to professor trelawney and was patting her firmly on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robes 
 
 there there sybill calm down blow your nose on this not as bad as you think now you are not going to have to leave hogwarts 
 
 oh really professor mcgonagall said umbridge in a deadly voice taking a few steps forward and your authority for that statement is 
 
 that would be mine said a deep voice 
 
 the oaken front doors had swung open students beside them scuttled out of the way as dumbledore appeared in the entrance what he had been doing out in the grounds harry could not imagine but there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night leaving the doors wide open behind him he strode forwards through the circle of onlookers towards professor trelawney and trembling on her trunk professor mcgonagall alongside her 
 
 yours professor dumbledore said umbridge with a singularly unpleasant little laugh afraid you do not understand the position i have here she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robes an order of dismissal signed by myself and the minister for magic under the terms of educational decree number the high inquisitor of hogwarts has the power to inspect place upon probation and sack any teacher shethat is to say ifeel is not performing to the standards required by the ministry of magic i have decided that professor trelawney is not up to scratch i have dismissed her 
 
 to very great surprise dumbledore continued to smile he looked down at professor trelawney who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk and said you are quite right of course professor umbridge as high inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers you do not however have the authority to send them away from the castle i am afraid he went on with a courteous little bow that the power to do that still resides with the headmaster and it is my wish that professor trelawney continue to live at hogwarts 
 
 at this professor trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccough was barely hidden 
 
 nono g go dumbledore i shshallleave hogwarts and sseek my fortune elsewhere 
 
 no said dumbledore sharply it is my wish that you remain sybill 
 
 he turned to professor mcgonagall 
 
 might i ask you to escort sybill back upstairs professor mcgonagall 
 
 of course said mcgonagall up you get sybill 
 
 professor sprout came hurrying forwards out of the crowd and grabbed professor other arm together they guided her past umbridge and up the marble stairs professor flitwick went scurrying after them his wand held out before him he squeaked locomotor trunks and professor luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her professor flitwick bringing up the rear 
 
 professor umbridge was standing stock still staring at dumbledore who continued to smile benignly 
 
 and what she said in a whisper that carried all around the eintrance hall are you going to do with her once i appoint a new divination teacher who needs her lodgings 
 
 oh that be a problem said dumbledore pleasantly you see i have already found us a new divination teacher and he will prefer lodgings on the ground floor 
 
 found said umbridge shrilly found might i remind you dumbledore that under educational decree number 
 
 the ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate ifand only ifthe headmaster is unable to find one said dumbledore and i am happy to say that on this occasion i have succeeded may i introduce you 
 
 he turned to face the open front doors through which night mist was now drifting harry heard hooves there was a shocked murmur around the hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even further backwards some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer 
 
 through the mist came a face harry had seen once before on a dark dangerous night in the forbidden forest hair and astonishingly blue eyes the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse 
 
 this is firenze said dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck umbridge i think find him suitable 
 
 rowling
