 he who must not be named returns 
 in a brief statement on friday night minister for magic cornelius fudge confirmed that has returned to this country and is once more active 
 
 it is with great regret that i must confirm that the wizard styling himself lordwell you know who i meanis alive and among us again said fudge looking tired and flustered as he addressed reporters it is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of azkaban who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the employ we believe the dementors are currently taking direction from lord thingy 
 
 we urge the magician population to remain vigilant the ministry is currently publishing guides to elementary home and personal defence which will be delivered free to all wizarding homes within the coming month 
 
 the statement was met with dismay and alarm from the wizarding community which as recently as last wednesday was receiving ministry assurances that there was no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumours that is operating amongst us once more 
 
 details of the events that led to the ministry turnaround are still hazy though it is believed that he who must not be named and a select band of followers known as death eaters gained entry to the ministry of magic itself on thursday evening 
 
 albus dumbledore newly reinstated headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry reinstated member of the international confederation of wizards and reinstated chief warlock of the wizengamot has so far been unavailable for comment he has insisted over the past year that is not dead as was widely hoped and believed but is recruiting followers once more for afresh attempt to seize power meanwhile the boy who lived 
 
 there you are harry i knew drag you into it somehow said hermione looking over the top of the paper at him 
 
 they were in the hospital wing harry was sitting on the end of bed and they were both listening to hermione read the front page of the sunday whose ankle had been mended in a trice by madam pomfrey was curled up at the foot of bed neville whose nose had likewise been returned to its normal size and shape was in a chair between the two beds and luna who had dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of the quibbler was reading the magazine and apparently not taking in a word hermione was saying 
 
 the boy who lived again now though he said ron darkly not such a deluded any more eh 
 
 he helped himself to a handful of chocolate frogs from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet threw a few to harry ginny and neville and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth there were still deep welts on his forearms where the tentacles had wrapped around him according to madam pomfrey thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else though since she had started applying copious amounts of dr oblivious unction there seemed to have been some improvement 
 
 yes very complimentary about you now harry said hermione scanning down the article a lone voice of truth perceived as unbalanced yet never wavered in his story forced to bear ridicule and slander hmmm she said frowning i notice they mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering in the prophet 
 
 she winced slightly and put a hand to her ribs the curse dolohov had used on her though less effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud had nevertheless caused in madam words quite enough damage to be going on with hermione was having to take ten different types of potion every day was improving greatly and was already bored with the hospital wing 
 
 last attempt to take over pages two to jour what the ministry should have told us page five why nobody listened to albus dumbledore pages six to eight exclusive interview with harry potter page nine well said hermione folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside certainly given them lots to write about and that interview with harry exclusive the one that was in the quibbler months ago 
 
 daddy sold it to them said luna vaguely turning a page of the got a very good price for it too so going to go on an expedition to sweden this summer to see if we can catch a snorkack 
 
 hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment then said that sounds lovely 
 
 ginny caught eye and looked away quickly grinning 
 
 so anyway said hermione sitting up a little straighter and wincing again going on in school 
 
 well got rid of fred and swamp said ginny he did it in about three seconds but he left a tiny patch under the window and roped it off 
 
 why said hermione looking startled 
 
 oh he just says it was a really good bit of magic said ginny shrugging 
 
 i think he left it as a monument to fred and george said ron through a mouthful of chocolate they sent me all these you know he told harry pointing at the small mountain of frogs beside him must be doing all right out of that joke shop eh 
 
 hermione looked rather disapproving and asked so has all the trouble stopped now back 
 
 yes said neville settled right back to normal 
 
 i filch is happy is he asked ron propping a chocolate frog card featuring dumbledore against his water jug 
 
 not at all said ginny really really miserable actually she lowered her voice to a whisper he keeps saying umbridge was the best thing that ever happened to hogwarts 
 
 all six of them looked around professor umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them gazing up at the ceiling dumbledore had strode alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs how he had done ithow he had emerged from the trees supporting professor umbridge without so much as a scratch on himnobody knew and umbridge was certainly not telling since she had returned to the castle she had not as far as any of them knew uttered a single word nobody really knew what was wrong with her either her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were still bits of twigs and leaves in it but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed 
 
 madam pomfrey says just in shock whispered hermione 
 
 sulking more like said ginny 
 
 yeah she shows signs of life if you do this said ron and with his tongue he made soft noises umbridge sat bolt upright looking around wildly 
 
 anything wrong professor called madam pomfrey poking her head around her office door 
 
 no no said umbridge sinking back into her pillows no i must have been dreaming 
 
 hermione and ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes 
 
 speaking of centaurs said hermione when she had recovered a little divination teacher now is firenze staying 
 
 got to said harry the other centaurs take him back will they 
 
 it looks like he and trelawney are both going to teach said ginny 
 
 bet dumbledore wishes he got rid of trelawney for good said ron now munching on his fourteenth frog mind you the whole useless if you ask me firenze a lot better 
 
 how can you say that hermione demanded after just found out that there are real prophecies 
 
 heart began to race he had not told ron hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained neville had told them it had smashed while harry was pulling him up the steps in the death room and harry had not yet corrected this impression he was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim there was no other way 
 
 it is a pity it broke said hermione quietly shaking her head 
 
 yeah it is said ron still at least never found out what was in it either where are you going he added looking both surprised and disappointed as harry stood up 
 
 said harry you know he just got back and i promised go down and see him and tell him how you two are 
 
 oh all right then said ron grumpily looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond wish we could come 
 
 say hello to him for us called hermione as harry proceeded down the ward and ask him happening about about his little friend 
 
 harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood as he left the dormitory 
 
 the castle seemed very quiet even for a sunday everybody was clearly out in the sunny grounds enjoying the end of their exams and the prospect of a last few days of term unhampered by revision or homework harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor peering out of windows as he went he could see people messing around in the air over the quidditch pitch and a couple of students swimming in the lake accompanied by the giant squid 
 
 he was finding it hard to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not whenever he was in company he wanted to get away and whenever he was alone he wanted company he thought he might really go and visit hagrid though as he had not talked to him properly since returned 
 
 harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when malfoy crabbe and goyle emerged from a door on the right that harry knew led down to the slytherin common room harry stopped dead so did malfoy and the others the only sounds were the shouts laughter and splashes drifting into the hall from the grounds through the open front doors 
 
 malfoy glanced aroundharry knew he was checking for signs of teachersthen he looked back at harry and said in a low voice dead potter 
 
 harry raised his eyebrows 
 
 funny he said think have stopped walking around 
 
 malfoy looked angrier than harry had ever seen him he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale pointed face contorted with rage 
 
 going to pay said malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper going to make you pay for what done to my father 
 
 well terrified now said harry sarcastically i lord just a act compared to you the matter he added for malfoy crabbe and goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name a mate of your dad he not scared of him are you 
 
 you think such a big man potter said malfoy advancing now crabbe and goyle flanking him you wait have you you land my father in prison 
 
 i thought i just had said harry 
 
 the dementors have left azkaban said malfoy quietly dad and the be out in no time 
 
 yeah i expect they will said harry still at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now 
 
 hand flew towards his wand but harry was too quick for him he had drawn his own wand before fingers had even entered the pocket of his robes 
 
 potter 
 
 the voice rang across the entrance hall snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt towards malfoy whatever dumbledore said he would never forgive snape never 
 
 what are you doing potter said snape as coldly as ever as he strode over to the four of them 
 
 trying to decide what curse to use on malfoy sir said harry fiercely 
 
 snape stared at him 
 
 put that wand away at once he said curtly ten points from gryff 
 
 snape looked towards the giant on the walls and gave a sneering smile 
 
 ah i see there are no longer any points left in the gryffindor to take away in that case potter we will simply have to 
 
 add some more 
 
 professor mcgonagall had just stumped up the stone steps into the castle she was carrying a tartan carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other but otherwise looked quite well 
 
 professor mcgonagall said snape striding forwards out of st i see 
 
 yes professor snape said professor mcgonagall shrugging off her travelling cloak quite as good as new you twocrabbegoyle 
 
 she beckoned them forwards imperiously and they came shuffling their large feet and looking awkward 
 
 here said professor mcgonagall thrusting her carpetbag into chest and her cloak into take these up to my office for me 
 
 they turned and stumped away up the marble staircase 
 
 right then said professor mcgonagall looking up at the hourglasses on the wall well i think potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of what say you professor snape 
 
 what snapped snape though harry knew he had heard perfectly well ohwelli suppose 
 
 so fifty each for potter the two weasleys longbottom and miss granger said professor mcgonagall and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of gryffindor s as she spoke ohand fifty for miss lovegood i suppose she added and a number of sapphires fell into glass now you wanted to take ten from mr potter i think professor snapeso there we are 
 
 a few rubies retreated into the upper bulb leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless 
 
 well potter malfoy i think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this professor mcgonagall continued briskly 
 
 harry did not need telling twice he thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at snape and malfoy 
 
 the hot sun hit him with a blast as he walked across the lawns towards cabin students lying around on the grass sunbathing talking reading the sunday prophet and eating sweets looked up at him as he passed some called out to him or else waved clearly eager to show that they like the prophet had decided he was something of a hero harry said nothing to any of them he had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three days ago but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred to keep it that way 
 
 he thought at first when he knocked on cabin door that he was out but then fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome hagrid it transpired was picking runner beans in his back garden 
 
 all righ harry he said beaming when harry approached the fence come in come in have a cup o dandelion juice 
 
 things hagrid asked him as they settled down at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice yeherfeelin all righ are yeh 
 
 harry knew from the look of concern on face that he was not referring to physical 
 
 fine harry said quickly because he could not bear to discuss the thing that he knew was in mind so you been 
 
 bin hidin out in the mountains said hagrid up in a cave like sirius did when he 
 
 hagrid broke off cleared his throat gruffly looked at harry and took a long draught of juice 
 
 anyway back now he said feebly 
 
 youyou look better said harry who was determined to keep the conversation moving away from sirius 
 
 wha said hagrid raising a massive hand and feeling his face ohoh yeah well loads better behaved now loads seemed right pleased ter see me when i got back ter tell yeh the truth a good lad really ive bin thinkin abou tryin ter find him a lady friend actually 
 
 harry would normally have tried to persuade hagrid out of this idea at once the prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the forest possibly even wilder and more brutal than grawp was positively alarming but somehow harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point he was starting to wish he was alone again and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulps of his dandelion juice his glass 
 
 knows bin tellin the truth now harry said hagrid softly and unexpectedly he was watching harry closely gotta be better hasn it 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 look hagrid leaned towards him across the table i knew sirius longer n yeh did he died in battle an the way wanted ter go 
 
 he want to go at all said harry angrily 
 
 hagrid bowed his great shaggy head 
 
 nah i don reckon he did he said quietly but still harry he was never one ter sit aroun at home an let other people do the fightin he lived with himself if he hadn gone ter help 
 
 harry leapt up 
 
 got to go and visit ron and hermione in the hospital wing he said mechanically 
 
 oh said hagrid looking rather upset oh all righ then harry take care o yerself then an drop back in if got a mo 
 
 yeah right 
 
 harry crossed to the door as fast as he could and pulled it open he was out in the sunshine again before hagrid had finished saying goodbye and walking away across the lawn once again people called out to him as he passed he closed his eyes for a few moments wishing they would all vanish that he could open his eyes and find himself alone in the grounds 
 
 a few days ago before his exams had finished and he had seen the vision voldemort had planted in his mind he would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know he had been telling the truth for them to believe that voldemort was back and to know that he was neither a liar nor mad now however 
 
 he walked a short way around the lake sat down on its bank sheltered from the gaze of behind a tangle of shrubs and stared out over the gleaming water thinking 
 
 perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with dumbledore an invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world he washe had always beena marked man it was just that he had never really understood what that meant 
 
 and yet sitting here on the edge of the lake with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him with the loss of sirius so raw and fresh inside he could not muster any great sense of fear it was sunny and the grounds around him were full of laughing people and even though he felt as distant from them as though he belonged to a different race it was still very hard to believe as he sat here that his life must include or end in murder 
 
 he sat there for a long time gazing out at the water trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it was directly across from here on the opposite bank that sirius had once collapsed trying to fend off a hundred dementors 
 
 the sun had set before he realised he was cold he got up and returned to the castle wiping his face on his sleeve as he went 
 
 ron and hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three days before the end of term hermione kept showing signs of wanting to talk about sirius but ron tended to make hushing noises every time she mentioned his name harry was still not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet his wishes varied with his mood he knew one thing though unhappy as he felt at the moment he would greatly miss hogwarts in a few days time when he was back at number four privet drive even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer he did not feel any better about it indeed he had never dreaded his return more 
 
 professor umbridge left hogwarts the day before the end of term it seemed she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime evidently hoping to depart undetected but unfortunately for her she met peeves on the way who seized his last chance to do as fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premises whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running away down the path and the heads of houses tried only to restrain them indeed professor mcgonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after umbridge herself because peeves had borrowed her walking stick 
 
 their last evening at school arrived most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the leaving feast but harry had not even started 
 
 just do it tomorrow said ron who was waiting by the door of their dormitory come on starving 
 
 i be long look you go ahead 
 
 but when the dormitory door closed behind ron harry made no effort to speed up his packing the very last thing he wanted to do was to attend the leaving feast he was worried that dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech he was sure to mention return he had talked to them about it last year after all 
 
 harry pulled some crumpled robes out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded ones and as he did so noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it he could not think what it was doing there he bent down pulled it out from underneath his trainers and examined it 
 
 he realised what it was within seconds sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of number twelve grimmauld place use it if you need me all right 
 
 harry sank down on to his bed and unwrapped the package out fell a small square mirror it looked old it was certainly dirty harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him 
 
 he turned the mirror over there on the reverse side was a scribbled note from sirius 
 
 this is a mirror got the other one of the pair if you need to speak to me just say my name into it appear in my mirror and be able to talk in yours james and i used to use them when we were in separate detentions 
 
 heart began to race he remembered seeing his dead parents in the mirror of erised four years ago he was going to be able to talk to sirius again right now he knew it 
 
 he looked around to make sure there was nobody else there the dormitory was quite empty he looked back at the mirror raised it in front of his face with trembling hands and said loudly and clearly sirius 
 
 his breath misted the surface of the glass he held the mirror even closer excitement flooding through him but the eyes blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own 
 
 he wiped the mirror clear again and said so that every syllable rang clearly through the room 
 
 sirius black 
 
 nothing happened the frustrated face looking back out of the mirror was still definitely his own 
 
 sirius have his mirror on him when he went through the archway said a small voice in head why not working 
 
 harry remained quite still for a moment then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered he had been convinced for a whole shining minute that he was going to see sirius talk to him again 
 
 disappointment was burning in his throat he got up and began throwing his things into the trunk on top of the broken mirror 
 
 but then an idea struck him a better idea than a mirror a much bigger more important idea how had he never thought of it beforewhy had he never asked 
 
 he was sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase hitting the walls as he ran and barely noticing he hurtled across the empty common room through the portrait hole and off along the corridor ignoring the fat lady who called after him the feast is about to start you know cutting it very fine 
 
 but harry had no intention of going to the feast 
 
 how could it be that the place was full of ghosts whenever you need one yet now 
 
 he ran down staircases and along corridors and met nobody either alive or dead they were all clearly in the great hall outside his charms classroom he came to a halt panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later until after the end of the feast 
 
 but just as he had given up hope he saw ita translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor 
 
 heyhey nick nick 
 
 the ghost stuck its head back out of the wall revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of sir nicholas de 
 
 good evening he said withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at harry i am not the only one who is late then though he sighed in a rather different sense of course 
 
 nick can i ask you something 
 
 a most peculiar expression stole over nearly headless face as he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter apparently to give himself thinking time he desisted only when his partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely 
 
 ernow harry said nick looking discomfited it wait until after the feast 
 
 nonick please said harry i really need to talk to you can we go in here 
 
 harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and nearly headless nick sighed 
 
 oh very well he said looking resigned i pretend i been expecting it 
 
 harry was holding the door open for him but he drifted through the wall instead 
 
 expecting what harry asked as he closed the door 
 
 you to come and find me said nick now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening grounds it happens sometimes when somebody has suffered a loss 
 
 well said harry refusing to be deflected you were right come to find you 
 
 nick said nothing 
 
 said harry who was finding this more awkward than he had anticipated just dead but still here you 
 
 nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the grounds 
 
 right it harry urged him you died but talking to you you can walk around hogwarts and everything you 
 
 yes said nearly headless nick quietly i walk and talk yes 
 
 so you came back you said harry urgently people can come back right as ghosts they have to disappear completely well he added impatiently when nick continued to say nothing 
 
 nearly headless nick hesitated then said not everyone can come back as a ghost 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 only only wizards 
 
 oh said harry and he almost laughed with relief well ok then the person asking about is a wizard so he can come back right 
 
 nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at harry 
 
 he come back 
 
 who 
 
 sirius black said nick 
 
 but you did said harry angrily you came dead and you disappear 
 
 wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth to walk palely where their living selves once trod said nick miserably but very few wizards choose that path 
 
 why not said harry anywayit mattersirius care if unusual come back i know he will 
 
 and so strong was his belief harry actually turned his head to check the door sure for a split second that he was going to see sirius and transparent but beaming walking through it towards him 
 
 he will not come back repeated nick he will have gone on 
 
 what mean gone on said harry quickly gone on where listenwhat happens when you die anyway where do you go why everyone come back why this place full of ghosts why 
 
 i cannot answer said nick 
 
 dead you said harry exasperatedly who can answer better than you 
 
 i was afraid of death said nick softly i chose to remain behind i sometimes wonder whether i to have well that is neither here nor there in fact i am neither here nor there he gave a small sad chuckle i know nothing of the secrets of death harry for i chose my feeble imitation of life instead i believe learned wizards study the matter in the department of mysteries 
 
 talk to me about that place said harry fiercely 
 
 i am sorry not to have been more help said nick gently well well do excuse me the feast you know 
 
 and he left the room leaving harry there alone gazing blankly at the wall through which nick had disappeared 
 
 harry felt almost as though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more he walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again 
 
 he had turned the corner towards the fat corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall a second glance showed him it was luna there were no good hiding places nearby she was bound to have heard his footsteps and in any case harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment 
 
 hello said luna vaguely glancing around at him as she stepped back from the notice 
 
 how come not at the feast harry asked 
 
 well lost most of my possessions said luna serenely people take them and hide them you know but as the last night i really do need them back so been putting up signs 
 
 she gestured towards the noticeboard upon which sure enough she had pinned a list of all her missing books and clothes with a plea for their return 
 
 an odd feeling rose in harry an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since death it was a few moments before he realised that he was feeling sorry for luna 
 
 how come people hide your stuff he asked her frowning 
 
 oh well she shrugged i think they think a bit odd you know some people call me loony lovegood actually 
 
 harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully 
 
 no reason for them to take your things he said flatly want help finding them 
 
 oh no she said smiling at him come back they always do in the end it was just that i wanted to pack tonight anyway why you at the feast 
 
 harry shrugged just feel like it 
 
 no said luna observing him with those oddly misty protuberant eyes i suppose you do that man the death eaters killed was your godfather he ginny told me 
 
 harry nodded curtly but found that for some reason he did not mind luna talking about sirius he had just remembered that she too could see thestrals 
 
 have you he began i mean who has anyone you known ever died 
 
 yes said luna simply my mother she was a quite extraordinary witch you know but she did like to experiment and one of her spells went rather badly wrong one day i was nine 
 
 sorry harry mumbled 
 
 yes it was rather horrible said luna conversationally i still feel very sad about it sometimes but still got dad and anyway not as though never see mum again is it 
 
 it said harry uncertainly 
 
 she shook her head in disbelief 
 
 oh come on you heard them just behind the veil you 
 
 you mean 
 
 in that room with the archway they were just lurking out of sight all you heard them 
 
 they looked at each other luna was smiling slightly harry did not know what to say or to think luna believed so many extraordinary things yet he had been sure he had heard voices behind the veil too 
 
 are you sure you want me to help you look for your stuff he said 
 
 oh no said luna no i think just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up it always does in the end well have a nice holiday harry 
 
 yeah yeah you too 
 
 she walked away from him and as he watched her go he found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly 
 
 the journey home on the hogwarts express next day was eventful in several ways firstly malfoy crabbe and goyle who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witnesses attempted to ambush harry halfway down the train as he made his way back from the toilet the attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of da members who saw what was happening through the glass and rose as one to rush to aid by the time ernie macmillan hannah abbott susan bones justin anthony goldstein and terry boot had finished using a wide variety of the hexes and jinxes harry had taught them malfoy crabbe and goyle resembled nothing so much as three gigantic slugs squeezed into hogwarts uniform as harry ernie and justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze 
 
 i must say looking forward to seeing face when he gets off the train said ernie with some satisfaction as he watched malfoy squirm above him ernie had never quite got over the indignity of malfoy docking points from hufflepuff during his brief spell as a member of the inquisitorial squad 
 
 be really pleased though said ron who had come to investigate the source of the commotion loads now anyway harry the food just stopped if you want anything 
 
 harry thanked the others and accompanied ron back to their compartment where he bought a large pile of cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties hermione was reading the daily prophet again ginny was doing a quiz in the quibbler and neville was stroking his mimbulus mimbletonia which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noises when touched 
 
 harry and ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while hermione read out snippets from the was now full of articles about how to repel dementors attempts by the ministry to track down death eaters and hysterical letters claiming that the writer had seen lord voldemort walking past their house that very morning 
 
 it really started yet sighed hermione gloomily folding up the newspaper again but it be long now 
 
 hey harry said ron softly nodding towards the glass window on to the corridor 
 
 harry looked around cho was passing accompanied by marietta edgecombe who was wearing a balaclava his and eyes met for a moment cho blushed and kept walking harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by knight 
 
 going on with you and her anyway ron asked quietly 
 
 nothing said harry truthfully 
 
 ierheard going out with someone else now said hermione tentatively 
 
 harry was surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all wanting to impress cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him so much of what he had wanted before death felt that way these days the week that had elapsed since he had last seen sirius seemed to have lasted much much longer it stretched across two universes the one with sirius in it and the one without 
 
 well out of it mate said ron forcefully i mean quite and all that but you want someone a bit more cheerful 
 
 probably cheerful enough with someone else said harry shrugging 
 
 she with now anyway ron asked hermione but it was ginny who answered 
 
 michael corner she said 
 
 michaelbut said ron craning around in his seat to state at her but you were going out with him 
 
 not any more said ginny resolutely he like gryffindor beating ravenclaw at quidditch and got really sulky so i ditched him and he ran off to comfort cho instead she scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill turned the quibbler and began marking her answers ron looked highly delighted 
 
 well i always thought he was a bit of an idiot he said prodding his queen forwards towards quivering castle good for you just choose someonebetternext time 
 
 he cast harry an oddly furtive look as he said it 
 
 well chosen dean thomas would you say better asked ginny vaguely 
 
 what shouted ron upending the chessboard crookshanks went plunging after the pieces and hedwig and pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead 
 
 as the train slowed down in the approach to cross harry thought he had never wanted to leave it less he even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of september when it would take him back to hogwarts when it finally puffed to a standstill however he lifted down cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train as usual 
 
 when the ticket inspector signalled to harry ron and hermione that it was safe to walk through the magical barrier between platforms nine and ten however he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side a group of people standing there to greet him who he had not expected at all 
 
 there was moody looking quite as sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye as he would have done without it his gnarled hands clutching a long staff his body wrapped in a voluminous travelling cloak tonks stood just behind him her bright hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass of the station ceiling wearing heavily patched jeans and a bright purple bearing the legend the weird to tonks was lupin his face pale his hair greying a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trousers at the front of the group stood mr and mrs weasley dressed in their muggle best and fred and george who were both wearing jackets in some lurid green scaly material 
 
 ron ginny called mrs weasley hurrying forwards and hugging her children tightly oh and harry dearhow are you 
 
 fine lied harry as she pulled him into a tight embrace over her shoulder he saw ron goggling at the twins new clothes 
 
 what are they supposed to be he asked pointing at the jackets 
 
 finest dragonskin little bro said fred giving his zip a little tweak business is booming and we thought treat ourselves 
 
 hello harry said lupin as mrs weasley let go of harry and turned to greet hermione 
 
 hi said harry i expect what are you all doing here 
 
 well said lupin with a slight smile we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home 
 
 i dunno if a good idea said harry at once 
 
 oh i think it is growled moody who had limped a little closer be them will it potter 
 
 he pointed with his thumb over his shoulder his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where was pointing and there sure enough were the three dursleys who looked positively appalled to see reception committee 
 
 ah harry said mr weasley turning from parents who he had just greeted enthusiastically and who were now taking it in turns to hug hermione well shall we do it then 
 
 yeah i reckon so arthur said moody 
 
 he and mr weasley took the lead across the station towards the dursleys who were apparently rooted to the floor hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group 
 
 good afternoon said mr weasley pleasantly to uncle vernon as he came to a halt right in front of him you might remember me my arthur weasley 
 
 as mr weasley had demolished most of the dursleys living room two years previously harry would have been very surprised if uncle vernon had forgotten him sure enough uncle vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at mr weasley but chose not to say anything partly perhaps because the dursleys were outnumbered two to one aunt petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed she kept glancing around as though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company dudley meanwhile seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant a feat at which he was failing extravagantly 
 
 we thought just have a few words with you about harry said mr weasley still smiling 
 
 yeah growled moody about how treated when at your place 
 
 uncle moustache seemed to bristle with indignation possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he was dealing with a kindred spirit he addressed himself to moody 
 
 i am not aware that it is any of your business what goes on in my house 
 
 i expect what not aware of would fill several books dursley growled moody 
 
 anyway not the point interjected tonks whose pink hair seemed to offend aunt petunia more than all the rest put together for she closed her eyes rather than look at her the point is if we find out been horrible to harry 
 
 and make no mistake hear about it added lupin pleasantly 
 
 yes said mr weasley even if you let harry use the 
 
 telephone whispered hermione 
 
 yeah if we get any hint that been mistreated in any way have us to answer to said moody 
 
 uncle vernon swelled ominously his sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddballs 
 
 are you threatening me sir he said so loudly that actually turned to stare 
 
 yes i am said who seemed rather pleased that uncle vernon had grasped this fact so quickly 
 
 and do i look like the kind of man who can be intimidated barked uncle vernon 
 
 well said moody pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye uncle vernon leapt backwards in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley yes have to say you do dursley 
 
 he turned away from uncle vernon to survey harry 
 
 so potter give us a shout if you need us if we hear from you for three days in a row send someone along 
 
 aunt petunia whimpered piteously it could not have been plainer that she was thinking of what the neighbours would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path 
 
 bye then potter said moody grasping shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand 
 
 take care harry said lupin quietly keep in touch 
 
 harry have you away from there as soon as we can mrs weasley whispered hugging him again 
 
 see you soon mate said ron anxiously shaking hand 
 
 really soon harry said hermione earnestly we promise 
 
 harry nodded he somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him to see them all ranged there on his side instead he smiled raised a hand in farewell turned around and led the way out of the station towards the sunlit street with uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley hurrying along in his wake
