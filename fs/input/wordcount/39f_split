lionfish nov chapter the flaw in the plancontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 he was flying facedown on the ground again the smell of the forest filled his nostrils he could feel the cold hard ground beneath his cheek and the hinge of his glasses which have been knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his temple every inch of him ached and the place where killing curse had hit him felt like the bruise of an punch he did not stir but he remained exactly where he had fallen with his left arm bent out at an awkward angle and his mouth gaping 
 
 he had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death but instead hurried footsteps whispers and solicitous murmurs filled the air 
 
 my lord my lord 
 
 it was bellatrixs voice and she spoke as if to a lover harry did not dare open his eyes but allowed his other senses to explore his predicament he knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground a slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the invisibility cloak was also there stuffed out of sight 
 
 my lord 
 
 that will do said voldemorts voice 
 
 more footsteps several people were backing away from the same spot desperate to see what was happening and why harry opened his eyes by a millimeter 
 
 voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet various death eaters were hurrying away from him returning to the crowd lining the clearing bellatrix alone remained behind kneeling beside voldemort 
 
 harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen the death eaters have been buddled around voldemort who seem to have fallen to the ground something had happened when he had hit harry with the killing curse had voldemort too collapsed it seemed like it and both of them had briefly fallen unconscious and both of them had now returned 
 
 my lord let me c 
 
 i do not require assistance said voldemort coldly and though he could not see it harry pictured bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand the boy is he dead 
 
 there was a complete silence in the clearing nobody approached harry but he felt their concentrated gaze it seemed to press him harder into the ground and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid might twitch 
 
 you said voldemort and there was a bang and a small shriek of pain examine him tell me whether he is dead 
 
 harry did not know who had been sent to verify he could only lie there with his heart thumping traitorously and wait to be examined but at the same time nothing small comfort through it was that voldemort was wary of approaching him that voldemort suspected that all had not gone to plan 
 
 hands softer than he had been expecting touched harrys face and felt his heart he could hear the womans fast breathing her pounding of life against his ribs 
 
 is draco alive is he in the castle 
 
 the whisper was barely audible her lips were an inch from his ear her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers 
 
 yes he breathed back 
 
 he felt the hand on his chest contract her nails pierced him then it was withdrawn she had sat up 
 
 he is dead narcissa malfoy called to the watchers 
 
 and now they shouted now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet and through his eyelids harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration 
 
 still feigning death on the ground he understood narcissa knew that the only way she would be permitted to enter hogwarts and find her son was as part of the conquering army she no longer cared whether voldemort won 
 
 you see screeched voldemort over the tumult harry potter is dead by my hand and no man alive can threaten me now watch crucio 
 
 harry had been expecting it knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied upon the forest floor it must be subjected to humiliation to prove voldemorts victory he was lifted into the air and it took all his determination to remain limp yet the pain he expected did not come he was thrown once twice three times into the air his glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes but he kept himself floppy and lifeless and when he fell to ground for the last time the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of laughter 
 
 now said voldemort we go to the castle and show them what has become of their hero who shall drag the body no c wait c 
 
 there was a fresh outbreak of laughter and after a few moments harry felt the ground trembling beneath him 
 
 you carry him voldemort said he will be nice and visible in your arms will he not pick up your little friend hagrid and the glasses c put on the glasses c he must be recognizable c 
 
 someone slammed harrys glasses back onto his face with deliberate force but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle harry could feel hagrids arms trembling with the force of his heaving sobs great tears splashed down upon him as hagrid cradled harry in his arms and harry did not dare by movement or word to intimate to hagrid that all was not yet lost 
 
 move said voldemort and hagrid stumbled forward forcing his way through the trees back through the forest 
 
 branches caught at harrys hair and robes but he lay quiescent his mouth lolling open his eyes shut and in the darkness while the death eaters coed all around them and while hagrid sobbed blindly nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck of harry potter 
 
 the two giants crashed along behind the death eaters harry could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed they made so much din that birds toes shrieking into the sky and even the jeers of the death eaters were drowned the victorious procession marched on toward the open ground and after a while harry could tell by the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids that the trees were beginning to thin 
 
 bane 
 
 hagrids unexpected bellow nearly forced harrys eyes open happy now are yeh that yeh didnt fight yeh cowardly bunch o nags are yeh happy harry potters c 
 
 hagrid could not continue but broke down in fresh tears harry wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass he dared not open his eyes to look some of the death eaters called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind a little later harry sensed by a freshening of the air that they had reached the edge of the forest 
 
 stop 
 
 harry thought that hagrid must have been forced to obey voldemorts command because he lurched a little and now a chill settled over them where they stood and harry heard the rasping breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees they would not affect him now 
 
 the fact of his own survival burned inside him a talisman against them as though his fathers stag kept guardian in his heart 
 
 someone passed close by harry and he knew that it was voldemort himself because he spoke a moment later his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the ground crashing upon harrys eardrums 
 
 harry potter is dead he was killed as he ran away trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him we bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone 
 
 the battle is won you have lost half of your fighters my death eaters outnumber you and the boy who lived is finished there must be no more war anyone who continues to resist man woman or child will be slaughtered as will every member of their family come out of the castle now kneel before me and you shall be spared your parents and children your brothers and sisters will live and be forgiven and you will join me in the new world we shall build together 
 
 there was silence in the grounds and from the castle voldemort was so close to him that harry did not dare open his eyes again 
 
 come said voldemort and harry heard him move ahead and hagrid was forced to follow now harry opened his eyes a fraction and saw voldemort striding in front them wearing the great snake nagini around his shoulders now free of her enchanted cage but harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the death eaters who marched on the either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness 
 
 harry sobbed hagrid oh harry harry 
 
 harry shut his eyes tight again he knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish above the gleeful voices of the death eaters and their tramping footsteps signs of life from those within 
 
 stop 
 
 the death eaters came to a halt harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the open front doors of the school he could see even though his closed lids the reddish glow that meant light streamed upon him from the entrance hall he waited any moment the people for whom he had tried to die would see him lying apparently dead in hagrids arms 
 
 no 
 
 the scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that professor mcgonagall could make such a sound he heard another women laughing nearby and knew that bellatrix gloried in mcgonagalls despair he squinted again for a single second and saw the open doorway filling with people as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers and see the truth of harrys death for themselves he saw voldemort standing a little in front of him stroking naginis head with a single white finger he closed his eyes again 
 
 no 
 
 no 
 
 harry harry 
 
 rons hermiones and ginnys voices were worse than mcgonagalls harry wanted nothing more than to call back yet he made himself lie silent and their cries acted like a trigger the crowd of survivors took up the cause screaming and yelling abuse at the death eathers until silence cried voldemort and there was a bang and a flash of bright light and silence was forced upon them all it is over set him down hagrid at my feet where he belongs 
 
 harry felt himself lowered onto the grass 
 
 you see said voldemort and harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the place where he lay harry potter is dead do you understand now deluded ones he was nothing ever but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him 
 
 he beat you yelled ron and the charm broke and the defenders of hogwarts were shouting and screaming again until a second more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more 
 
 he was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds said voldemort and there was a relish in his voice for the lie killed while trying to save himself c 
 
 but voldemort broke off harry heard a scuffle and a shout then another bang a flash of light and grunt of pain he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount someone had broken free of the crowd and charged at voldemort harry saw the figure hit the ground disarmed voldemort throwing the challengers wand aside and laughing 
 
 and who is this he said in his soft snakes hiss who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost 
 
 bellatrix gave a delighted laugh 
 
 it is neville longbottom my lord the boy who has been giving the carrows so much trouble the son of the aurors remember 
 
 ah yes i remember said voldemort looking down at neville who was struggling back to his feet unarmed and unprotected standing in the between the survivors and the death eaters but you are a pureblood arent you my brave boy voldemort asked neville who stood facing him his empty hands curled in fists 
 
 so what if i am said neville loudly 
 
 you show spirit and bravery and you come of noble stock you will make a very valuable death eater we need your kind neville longbottom 
 
 ill join you when hell freezes over said neville dumbledores army he shouted and there was an answering cheer from the crowd whom voldemorts silencing charms seemed unable to hold 
 
 very well said voldemort and harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse if that is your choice longbottom we revert to the original plan on your head he said quietly be it 
 
 still watching through his lashes harry saw voldemort wave his wand seconds later out of one of the castles shattered windows something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half light and landed in voldemorts hand he shook the mildewed object by its pointed end and it dangled empty and ragged the sorting hat 
 
 there will be no more sorting at hogwarts school said voldemort there will be no more houses the emblem shield and colors of my noble ancestor salazar slythering will suffice everyone wont they neville longbottom 
 
 he pointed his wand at neville who grew rigid and still then forced the hat onto nevilles head so that it slipped down below his eyes there were movements from the watching crowd in front of the castle and as one the death eaters raised their wands holding the fighters of hogwarts at bay 
 
 neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me said voldemort and with a flick of his wand he caused the sorting hat to burst into flames 
 
 screams split the dawn and neville was a flame rooted to the spot unable to move and harry could not bear it he must act and then many things happened at the same moment 
 
 they heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the walls and pelted toward the castle uttering loud war cries at the same time grawp came lumbering around the side of the castle and yelled hagger his cry was answered by roars from voldemorts giants they ran at grawp like bull elephants making the earth quake then came hooves and the twangs of bows and arrows were suddenly falling amongst the death eaters who broke ranks shouting their surprise harry pulled the invisibility cloak from inside his robes swung it over himself and sprang to his feet as neville moved too 
 
 in one swift fluid motion neville broke free of the curse upon him the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver with a glittering rubied handle the slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampeding centaurs and yet it seemed to draw every eye with a single stroke neville sliced off the great snakes head which spun high into the air gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall and voldemorts mouth was open in a scream of fury that nobody could hear and the snakes body thudded to the ground at his feet c 
 
 hidden beneath the invisibility cloak harry cast a shield charm between neville and voldemort before the latter could raise his stamps of the battling giants hagrids yell came loudest of all 
 
 harry hagrid shouted harry c wheres harry chaos reigned the charging centaurs were scattering the death eaters everyone was feeling the giants stamping feet and nearer and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who knew where harry saw great winged creatures soaring the heads of voldemorts giants thestrals and buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while grawp punched and pummeled them and now the wizards defenders of hogwarts and death eaters alike were being forced back into the castle harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any death eater he could see and they crumpled not knowing what or who had hit them and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd still hidden beneath the invisibility cloak harry was buffered into the entrance hall he was searching for voldemort and saw him across the room firing spells from his wand as he backed into the great hall still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and right harry cast more shield charms and voldemorts victims seamus finnigan and hannah abbott darted past him into the great hall where they joined the fight already flourishing inside it 
 
 and now there were more even more people storming up the front steps and harry saw charlie weasley overtaking horace slughorn who was still wearing his emerald pajamas they seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every hogwarts student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeeps and homeowners of hogsmeade the centaurs bane ronan and magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves as behind harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges 
 
 the of hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall screaming and waving carving knives and cleaver and at their head the locker of regulus black bouncing on his chest was kreacher his bullfrogs voice audible even above this din fight fight fight for my master defender of fight the dark lord in the name of brave regulus fight 
 
 they were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shim of death eaters their tiny faces alive with malice and everywhere harry looked death eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers overcome by spells dragging arrows from wounds stabbed in the leg by elves or else simply attempting to escape but swallowed by the oncoming horde 
 
 but it was not over yet harry sped between duelers past a struggling prisoners and into he great hall 
 
 voldemort was in the center of the battle and he was striking and smiting al within reach harry could not get a clear shot but fought his way nearer still invisible and the great hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside 
 
 harry saw yaxley slammed to the floor by george and lee jordan saw dolohov fall with a scream at flitwicks hands saw walden macnair thrown across the room by hagrid hit the stone wall opposite and slide unconscious to the ground he saw ron and neville bringing down fenrir greyback aberforth stunning rookwood arthur and percy flooting thicknesse and lucius and narcissa malfoy running through the crowd not even attempting to fight screaming for their son 
 
 voldemort was now dueling mcgonagall slughorn kingsley all at once and there was a cold hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him unable to finish him bellatrix was still fighting too fifty yards away from voldemort and like her master she dueled three at once hermione ginny and luna all battling their hardest but bellatrix was equal to them and harrys attention was diverted as a killing curse shot so close to ginny that she missed death by an inch 
 
 he changed course running at bellatrix rather than voldemort but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways 
 
 not my daughter you bitch 
 
 mrs weasley threw off her cloak as she ran freeing her arms bellatrix spun on the spot roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger 
 
 out of my way shouted mrs weasley to the three girls and with a simple swipe of her wand she began to duel harry watched with terror and elation as molly weasleys wand slashed and twisted and bellatrix lestranges smile faltered and became a snarl jets of light flew from both wands the floor around the witches feet became hot and cracked both woman were fighting to kill 
 
 no mrs weasley cried as a few students ran forward trying to come to her aid get back get back she is mine 
 
 hundreds of people now lined the walls watching the two fights voldemort and his three opponents bellatrix and molly and harry stood invisible torn between both wanting to attack and yet to protect unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent 
 
 what will happen to your children when ive killed you taunted bellatrix as mad as her master capering as mollys curses danced around her when mummys gone the same way as freddie 
 
 you c will c never c touch c our c children c again screamed mrs weasley 
 
 bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin sirius had given as he toppled backward through the veil and suddenly harry knew what was going to happen before it did 
 
 mollys curse soared beneath bellatrixs constricted arm and hit her squarely in the chest directly over her heart 
 
 bellatrixs gloating smile froze her eyes seemed to bulge for the tiniest space of time she knew what had happened and then she toppled and the watching crowd roared and voldemord screamed 
 
 harry felt as though he turned into slow motion he saw mcgonagall kingsley and slughorn blasted backward flailing and writhing through the air as voldemorts fury at the fall of his last best lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb voldemort raised his wand and directed it at molly weasley 
 
 protego roared harry and the shield charm expanded in the middle of the hall and voldemort stared around for the source as harry pulled off the invisibility cloak at last 
 
 the yell of shock the cheers the screams on every side of harry 
 
 hes alive were stifled at once the crowd was afraid and silence fell abruptly and completely as voldemort and harry looked at each other and began at the same moment to circle each other 
 
 i dont want anyone else to help harry said loudly and in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call its got to be like this its got to be me 
 
 voldemort hissed 
 
 potter doesnt mean that he said his red eyes wide this isnt how he works is it who are you going to use as a shield today potter 
 
 nobody said harry simply there are no more horcruxes its just you and me neither can live while the other survives and one of us is about to leave for good 
 
 one of us jeered voldemort and his whole body was taut and his red eyes stared a snake that was about to strike you think it will be you do you the boy who has survived by accident and because dumbledore was pulling the strings 
 
 accident was it when my mother died to save me asked harry they were still moving sideways both of them in that perfect circle maintaining the same distance from each other and for harry no face existed but voldemorts accident when i decided to fight in that graveyard accident that i didnt defend myself tonight and still survived and returned to fight again 
 
 accidents screamed voldemort but still he did not strike and the watching crowd was frozen as if petrified and of the hundreds in the hall nobody seemed to breathe but they two accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men and women and permitted me to kill them for you 
 
 you wont be killing anyone else tonight said harry as they circled and stared into each others eyes green into red you wont be able to kill any of them ever again dont you get it i was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people c 
 
 but you did not 
 
 c i meant to and thats what did it ive done what my mother did theyre protected from you havent you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding you cant torture them you cant touch them you dont learn from your mistakes riddle do you 
 
 you dare c 
 
 yes i dare said harry i know things you dont know tom riddle i know lots of important things that you dont want to hear some before you make another big mistake 
 
 voldemort did not speak but prowled in a circle and harry knew that he kept him temporarily mesmerized at bay held back by the faintest possibility that harry might indeed know a final secret 
 
 is it love again said voldemort his snakes face jeering dumbledore favorite solution love which he claimed conquered death though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like and old waxwork love which did not prevent me stamping out your muddblood mother like a cockroach potter c and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse so what will stop you dying now when i strike 
 
 just one thing said harry and still they circled each other wrapped in each other held apart by nothing but the last secret 
 
 if it is not love that will save you this time said voldemort you must believe that you have magic that i do not or else a weapon more powerful than mine 
 
 i believe both said harry and he saw shock flit across the snakelike face though it was instantly dispelled voldemort began to laugh and the sound was more frightening than his screams humorless and insane it echoed around the silent hall 
 
 you think you know more magic than i do he said than i than lord voldemort who has performed magic that dumbledore himself never dreamed of 
 
 oh he dreamed of it said harry but he knew more than you knew enough not to do what youve done 
 
 you mean he was weak screamed voldemort too weak to dare too weak to take what might have been his what will be mine 
 
 no he was cleverer than you said harry a better wizard a better man 
 
 i brought about the death of albus dumbledore 
 
 you thought you did said harry but you were wrong 
 
 for the first time the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew breath as one 
 
 dumbledore is dead voldemort hurled the words at harry as in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle i have seen it potter and he will not return 
 
 yes dumbledore is dead said harry calmly but you didnt have him killed he chose his own manner of dying chose it months before he died arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant 
 
 what childish dream is this said voldemort but still he did not strike and his red eyes did not waver from harrys 
 
 severus snape wasnt yours said harry snape was dumbledores dumbledores from the moment you starting hunting down my mother and you never realized it because of the thing you cant understand you never saw snape cast a patronus did you riddle 
 
 voldemort did not answer they continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each other apart 
 
 snapes patronus was a doe said harry the same as my mothers because he loved her for nearly all of his life from the time when they were children you should have realized he said as he saw voldemorts nostrils flare he asked you to spare her life didnt he 
 
 he desired her that was all sneered voldemort but when she had gone he agreed that there were other women and of purer blood worthier of him c 
 
 of course he told you that said harry but he was dumbledores spy from the moment you threatened her and hes been working against you ever since dumbledore was already dying when snape finished him 
 
 it matters not shrieked voldemort who had followed every word with rapt attention but now let out a cackle of mad laughter it matters not whether snape was mine or dumbledores or what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path i crushed them as i crushed your mother snapes supposed great love oh but it all makes sense potter and in ways that you do not understand 
 
 dumbledore was trying to keep the elder wand from me he intended that snape should be the true master of the wand but i got there ahead of you little boy c i reached the wand before you could get your hands on it i understood the truth before you caught up i killed severus snape three hours ago and the elder wand the deathstick the wand of destiny is truly mine dumbledores last plan went wrong harry potter 
 
 yeah it did said harry youre right but before you try to kill me id advise you think what youve done think and try for some remorse riddle 
 
 what is this 
 
 of all the things that harry had said to him beyond any revelation or taunt nothing had socked voldemort like this harry saw is pupils contract to thin slits saw the skin around his eyes whiten 
 
 its your one last chance said harry its all youve got left ive seen what youll be otherwise be a man try 
 
 try for some remorse 
 
 you dare c said voldemort again 
 
 yes i dare said harry because dumbledores last plan hasnt backfired on me at all its backfired on you riddle 
 
 voldemorts hand was trembling on the elder wand and harry gripped dracos very tightly the moment he knew was seconds away 
 
 that wand still isnt working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person severus snape was never the true master of the elder wand he never defeated dumbledore 
 
 he killed c 
 
 arent you listening snape never beat dumbledore dumbledores death was planned between them dumbledore intended to die undefeated the wands last true master if all had gone as planned the wands power would have died with him because it had never been won from him 
 
 but then potter dumbledore as good as gave me the wand voldemorts voice shook with malicious pleasure i stole the wand from its last masters tomb i removed it against the last masters wishes its power is mine 
 
 you still dont get it riddle do you possessing the wand isnt enough holding it using it doesnt make it really yours didnt you listen to ollivander the wand chooses the wizard the elder wand recognized a new master before dumbledore died someone who never even laid a hand on it the new master removed the wand from dumbledore against his will never realizing exactly what he had done or that the worlds most dangerous wand had given him its allegiance 
 
 voldemorts chest rose and fell rapidly and harry could feel the curse coming feel it building inside the wand pointed at his face 
 
 the true master of the elder wand was draco malfoy 
 
 blank shock showed in voldemorts face for a moment but then it was gone 
 
 but what does it matter he said softly even if you are right potter it makes no difference to you and me you no longer have the phoenix wand we duel on skill alone and after i have killed you i can attend to draco malfoy 
 
 but youre too late said harry youve missed your chance i got there first i overpowered draco weeks ago i took his wand from him 
 
 harry twitched the hawthorn wand and he felt the eyes of everyone in the hall upon it 
 
 so it all comes down to this doesnt it whispered harry does the wand in your hand know its last master was disarmed because if it does i am the true master of the elder wand 
 
 a burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the nearest window the light hit both of their faces at the same time so that voldemorts was suddenly a flaming blur harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens pointing dracos wand 
 
 avada kedavra 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 the bang was like a cannon blast and the golden flames that erupted between them at the dead center of the circle they had been treading marked the point where the spells collided harry saw voldemorts green jet meet his own spell saw the elder wand fly high dark against the sunrise spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of nagini spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill who had come to take full possession of it at last and harry with the unerring skill of the seeker caught the wand in his free hand as voldemort fell backward arms splayed the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward tom riddle hit the floor with a mundane finality his body feeble and shrunken the white hands empty the snakelike face vacant and unknowing voldemort was dead killed by his own rebounding curse and harry stood with two wands in his hand staring down at his enemys shell 
 
 one shivering second of silence the shock of the moment suspended and then the tumult broke around harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air the fierce new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him and the first to reach him were ron and hermione and it was their arms that were wrapped around him their incomprehensible shouts that deafened him then ginny neville and luna were there and then all the weasleys and hagrid and kingsley and mcgonagall and flitwick and sprout and harry could not hear a word that anyone was shouting not tell whose hands were seizing him pulling him trying to hug some part of him hundreds of them pressing in all of them determined to touch the boy who lived the reason it was over at last c the sun rose steadily over hogwarts and the great hall blazed with life and light harry was an indispensable part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning of grief and celebration they wanted him there with them their leader and symbol their savior and their guide and that he had not slept that he craved the company of only a few of them seemed to occur to no one he must speak to the bereaved clasp their hands witness their tears receive their thanks hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on that the imperiused up and down the country had come back to themselves that death eaters were fleeing or else being captured that the innocent of azkaban were being released at that very moment and that kingsley shacklebolt had been named temporary minister of magic 
 
 they moved voldemorts body and laid it in a chamber off the hall away form the bodies of fred tonks lupin colin creevey and fifty others who had died fighting him mcgonagall had replaced the house tables but nobody was sitting according to house anymore all were jumbled together teachers and pupils ghosts and parents centaurs and and firenze lay recovering in the corner and grawp peered in through a smashed window and people were throwing food into his laughing mouth after a while exhausted and drained harry found himself sitting on a bench beside luna 
 
 id want some peace and quiet if it were me she said 
 
 id love some he replied 
 
 ill distract them all she said use your cloak 
 
 and before he could say a word she had cried oooh look a blibbering humdinger and pointed out the window everyone who heard looked around and harry slid the cloak up over himself and got to his feet 
 
 now he could move through the hall without interference he spotted ginny two tables away she was sitting with her head on her mothers shoulder there would be time to talk later hours and days and maybe years in which to talk he saw neville the sword of gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers along the aisle between the tables he walked and he spotted the three malfoys huddled together as though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there but nobody was paying them any attention everywhere he looked he saw families reunited and finally he saw the two whose company he craved most 
 
 its me he muttered crouching down between them will you come with me 
 
 they stood up at once and together he ron and hermione left the great hall great chunks were missing from the marble staircase part of the balustrade gone and rubble and bloodstains occurred ever few steps as their climbed 
 
 somewhere in the distance they could hear peeves zooming through the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition 
 
 
 
 
 we did it we bashed them wee potters the one 
 
 and voldys gone moldy so now lets have fun 
 
 
 
 
 really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing doesnt it said ron pushing open a door to let harry and hermione through 
 
 happiness would come harry though but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion and the pain of losing fred and lupin and tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps most of all he felt the most stupendous relief and a longing to sleep but first he owed an explanation to ron and hermione who had stuck with him for so long and who deserved the truth 
 
 painstakingly he recounted what he had seem in the pensieve and what had happened in the forest and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking though none of them had mentioned their destination 
 
 since he had last seen it the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmasters study had been knocked aside it stood lopsided looking a little and harry wondered whether it would be able to distinguish passwords anymore 
 
 can we go up he asked the gargoyle 
 
 feel free groaned the statue 
 
 they clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an escalator harry pushed open the door at the top 
 
 he had one brief glimpse of the stone pensieve on the desk where he had left it and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out thinking of curses and returning death eaters and the rebirth of voldemort c 
 
 but it was applause all around the walls the headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs they reached through their frames to grip each others hands they danced up and down on their chairs in which they have been painted dilys derwent sobbed unashamedly dexter fortescue was waving his and phineas niggelus called in his high reedy voice and let it be noted that slytherin house played its part let our contribution not be forgotten 
 
 but harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the headmasters chair tears were sliding down from behind the spectacles into the long silver beard and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled harry with the same balm as phoenix song 
 
 at last harry held up his hands and the portraits fell respectfully silent beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak he directed his words at dumbledore however and chose them with enormous care exhausted and though he was he must make one last effort seeking one last piece of advice 
 
 the thing that was hidden in the snitch he began i dropped it in the forest i dont know exactly where but im not going to go looking for it again do you agree 
 
 my dear boy i do said dumbledore while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious a wise and courageous decision but no less than i would have expected of you does anyone know else know where it fell 
 
 no one said harry and dumbledore nodded his satisfaction 
 
 im going to keep ignotuss present though said harry and dumbledore beamed 
 
 but of course harry it is yours forever until you pass it on 
 
 and then theres this 
 
 harry held up the elder wand and ron and hermione looked at it with a reverence that even in his befuddled and state harry did not like to see 
 
 i dont want it said harry 
 
 what said ron loudly are you mental 
 
 i know its powerful said harry wearily but i was happier with mine so 
 
 he rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck and pulled out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather hermione had said that they could not be repaired that the damage was too severe all he knew was that if this did not work nothing would 
 
 he laid the broken wand upon the headmasters desk touched it with the very tip of the elder wand and said reparo 
 
 as his wand resealed red sparks flew out of its end harry knew that he had succeeded he picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion 
 
 im putting the elder wand he told dumbledore who was watching him with enormous affection and admiration back where it came from it can stay there if i die a natural death like ignotus its power will be broken wont it the previous master will never have been defeated thatll be the end of it 
 
 dumbledore nodded they smiled at each other 
 
 are you sure said ron there was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at the elder wand 
 
 i think harrys right said hermione quietly 
 
 that wands more trouble than its worth said harry and quite honestly he turned away from the painted portraits thinking now only of the bed lying waiting for him in gryffindor tower and wondering whether kreacher might bring him a sandwich there ive had enough trouble for a lifetime
