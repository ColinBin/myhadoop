 the dryad 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 we are travelling to paris to the exhibition 
 
 now we are there that was a journey a flight without magic we 
 flew on the wings of steam over the sea and across the land 
 
 yes our time is the time of fairy tales 
 
 we are in the midst of paris in a great hotel blooming flowers 
 ornament the staircases and soft carpets the floors 
 
 our room is a very cosy one and through the open balcony door 
 we have a view of a great square spring lives down there it has come to paris and arrived at the same time with us it has come in the 
 shape of a glorious young chestnut tree with delicate leaves newly 
 opened how the tree gleams dressed in its spring garb before all 
 the other trees in the place one of these latter had been struck 
 out of the list of living trees it lies on the ground with roots 
 exposed on the place where it stood the young chestnut tree is to be 
 planted and to flourish 
 
 it still stands towering aloft on the heavy wagon which has 
 brought it this morning a distance of several miles to paris for 
 years it had stood there in the protection of a mighty oak tree 
 under which the old venerable clergyman had often sat with children 
 listening to his stories 
 
 the young chestnut tree had also listened to the stories for 
 the dryad who lived in it was a child also she remembered the time 
 when the tree was so little that it only projected a short way above 
 the grass and ferns around these were as tall as they would ever 
 be but the tree grew every year and enjoyed the air and the 
 sunshine and drank the dew and the rain several times it was also 
 as it must be well shaken by the wind and the rain for that is a 
 part of education 
 
 the dryad rejoiced in her life and rejoiced in the sunshine 
 and the singing of the birds but she was most rejoiced at human 
 voices she understood the language of men as well as she understood that of animals 
 
 butterflies cockchafers everything that could 
 fly came to pay a visit they could all talk they told of the 
 village of the vineyard of the forest of the old castle with its 
 parks and canals and ponds down in the water dwelt also living 
 beings which in their way could fly under the water from one 
 place to another beings with knowledge and delineation they said 
 nothing at all they were so clever 
 
 and the swallow who had dived told about the pretty little 
 goldfish of the thick turbot the fat brill and the old carp the 
 swallow could describe all that very well but self is the man she 
 said one ought to see these things self but how was the 
 dryad ever to see such beings she was obliged to be satisfied with 
 being able to look over the beautiful country and see the busy 
 industry of men 
 
 it was glorious but most glorious of all when the old clergyman 
 sat under the oak tree and talked of france and of the great deeds of 
 her sons and daughters whose names will be mentioned with 
 admiration through all time 
 
 then the dryad heard of the shepherd girl joan of arc and of 
 charlotte corday she heard about henry the fourth and napoleon the first she heard names whose echo sounds in the hearts of the people 
 
 the village children listened attentively and the dryad no less 
 attentively she became a with the rest in the clouds 
 that went sailing by she saw picture by picture everything that 
 she heard talked about the cloudy sky was her 
 she felt so happy in beautiful france the fruitful land of 
 genius with the crater of freedom but in her heart the sting 
 remained that the bird that every animal that could fly was much 
 better off than she even the fly could look about more in the 
 world far beyond the horizon 
 
 france was so great and so glorious but she could only look 
 across a little piece of it the land stretched out 
 with vineyards forests and great cities of all these paris was the 
 most splendid and the mightiest the birds could get there but she 
 never 
 
 among the village children was a little ragged poor girl but a 
 pretty one to look at she was always laughing or singing and 
 twining red flowers in her black hair 
 
 go to paris the old clergyman warned her poor child if 
 you go there it will be your ruin 
 
 but she went for all that 
 
 the dryad often thought of her for she had the same wish and 
 felt the same longing for the great city 
 the tree was bearing its first chestnut blossoms the 
 birds were twittering round them in the most beautiful sunshine 
 then a stately carriage came rolling along that way and in it sat a 
 grand lady driving the spirited horses on the back seat 
 a little smart groom balanced himself the dryad knew the lady and 
 the old clergyman knew her also he shook his head gravely when he saw her and said 
 
 so you went there after all and it was your ruin poor mary 
 that one poor thought the dryad no she wears a dress fit for 
 a countess she had become one in the city of magic changes oh if i were only there amid all the splendor and pomp they shine up 
 into the very clouds at night when i look up i can tell in what 
 direction the town lies 
 
 towards that direction the dryad looked every evening she saw 
 in the dark night the gleaming cloud on the horizon in the clear 
 moonlight nights she missed the sailing clouds which showed her 
 pictures of the city and pictures from history 
 
 the child grasps at the the dryad grasped at the 
 her a sudden cloudless sky was for her a blank leaf and for several days she had only had such leaves before 
 her 
 
 it was in the warm not a breeze moved through the 
 glowing hot days every leaf every flower lay as if it were 
 torpid and the people seemed torpid too 
 
 then the clouds arose and covered the region round about where the 
 gleaming mist announced here lies paris 
 
 the clouds piled themselves up like a chain of mountains 
 hurried on through the air and spread themselves abroad over the 
 whole landscape as far as the eye could reach 
 
 like enormous blocks of rock the clouds lay piled over 
 one another gleams of lightning shot forth from them 
 
 these also are the servants of the lord god the old clergyman 
 had said and there came a bluish dazzling flash of lightning a 
 lighting up as if of the sun itself which could burst blocks of 
 rock asunder the lightning struck and split to the roots the old 
 venerable oak the crown fell asunder it seemed as if the tree were 
 stretching forth its arms to clasp the messengers of the light 
 
 no bronze cannon can sound over the land at the birth of a royal 
 child as the thunder sounded at the death of the old oak the rain 
 streamed down a refreshing wind was blowing the storm had gone by and there was quite a holiday glow on all things the old clergyman spoke a few words for honorable remembrance and a painter made a drawing as a lasting record of the tree 
 
 everything passes away said the dryad passes away like a 
 cloud and never comes back 
 
 the old clergyman too did not come back the green roof of his 
 school was gone and his had vanished the children did not come but autumn came and winter came and then spring also in all this change of seasons the dryad looked toward the region where at night paris gleamed with its bright mist far on the horizon 
 
 forth from the town rushed engine after engine train after train 
 whistling and screaming at all hours in the day in the evening 
 towards midnight at daybreak and all the day through came the 
 trains out of each one and into each one streamed people from the 
 country of every king a new wonder of the world had summoned them to paris 
 
 in what form did this wonder exhibit itself 
 a splendid blossom of art and industry said one has 
 unfolded itself in the champ de mars a gigantic sunflower from whose petals one can learn geography and statistics and can become as wise as a lord mayor and raise self to the level of art and 
 poetry and study the greatness and power of the various lands 
 a fairy tale flower said another a which spreads out its green leaves like a velvet carpet over the sand the opening spring has brought it forth the summer will see it in all its splendor the autumn winds will sweep it away so that not a leaf not a fragment of its root shall remain 
 in front of the military school extends in time of peace the arena 
 of war a field without a blade of grass a piece of sandy steppe 
 as if cut out of the desert of africa where fata morgana displays her 
 wondrous airy castles and hanging gardens in the champ de mars 
 however these were to be seen more splendid more wonderful than in the east for human art had converted the airy deceptive scenes into reality 
 
 the palace of the present has been built it was said 
 
 day by day hour by hour it unfolds more of its wonderful splendor 
 
 the endless halls shine in marble and many colors master 
 bloodless here moves his limbs of steel and iron in the great 
 circular hall of machinery works of art in metal in stone in 
 gobelins tapestry announce the vitality of mind that is stirring in 
 every land halls of paintings splendor of flowers everything that 
 mind and skill can create in the workshop of the artisan has been 
 placed here for show even the memorials of ancient days out of old 
 graves and have appeared at this general meeting 
 the overpowering great variegated whole must be divided into small 
 portions and pressed together like a plaything if it is to be 
 understood and described 
 
 like a great table on christmas eve the champ de mars carried a 
 of industry and art and around this knickknacks from 
 all countries had been ranged knickknacks on a grand scale for every nation found some remembrance of home 
 
 here stood the royal palace of egypt there the caravanserai of 
 the desert land the bedouin had quitted his sunny country and 
 hastened by on his camel here stood the russian stables with the 
 fiery glorious horses of the steppe here stood the simple 
 dwelling of the danish peasant with the dannebrog 
 flag next to gustavus wooden house from dalarne with its 
 wonderful carvings american huts english cottages french pavilions kiosks theatres churches all strewn around and between them the fresh green turf the clear springing water blooming bushes rare trees hothouses in which one might fancy self transported into the tropical forest whole gardens brought from damascus and blooming under one roof what colors what fragrance 
 
 artificial grottoes surrounded bodies of fresh or salt water 
 and gave a glimpse into the empire of the fishes the visitor seemed 
 to wander at the bottom of the sea among fishes and polypi 
 all this they said the champ de mars offers and around 
 the great table the crowd of human beings moves like a 
 busy swarm of ants on foot or in little carriages for not all feet 
 are equal to such a fatiguing journey 
 
 hither they swarm from morning till late in the evening steamer 
 after steamer crowded with people glides down the seine the 
 number of carriages is continually on the increase the swarm of 
 people on foot and on horseback grows more and more dense carriages and omnibuses are crowded stuffed and embroidered with people all these tributary streams flow in one direction towards the exhibition 
 
 on every entrance the flag of france is displayed around the 
 bazaar wave the flags of all nations there is a humming and a 
 murmuring from the hall of the machines from the towers the melody of the chimes is heard with the tones of the organs in the churches 
 mingle the hoarse nasal songs from the cafes of the east it is a 
 kingdom of babel a wonder of the world 
 
 in very truth it was what all the reports said and who 
 did not hear them the dryad knew everything that is told here of 
 the new wonder in the city of cities 
 
 fly away ye birds fly away to see and then come back and 
 tell me said the dryad 
 
 the wish became an intense desire became the one thought of a 
 life then in the quiet silent night while the full moon was 
 shining the dryad saw a spark fly out of the disc and fall 
 like a shooting star and before the tree whose leaves waved to and 
 fro as if they were stirred by a tempest stood a noble mighty and 
 grand figure in tones that were at once rich and strong like the 
 trumpet of the last judgment bidding farewell to life and summoning to the great account it said 
 
 thou shalt go to the city of magic thou shalt take root there 
 and enjoy the mighty rushing breezes the air and the sunshine 
 there but the time of thy life shall then be shortened the line of 
 years that awaited thee here amid the free nature shall shrink to 
 but a small tale poor dryad it shall be thy destruction thy 
 yearning and longing will increase thy desire will grow more 
 stormy the tree itself will be as a prison to thee thou wilt quit 
 thy cell and give up thy nature to fly out and mingle among men 
 then the years that would have belonged to thee will be contracted 
 to half the span of the ephemeral fly that lives but a day one 
 night and thy shall be blown out the leaves of the tree 
 will wither and be blown away to become green never again 
 thus the words sounded and the light vanished away but not the 
 longing of the dryad she trembled in the wild fever of expectation 
 i shall go there she cried rejoicingly life is beginning and 
 swells like a cloud nobody knows whither it is hastening 
 when the gray dawn arose and the moon turned pale and the clouds 
 were tinted red the hour struck the words of promise were fulfilled 
 
 people appeared with spades and poles they dug round the roots of 
 the tree deeper and deeper and beneath it a wagon was brought 
 out drawn by many horses and the tree was lifted up with its 
 roots and the lumps of earth that adhered to them matting was 
 placed around the roots as though the tree had its feet in a warm 
 bag and now the tree was lifted on the wagon and secured with chains 
 
 the journey began the journey to paris there the tree was to grow as an ornament to the city of french glory 
 
 the twigs and the leaves of the chestnut tree trembled in the 
 first moments of its being moved and the dryad trembled in the 
 pleasurable feeling of expectation 
 
 away away it sounded in every beat of her pulse away 
 away sounded in words that flew trembling along the dryad forgot 
 to bid farewell to the regions of home she thought not of the 
 waving grass and of the innocent daisies which had looked up to her 
 as to a great lady a young princess playing at being a shepherdess 
 out in the open air 
 
 the chestnut tree stood upon the wagon and nodded his branches 
 whether this meant farewell or forward the dryad knew not she 
 dreamed only of the marvellous new things that seemed yet so 
 familiar and that were to unfold themselves before her no 
 heart rejoicing in innocence no heart whose blood danced with 
 passion had set out on the journey to paris more full of 
 expectation than she 
 
 her farewell sounded in the words away away 
 the wheels turned the distant approached the present vanished 
 the region was changed even as the clouds change new vineyards 
 forests villages villas appeared came nearer vanished 
 
 the chestnut tree moved forward and the dryad went with it 
 after rushed past sending up into the air 
 vapory clouds that formed figures which told of paris whence they 
 came and whither the dryad was going 
 
 everything around knew it and must know whither she was bound it 
 seemed to her as if every tree she passed stretched out its leaves 
 towards her with the prayer take me with you take me with you 
 for every tree enclosed a longing dryad 
 
 what changes during this flight houses seemed to be rising out of 
 the earth more and more thicker and thicker the chimneys rose 
 like ranged side by side or in rows one above the 
 other on the roofs great inscriptions in letters a yard long and 
 figures in various colors covering the walls from cornice to 
 basement came brightly out 
 
 where does paris begin and when shall i be there asked the 
 dryad 
 
 the crowd of people grew the tumult and the bustle increased 
 carriage followed upon carriage people on foot and people on 
 horseback were mingled together all around were shops on shops music and song crying and talking 
 
 the dryad in her tree was now in the midst of paris the great 
 heavy wagon all at once stopped on a little square planted with trees 
 the high houses around had all of them balconies to the windows 
 from which the inhabitants looked down upon the young fresh chestnut tree which was coming to be planted here as a substitute for the dead tree that lay stretched on the ground 
 
 the stood still and smiled in admiration of its pure 
 vernal freshness the older trees whose buds were still closed 
 whispered with their waving branches welcome welcome the 
 fountain throwing its jet of water high up in the air to let it fall 
 again in the wide stone basin told the wind to sprinkle the 
 with pearly drops as if it wished to give him a refreshing draught to 
 welcome him 
 
 the dryad felt how her tree was being lifted from the wagon to 
 be placed in the spot where it was to stand the roots were covered 
 with earth and fresh turf was laid on top blooming shrubs and 
 flowers in pots were ranged around and thus a little garden arose 
 in the square 
 
 the tree that had been killed by the fumes of gas the steam of 
 kitchens and the bad air of the city was put upon the wagon and 
 driven away the looked on children and old men sat upon the bench and looked at the green tree and we who are telling this story stood upon a balcony and looked down upon the green spring sight that had been brought in from the fresh country air and said what the old clergyman would have said poor dryad 
 
 i am happy i am happy the dryad cried rejoicing and yet i 
 cannot realize cannot describe what i feel everything is as i 
 fancied it and yet as i did not fancy it 
 
 the houses stood there so lofty so close the sunlight shone 
 on only one of the walls and that one was stuck over with bills and 
 placards before which the people stood still and this made a crowd 
 carriages rushed past carriages rolled past light ones and heavy 
 ones mingled together omnibuses those moving houses came rattling by horsemen galloped among them even carts and wagons asserted their rights 
 
 the dryad asked herself if these houses which stood so 
 close around her would not remove and take other shapes like the 
 clouds in the sky and draw aside so that she might cast a glance 
 into paris and over it notre dame must show itself the vendome 
 column and the wondrous building which had called and was still 
 calling so many strangers to the city 
 
 but the houses did not stir from their places it was yet day when 
 the lamps were lit the gleamed from the shops and shone 
 even into the branches of the trees so that it was like sunlight in 
 summer the stars above made their appearance the same to which the dryad had looked up in her home she thought she felt a clear pure stream of air which went forth from them she felt herself lifted up and strengthened and felt an increased power of seeing through 
 every leaf and through every fibre of the root amid all the noise and 
 the turmoil the colors and the lights she knew herself watched by 
 mild eyes 
 
 from the side streets sounded the merry notes of fiddles and 
 wind instruments up to the dance to the dance to jollity and 
 pleasure that was their invitation such music it was that horses 
 carriages trees and houses would have danced if they had known how 
 
 the charm of intoxicating delight filled the bosom of the dryad 
 
 how glorious how splendid it is she cried rejoicingly now i 
 am in paris 
 
 the next day that dawned the next night that fell offered the 
 same spectacle similar bustle similar life changing indeed yet 
 always the same and thus it went on through the sequence of days 
 now i know every tree every flower on the square here i know 
 every house every balcony every shop in this narrow 
 corner where i am denied the sight of this great mighty city where 
 are the arches of triumph the boulevards the wondrous building of 
 the world i see nothing of all this as if shut up in a cage i stand 
 among the high houses which i now know by heart with their 
 inscriptions signs and placards all the painted confectionery that 
 is no longer to my taste where are all the things of which i heard 
 for which i longed and for whose sake i wanted to come hither what have i seized found won i feel the same longing i felt before i 
 feel that there is a life i should wish to grasp and to experience 
 i must go out into the ranks of living men and mingle among them i 
 must fly about like a bird i must see and feel and become human 
 altogether i must enjoy the one instead of vegetating for 
 years in sameness and weariness in which i become ill 
 and at last sink and disappear like the dew on the meadows i will 
 gleam like the cloud gleam in the sunshine of life look out over the 
 whole like the cloud and pass away like it no one knoweth whither 
 thus sighed the dryad and she prayed 
 
 take from me the years that were destined for me and give me but 
 half of the life of the ephemeral fly deliver me from my prison give 
 me human life human happiness only a short span only the one it cannot be otherwise and then punish me for my wish to live my longing for life strike me out of thy list let my shell the 
 fresh young tree wither or be hewn down and burnt to ashes and 
 scattered to all the winds 
 
 a rustling went through the leaves of the tree there was a 
 trembling in each of the leaves it seemed as if fire streamed through 
 it a gust of wind shook its green crown and from the midst of that 
 crown a female figure came forth in the same moment she was sitting 
 beneath the leafy branches young and beautiful 
 to behold like poor mary to whom the clergyman had said the 
 great city will be thy destruction 
 
 the dryad sat at the foot of the tree at her house door which 
 she had locked and whose key had thrown away so young so fair 
 the stars saw her and blinked at her the saw her and 
 gleamed and beckoned to her how delicate she was and yet how 
 blooming a child and yet a grown maiden her dress was fine as 
 silk green as the leaves on the crown of the tree 
 in her hair clung a chestnut blossom she looked like the goddess of spring 
 
 for one short minute she sat motionless then she sprang up 
 and light as a gazelle she hurried away she ran and sprang like the 
 reflection from the mirror that carried by the sunshine is cast now 
 here now there could any one have followed her with his eyes he 
 would have seen how marvellously her dress and her form changed 
 according to the nature of the house or the place whose light happened to shine upon her 
 
 she reached the boulevards here a sea of light streamed forth 
 from the of the lamps the shops and the cafes here 
 stood in a row young and slender trees each of which concealed its 
 dryad and gave shade from the artificial sunlight the whole vast 
 pavement was one great festive hall where covered tables stood 
 laden with refreshments of all kinds from champagne and chartreuse 
 down to coffee and beer here was an exhibition of flowers statues 
 books and colored stuffs 
 
 from the crowd close by the lofty houses she looked forth over the 
 terrific stream beyond the rows of trees yonder heaved a stream of 
 rolling carriages cabriolets coaches omnibuses cabs and among 
 them riding gentlemen and marching troops to cross to the opposite 
 shore was an undertaking fraught with danger to life and limb now 
 lanterns shed their radiance abroad now the gas had the upper hand 
 suddenly a rocket rises whence whither 
 
 here are sounds of soft italian melodies yonder spanish songs 
 are sung accompanied by the rattle of the castanets but strongest of 
 all and predominating over the rest the tunes of the 
 moment the exciting music which orpheus never knew and which was never heard by the belle helene even the barrow was tempted to hop upon one of its wheels 
 
 the dryad danced floated flew changing her color every 
 moment like a in the sunshine each house with the 
 world belonging to it gave her its own reflections 
 
 as the glowing torn from its stem is carried away 
 by the stream so the dryad drifted along whenever she paused she 
 was another being so that none was able to follow her to recognize 
 her or to look more closely at her 
 
 like all things flew by her she looked into a 
 thousand faces but not one was familiar to her she saw not a 
 single form from home two bright eyes had remained in her memory she thought of mary poor mary the ragged merry child who wore the red flowers in her black hair mary was now here in the rich and magnificent as in that day when she drove past the house of the old clergyman and past the tree of the dryad the old oak 
 
 here she was certainly living in the deafening tumult perhaps 
 she had just stepped out of one of the gorgeous carriages in 
 waiting handsome equipages with coachmen in gold braid and footmen in silken hose drove up the people who alighted from them were all ladies they went through the opened gate and ascended the broad staircase that led to a building resting on marble pillars was this building perhaps the wonder of the world 
 there mary would certainly be found 
 
 sancta maria resounded from the interior incense floated 
 through the lofty painted and gilded aisles where a solemn twilight 
 reigned 
 
 it was the church of the madeleine 
 
 clad in black garments of the most costly stuffs fashioned 
 according to the latest mode the rich feminine world of paris 
 glided across the shining pavement the crests of the proprietors were engraved on silver shields on the and embroidered in the corners of perfumed handkerchiefs bordered with brussels lace a few of the ladies were kneeling in silent prayer 
 before the altars others resorted to the confessionals 
 
 anxiety and fear took possession of the dryad she felt as if 
 she had entered a place where she had no right to be here was the 
 abode of silence the hall of secrets everything was said in 
 whispers every word was a mystery 
 
 the dryad saw herself enveloped in lace and silk like the women 
 of wealth and of high birth around her had perhaps every one of 
 them a longing in her breast like the dryad 
 
 a deep painful sigh was heard did it escape from some 
 confessional in a distant corner or from the bosom of the dryad 
 she drew the veil closer around her she breathed incense and not the 
 fresh air here was not the of her longing 
 
 away away a hastening without rest the ephemeral fly knows 
 not repose for her existence is flight 
 
 she was out again among the gas candelabra by a magnificent 
 fountain 
 
 all its streaming waters are not able to wash out the innocent 
 blood that was spilt here 
 
 such were the words spoken strangers stood around carrying on 
 a lively conversation such as no one would have dared to carry on 
 in the gorgeous hall of secrets whence the dryad came 
 
 a heavy stone slab was turned and then lifted she did not 
 understand why she saw an opening that led into the depths below 
 the strangers stepped down leaving the starlit air and the cheerful 
 life of the upper world behind them 
 
 i am afraid said one of the women who stood around to her 
 husband i cannot venture to go down nor do i care for the wonders down yonder you had better stay here with me 
 
 indeed and travel home said the man and quit paris without 
 having seen the most wonderful thing of all the real wonder of the 
 present period created by the power and resolution of one man 
 i will not go down for all that was the reply 
 
 the wonder of the present time it had been called the dryad 
 had heard and had understood it the goal of her ardent longing had 
 thus been reached and here was the entrance to it down into the 
 depths below paris she had not thought of such a thing but now she heard it said and saw the strangers descending and went after them 
 
 the staircase was of cast iron spiral broad and easy below 
 there burned a lamp and farther down another they stood in a 
 labyrinth of endless halls and arched passages all communicating with each other all the streets and lanes of paris were to be seen here 
 again as in a dim reflection the names were painted up and every 
 house above had its number down here also and struck its roots 
 under the macadamized quays of a broad canal in which the muddy water flowed onward over it the fresh streaming water was carried on arches and quite at the top hung the tangled net of and 
 
 
 in the distance lamps gleamed like a reflection from the 
 above every now and then a dull rumbling was heard this came from the heavy wagons rolling over the entrance bridges 
 
 whither had the dryad come 
 
 you have no doubt heard of the catacombs now they are vanishing points in that new underground world that wonder of the present day the sewers of paris the dryad was there and not in the 
 exhibition in the champ de mars 
 
 she heard exclamations of wonder and admiration 
 
 from here go forth health and life for thousands upon thousands 
 up yonder our time is the time of progress with its manifold 
 blessings 
 
 such was the opinion and the speech of men but not of those 
 creatures who had been born here and who built and dwelt here of the rats namely who were squeaking to one another in the clefts of a 
 crumbling wall quite plainly and in a way the dryad understood well 
 
 a big old with his tail bitten off was relieving 
 his feelings in loud squeaks and his family gave their tribute of 
 concurrence to every word he said 
 
 i am disgusted with this he cried with these 
 outbursts of ignorance a fine magnificence truly all made up of gas 
 and petroleum i eat such stuff as that everything here is so 
 fine and bright now that ashamed of self without exactly 
 knowing why ah if we only lived in the days of tallow candles and 
 it does not lie so very far behind us that was a romantic time as 
 one may say 
 
 what are you talking of there asked the dryad i have never 
 seen you before what is it you are talking about 
 
 of the glorious days that are gone said the rat of the 
 happy time of our and then it 
 was a great thing to get down here that was a nest quite 
 different from paris mother plague used to live here then she killed 
 people but never rats robbers and smugglers could breathe freely 
 here here was the of the most interesting personages 
 whom one now only gets to see in the theatres where they act 
 melodrama up above the time of romance is gone even in our 
 nest and here also fresh air and petroleum have broken in 
 
 thus squeaked the rat he squeaked in honor of the old time 
 when mother plague was still alive 
 
 a carriage stopped a kind of open omnibus drawn by swift horses 
 the company mounted and drove away along the boulevard de 
 sebastopol that is to say the underground boulevard over which 
 the crowded street of that name extended 
 
 the carriage disappeared in the twilight the dryad disappeared 
 lifted to the cheerful freshness above here and not below in the 
 vaulted passages filled with heavy air the wonder work must be found which she was to seek in her short lifetime it must gleam brighter than all the stronger than the moon that was just 
 gliding past 
 
 yes certainly she saw it yonder in the distance it gleamed 
 before her and twinkled and glittered like the evening star in the 
 sky 
 
 she saw a glittering portal open that led to a little garden 
 where all was brightness and dance music colored lamps surrounded 
 little lakes in which were of colored metal from 
 whose flowers jets of water spurted up beautiful weeping willows 
 real products of spring hung their fresh branches over these lakes 
 like a fresh green transparent and yet screening veil in the 
 bushes burnt an open fire throwing a red twilight over the quiet huts 
 of branches into which the sounds of music penetrated an ear 
 tickling intoxicating music that sent the blood coursing through the 
 veins 
 
 beautiful girls in festive attire with pleasant smiles on their 
 lips and the light spirit of youth in their hearts marys with 
 roses in their hair but without carriage and postilion flitted to 
 and fro in the wild dance 
 
 where were the heads where the feet as if stung by tarantulas 
 they sprang laughed rejoiced as if in their ecstacies they were 
 going to embrace all the world 
 
 the dryad felt herself torn with them into the whirl of the dance 
 round her delicate foot clung the silken boot chestnut brown in 
 color like the ribbon that floated from her hair down upon her bare 
 shoulders the green silk dress waved in large folds but did not 
 entirely hide the pretty foot and ankle 
 
 had she come to the enchanted garden of armida what was the 
 name of the place 
 
 the name glittered in over the entrance it was 
 mabille 
 
 the soaring upwards of rockets the splashing of fountains and 
 the popping of champagne corks accompanied the wild bacchantic 
 dance over the whole glided the moon through the air clear but with 
 a somewhat crooked face 
 
 a wild joviality seemed to rush through the dryad as though she 
 were intoxicated with opium her eyes spoke her lips spoke but the 
 sound of violins and of flutes drowned the sound of her voice her 
 partner whispered words to her which she did not understand nor do we understand them he stretched out his arms to draw her to him but he embraced only the empty air 
 
 the dryad had been carried away like a on the wind 
 before her she saw a flame in the air a flashing light high up on a 
 tower the beacon light shone from the goal of her longing shone from the red lighthouse tower of the fata morgana of the champ de mars 
 
 thither she was carried by the wind she circled round the tower 
 the workmen thought it was a butterfly that had come too early and 
 that now sank down dying 
 
 the moon shone bright spread light around through 
 the halls over the buildings scattered about over the 
 and the rocks produced by human ingenuity from which 
 waterfalls driven by the power of master bloodless fell down 
 the caverns of the sea the depths of the lakes the kingdom of the 
 fishes were opened here men walked as in the depths of the deep pond and held converse with the sea in the of glass the water pressed against the strong glass walls above and on every side 
 the polypi living creatures had fastened themselves to the 
 bottom and stretched out arms fathoms long for prey a big turbot 
 was making himself broad in front quietly enough but not without 
 casting some suspicious glances aside a crab clambered over him 
 looking like a gigantic spider while the shrimps wandered about in 
 restless haste like the butterflies and moths of the sea 
 
 in the fresh water grew nymphaea and reeds the 
 stood up below in rank and file all turning their heads 
 one way that the streaming water might flow into their mouths fat 
 carps stared at the glass wall with stupid eyes they knew that they 
 were here to be exhibited and that they had made the somewhat 
 toilsome journey hither in tubs filled with water and they thought 
 with dismay of the from which they had suffered so 
 cruelly on the railway 
 
 they had come to see the exhibition and now contemplated it 
 from their fresh or position they looked attentively at 
 the crowds of people who passed by them early and late all the 
 nations in the world they thought had made an exhibition of their 
 inhabitants for the edification of the soles and haddocks pike and 
 carp that they might give their opinions upon the different kinds 
 those are scaly animals said a little slimy whiting they put 
 on different scales two or three times a day and they emit sounds 
 which they call speaking we put on scales and we make 
 ourselves understood in an easier way simply by twitching the corners of our mouths and staring with our eyes we have a great many advantages over mankind 
 
 but they have learned swimming of us remarked a 
 codling you must know i come from the great sea outside in the 
 hot time of the year the people yonder go into the water first they 
 take off their scales and then they swim they have learnt from the 
 frogs to kick out with their hind legs and row with their fore 
 paws but they cannot hold out long they want to be like us but they cannot come up to us poor people 
 
 and the fishes stared they thought that the whole swarm of people 
 whom they had seen in the bright daylight were still moving around 
 them they were certain they still saw the same forms that had first 
 caught their attention 
 
 a pretty barbel with spotted skin and an enviably round back 
 declared that the human fry were still there 
 
 i can see a well human figure quite well said the 
 barbel she was called contumacious lady or something of that 
 kind she had a mouth and staring eyes like ours and a great balloon 
 at the back of her head and something like a umbrella in 
 front there were a lot of dangling bits of seaweed hanging about her 
 she ought to take all the rubbish off and go as we do then she would look something like a respectable barbel so far as it is possible for a person to look like one 
 
 become of that one whom they drew away with the hook he sat on a and had paper and pen and ink and wrote 
 down everything they called him a writer 
 
 going about with him still said a hoary old maid of a 
 carp who carried her misfortune about with her so that she was quite hoarse in her youth she had once swallowed a hook and still swam patiently about with it in her gullet a writer that means as we fishes describe it a kind of cuttle or among men 
 thus the fishes gossipped in their own way but in the artificial the laborers were busy who were obliged to take advantage of the hours of night to get their work done by daybreak they accompanied with blows of their hammers and with songs the parting words of the vanishing dryad 
 
 so at any rate i have seen you you pretty she 
 said yes i know you and she waved her hand to them i have known about you a long time in my home the swallow told me about you how beautiful you are how delicate and shining i should like to kiss every one of you you others also i know you all but you do not know me 
 
 the fishes stared out into the twilight they did not understand a 
 word of it 
 
 the dryad was there no longer she had been a long time in the 
 open air where the different countries the country of black bread 
 the codfish coast the kingdom of russia leather and the banks of 
 and the gardens of rose oil exhaled their perfumes 
 from the flower 
 
 when after a night at a ball we drive home half asleep and 
 half awake the melodies still sound plainly in our ears we hear 
 them and could sing them all from memory when the eye of the 
 murdered man closes the picture of what it saw last clings to it 
 for a time like a photographic picture 
 
 so it was likewise here the bustling life of day had not yet 
 disappeared in the quiet night the dryad had seen it she knew 
 thus it will be repeated tomorrow 
 
 the dryad stood among the fragrant roses and thought she knew 
 them and had seen them in her own home she also saw red 
 pomegranate flowers like those that little mary had worn in her 
 dark hair 
 
 remembrances from the home of her childhood flashed through her 
 thoughts her eyes eagerly drank in the prospect around and 
 feverish restlessness chased her through the halls 
 a weariness that increased continually took possession of her 
 she felt a longing to rest on the soft oriental carpets within or 
 to lean against the weeping willow without by the clear water but for 
 the ephemeral fly there was no rest in a few moments the day had 
 completed its circle 
 
 her thoughts trembled her limbs trembled she sank down on the 
 grass by the bubbling water 
 
 thou wilt ever spring living from the earth she said 
 mournfully moisten my tongue bring me a refreshing draught 
 
 i am no living water was the answer i only spring upward when 
 the machine wills it 
 
 give me something of thy freshness thou green grass implored 
 the dryad give me one of thy fragrant flowers 
 
 we must die if we are torn from our stalks replied the 
 flowers and the grass 
 
 give me a kiss thou fresh stream of air only a single 
 
 
 soon the sun will kiss the clouds red answered the wind 
 
 then thou wilt be among the dead blown away as all the splendor 
 here will be blown away before the year shall have ended then i can 
 play again with the light loose sand on the place here and whirl 
 the dust over the land and through the air all is dust 
 
 the dryad felt a terror like a woman who has cut asunder her 
 in the bath but is filled again with the love of life 
 even while she is bleeding to death she raised herself tottered 
 forward a few steps and sank down again at the entrance to a little 
 church the gate stood open lights were burning upon the altar and 
 the organ sounded 
 
 what music such notes the dryad had never yet heard and yet it 
 seemed to her as if she recognized a number of voices among them they came deep from the heart of all creation she thought she heard the stories of the old clergyman of great deeds and of the celebrated names and of the gifts that the creatures of god must bestow upon posterity if they would live on in the world 
 the tones of the organ swelled and in their song there sounded 
 these words 
 
 thy wishing and thy longing have torn thee with thy roots 
 from the place which god appointed for thee that was thy destruction thou poor dryad 
 
 the notes became soft and gentle and seemed to die away in a 
 wail 
 
 in the sky the clouds showed themselves with a ruddy gleam the 
 wind sighed pass away ye dead now the sun is going to rise 
 
 the first ray fell on the dryad her form was irradiated in 
 changing colors like the when it is bursting and 
 becomes a drop of water like a tear that falls and passes away like a 
 vapor 
 
 poor dryad only a only a tear poured upon the earth 
 and vanished away 
 
 the end
