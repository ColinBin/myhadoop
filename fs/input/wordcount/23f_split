 harry looked around at the other two now mere outlines in the darkness he saw hermione point her wand set toward the outside but into his face there was a bang a burst of white light and he buckled in agony unable to see he could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him 
 
 get up vermin 
 
 unknown hands dragged harry roughly off the ground before he could stop them someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers tight swollen and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction his eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling ron and hermione outside too 
 
 get c off c her ron shouted there was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh ron grunted in pain and hermione screamed no leave him alone leave him alone 
 
 your boyfriends going to have worse than that done to him if hes on my list said the horribly familiar rasping voice delicious girl what a treat i do enjoy the softness of the skin 
 
 harrys stomach turned over he knew who this was fenrit greyback the werewolf who was permitted to wear death eater robes in return for his hired savagery 
 
 search the tent said another voice 
 
 harry was thrown face down onto the ground a thud told him that ron had been cast down beside him they could hear footsteps and crashes the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched 
 
 now lets see who weve got said greybacks gloating voice from overhead and harry was rolled over onto his back a beam of wand light fell onto his face and greyback laughed 
 
 ill be needing butterbeer to wash this one down what happened to you ugly 
 
 harry did not answer immediately 
 
 i said repeated greyback and harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain what happened to you 
 
 stung harry muttered been stung 
 
 yeah looks like it said a second voice 
 
 whats your name snarled greyback 
 
 dudley said harry 
 
 and your first name 
 
 i c vernon vernon dudley

 stan shunpike said ron 
 
 like ell you are said the man called scabior we know stan shunpike es put a bit of work our way 
 
 there was another thud 
 
 ib bardy said ron and harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood bardy weasley 
 
 a weasley rasped greyback so youre related to blood traitors even if youre not a mudblood and lastly your pretty little friend the relish in his voice made harrys flesh crawl 
 
 easy greyback said scabior over the jeering of the others 
 
 oh im not going to bite just yet well see if shes a bit quicker at remembering her name than barny who are you girly 
 
 penelope clearwater said hermione she sounded terrified but convincing 
 
 whats your blood status 
 
 said hermione 
 
 easy enough to check said scabior but the ole lot of em look like they could still be ogwarts age c 
 
 web lebt said ron 
 
 left ave you ginger said scabior and you decided to go camping and you thought just for a laugh youd use the dark lords name 
 
 nod a laugh said ron aggiden 
 
 accident there was more jeering laughter 
 
 you know who used to like using the dark lords name weasley growled greyback the order of the phoenix mean anything to you 
 
 doh 
 
 well they dont show the dark lord proper respect so the names been tabooed a few order members have been tracked that way well see bind them up with the other two prisoners 
 
 someone yanked harry up by the hair dragged him a short way pushed him down into a sitting position then started binding him with other people harry was still half blind barely able to see anything through his eyes when at last the man tying then had walked away harry whispered to the other prisoners 
 
 anyone still got a wand 
 
 no said ron and hermione from either side of him 
 
 this is all my fault i said the name im sorry c 
 
 harry 
 
 it was a new but familiar voice and it came from directly behind harry from the person tied to hermiones left 
 
 dean 
 
 it is you if they find out who theyve got theyre snatchers theyre only looking for truants to sell for gold c 
 
 not a bad little haul for one night greyback was saying as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent a mudblood a runaway goblin and these truants you checked their names on the list yet scabior he roared 
 
 yeah theres no vernon dudley un ere greyback 
 
 interesting said greyback thats interesting 
 
 he crouched down beside harry who saw through the infinitesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers with pointed brown teeth and sores in the corners of his mouth greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where dumbledore had died of dirt sweat and blood 
 
 so you arent wanted then vernon or are you on that list under a different name what house were you in at hogwarts 
 
 slytherin said harry automatically 
 
 funny ow they all thinks we wants to ear that leered scabior out of the shadows but none of em can tell us where the common room is 
 
 its in the dungeons said harry clearly you enter through the wall its full of skulls and stuff and its under the lake so the lights all green 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 well well looks like we really ave caught a little slytherin said scabior good for you vernon cause there aint a lot of mudblood slytherins whos your father 
 
 he works at the ministry harry lied he knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation but on the other hand he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case department of magical accidents and catastrophes 
 
 you know what greyback said scabior i think there is a dudley in there 
 
 harry could barely breathe could luck sheer luck get them safely out of this 
 
 well well said greyback and harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice and knew that greyback was wondering whether he had just indeed just attacked and bound the son of a ministry official harrys heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs he would not have been surprised to know that greyback could see it if youre telling the truth ugly youve got nothing to fear from a trip to the ministry i expect your fatherll reward us just for picking you up 
 
 but said harry his mouth bone dry if you just let us c 
 
 hey came a shout from inside the tent look at this greyback 
 
 a dark figure came bustling toward them and harry saw a glint of silver to the light of their wands they had found gryffindors sword 
 
 nice said greyback appreciatively taking it from his companion oh very nice indeed looks that where did you get something like this 
 
 its my fathers harry lied hoping against hope that it was too dark for greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt we borrowed it to cut firewood c 
 
 ang on a minute greyback look at this in the prophet 
 
 as scabior said it harrys scar which was stretched tight across his distended forehead burned savagely more clearly than he could make out anything around him he saw a towering building a grim fortress and forbidding voldemorts thoughts had suddenly become again he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose 
 
 so close so close with a huge effort of will harry closed his mind to voldemorts thoughts pulling himself back to where he sat tied to ron hermione dean and griphook in the darkness listening to greyback and scabior 
 
 hermione granger scabior was saying the mudblood who is known to be traveling with arry potter 
 
 harrys scar burned in the silence but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present nor to slip into voldemorts mind he heard the creak of greybacks boots as he crouched down in front of hermione 
 
 you know what little girly this picture looks a hell of a lot like you 
 
 it isnt it isnt me 
 
 hermiones terrified squeak was as good as a confession 
 
 known to be traveling with harry potter repeated greyback quietly 
 
 a stillness had settled over the scene harrys scar was exquisitely painful but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of voldemorts thoughts it had never been so important to remain in his own right mind 
 
 well this changed things doesnt it whispered greyback nobody spoke harry sensed the gang of snatchers watching frozen and felt hermiones arm trembling against his greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where harry sat crouching down again to stare closely at his misshapen features 
 
 whats that on your forehead vernon he asked softly his breath foul in harrys nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taught scar 
 
 dont touch it harry yelled he could not stop himself he thought he might be sick from the pain of it 
 
 i thought you wore glasses potter breathed greyback 
 
 i found glasses yelped one of the snatchers skulking in the background there was glasses in the tent greyback wait c 
 
 and seconds later harrys glasses had been rammed back onto his face the snatchers were closing in now peering at him 
 
 it is rasped greyback weve caught potter 
 
 they all took several steps backward stunned by what they had done harry still fighting to remain present in his own splitting head could think of nothing to say fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind 
 
 che was hiding around the high walls of the black fortressc 
 
 no he was harry tied up and wandless in grave dangerc 
 
 clooking up up to the topmost window the highest towerc 
 
 he was harry and they were discussing his fate in low voicesc 
 
 ctime to fly 
 
 to the ministry 
 
 to hell with the ministry growled greyback theyll take the credit and we wont get a look in i say we take him straight to 
 
 will you summon im ere said scabior sounding awed terrified 
 
 no snarled greyback i havent got c they say hes using the malfoys place as a base well take the boy there 
 
 harry thought he knew why greyback was not calling voldemort the werewolf might be allowed to wear death eater robes when they wanted to use him but only voldemorts inner circle were branded with the dark mark greyback had not been granted this highest honor 
 
 harrys scar seared again c 
 
 c and he rose into the night flying straight up to the windows at the very top of the tower c 
 
 completely sure its him cause if it aint greyback were dead 
 
 whos in charge here roared greyback covering his moment of inadequacy i say thats potter and him plus his wand thats two hundred thousand galleons right there but if youre too gutless to come along any of you its all for me and with any luck ill get the girl thrown in 
 
 c the window was the merest slit in the black rock not big enough for a man to enter a skeletal figure was just visible through it curled beneath a blanket dead or sleeping 
 
 all right said scabior all right were in and what about the rest of em greyback whatll we do with em 
 
 might as well take the lot weve got two mudbloods thats another ten galleons give me the sword as well if theyre rubies thats another small fortune right there 
 
 the prisoners were dragged to their feet harry could hear hermiones breathing fast and terrified 
 
 grab hold and make it tight ill do potter said greyback seizing a fistful of harrys hair harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp on three one c two c three c 
 
 they disapparated pulling the prisoners with them harry struggled trying to throw off greybacks hand but it was hopeless ron and hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side he could not separate from the group and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still c 
 
 c as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed lightly as vapor inside the room c 
 
 the prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane harrys eyes still puffy took a moment to acclimatize then he saw a pair of gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive he experienced the tiniest trickle of relief the worst had not happened yet voldemort was not here he was harry knew for he was fighting to resist the vision in some strange fortresslike place at the top of a tower how long it would take voldemort to get to this place once he knew that harry was here was another matter 
 
 one of the snatchers strode to the gates and shook them 
 
 how do we get in theyre locked greyback i cant c blimey 
 
 he whipped his hands away in fright the iron was contorting twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face which spoke in a clanging echoing voice state your purpose 
 
 weve got potter greyback roared triumphantly weve captured harry potter 
 
 the gates swung open 
 
 come on said greyback to his men and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the drive between high hedges that muffled their footsteps harry saw a ghostly white shape above him and realized it was an albino peacock he stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by greyback now he was staggering along sideways tied to the four other prisoner closing his puffy eyes he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a moment wanting to know what voldemort was doing whether he knew yet that harry was caught 
 
 the emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him eyes opening in a skull of a face the frail man sat up great sunken eyes fixed upon him upon voldemort and then he smiled most of his teeth were gone 
 
 so you have come i thought you would one day but your journey was pointless i never had it 
 
 you lie 
 
 as voldemorts anger throbbed inside him harrys scar threatened to burst with pain and he wrenched his mind back to his own body fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel 
 
 light spilled out over all of them 
 
 what is this said a womans cold voice 
 
 were here to see rasped greyback 
 
 who are you 
 
 you know me there was resentment in the werewolfs voice fenrit greyback weve caught harry potter 
 
 greyback seized harry and dragged him around to face the light forcing the other prisoners to shuffle around too 
 
 i know es swollen maam but its im piped up scabior if you look a bit closer youll see is scar and this ere see the girl the mudblood whos been traveling around with im maam theres no doubt its im and weve got is wand as well ere maam c 
 
 through his puffy eyelids harry saw narcissa malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her she raised her eyebrows 
 
 bring them in she said 
 
 harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits 
 
 follow me said narcissa leading the way across the hall my son draco is home for his easter holidays if that is harry potter he will know 
 
 the drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside even with his eyes almost closed harry could make out the wide proportions of the room a crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling more portraits against the dark purple walls two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the snatchers 
 
 what is this 
 
 the dreadfully familiar drawling voice of lucius malfoy fell on harrys ears he was panicking now he could see no way out and it was easier as his fear mounted to block out voldemorts thoughts though his scar was still burning 
 
 they say theyve got potter said narcissas cold voice draco come here 
 
 harry did not dare look directly at draco but saw him obliquely a figure slightly taller than he was rising from an armchair his face a pale and pointed blur beneath hair 
 
 greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place harry directly beneath the chandelier 
 
 well boy rasped the werewolf 
 
 harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace a great gilded thing in an intricately scrolled frame through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time since leaving grimmauld place 
 
 his face was huge shiny and pink every feature distorted by hermiones jinx his black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw had he not known that it was he who stood there he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses he resolved not to speak for his voice was sure to give him away yet he still avoided eye contact with draco as the latter approached 
 
 well draco said lucius malfoy he sounded avid is it is it harry potter 
 
 i cant c i cant be sure said draco he was keeping his distance from greyback and seemed as scared of looking at harry as harry was of looking at him 
 
 but look at him carefully look come closer 
 
 harry had never heard lucius malfoy so excited 
 
 draco if we are the ones who hand potter over to the dark lord everything will be forgiv c 
 
 now we wont be forgetting who actually caught him i hope mr malfoy said greyback menacingly 
 
 of course not of course not said lucius impatiently he approached harry himself came so close that harry could see the usually languid pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes with his face a puffy mask harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a cage 
 
 what did you do to him lucius asked greyback how did he get into this state 
 
 that wasnt us 
 
 looks more like a stinging jinx to me said lucius 
 
 his gray eyes raked harrys forehead 
 
 theres something there he whispered it could be the scar stretched tight 
 
 draco come here look properly what do you think 
 
 harry saw dracos face up close now right beside his fathers they were extraordinarily alike except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement dracos expression was full of reluctance even fear 
 
 i dont know he said and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching 
 
 we had better be certain lucius narcissa called to her husband in her cold clear voice completely sure that it is potter before we summon the dark lord they say this is his c she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand c but it does not resemble ollivanders description if we are mistaken if we call the dark lord here for nothing remember what he did to rowle and dolohov 
 
 what about the mudblood then growled greyback harry was nearly thrown off his feet as the snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again so that the light fell on hermione instead 
 
 wait said narcissa sharply yes c yes she was in madam malkins with potter i saw her picture in the prophet look draco isnt it the granger girl 
 
 i maybe yeah 
 
 but then thats the weasley boy shouted lucius striding around the bound prisoners to face ron its them potters friends c draco look at him isnt it arthur weasleys son whats his name c 
 
 yeah said draco again his back to the prisoners it could be 
 
 the drawing room door opened behind harry a woman spoke and the sound of the voice wound harrys fear to an even higher pitch 
 
 what is this whats happened cissy 
 
 bellatrix lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners and stopped on harrys right staring at hermione through her heavily lidded eyes but surely she said quietly this is the mudblood girl this is grander 
 
 yes yes its granger cried lucius and beside her we think potter potter and his friends caught at last 
 
 potter shrieked bellatrix and she backed away the better to take in harry 
 
 are you sure well then the dark lord must be informed at once 
 
 she dragged back her left sleeve harry saw the dark mark burned into the flesh of her arm and knew that she was about to touch it to summon her beloved masterc 
 
 i was about to call him said lucius and his hand actually closed upon bellatrixs wrist preventing her from touching the mark i shall summon him bella potter has been brought to my house and it is therefore upon my authority c 
 
 your authority she sneered attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp you lost your authority when you lost your wand lucius how dare you take your hands off me 
 
 this is nothing to do with you you did not capture the boy c 
 
 begging your pardon mr malfoy interjected greyback but its us that caught potter and its us thatll be claiming the gold c 
 
 gold laughed bellatrix still attempting to throw off her her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand take your gold filthy scavenger what do i want with gold i seek only the honor of his c of c 
 
 she stopped struggling her dark eyes fixed upon something harry could not see jubilant at her capitulation lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve c 
 
 stop shrieked bellatrix do not touch it we shall all perish if the dark lord comes now 
 
 lucius froze his index finger hovering over his own mark bellatrix strode out of harrys limited line of vision 
 
 what is that he heard her say 
 
 sword grunted an snatcher 
 
 give it to me 
 
 its not yours missus its mine i reckon i found it 
 
 there was a bang and a flash of red light harry knew that the snatcher had been stunned there was a roar of anger from his fellows scabior drew his wand 
 
 what dyou think youre playing at woman 
 
 stupefy she screamed stupefy 
 
 they were no match for her even thought there were four of them against one of her she was a witch as harry knew with prodigious skill and no conscience they fell where they stood all except greyback who had been forced into a kneeling position his arms outstretched out of the corners of his eyes harry saw bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf the sword of gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand her face waxen 
 
 where did you get this sword she whispered to greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip 
 
 how dare you he snarled his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze up at her he bared his pointed teeth release me woman 
 
 where did you find this sword she repeated brandishing it in his face snape sent it to my vault in gringotts 
 
 it was in their tent rasped greyback release me i say 
 
 she waved her wand and the werewolf sprang to his feet but appeared too wary to approach her he prowled behind an armchair his filthy curved nails clutching its back 
 
 draco move this scum outside said bellatrix indicating the unconscious men if you havent got the guts to finish them then leave them in the courtyard for me 
 
 dont you dare speak to draco like c said narcissa furiously but bellatrix screamed 
 
 be quiet the situation is graver than you can possibly imagine cissy we have a very serious problem 
 
 she stood panting slightly looking down at the sword examining its hilt then she turned to look at the silent prisoners 
 
 if it is indeed potter he must not be harmed she muttered more to herself than to the others the dark lord wishes to dispose of potter himself but if he finds out i must i must know 
 
 she turned back to her sister again 
 
 the prisoners must be placed in the cellar while i think what to do 
 
 this is my house bella you dont give orders in my c 
 
 do it you have no idea of the danger were in shrieked bellatrix she looked frightening mad a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet 
 
 narcissa hesitated for a moment then addressed the werewolf 
 
 take these prisoners down to the cellar greyback 
 
 wait said bellatrix sharply all except except for the mudblood 
 
 greyback gave a grunt of pleasure 
 
 no shouted ron you can have me keep me 
 
 bellatrix hit him across the face the blow echoed around the room 
 
 if she dies under questioning ill take you next she said blood traitor is next to mudblood in my book take them downstairs greyback and make sure they are secure but do nothing more to them c yet 
 
 she threw greybacks wand back to him then took a short silver knife from under her robes she cut hermione free from the other prisoners then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room while greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door into a dark passageway his wand held out in front of him projecting an invisible and irresistible force 
 
 reckon shell let me have a bit of the girl when shes finished with her greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor id say ill get a bite or two wouldnt you ginger 
 
 harry could feel ron shaking they were forced down a steep flight of stairs still tied and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment at the bottom was a heavy door greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness the echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible drawn out scream from directly above them 
 
 hermione ron bellowed and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying them together so that harry staggered hermione 
 
 be quiet harry said shut up ron we need to work out a way c 
 
 hermione hermione 
 
 we need a plan stop yelling c we need to get these ropes off c 
 
 harry came a whisper through the darkness ron is that you 
 
 ron stopped shouting there was a sound of movement close by them then harry saw a shadow moving closer 
 
 harry ron 
 
 luna 
 
 yes its me oh no i didnt want you to be caught 
 
 luna can you help us get these ropes off said harry 
 
 oh yes i expect so theres an old nail we use if we need to break anything just a moment 
 
 hermione screamed again from overhead and they could hear bellatrix screaming too but her words were inaudible for ron shouted again hermione hermione 
 
 mr ollivander harry could hear luna saying mr ollivander have you got the nail if you just move over a little bit i think it was beside the water jug 
 
 she was back within seconds 
 
 youll need to stay still she said 
 
 harry could feel her digging at the ropes tough fibers to work the knots free from upstairs they heard bellatrixs voice 
 
 im going to ask you again where did you get this sword where 
 
 we found it c we found it c please hermione screamed again ron struggled harder than ever and the rusty nail slipped onto harrys wrist 
 
 ron please stay still luna whispered i cant see what im doing c 
 
 my pocket said ron in my pocket theres a deluminator and its full of light 
 
 a few seconds later there was a click and the luminescent spheres the deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar unable to rejoin their sources they simply hung there like tiny suns flooding the underground room with light harry saw luna all eyes in her white face and the motionless figure of ollivander the wandmaker curled up on the floor in the corner craning around he caught sight of their fellow prisoners dean and griphook the goblin who seemed barely conscious kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans 
 
 oh thats much easier thanks ron said luna and she began hacking at their bindings again hello dean 
 
 from above came bellatrixs voice 
 
 youre lying filthy mudblood and i know it you have been inside my vault at gringotts tell the truth tell the truth 
 
 another terrible screamc 
 
 hermione 
 
 what else did you take what else have you got tell me the truth or i swear i shall run you through with this knife 
 
 there 
 
 harry felt the ropes fall away and turned rubbing his wrists to see ron running around the cellar looking up at the low ceiling searching for a trapdoor dean his face bruised and bloody said thanks to luna and stood there shivering but griphook sank onto the cellar floor looking groggy and disoriented many welts across his swarthy face 
 
 ron was now trying to disapparate without a wand 
 
 theres no way out ron said luna watching his fruitless efforts the cellar is completely i tried at first mr ollivander has been here for a long time hes tried everything 
 
 hermione was screaming again the sound went through harry like physical pain barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar he too started to run around the cellar feeling the walls for he hardly knew what knowing in his heart that it was useless 
 
 what else did you take what else answer me crucio 
 
 hermiones screams echoed off the walls upstairs ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists and harry in utter desperation seized hagrids pouch from around his neck and groped inside it he pulled out dumbledores snitch and shook it hoping for he did not know what c nothing happened c he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand but they were lifeless c the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor and he saw a gleam of brightest blue c 
 
 dumbledores eye was gazing at him out of the mirror 
 
 help us he yelled at it in mad desperation were in the cellar of malfoy manor help us 
 
 the eye blinked and was gone 
 
 harry was not even sure that it had really been there he tilted the shard of mirror this way and that and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison and upstairs hermione was screaming worse than ever and next to him ron was bellowing hermione hermione 
 
 how did you get into my vault they heard bellatrix scream did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you 
 
 we only met him tonight hermione sobbed weve never been inside your vault it isnt the real sword its a copy just a copy 
 
 a copy screeched bellatrix oh a likely story 
 
 but we can find out easily came luciuss voice draco fetch the goblin he can tell us whether the sword is real or not 
 
 harry dashed across the cellar to where griphook was huddled on the floor 
 
 griphook he whispered into the goblins pointed ear you must tell them that swords a fake they mustnt know its the real one griphook please c 
 
 he could hear someone scuttling own the cellar steps next moment dracos shaking voice spoke from behind the door 
 
 stand back line up against the back wall dont try anything or ill kill you 
 
 they did as they were bidden as the lock turned ron clicked the deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket restoring the cellars darkness the door flew open malfoy marched inside wand held out in front of him pale and determined he seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again dragging griphook with him the door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar 
 
 ron clicked the deluminator three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket revealing dobby the who had just apparated into their midst 
 
 dob c 
 
 harry hit ron on the arm to stop him shouting and ron looked terrified at his mistake footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead draco marching griphook to bellatrix 
 
 dobbys enormous shaped eyes were wide he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears he was back in the home of his old masters and it was clear that he was petrified 
 
 harry potter he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice dobby has come to rescue you 
 
 but how did you c 
 
 an awful scream drowned harrys words hermione was being tortured again he cut to the essentials 
 
 you can disapparate out of this cellar he asked dobby who nodded his ears flapping 
 
 and you can take humans with you 
 
 dobby nodded again 
 
 right dobby i want you to grab luna dean and mr ollivander and take them c take them to c 
 
 bill and fleurs said ron shell cottage on the outskirts of tinworth 
 
 the elf nodded for a third time 
 
 and then come back said harry can you do that dobby 
 
 of course harry potter whispered the little elf he hurried over to mr ollivander who appeared to be barely conscious he took one of the wandmakers hands in his own then held out the other to luna and dean neither of whom moved 
 
 harry we want to help you luna whispered 
 
 we cant leave you here said dean 
 
 go both of you well see you at bill and fleurs 
 
 as harry spoke his scar burned worse than ever and for a few seconds he looked down not upon the wandmaker but on another man who was just as old just as thin but laughing scornfully 
 
 kill me then voldemort i welcome death but my death will not bring you what you seek there is so much you do not understand 
 
 he felt voldemorts fury but as hermione screamed again he shut it out returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present 
 
 go harry beseeched to luna and dean go well follow just go 
 
 they caught hold of the elfs outstretched fingers there was another loud crack and dobby luna dean and ollivander vanished 
 
 what was that shouted lucius malfoy from over their heads did you hear that what was that noise in the cellar 
 
 harry and ron stared at each other 
 
 draco c no call wormtail make him go and check 
 
 footsteps crossed the room overhead then there was silence harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar 
 
 were going to have to try and tackle him he whispered to ron they had no choice the moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners they were lost leave the lights on harry added and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door they backed against the wall on either side of it 
 
 stand back came wormtails voice stand away from the door im coming in 
 
 the door flew open for a split second wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair then harry and ron launched themselves upon him ron seized wormtails wand arm and forced it upwards harry slapped a hand to his mouth muffling his voice silently they struggled wormtails wand emitted sparks his silver hand closed around harrys throat 
 
 what is it wormtail called lucius malfoy from above 
 
 nothing ron called back in a passable imitation of wormtails wheezy voice all fine 
 
 harry could barely breathe 
 
 youre going to kill me harry choked attempting to prise off the metal fingers after i saved your life you owe me wormtail 
 
 the silver fingers slackened harry had not expected it he wrenched himself free astonished keeping his hand over wormtails mouth he saw the ratlike mans small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise he seemed just as shocked as harry at what his hand had done at the tiny merciful impulse it had betrayed and he continued to struggle more powerfully as though to undo that moment of weakness 
 
 and well have that whispered ron tugging wormtails wand from his other hand 
 
 wandless helpless pettigrews pupils dilated in terror his eyes had slid from harrys face to something else his own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat 
 
 no c 
 
 without pausing to think harry tried to drag back the hand but there was no stopping it the silver tool that voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation his moment of pity he was being strangled before their eyes 
 
 no 
 
 ron had released wormtail too and together he and harry tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around wormtails throat but it was no use pettigrew was turning blue 
 
 relashio said ron pointing the wand at the silver hand but nothing happened pettigrew dropped to his knees and at the same moment hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead wormtails eyes rolled upward in his purple face he gave a last twitch and was still 
 
 harry and ron looked at each other then leaving wormtails body on the floor behind them ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door which was ajar now they had a clear view of bellatrix looking down at griphook who was holding gryffindors sword in his hands hermione was lying at bellatrixs feet she was barely stirring 
 
 well bellatrix said to griphook is it the true sword 
 
 harry waited holding his breath fighting against the prickling of his scar 
 
 no said griphook it is a fake 
 
 are you sure panted bellatrix quite sure 
 
 yes said the goblin 
 
 relief broke across her face all tension drained from it 
 
 good she said and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the goblins face and he dropped with a yell at her feet she kicked him aside and now she said in a voice that burst with triumph we call the dark lord 
 
 and she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the dark mark 
 
 at once harrys scar felt as though it had split open again his true surroundings vanished he was voldemort and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him he was enraged at the summons he felt c he had warned them he had told them to summon him for nothing less than potter if they were mistaken 
 
 kill me then demanded the old man you will not win you cannot win that wand will never ever be yours c 
 
 and voldemorts fury broke a burst of green light filled the prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back lifeless and voldemort returned to the window his wrath barely controllable they would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back 
 
 and i think said bellatrixs voice we can dispose of the mudblood greyback take her if you want her 
 
 noooooooooooo 
 
 ron had burst into the drawing room bellatrix looked around shocked she turned her wand to face ron instead c 
 
 expelliarmus he roared pointing wormtails wand at bellatrix and hers flew into the air and was caught by harry who had sprinted after ron lucius narcissa draco and greyback wheeled about harry yelled stupefy and lucius malfoy collapsed onto the hearth jets of light flew from dracos narcissas and greybacks wands harry threw himself to the floor rolling behind a sofa to avoid them 
 
 stop or she dies 
 
 panting harry peered around the edge of the sofa bellatrix was supporting hermione who seemed to be unconscious and was holding her short silver knife to hermiones throat 
 
 drop your wands she whispered drop them or well see exactly how filthy her blood is 
 
 ron stood rigid clutching wormtails wand harry straightened up still holding bellatrixs 
 
 i said drop them she screeched pressing the blade into hermiones throat harry saw beads of blood appear there 
 
 all right he shouted and he dropped bellatrixs wand onto the floor at his feet ron did the same with wormtails both raised their hands to shoulder height 
 
 good she leered draco pick them up the dark lord is coming harry potter your death approaches 
 
 harry knew it his scar was bursting with the pain of it and he could feel voldemort flying through the sky from far away over a dark and stormy sea and soon he would be close enough to apparate to them and harry could see no way out 
 
 now said bellatrix softly as draco hurried back to her with the wands cissy i think we ought to tie these little heroes up again while greyback takes care of miss mudblood i am sure the dark lord will not begrudge you the girl greyback after what you have done tonight 
 
 at the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above all of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble then with a creak and an ominous jingling it began to fall bellatrix was directly beneath it dropping hermione she threw herself aside with a scream the chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains falling on top of hermione and the goblin who still clutched the sword of gryffindor glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions draco doubled over his hands covering his bloody face 
 
 as ron ran to pull hermione out of the wreckage harry took the chance he leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from dracos grip pointed all of them at greyback and yelled stupefy the werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground 
 
 as narcissa dragged draco out of the way of further harm bellatrix sprang to her feet her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife but narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway 
 
 dobby she screamed and even bellatrix froze you you dropped the chandelier c 
 
 the tiny elf trotted into the room his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress 
 
 you must not hurt harry potter he squeaked 
 
 kill him cissy shrieked bellatrix but there was another loud crack and narcissas wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room 
 
 you dirty little monkey bawled bellatrix how dare you take a witchs wand how dare you defy your masters 
 
 dobby has no master squealed the elf dobby is a free elf and dobby has come to save harry potter and his friends 
 
 harrys scar was blinding him with pain dimly he knew that they had moments seconds before voldemort was with them 
 
 ron catch c and go he yelled throwing one of the wands to him then he bent down to tug griphook out from under the chandelier hoisting the groaning goblin who still clung to the sword over one shoulder harry seized dobbys hand and spun on the spot to disapparate 
 
 as he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the pale frozen figures of narcissa and draco of the streak of red that was rons hair and a blue of flying silver as bellatrixs knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing c 
 
 bill and fleurs shell cottage bill and fleurs 
 
 he had disappeared into the unknown all he could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice to take him there the pain in his forehead pierced him and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him he could feel the blade of gryffindors sword bumping against his back dobbys hand jerked in his he wondered whether the elf was trying to take charge to pull them in the right direction and tried by squeezing the fingers to indicate that that was fine with them 
 
 and then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air harry fell to his knees relinquished dobbys hand and attempted to lower griphook gently to the ground 
 
 are you all right he said as the goblin stirred but griphook merely whimpered 
 
 harry squinted around through the darkness there seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky and he thought he saw movement outside it 
 
 dobby is this shell cottage he whispered clutching the two wands he had brought from the malfoys ready to fight if he needed to have we come to the right place dobby 
 
 he looked around the little elf stood feet from him 
 
 dobby 
 
 the elf swayed slightly stars reflected in his wide shining eyes together he and harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elfs heaving chest 
 
 dobby c no c help harry bellowed toward the cottage toward the people moving there help 
 
 he did not know or care whether they were wizards or muggles friends or foes all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across dobbys front and that he had stretched out his own arms to harry with a look of supplication harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass 
 
 dobby no dont die dont die c 
 
 the elfs eyes found him and his lips trembled with the effort to form words 
 
 harry potter 
 
 and then with a little shudder the elf became quite still and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows
