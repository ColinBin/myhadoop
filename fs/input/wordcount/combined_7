 chapter vii 
 
 in which will be found the origin of the saying 
 lose the card 
 this is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay jean valjean 
 when the hearse had driven off when the priest and the choir boy had entered the carriage again and taken their departure fauchelevent who had not taken his eyes from the saw the latter bend over and grasp his shovel which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt 
 then fauchelevent took a supreme resolve 
 he placed himself between the grave and the crossed his arms and said 
 i am the one to pay 
 the stared at him in amazement and replied 
 that peasant 
 fauchelevent repeated 
 i am the one who pays 
 what 
 for the wine 
 what wine 
 that argenteuil wine 
 where is the argenteuil 
 at the bon coing 
 go to the devil said the 
 and he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin 
 the coffin gave back a hollow sound 
 fauchelevent felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself he shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle 
 comrade 
 before the bon coing is shut 
 the took some more earth on his shovel fauchelevent continued 
 i will pay 
 and he seized the arm 
 listen to me comrade 
 i am the convent i have come to help you 
 it is a business which can be performed at night let us begin then by going for a drink 
 and as he spoke and clung to this desperate insistence this melancholy reflection occurred to him 
 and if he drinks will he get drunk 
 provincial said the man if you positively insist upon it i consent 
 we will drink 
 after work never before 
 and he flourished his shovel briskly 
 fauchelevent held him back 
 it is argenteuil wine at six 
 oh come said the you are a ding dong ding dong all you know how to say 
 go hang yourself 
 and he threw in a second shovelful 
 fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was saying 
 come along and drink he cried since it is i who pays the bill 
 when we have put the child to bed said the 
 he flung in a third shovelful 
 then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added 
 cold you see and the corpse would shriek out after us if we were to plant her there without a coverlet 
 at that moment as he loaded his shovel the bent over and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped 
 wild gaze fell mechanically into that pocket and there it stopped 
 the sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket 
 the sum total of lightning that the eye of a picard peasant can contain traversed pupils 
 an idea had just occurred to him 
 he thrust his hand into the pocket from behind without the who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth observing it and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it 
 the man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave 
 just as he turned round to get the fifth fauchelevent looked calmly at him and said 
 by the way you new man have you your card 
 the paused 
 what card 
 the sun is on the point of setting 
 good it is going to put on its nightcap 
 the gate of the cemetery will close immediately 
 well what then 
 have you your card 
 ah my card said the 
 and he fumbled in his pocket 
 having searched one pocket he proceeded to search the other he passed on to his fobs explored the first returned to the second 
 why no said he i have not my card 
 i must have forgotten it 
 fifteen francs fine said fauchelevent 
 the turned green 
 green is the pallor of livid people 
 ah 
 he exclaimed fifteen francs fine 
 
 with the moon 
 
 three pieces of a hundred sous said fauchelevent 
 the dropped his shovel 
 turn had come 
 ah come now conscript said fauchelevent none of this despair there is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave fifteen francs is fifteen francs and besides you may not be able to pay it 
 i am an old hand you are a new one 
 i know all the ropes and the devices 
 i will give you some friendly advice one thing is clear the sun is on the point of setting it is touching the dome now the cemetery will be closed in five minutes more 
 that is true replied the man 
 five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave it is as hollow as the devil this grave and to reach the gate in season to pass it before it is shut 
 that is true 
 in that case a fine of fifteen francs 
 fifteen francs 
 but you have time 
 where do you live 
 a couple of steps from the barrier a quarter of an hour from here no rue de vaugirard 
 you have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best speed 
 that is exactly so 
 once outside the gate you gallop home you get your card you return the cemetery porter admits you 
 as you have your card there will be nothing to pay 
 and you will bury your corpse watch it for you in the meantime so that it shall not run away 
 i am indebted to you for my life peasant 
 decamp said fauchelevent 
 the overwhelmed with gratitude shook his hand and set off on a run 
 when the man had disappeared in the thicket fauchelevent listened until he heard his footsteps die away in the distance then he leaned over the grave and said in a low tone 
 father madeleine 
 there was no reply 
 fauchelevent was seized with a shudder 
 he tumbled rather than climbed into the grave flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried 
 are you there 
 silence in the coffin 
 fauchelevent hardly able to draw his breath for trembling seized his cold chisel and his hammer and pried up the coffin lid 
 jean face appeared in the twilight it was pale and his eyes were closed 
 hair rose upright on his head he sprang to his feet then fell back against the side of the grave ready to swoon on the coffin 
 he stared at jean valjean 
 jean valjean lay there pallid and motionless 
 fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh 
 he is dead 
 and drawing himself up and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders he cried 
 and this is the way i save his life 
 then the poor man fell to sobbing 
 he soliloquized the while for it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural powerful emotion often talks aloud 
 it is father fault 
 why did that fool die 
 what need was there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting it 
 it is he who has killed m madeleine father madeleine 
 he is in the coffin 
 it is quite handy all is over 
 now is there any sense in these things ah my god he is dead 
 well and his little girl what am i to do with her 
 what will the say 
 the idea of its being possible for a man like that to die like this when i think how he put himself under that cart 
 father madeleine father madeleine 
 pardine 
 he was suffocated i said so he believe me 
 well 
 a pretty trick to play he is dead that good man the very best man out of all the good good folks 
 and his little girl 
 ah 
 in the first place i go back there myself 
 i shall stay here 
 after having done such a thing as that 
 the use of being two old men if we are two old fools 
 but in the first place how did he manage to enter the convent 
 that was the beginning of it all one should not do such things 
 father madeleine 
 father madeleine father madeleine 
 madeleine 
 monsieur madeleine 
 monsieur le maire he does not hear me 
 now get out of this scrape if you can 
 and he tore his hair 
 a grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance it was the cemetery gate closing 
 fauchelevent bent over jean valjean and all at once he bounded back and recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit 
 jean eyes were open and gazing at him 
 to see a corpse is alarming to behold a resurrection is almost as much so 
 fauchelevent became like stone pale haggard overwhelmed by all these excesses of emotion not knowing whether he had to do with a living man or a dead one and staring at jean valjean who was gazing at him 
 i fell asleep said jean valjean 
 and he raised himself to a sitting posture 
 fauchelevent fell on his knees 
 just good virgin 
 how you frightened me 
 then he sprang to his feet and cried 
 thanks father madeleine 
 jean valjean had merely fainted 
 the fresh air had revived him 
 joy is the ebb of terror 
 fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty in recovering himself as jean valjean had 
 so you are not dead 
 oh 
 how wise you are 
 i called you so much that you came back 
 when i saw your eyes shut i said good there he is stifled i should have gone raving mad mad enough for a strait jacket 
 they would have put me in bicetre what do you suppose i should have done if you had been dead and your little girl 
 that would never have understood it 
 the child is thrust into your arms and then the grandfather is dead 
 what a story good saints of paradise what a tale 
 ah you are alive the best of it 
 i am cold said jean valjean 
 this remark recalled fauchelevent thoroughly to reality and there was pressing need of it 
 the souls of these two men were troubled even when they had recovered themselves although they did not realize it and there was about them something uncanny which was the sinister bewilderment inspired by the place 
 let us get out of here quickly exclaimed fauchelevent 
 he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a gourd with which he had provided himself 
 but first take a drop said he 
 the flask finished what the fresh air had begun jean valjean swallowed a mouthful of brandy and regained full possession of his faculties 
 he got out of the coffin and helped fauchelevent to nail on the lid again 
 three minutes later they were out of the grave 
 moreover fauchelevent was perfectly composed 
 he took his time the cemetery was closed 
 the arrival of the gribier was not to be apprehended 
 that conscript was at home busily engaged in looking for his card and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings since it was in pocket without a card he could not get back into the cemetery 
 fauchelevent took the shovel and jean valjean the and together they buried the empty coffin 
 when the grave was full fauchelevent said to jean valjean 
 let us go 
 i will keep the shovel do you carry off the mattock 
 night was falling 
 jean valjean experienced rome difficulty in moving and in walking he had stiffened himself in that coffin and had become a little like a corpse 
 the rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks 
 he had in a manner to thaw out from the tomb 
 you are benumbed said fauchelevent 
 it is a pity that i have a game leg for otherwise we might step out briskly 
 bah replied jean valjean four paces will put life into my legs once more 
 they set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed on arriving before the closed gate and the pavilion fauchelevent who held the card in his hand dropped it into the box the porter pulled the rope the gate opened and they went out 
 how well everything is going said fauchelevent what a capital idea that was of yours father madeleine 
 they passed the vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world in the neighborhood of the cemetery a shovel and pick are equal to two passports 
 the rue vaugirard was deserted 
 father madeleine said fauchelevent as they went along and raising his eyes to the houses your eyes are better than mine show me no 
 here it is said jean valjean 
 there is no one in the street said fauchelevent 
 give me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me 
 fauchelevent entered no ascended to the very top guided by the instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret and knocked in the dark at the door of an attic 
 a voice replied 
 come in 
 it was voice 
 fauchelevent opened the door 
 the dwelling was like all such wretched habitations an unfurnished and encumbered garret a coffin the place of a commode a served for a a straw mattress served for a bed the floor served instead of tables and chairs 
 in a corner on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a heap 
 the whole of this interior bore traces of having been overturned one would have said that there had been an earthquake for one the covers were displaced the rags scattered about the jug broken the mother had been crying the children had probably been beaten traces of a vigorous and search 
 it was plain that the had made a desperate search for his card and had made everybody in the garret from the jug to his wife responsible for its loss 
 he wore an air of desperation 
 but fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to take any notice of this sad side of his success 
 he entered and said 
 i have brought you back your shovel and pick 
 gribier gazed at him in stupefaction 
 is it you peasant 
 and morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery 
 and he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor 
 what is the meaning of this demanded gribier 
 the meaning of it is that you dropped your card out of your pocket that i found it on the ground after you were gone that i have buried the corpse that i have filled the grave that i have done your work that the porter will return your card to you and that you will not have to pay fifteen francs 
 there you have it conscript 
 thanks villager exclaimed gribier radiant 
 the next time i will pay for the drinks

 book eight 
 chapter i 
 
 after prince andrews engagement to natasha pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man to which he had devoted himself with such ardor all the zest of such a life vanished after the engagement of andrew and natasha and the death of joseph alexeevich the news of which reached him almost at the same time only the skeleton of life remained his house a brilliant wife who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage acquaintance with all petersburg and his court service with its dull formalities and this life suddenly seemed to pierre unexpectedly loathsome he ceased keeping a diary avoided the company of the brothers began going to the club again drank a great deal and came once more in touch with the bachelor sets leading such a life that the countess helene thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it pierre felt that she right and to avoid compromising her went away to moscow 
 in moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and fading princesses still lived with its enormous retinue as soon as driving through the town he saw the iberian shrine with innumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons the kremlin square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles the sleigh drivers and hovels of the sivtsev vrazhok those old moscovites who desired nothing hurried nowhere and were ending their days leisurely when he saw those old moscow ladies the moscow balls and the english club he felt himself at home in a quiet haven in moscow he felt at peace at home warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown 
 moscow society from the old women down to the children received pierre like a guest whose place was always ready awaiting him for moscow society pierre was the nicest kindest most intellectual merriest and most magnanimous of cranks a heedless genial nobleman of the old russian type his purse was always empty because it was open to everyone 
 benefit performances poor pictures statues benevolent societies gypsy choirs schools subscription dinners sprees freemasons churches and books no one and nothing met with a refusal from him and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and taken him under their protection he would have given everything away there was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him as soon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of margaux he was surrounded and talking disputing and joking began when there were quarrels his kindly smile and jests reconciled the antagonists the masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not there 
 when after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere with them shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men at balls he danced if a partner was needed young ladies married and unmarried liked him because without making love to any of them he was equally amiable to all especially after supper il est charmant il pas de sexe they said of him 
 he is charming he has no sex 
 pierre was one of those retired of whom there were hundreds ending their days in moscow 
 how horrified he would have been seven years before when he first arrived from abroad had he been told that there was no need for him to seek or plan anything that his rut had long been shaped eternally predetermined and that wriggle as he might he would be what all in his position were he could not have believed it had he not at one time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in russia then himself to be a napoleon then to be a philosopher and then a strategist and the conqueror of napoleon had he not seen the possibility of and passionately desired the regeneration of the sinful human race and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs 
 but instead of all that here he was the wealthy husband of an unfaithful wife a retired fond of eating and drinking and as he unbuttoned his waistcoat of abusing the government a bit a member of the moscow english club and a universal favorite in moscow society for a long time he could not reconcile himself to the idea that he was one of those same retired moscow he had so despised seven years before 
 sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living this life temporarily but then he was shocked by the thought of how many like himself had entered that life and that club temporarily with all their teeth and hair and had only left it when not a single tooth or hair remained 
 in moments of pride when he thought of his position it seemed to him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired he had formerly despised they were empty stupid contented fellows satisfied with their position while i am still discontented and want to do something for mankind but perhaps all these comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new a path in life of their own and like me were brought by force of circumstances society and race by that elemental force against which man is powerless to the condition i am in said he to himself in moments of humility and after living some time in moscow he no longer despised but began to grow fond of to respect and to pity his comrades in destiny as he pitied himself 
 pierre longer suffered moments of despair hypochondria and disgust with life but the malady that had formerly found expression in such acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment what for why what is going on in the world he would ask himself in perplexity several times a day involuntarily beginning to reflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life but knowing by experience that there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away from them and took up a book or hurried of to the club or to apollon to exchange the gossip of the town 
 helene who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one of the stupidest women in the world thought pierre is regarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement and they pay homage to her napoleon bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great but now that he has become a wretched comedian the emperor francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage the spaniards through the catholic clergy offer praise to god for their victory over the french on the fourteenth of june and the french also through the catholic clergy offer praise because on that same fourteenth of june they defeated the spaniards my brother masons swear by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor and they intrigue the astraea lodge against the manna seekers and fuss about an authentic scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not understand we all profess the christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors the law in honor of which we have built in moscow forty times forty churches but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness a priest gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution so thought pierre and the whole of this general deception which everyone accepts accustomed as he was to it astonished him each time as if it were something new i understand the deception and confusion he thought but how am i to tell them all that i see i have tried and have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand it as i do and only try not to see it so it appears that it must be so but i what is to become of me thought he he had the unfortunate capacity many men especially russians have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part in it every sphere of work was connected in his eyes with evil and deception whatever he tried to be whatever he engaged in the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity yet he had to live and to find occupation it was too dreadful to be under the burden of these insoluble problems so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them he frequented every kind of society drank much bought pictures engaged in building and above all read 
 he read and read everything that came to hand on coming home while his valets were still taking off his things he picked up a book and began to read from reading he passed to sleeping from sleeping to gossip in drawing rooms of the club from gossip to carousals and women from carousals back to gossip reading and wine drinking became more and more a physical and also a moral necessity though the doctors warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him he drank a great deal he was only quite at ease when having poured several glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant warmth in his body an amiability toward all his fellows and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it deeply only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought he was always conscious of some aspect of that skein as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read but under the influence of wine he said to himself it matter get it unraveled i have a solution ready but have no time now think it all out later on but the later on never came 
 in the morning on an empty stomach all the old questions appeared as insoluble and terrible as ever and pierre hastily picked up a book and if anyone came to see him he was glad 
 sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when entrenched under the fire if they have nothing to do try hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger to pierre all men seemed like those soldiers seeking refuge from life some in ambition some in cards some in framing laws some in women some in toys some in horses some in politics some in sport some in wine and some in governmental affairs nothing is trivial and nothing is important all the same only to save oneself from it as best one can thought pierre only not to see it that dreadful it

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter viii 
 
 a successful interrogatory 
 an hour later in the darkness of night two men and a child presented themselves at no rue the elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped 
 they were fauchelevent jean valjean and cosette 
 the two old men had gone to fetch cosette from the in the rue du where fauchelevent had deposited her on the preceding day 
 cosette had passed these hours trembling silently and understanding nothing 
 she trembled to such a degree that she wept 
 she had neither eaten nor slept the worthy had plied her with a hundred questions without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days 
 she divined that they were passing through a crisis she was deeply conscious that it was necessary to be good who has not experienced the sovereign power of those two words pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a terrified little being say nothing 
 fear is mute 
 moreover no one guards a secret like a child 
 but when at the expiration of these lugubrious hours she beheld jean valjean again she gave vent to such a cry of joy that any thoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry would have guessed that it issued from an abyss 
 fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the all the doors opened 
 thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in 
 the porter who had received his instructions opened the little door which connected the courtyard with the garden and which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago in the wall at the bottom of the court which faced the carriage entrance 
 the porter admitted all three of them through this door and from that point they reached the inner reserved parlor where fauchelevent on the preceding day had received his orders from the prioress 
 the prioress rosary in hand was waiting for them 
 a vocal mother with her veil lowered stood beside her 
 a discreet candle lighted one might almost say made a show of lighting the parlor 
 the prioress passed jean valjean in review 
 there is nothing which examines like a downcast eye 
 then she questioned him 
 you are the brother 
 yes reverend mother replied fauchelevent 
 what is your name 
 fauchelevent replied 
 ultime fauchelevent 
 he really had had a brother named ultime who was dead 
 where do you come from 
 fauchelevent replied 
 from picquigny near amiens 
 what is your age 
 fauchelevent replied 
 fifty 
 what is your profession 
 fauchelevent replied 
 gardener 
 are you a good christian 
 fauchelevent replied 
 every one is in the family 
 is this your little girl 
 fauchelevent replied 
 yes reverend mother 
 you are her father 
 fauchelevent replied 
 her grandfather 
 the vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice 
 he answers well 
 jean valjean had not uttered a single word 
 the prioress looked attentively at cosette and said half aloud to the vocal mother 
 she will grow up ugly 
 the two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor then the prioress turned round and said 
 father fauvent you will get another with a bell two will be required now 
 on the following day therefore two bells were audible in the garden and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their veils 
 at the extreme end of the garden under the trees two men fauvent and another man were visible as they dug side by side 
 an enormous event 
 their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other 
 he is an assistant gardener 
 the vocal mothers added 
 he is a brother of father fauvent 
 jean valjean was in fact regularly installed he had his belled henceforth he was official 
 his name was ultime fauchelevent 
 the most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the observation upon cosette 
 she will grow up ugly 
 the prioress that pronounced prognosticator immediately took a fancy to cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil 
 there is nothing that is not strictly logical about this 
 it is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent women are conscious of their faces now girls who are conscious of their beauty do not easily become nuns the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their good looks more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty 
 hence a lively taste for plain girls 
 the whole of this adventure increased the importance of good old fauchelevent he won a triple success in the eyes of jean valjean whom he had saved and sheltered in those of gribier who said to himself 
 he spared me that fine with the convent which being enabled thanks to him to retain the coffin of mother crucifixion under the altar eluded caesar and satisfied god there was a coffin containing a body in the and a coffin without a body in the vaugirard cemetery public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby but no one was aware of it 
 as for the convent its gratitude to fauchelevent was very great fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners 
 upon the occasion of the next visit the prioress recounted the affair to his grace making something of a confession at the same time and yet boasting of her deed on leaving the convent the archbishop mentioned it with approval and in a whisper to m de latil confessor afterwards archbishop of reims and cardinal 
 this admiration for fauchelevent became widespread for it made its way to rome we have seen a note addressed by the then reigning pope leo xii to one of his relatives a monsignor in the establishment in paris and bearing like himself the name of della genga it contained these lines 
 it appears that there is in a convent in paris an excellent gardener who is also a holy man named fauvent nothing of this triumph reached fauchelevent in his hut he went on grafting weeding and covering up his melon beds without in the least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity neither did he suspect his glory any more than a durham or surrey bull whose portrait is published in the london illustrated news with this inscription 
 bull which carried off the prize at the cattle show

 book eight 
 chapter ii 
 
 at the beginning of winter prince nicholas bolkonski and his daughter moved to moscow at that time enthusiasm for the emperor regime had weakened and a patriotic and tendency prevailed there and this together with his past and his intellect and his originality at once made prince nicholas bolkonski an object of particular respect to the moscovites and the center of the moscow opposition to the government 
 the prince had aged very much that year he showed marked signs of senility by a tendency to fall asleep forgetfulness of quite recent events remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with which he accepted the role of head of the moscow opposition in spite of this the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful veneration especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his coat and powdered wig and aroused by anyone told his abrupt stories of the past or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms of the present for them all that house with its gigantic mirrors furniture powdered footmen and the stern shrewd old man himself a relic of the past century with his gentle daughter and the pretty frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle but the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw their host there were also hours in the day during which the private and intimate life of the house continued 
 latterly that private life had become very trying for princess mary there in moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures talks with the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at bald hills and she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not go out into society everyone knew that her father would not let her go anywhere without him and his failing health prevented his going out himself so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties she had quite abandoned the hope of getting married she saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the young men possible suitors who sometimes appeared at their house she had no friends during this visit to moscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to her mademoiselle bourienne with whom she had never been able to be quite frank had now become unpleasant to her and for various reasons princess mary avoided her julie with whom she had corresponded for the last five years was in moscow but proved to be quite alien to her when they met just then julie who by the death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in moscow was in the full whirl of society pleasures she was surrounded by young men who she fancied had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or never on thursdays princess mary remembered with a mournful smile that she now had no one to write to since julie whose presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week like the old emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his evenings for years she regretted presence and having no one to write to in moscow princess mary had no one to talk to no one to whom to confide her sorrow and much sorrow fell to her lot just then the time for prince return and marriage was approaching but his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out in fact it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless for at every mention of the young countess rostova the old prince who apart from that was usually in a bad temper lost control of himself another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six nephew to her consternation she detected in herself in relation to little nicholas some symptoms of her irritability however often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew almost every time that pointer in hand she sat down to show him the french alphabet she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child who was already afraid that auntie might at any moment get angry that at his slightest inattention she trembled became flustered and heated raised her voice and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner having put him in the corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel evil nature and little nicholas following her example would sob and without permission would leave his corner come to her pull her wet hands from her face and comfort her but what distressed the princess most of all was her irritability which was always directed against her and had of late amounted to cruelty had he forced her to prostrate herself to the ground all night had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard but this loving despot the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason tormented himself and her knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately but to show her that she was always to blame for everything of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented princess mary more than anything else this was his intimacy with mademoiselle bourienne the idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of his intentions had occurred to him in jest that if andrew got married he himself would marry bourienne had evidently pleased him and latterly he had persistently and as it seemed to princess mary merely to offend her shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of bourienne 
 one day in moscow in princess presence she thought her father did it purposely when she was there the old prince kissed mademoiselle hand and drawing her to him embraced her affectionately princess mary flushed and ran out of the room a few minutes later mademoiselle bourienne came into princess room smiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice princess mary hastily wiped away her tears went resolutely up to mademoiselle bourienne and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste at the frenchwoman her voice breaking horrible vile inhuman to take advantage of the weakness she did not finish leave my room she exclaimed and burst into sobs 
 next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter but she noticed that at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne should be served first after dinner when the footman handed coffee and from habit began with the princess the prince suddenly grew furious threw his stick at philip and instantly gave instructions to have him conscripted for the army 
 he obey i said it twice and he obey she is the first person in this house my best friend cried the prince and if you allow yourself he screamed in a fury addressing princess mary for the first time to forget yourself again before her as you dared to do yesterday i will show you who is master in this house go let me set eyes on you beg her pardon 
 princess mary asked mademoiselle pardon and also her pardon for herself and for philip the footman who had begged for her intervention 
 at such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her soul and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his spectacles in her presence fumbling near them and not seeing them or would forget something that had just occurred or take a false step with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness or worst of all at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him would suddenly fall asleep letting his napkin drop and his shaking head sink over his plate he is old and feeble and i dare to condemn him she thought at such moments with a feeling of revulsion against herself

 book take that which is committed them 
 chapter ix 
 
 cloistered 
 cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent 
 it was quite natural that cosette should think herself jean daughter 
 moreover as she knew nothing she could say nothing and then she would not have said anything in any case 
 as we have just observed nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness cosette had suffered so much that she feared everything even to speak or to breathe 
 a single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her 
 she had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with jean valjean 
 she speedily became accustomed to the convent 
 only she regretted catherine but she dared not say so 
 once however she did say to jean valjean father if i had known i would have brought her away with me 
 cosette had been obliged on becoming a scholar in the convent to don the garb of the pupils of the house 
 jean valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside this was the same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted the thenardiers inn 
 it was not very threadbare even now jean valjean locked up these garments plus the stockings and the shoes with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound in a little valise which he found means of procuring he set this valise on a chair near his bed and he always carried the key about his person 
 father cosette asked him one day what is there in that box which smells so good 
 father fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action in addition to the glory which we just mentioned and of which he knew nothing in the first place it made him happy next he had much less work since it was shared 
 lastly as he was very fond of snuff he found the presence of m madeleine an advantage in that he used three times as much as he had done previously and that in an infinitely more luxurious manner seeing that m madeleine paid for it 
 the nuns did not adopt the name of ultime they called jean valjean the other fauvent 
 if these holy women had possessed anything of glance they would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done outside in the behalf of the garden it was always the elder fauchelevent the old the infirm the lame man who went and never the other but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on god know not how to spy or whether they were by preference occupied in keeping watch on each other they paid no heed to this 
 moreover it was well for jean valjean that he kept close and did not stir out 
 javert watched the quarter for more than a month 
 this convent was for jean valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs 
 henceforth those four walls constituted his world he saw enough of the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity and cosette enough to remain happy 
 a very sweet life began for him 
 he inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden in company with fauchelevent 
 this hovel built of old rubbish which was still in existence in was composed as the reader already knows of three chambers all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls 
 the principal one had been given up by force for jean valjean had opposed it in vain to m madeleine by father fauchelevent 
 the walls of this chamber had for ornament in addition to the two nails whereon to hang the and the basket a royalist of applied to the wall over the and of which the following is an exact facsimile 
 
 graphic here 
 
 this specimen of vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by the preceding gardener an old chouan who had died in the convent and whose place fauchelevent had taken 
 jean valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very useful he had formerly been a pruner of trees and he gladly found himself a gardener once more 
 it will be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture 
 he turned these to advantage almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted and wild he budded them and made them produce excellent fruit 
 cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day as the sisters were melancholy and he was kind the child made comparisons and adored him 
 at the appointed hour she flew to the hut when she entered the lowly cabin she filled it with paradise jean valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded cosette 
 the joy which we inspire has this charming property that far from growing meagre like all reflections it returns to us more radiant than ever at recreation hours jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest 
 for cosette laughed now 
 face had even undergone a change to a certain extent the gloom had disappeared from it 
 a smile is the same as sunshine it banishes winter from the human countenance 
 recreation over when cosette went into the house again jean valjean gazed at the windows of her and at night he rose to look at the windows of her dormitory 
 god has his own ways moreover the convent contributed like cosette to uphold and complete the work in jean valjean 
 it is certain that virtue adjoins pride on one side 
 a bridge built by the devil exists there 
 jean valjean had been unconsciously perhaps tolerably near that side and that bridge when providence cast his lot in the convent of the so long as he had compared himself only to the bishop he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in general and pride was beginning to spring up who knows 
 he might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred 
 the convent stopped him on that downward path 
 this was the second place of captivity which he had seen in his youth in what had been for him the beginning of his life and later on quite recently again he had beheld another a frightful place a terrible place whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of justice and the crime of the law now after the galleys he saw the cloister and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys and that he now so to speak was a spectator of the cloister he confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety 
 sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe and slowly descended the endless spirals of revery 
 he recalled his former companions 
 how wretched they were they rose at dawn and toiled until night hardly were they permitted to sleep they lay on camp beds where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches thick in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of the year they were clothed in frightful red blouses they were allowed as a great favor linen trousers in the hottest weather and a woollen blouse on their backs when it was very cold they drank no wine and ate no meat except when they went on fatigue duty 
 they lived nameless designated only by numbers and converted after a manner into ciphers themselves with downcast eyes with lowered voices with shorn heads beneath the cudgel and in disgrace 
 then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes 
 these beings also lived with shorn heads with downcast eyes with lowered voices not in disgrace but amid the scoffs of the world not with their backs bruised with the cudgel but with their shoulders lacerated with their discipline 
 their names also had vanished from among men they no longer existed except under austere appellations they never ate meat and they never drank wine they often remained until evening without food they were attired not in a red blouse but in a black shroud of woollen which was heavy in summer and thin in winter without the power to add or subtract anything from it without having even according to the season the resource of the linen garment or the woollen cloak and for six months in the year they wore serge chemises which gave them fever 
 they dwelt not in rooms warmed only during rigorous cold but in cells where no fire was ever lighted they slept not on mattresses two inches thick but on straw 
 and finally they were not even allowed their sleep every night after a day of toil they were obliged in the weariness of their first slumber at the moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm to rouse themselves to rise and to go and pray in an and gloomy chapel with their knees on the stones 
 on certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve successive hours in a kneeling posture or prostrate with face upon the pavement and arms outstretched in the form of a cross 
 the others were men these were women 
 what had those men done 
 they had stolen violated pillaged murdered assassinated 
 they were bandits counterfeiters poisoners incendiaries murderers parricides 
 what had these women done 
 they had done nothing whatever 
 on the one hand highway robbery fraud deceit violence sensuality homicide all sorts of sacrilege every variety of crime on the other one thing only innocence 
 perfect innocence almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious assumption attached to the earth by virtue already possessing something of heaven through holiness 
 on the one hand confidences over crimes which are exchanged in whispers on the other the confession of faults made aloud and what crimes 
 and what faults 
 on the one hand miasms on the other an ineffable perfume on the one hand a moral pest guarded from sight penned up under the range of cannon and literally devouring its victims on the other the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth there darkness here the shadow but a shadow filled with gleams of light and of gleams full of radiance 
 two strongholds of slavery but in the first deliverance possible a legal limit always in sight and then escape 
 in the second perpetuity the sole hope at the distant extremity of the future that faint light of liberty which men call death 
 in the first men are bound only with chains in the other chained by faith 
 what flowed from the first 
 an immense curse the gnashing of teeth hatred desperate viciousness a cry of rage against human society a sarcasm against heaven 
 what results flowed from the second 
 blessings and love 
 and in these two places so similar yet so unlike these two species of beings who were so very unlike were undergoing the same work expiation 
 jean valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former that personal expiation the expiation for self 
 but he did not understand that of these last that of creatures without reproach and without stain and he trembled as he asked himself the expiation of what 
 what expiation 
 a voice within his conscience replied 
 the most divine of human generosities the expiation for others 
 here all personal theory is withheld we are only the narrator we place ourselves at jean point of view and we translate his impressions 
 before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation the highest possible pitch of virtue the innocence which pardons men their faults and which expiates in their stead servitude submitted to torture accepted punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned for the sake of sparing it to souls which have fallen the love of humanity swallowed up in the love of god but even there preserving its distinct and mediatorial character sweet and feeble beings possessing the misery of those who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed 
 and he remembered that he had dared to murmur 
 often in the middle of the night he rose to listen to the grateful song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities and the blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly chastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy and that he wretch that he was had shaken his fist at god 
 there was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply like a warning whisper from providence itself 
 the scaling of that wall the passing of those barriers the adventure accepted even at the risk of death the painful and difficult ascent all those efforts even which he had made to escape from that other place of expiation he had made in order to gain entrance into this one 
 was this a symbol of his destiny 
 this house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to that other one whence he had fled and yet he had never conceived an idea of anything similar 
 again he beheld gratings bolts iron guard whom 
 angels 
 these lofty walls which he had seen around tigers he now beheld once more around lambs 
 this was a place of expiation and not of punishment and yet it was still more austere more gloomy and more pitiless than the other 
 these virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts a cold harsh wind that wind which had chilled his youth traversed the barred and padlocked grating of the vultures a still harsher and more biting breeze blew in the cage of these doves 
 why 
 when he thought on these things all that was within him was lost in amazement before this mystery of sublimity 
 in these meditations his pride vanished 
 he scrutinized his own heart in all manner of ways he felt his pettiness and many a time he wept 
 all that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him back towards the holy injunctions cosette through love the convent through humility 
 sometimes at eventide in the twilight at an hour when the garden was deserted he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which skirted the chapel in front of the window through which he had gazed on the night of his arrival and turned towards the spot where as he knew the sister was making reparation prostrated in prayer thus he prayed as he knelt before the sister 
 it seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before god 
 everything that surrounded him that peaceful garden those fragrant flowers those children who uttered joyous cries those grave and simple women that silent cloister slowly permeated him and little by little his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister of perfume like the flowers of simplicity like the women of joy like the children 
 and then he reflected that these had been two houses of god which had received him in succession at two critical moments in his life 
 the first when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him the second at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit of him and when the galleys were again yawning and that had it not been for the first he should have relapsed into crime and had it not been for the second into torment 
 his whole heart melted in gratitude and he loved more and more 
 many years passed in this manner cosette was growing up

 book eight 
 chapter iii 
 
 in there was living in moscow a french doctor metivier who had rapidly become the fashion he was enormously tall handsome amiable as frenchmen are and was as all moscow said an extraordinarily clever doctor he was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor but as an equal 
 prince nicholas had always ridiculed medicine but latterly on mademoiselle advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and had grown accustomed to him metivier came to see the prince about twice a week 
 on december st nicholas day and the name day all moscow came to the front door but he gave orders to admit no one and to invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom he gave to princess mary 
 metivier who came in the morning with his felicitations considered it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne as he told princess mary and went in to see the prince it happened that on that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods he had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed querulousness which generally culminated in a burst of rage and she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion until the arrival the morning had passed off safely after admitting the doctor princess mary sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she could hear all that passed in the study 
 to force the guard 
 at first she heard only voice then her then both voices began speaking at the same time the door was flung open and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified metivier with his shock of black hair and the prince in his dressing gown and fez his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards 
 you understand shouted the prince but i do french spy slave of buonaparte spy get out of my house be off i tell you 
 metivier shrugging his shoulders went up to mademoiselle bourienne who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room 
 the prince is not very well bile and rush of blood to the head keep calm i will call again tomorrow said metivier and putting his fingers to his lips he hastened away 
 through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry spies traitors traitors everywhere not a peace in my own house 
 after departure the old prince called his daughter in and the whole weight of his wrath fell on her she was to blame that a spy had been admitted had he not told her yes told her to make a list and not to admit anyone who was not on that list then why was that scoundrel admitted she was the cause of it all with her he said he could not have a peace and could not die quietly 
 no we must part we must part understand that understand it i cannot endure any more he said and left the room then as if afraid she might find some means of consolation he returned and trying to appear calm added and imagine i have said this in a moment of anger i am calm i have thought it over and it will be carried out we must part so find some place for yourself but he could not restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves is capable evidently suffering himself he shook his fists at her and screamed 
 if only some fool would marry her then he slammed the door sent for mademoiselle bourienne and subsided into his study 
 at two the six chosen guests assembled for dinner 
 these guests the famous count rostopchin prince lopukhin with his nephew general chatrov an old war comrade of the and of the younger generation pierre and boris drubetskoy awaited the prince in the drawing room 
 boris who had come to moscow on leave a few days before had been anxious to be presented to prince nicholas bolkonski and had contrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house 
 the house did not belong to what is known as fashionable society but his little circle though not much talked about in town was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other boris had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in his presence invited rostopchin to dinner on st nicholas day and rostopchin had replied that he could not come 
 on that day i always go to pay my devotions to the relics of prince nicholas bolkonski 
 oh yes yes replied the commander in chief how is he 
 the small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a court of justice all were silent or talked in low tones prince nicholas came in serious and taciturn princess mary seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual the guests were reluctant to address her feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation count rostopchin alone kept the conversation going now relating the latest town news and now the latest political gossip 
 lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation prince bolkonski listened as a presiding judge receives a report only now and then silently or by a brief word showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him the tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political world incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse but whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped or was stopped at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself 
 at dinner the talk turned on the latest political news seizure of the duke of territory and the russian note hostile to napoleon which had been sent to all the european courts 
 bonaparte treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel said count rostopchin repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before one only wonders at the or blindness of the crowned heads now the turn has come and bonaparte scruple to depose the head of the catholic church yet all keep silent our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the duke of territory and even count rostopchin paused feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was impossible 
 other territories have been offered in exchange for the duchy of oldenburg said prince bolkonski he shifts the dukes about as i might move my serfs from bald hills to bogucharovo or my ryazan estates 
 the duke of oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of character and resignation remarked boris joining in respectfully 
 he said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the honor of being presented to the duke prince bolkonski glanced at the young man as if about to say something in reply but changed his mind evidently considering him too young 
 i have read our protests about the oldenburg affair and was surprised how badly the note was worded remarked count rostopchin in the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him 
 pierre looked at rostopchin with naive astonishment not understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the note 
 does it matter count how the note is worded he asked so long as its substance is forcible 
 my dear fellow with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy to have a good style returned count rostopchin 
 pierre now understood the dissatisfaction with the wording of the note 
 one would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up remarked the old prince there in petersburg they are always writing not notes only but even new laws my andrew there has written a whole volume of laws for russia nowadays they are always writing and he laughed unnaturally 
 there was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general cleared his throat to draw attention 
 did you hear of the last event at the review in petersburg the figure cut by the new french ambassador 
 eh yes i heard something he said something awkward in his presence 
 his majesty drew attention to the grenadier division and to the march past continued the general and it seems the ambassador took no notice and allowed himself to reply that we in france pay no attention to such trifles the emperor did not condescend to reply at the next review they say the emperor did not once deign to address him 
 all were silent on this fact relating to the emperor personally it was impossible to pass any judgment 
 impudent fellows said the prince you know metivier i turned him out of my house this morning he was here they admitted him spite of my request that they should let no one in he went on glancing angrily at his daughter 
 and he narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and the reasons that convinced him that metivier was a spy though these reasons were very insufficient and obscure no one made any rejoinder 
 after the roast champagne was served the guests rose to congratulate the old prince princess mary too went round to him 
 he gave her a cold angry look and offered her his wrinkled cheek to kiss the whole expression of his face told her that he had not forgotten the talk that his decision remained in force and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to her now 
 when they went into the drawing room where coffee was served the old men sat together 
 prince nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the impending war 
 he said that our wars with bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we sought alliances with the germans and thrust ourselves into european affairs into which we had been drawn by the peace of tilsit we ought not to fight either for or against austria our political interests are all in the east and in regard to bonaparte the only thing is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy and he will never dare to cross the russian frontier as was the case in 
 how can we fight the french prince said count rostopchin can we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities look at our youths look at our ladies the french are our gods paris is our kingdom of heaven 
 he began speaking louder evidently to be heard by everyone 
 french dresses french ideas french feelings there now you turned metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a frenchman and a scoundrel but our ladies crawl after him on their knees i went to a party last night and there out of five ladies three were roman catholics and had the indulgence for doing woolwork on sundays and they themselves sit there nearly naked like the signboards at our public baths if i may say so ah when one looks at our young people prince one would like to take peter the old cudgel out of the museum and belabor them in the russian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them 
 all were silent the old prince looked at rostopchin with a smile and wagged his head approvingly 
 well your excellency keep well said rostopchin getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince 
 my dear fellow his words are music i never tire of hearing him said the old prince keeping hold of the hand and offering his cheek to be kissed 
 following example the others also rose

 he has no shirt on his body no shoes on his feet no roof over his head he is like the flies of heaven who have none of these things he is from seven to thirteen years of age he lives in bands roams the streets lodges in the open air wears an old pair of trousers of his which descend below his heels an old hat of some other father which descends below his ears a single suspender of yellow listing he runs lies in wait rummages about wastes time blackens pipes swears like a convict haunts the knows thieves calls gay women thou talks slang sings obscene songs and has no evil in his heart this is because he has in his heart a pearl innocence and pearls are not to be dissolved in mud

 book eight 
 chapter iv 
 
 princess mary as she sat listening to the old talk and faultfinding understood nothing of what she heard she only wondered whether the guests had all observed her hostile attitude toward her she did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities shown her during dinner by boris drubetskoy who was visiting them for the third time already 
 princess mary turned with questioning look to pierre who hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone in the drawing room 
 may i stay a little longer he said letting his stout body sink into an armchair beside her 
 oh yes she answered you noticed nothing her look asked 
 pierre was in an agreeable mood he looked straight before him and smiled quietly 
 have you known that young man long princess he asked 
 who 
 drubetskoy 
 no not long 
 do you like him 
 yes he is an agreeable young man why do you ask me that said princess mary still thinking of that conversation with her father 
 because i have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from petersburg to moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an heiress 
 you have observed that said princess mary 
 yes returned pierre with a smile and this young man now manages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too i can read him like a book at present he is hesitating whom to lay siege to you or mademoiselle julie karagina he is very attentive to her 
 he visits them 
 yes very often and do you know the new way of courting said pierre with an amused smile evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary 
 no replied princess mary 
 to please moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy he is very melancholy with mademoiselle karagina said pierre 
 really asked princess mary looking into kindly face and still thinking of her own sorrow it would be a relief thought she if i ventured to confide what i am feeling to someone i should like to tell everything to pierre he is kind and generous it would be a relief he would give me advice 
 would you marry him 
 oh my god count there are moments when i would marry anybody she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice ah how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that she went on in a trembling voice that you can do nothing for him but grieve him and to know that you cannot alter this then there is only one thing left to go away but where could i go 
 what is wrong what is it princess 
 but without finishing what she was saying princess mary burst into tears 
 i know what is the matter with me today take any notice forget what i have said 
 gaiety vanished completely he anxiously questioned the princess asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him but she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said that she did not remember what she had said and that she had no trouble except the one he knew of that prince marriage threatened to cause a rupture between father and son 
 have you any news of the rostovs she asked to change the subject i was told they are coming soon i am also expecting andrew any day i should like them to meet here 
 and how does he now regard the matter asked pierre referring to the old prince 
 princess mary shook her head 
 what is to be done in a few months the year will be up the thing is impossible i only wish i could spare my brother the first moments i wish they would come sooner i hope to be friends with her you have known them a long time said princess mary tell me honestly the whole truth what sort of girl is she and what do you think of her the real truth because you know andrew is risking so much doing this against his will that i should like to know 
 an undefined instinct told pierre that these explanations and repeated requests to be told the whole truth expressed on the princess part toward her future and a wish that he should disapprove of choice but in reply he said what he felt rather than what he thought 
 i know how to answer your question he said blushing without knowing why i really know what sort of girl she is i analyze her at all she is enchanting but what makes her so i know that is all one can say about her 
 princess mary sighed and the expression on her face said yes what i expected and feared 
 is she clever she asked 
 pierre considered 
 i think not he said and yet yes she does not deign to be clever oh no she is simply enchanting and that is all 
 princess mary again shook her head disapprovingly 
 ah i so long to like her tell her so if you see her before i do 
 i hear they are expected very soon said pierre 
 princess mary told pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future as soon as the rostovs arrived and to try to accustom the old prince to her

 of nobility 
 we will speak of nobility first as a portion of an estate then as a condition of 
 particular persons a monarchy where there is no nobility at all is ever a pure 
 and absolute tyranny as that of the turks for nobility attempers sovereignty and draws the eyes of me people somewhat aside from the line royal but for democracies they need it not and they are commonly more quiet and less subject to sedition then where there are stirps of nobles for eyes are upon the business and not upon the persons or if upon the persons it is for the business sake as fittest and not for flags and pedigree 
 we see the switzers last well notwithstanding their diversity of religion and of cantons for utility is their bond and not respects the united provinces of the low countries in their government excel for where there is an equality the consultations are more indifferent and the payments and tributes more cheerful a great and potent nobility addeth majesty to a monarch but diminisheth power and putteth life and spirit into the people but presseth their fortune it is well when nobles are not too great for sovereignty nor for justice and yet maintained in that height as the insolence of inferiors may be broken upon them before it come on too fast upon the majesty of kings 
 a numerous nobility causeth poverty and inconvenience in a state for it is a surcharge of expense and besides it being of necessity that many of the nobility fall in time to be weak in fortune it maketh a kind of disproportion between honour and means 
 as for nobility in particular persons it is a reverend thing to see an ancient castle or building not in decay or to see a fair timber tree sound and perfect how much more to behold an ancient noble family which hath stood against me waves and weathers of time 
 for new nobility is but the act of power but ancient nobility is the act of time those that are first raised to nobility are commonly more virtuous but less 
 innocent than their descendants for there is rarely any rising but by a of good and evil arts but it is reason the memory of their virtues remain to their posterity and their faults die with themselves 
 nobility of birth commonly abateth industry and he that is not industrious envieth him that is besides noble persons cannot go much higher and he that standeth at a stay when others rise can hardly avoid motions of envy on the other side nobility extinguished the passive envy from others towards them 
 because they are in possession of honour certainly kings that have able men of their nobility shall find ease in employing them and a better slide into their business for people naturally bend to them as born in some sort to command

 book just man 
 chapter xiii 
 
 what he believed 
 we are not obliged to sound the bishop of d on the score of orthodoxy 
 in the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect 
 the conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word 
 moreover certain natures being given we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own 
 what did he think of this dogma or of that mystery 
 these secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb where souls enter naked 
 the point on which we are certain is that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case 
 no decay is possible to the diamond he believed to the extent of his powers 
 credo in patrem he often exclaimed 
 moreover he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience and which whispers to a man thou art with god 
 the point which we consider it our duty to note is that outside of and beyond his faith as it were the bishop possessed an excess of love 
 in was in that quarter quia multum he loved he was regarded as vulnerable by serious men grave persons and reasonable people favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry what was this excess of love 
 it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men as we have already pointed out and which on occasion extended even to things 
 he lived without disdain he was indulgent towards creation 
 every man even the best has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals the bishop of d had none of that harshness which is peculiar to many priests nevertheless 
 he did not go as far as the brahmin but he seemed to have weighed this saying of ecclesiastes 
 who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth 
 hideousness of aspect deformity of instinct troubled him not and did not arouse his indignation 
 he was touched almost softened by them it seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which is apparent the cause the explanation or the excuse for them 
 he seemed at times to be asking god to commute these penalties 
 he examined without wrath and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest that portion of chaos which still exists in nature 
 this revery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings 
 one morning he was in his garden and thought himself alone but his sister was walking behind him unseen by him 
 suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground it was a large black hairy frightful spider 
 his sister heard him say 
 poor beast 
 it is not its fault 
 why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness puerile they may be but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to saint francis and of marcus aurelius 
 one day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant thus lived this just man 
 sometimes he fell asleep in his garden and then there was nothing more venerable possible 
 monseigneur bienvenu had formerly been if the stories anent his youth and even in regard to his manhood were to be believed a passionate and possibly a violent man 
 his universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life and had trickled there slowly thought by thought for in a character as in a rock there may exist apertures made by drops of water these hollows are uneffaceable these formations are indestructible 
 in as we think we have already said he reached his birthday but he did not appear to be more than sixty 
 he was not tall he was rather plump and in order to combat this tendency he was fond of taking long strolls on foot his step was firm and his form was but slightly bent a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion 
 gregory xvi at the age of eighty held himself erect and smiling which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop 
 monseigneur welcome had what the people term a fine head but so amiable was he that they forgot that it was fine 
 when he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms and of which we have already spoken people felt at their ease with him and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person 
 his fresh and ruddy complexion his very white teeth all of which he had preserved and which were displayed by his smile gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man a good fellow and of an old man he is a fine man 
 that it will be recalled was the effect which he produced upon napoleon 
 on the first encounter and to one who saw him for the first time he was nothing in fact but a fine man 
 but if one remained near him for a few hours and beheld him in the least degree pensive the fine man became gradually transfigured and took on some imposing quality i know not what his broad and serious brow rendered august by his white locks became august also by virtue of meditation majesty radiated from his goodness though his goodness ceased not to be radiant one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings without ceasing to smile 
 respect an unutterable respect penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart and one felt that one had before him one of those strong thoroughly tried and indulgent souls where thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle 
 as we have seen prayer the celebration of the offices of religion the consolation of the afflicted the cultivation of a bit of land fraternity frugality hospitality renunciation confidence study work filled every day of his life 
 filled is exactly the word certainly the day was quite full to the brim of good words and good deeds 
 nevertheless it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed and after the two women had retired it seemed to be a sort of rite with him to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens 
 sometimes if the two old women were not asleep they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at a very advanced hour of the night 
 he was there alone communing with himself peaceful adoring comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the invisible splendor of god opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the unknown at such moments while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation he could not have told himself probably what was passing in his spirit he felt something take its flight from him and something descend into him 
 mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe 
 he thought of the grandeur and presence of god of the future eternity that strange mystery of the eternity past a mystery still more strange of all the infinities which pierced their way into all his senses beneath his eyes and without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible he gazed upon it 
 he did not study god he was dazzled by him 
 he considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms which communicate aspects to matter reveal forces by verifying them create individualities in unity proportions in extent the innumerable in the infinite and through light produce beauty these conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly hence life and death 
 he seated himself on a wooden bench with his back against a decrepit vine he gazed at the stars past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his this quarter of an acre so poorly planted so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds was dear to him and satisfied his wants 
 what more was needed by this old man who divided the leisure of his life where there was so little leisure between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night 
 was not this narrow enclosure with the heavens for a ceiling sufficient to enable him to adore god in his most divine works in turn 
 does not this comprehend all in fact and what is there left to desire beyond it a little garden in which to walk and immensity in which to dream at feet that which can be cultivated and plucked over head that which one can study and meditate upon 
 some flowers on earth and all the stars in the sky

 a new hope 
 xiii 
 
 a cheering gleeful throng of technicians mechanics and other inhabitants of thealliance headquarters swarmed around each fighter as it touched down and taxied intothe temple hangar several of the other surviving pilots had already vacated theirships and were waiting to greet luke 
 on the opposite side of the fighter the crowd was far smaller and morerestrained it consisted of a couple of technicians and one tall humanoid droid whowatched worriedly as the humans mounted the scorched fighter and lifted a badlyburned metal hulk from its back 
 oh my artoo threepio pleaded bending close to the carbonized you hear me say something his unwinking gaze turned to one of thetechs you can repair him you 
 do our best the man studied the vaporized metal the danglingcomponents taken a terrible beating 
 you must repair him sir if any of my circuits or modules will help donate them 
 they moved slowly away oblivious to the noise and excitement around robots and the humans who repaired them there existed a very specialrelationship each partook a little of the other and sometimes the dividing linebetween man and machine was more blurred than many would admit 
 the center of the carnival atmosphere was formed by three figures who battled tosee who could compliment the others the most when it came to however chewbacca won by default there was laughter as thewookie looked embarrassed at having nearly flattened luke in his eagerness to greethim 
 i know come back luke was shouting i just know it i nothing but dust if you sailed in like that han 
 solo had lost none of his smug well i very well let aflying farm boy go up against that station all by himself besides i was beginning torealize what could happen and i felt terrible about it you to maybetake all the credit and get all the reward 
 as they laughed a little figure robes flowing rushed up to luke in a veryunsenatorial fashion you did it luke you did it leia was shouting 
 she fell into his arms and hugged him as he spun her around then she movedto solo and repeated the embrace expectantly the corellian was not quite asembarrassed 
 suddenly awed by the adulation of the crowd luke turned away he gave thetired fighter a look of approval then found his gaze traveling upward up to theceiling high overhead for a second he thought he heard something faintly like agratified sigh a relaxing of muscles a crazy old man had once performed in momentsof pleasure of course it was probably the intruding hot wind of a steaming jungleworld but luke smiled anyway at what he thought he saw up here 
 there were many rooms in the vast expanse of the temple which had beenconverted for modern service by the technicians of the alliance even in theirdesperate need however there was something too clean and classically beautifulabout the ruins of the ancient throne room for the architects to modify they had leftit as it was save for scouring it clear of creeping jungle growth and debris 
 for the first time in thousands of years that spacious chamber was of rebel troops and technicians stood assembled on the old stone together for one last time before dispersing to new posts and distant the first time ever the massed ranks of pressed uniforms and polished arrayed together in a fitting show of alliance might 
 the banners of the many worlds which had lent support to the rebellion flutteredin the gentle breeze formed inside at the far end of a long open aisle stood a visiongowned in formal white barred with chalcedony signet ofoffice 
 several figures appeared at the far end of the aisle one massive and signs of running for cover but was urged on down the open row by hiscompanion it took several minutes for luke han chewie and threepio to coverthe distance to the other end 
 they stopped before leia and luke recognized general dodonna among theother dignitaries seated nearby there was a pause and a gleaming familiar artoounit joined the group moving to stand next to a thoroughly awestruck threepio 
 chewbacca shuffled nervously giving every indication of wishing he weresomeplace else solo silenced him as leia rose and came forward at the sametime banners tilted in unison and all those gathered in the great hall turned to face thedais 
 she place something heavy and golden around neck then to strain to do finally around then she made a signal to thecrowd and the rigid discipline dissolved as every man woman and mechanicalpresent was permitted to give full vent to their feelings 
 as he stood awash in the cheers and shouts luke found that his mind wasneither on his possible future with the alliance nor on the chance of travelingadventurously with han solo and chewbacca instead unlikely as solo had claimedit might be he found his full attention occupied by the radiant leia organa 
 she noticed his unabashed stare but this time she only smiled

 book one 
 chapter xiv 
 
 after receiving her visitors the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came to congratulate the countess wished to have a talk with the friend of her childhood princess anna mikhaylovna whom she had not seen properly since she returned from petersburg anna mikhaylovna with her but pleasant face drew her chair nearer to that of the countess 
 with you i will be quite frank said anna mikhaylovna there are not many left of us old friends why i so value your friendship 
 anna mikhaylovna looked at vera and paused the countess pressed her hand 
 vera she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite how is it you have so little tact you see you are not wanted here go to the other girls or 
 the handsome vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt 
 if you had told me sooner mamma i would have gone she replied as she rose to go to her own room 
 but as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting one pair at each window she stopped and smiled scornfully sonya was sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses for her the first he had ever written boris and natasha were at the other window and ceased talking when vera entered sonya and natasha looked at vera with guilty happy faces 
 it was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in vera 
 how often have i asked you not to take my things she said you have a room of your own and she took the inkstand from nicholas 
 in a minute in a minute he said dipping his pen 
 you always manage to do things at the wrong time continued vera you came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you 
 though what she said was quite just perhaps for that very reason no one replied and the four simply looked at one another she lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand 
 and at your age what secrets can there be between natasha and boris or between you two all nonsense 
 now vera what does it matter to you said natasha in defense speaking very gently 
 she seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone 
 very silly said vera i am ashamed of you secrets indeed 
 all have secrets of their own answered natasha getting warmer we interfere with you and berg 
 i should think not said vera because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior but just tell mamma how you are behaving with boris 
 natalya ilynichna behaves very well to me remarked boris i have nothing to complain of 
 boris you are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome said natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly she used the word diplomat which was just then much in vogue among the children in the special sense they attached to it why does she bother me and she added turning to vera never understand it because never loved anyone you have no heart you are a madame de genlis and nothing more this nickname bestowed on vera by nicholas was considered very stinging and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people go and flirt with berg as much as you please she finished quickly 
 i shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors 
 well now done what you wanted put in nicholas said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them go to the nursery 
 all four like a flock of scared birds got up and left the room 
 the unpleasant things were said to me remarked vera i said none to anyone 
 madame de genlis madame de genlis shouted laughing voices through the door 
 the handsome vera who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone smiled and evidently unmoved by what had been said to her went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer 
 in the drawing room the conversation was still going on 
 ah my dear said the countess my life is not all roses either i know that at the rate we are living our means last long all the club and his easygoing nature even in the country do we get any rest theatricals hunting and heaven knows what besides but talk about me tell me how you managed everything i often wonder at you annette how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to moscow to petersburg to those ministers and great people and know how to deal with them all quite astonishing how did you get things settled i possibly do it 
 ah my love answered anna mikhaylovna god grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction one learns many things then she added with a certain pride that lawsuit taught me much when i want to see one of those big people i write a note princess desires an interview with so and then i take a cab and go myself two three or four times till i get what i want i mind what they think of me 
 well and to whom did you apply about bory asked the countess you see yours is already an officer in the guards while my nicholas is going as a cadet no one to interest himself for him to whom did you apply 
 to prince vasili he was so kind he at once agreed to everything and put the matter before the emperor said princess anna mikhaylovna enthusiastically quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end 
 has prince vasili aged much asked the countess i have not seen him since we acted together at the rumyantsovs theatricals i expect he has forgotten me he paid me attentions in those days said the countess with a smile 
 he is just the same as ever replied anna mikhaylovna overflowing with amiability his position has not turned his head at all he said to me i am sorry i can do so little for you dear princess i am at your command yes he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation but nataly you know my love for my son i would do anything for his happiness and my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one continued anna mikhaylovna sadly dropping her voice my wretched lawsuit takes all i have and makes no progress would you believe it i have literally not a penny and know how to equip boris she took out her handkerchief and began to cry i need five hundred rubles and have only one note i am in such a state my only hope now is in count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov if he will not assist his godson you know he is godfather and allow him something for his maintenance all my trouble will have been thrown away i shall not be able to equip him 
 the countess eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence 
 i often think though perhaps a sin said the princess that here lives count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov so rich all alone that tremendous fortune and what is his life worth a burden to him and life is only just beginning 
 surely he will leave something to boris said the countess 
 heaven only knows my dear these rich grandees are so selfish still i will take boris and go to see him at once and i shall speak to him straight out let people think what they will of me really all the same to me when my fate is at stake the princess rose now two and you dine at four there will just be time 
 and like a practical petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time anna mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son and went into the anteroom with him 
 my dear said she to the countess who saw her to the door and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear wish me good luck

 chapter 
 
 as soon as i had perused this epistle i went to the master and informed him that his sister had arrived at the heights and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for mrs situation and her ardent desire to see him with a wish that he would transmit to her as early as possible some token of forgiveness by me 
 forgiveness said linton i have nothing to forgive her ellen you may call at wuthering heights this afternoon if you like and say that i am not angry but sorry to have lost her especially as i can never think be happy it is out of the question my going to see her however we are eternally divided and should she really wish to oblige me let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country 
 and you write her a little note sir i asked imploringly 
 no he answered it is needless my communication with family shall be as sparing as his with mine it shall not exist 
 mr coldness depressed me exceedingly and all the way from the grange i puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said when i repeated it and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console isabella i dare say she had been on the watch for me since morning i saw her looking through the lattice as i came up the garden causeway and i nodded to her but she drew back as if afraid of being observed i entered without knocking there never was such a dreary dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented i must confess that if i had been in the young place i would at least have swept the hearth and wiped the tables with a duster but she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her her pretty face was wan and listless her hair uncurled some locks hanging lankly down and some carelessly twisted round her head probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening hindley was not there mr heathcliff sat at a table turning over some papers in his but he rose when i appeared asked me how i did quite friendly and offered me a chair he was the only thing there that seemed decent and i thought he never looked better so much had circumstances altered their positions that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman and his wife as a thorough little slattern she came forward eagerly to greet me and held out one hand to take the expected letter i shook my head she understand the hint but followed me to a sideboard where i went to lay my bonnet and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what i had brought heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manoeuvres and said 
 if you have got anything for isabella as no doubt you have nelly give it to her you make a secret of it we have no secrets between us 
 oh i have nothing i replied thinking it best to speak the truth at once my master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit from him at present he sends his love and his wishes for your happiness and his pardon for the grief you have occasioned but he thinks that after this time his household and the household here should drop intercommunication as nothing good could come of keeping it up 
 mrs lip quivered slightly and she returned to her seat in the window her husband took his stand on the hearthstone near me and began to put questions concerning catherine i told him as much as i thought proper of her illness and he extorted from me by most of the facts connected with its origin i blamed her as she deserved for bringing it all on herself and ended by hoping that he would follow mr example and avoid future interference with his family for good or evil 
 mrs linton is now just recovering i said never be like she was but her life is spared and if you really have a regard for her shun crossing her way again nay move out of this country entirely and that you may not regret it inform you catherine linton is as different now from your old friend catherine earnshaw as that young lady is different from me her appearance is changed greatly her character much more so and the person who is compelled of necessity to be her companion will only sustain his affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was by common humanity and a sense of duty 
 that is quite possible remarked heathcliff forcing himself to seem calm quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon but do you imagine that i shall leave catherine to his duty and humanity and can you compare my feelings respecting catherine to his before you leave this house i must exact a promise from you that get me an interview with her consent or refuse i will see her what do you say 
 i say mr heathcliff i replied you must not you never shall through my means another encounter between you and the master would kill her altogether 
 with your aid that may be avoided he continued and should there be danger of such an he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her i think i shall be justified in going to extremes i wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether catherine would suffer greatly from his loss the fear that she would restrains me and there you see the distinctions between our feelings had he been in my place and i in his though i hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall i never would have raised a hand against him you may look incredulous if you please i never would have banished him from her society as long as she desired his the moment her regard ceased i would have torn his heart out and drunk his blood but till you believe me you know then i would have died by inches before i touched a single hair of his head 
 and yet i interrupted you have no scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect restoration by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now when she has nearly forgotten you and involving her in a new tumult of discord and distress 
 you suppose she has nearly forgotten me he said oh nelly you know she has not you know as well as i do that for every thought she spends on linton she spends a thousand on me at a most miserable period of my life i had a notion of the kind it haunted me on my return to the neighbourhood last summer but only her own assurance could make me admit the horrible idea again and then linton would be nothing nor hindley nor all the dreams that ever i dreamt two words would comprehend my and hell existence after losing her would be hell yet i was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued edgar attachment more than mine if he loved with all the powers of his puny being he love as much in eighty years as i could in a day and catherine has a heart as deep as i have the sea could be as readily contained in that as her whole affection be monopolized by him tush he is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog or her horse it is not in him to be loved like me how can she love in him what he has not 
 catherine and edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be cried isabella with sudden vivacity no one has a right to talk in that manner and i hear my brother depreciated in silence 
 your brother is wondrous fond of you too he observed heathcliff scornfully he turns you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity 
 he is not aware of what i suffer she replied i tell him that 
 you have been telling him something then you have written have you 
 to say that i was married i did saw the note and nothing since 
 no 
 my young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition i remarked love comes short in her case obviously whose i may guess but perhaps i say 
 i should guess it was her own said heathcliff she degenerates into a mere slut she is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early hardly credit it but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to go home however suit this house so much the better for not being over nice and take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad 
 well sir returned i i hope consider that mrs heathcliff is accustomed to be looked after and waited on and that she has been brought up like an only daughter whom everyone was ready to serve you must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her and you must treat her kindly whatever be your notion of mr edgar you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments or she have abandoned the elegances and comforts and friends of her former home to fix contentedly in such a wilderness as this with you 
 she abandoned them under a delusion he answered picturing in me a hero of romance and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion i can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished but at last i think she begins to know me i perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first and the senseless incapability of discerning that i was in earnest when i gave her my opinion of her infatuation and herself it was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that i did not love her i believed at one time no lessons could teach her that and yet it is poorly learnt for this morning she announced as a piece of appalling intelligence that i had actually succeeded in making her hate me a positive labour of hercules i assure you if it be achieved i have cause to return thanks can i trust your assertion isabella are you sure you hate me if i let you alone for half a day you come sighing and wheedling to me again i dare say she would rather i had seemed all tenderness before you it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed but i care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side and i never told her a lie about it she cannot accuse me of showing a bit of deceitful softness the first thing she saw me do on coming out of the grange was to hang up her little dog and when she pleaded for it the first words i uttered were a wish that i had the hanging of every being belonging to her except one possibly she took that exception for herself but no brutality disgusted her i suppose she has an innate admiration of it if only her precious person were secure from injury now was it not the depth of genuine idiocy for that pitiful slavish brach to dream that i could love her tell your master nelly that i never in all my life met with such an abject thing as she is she even disgraces the name of linton and sometimes relented from pure lack of invention in my experiments on what she could endure and still creep shamefully cringing back but tell him also to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease that i keep strictly within the limits of the law i have avoided up to this period giving her the slightest right to claim a separation and more thank nobody for dividing us if she desired to go she might the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her 
 mr heathcliff said i this is the talk of a madman and your wife most likely is convinced you are mad and for that reason she has borne with you hitherto but now that you say she may go doubtless avail herself of the permission you are not so bewitched are you as to remain with him of your own accord 
 take care ellen answered isabella her eyes sparkling irefully there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her endeavours to make himself detested put faith in a single word he speaks a lying fiend a monster and not a human being been told i might leave him before and made the attempt but i dare not repeat it only ellen promise not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or catherine whatever he may pretend he wishes to provoke edgar to desperation he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him and he obtain die first i just hope i pray that he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me the single pleasure i can imagine is to die or see him dead 
 will do for the present said heathcliff if you are called upon in a court of law remember her language nelly and take a good look at that countenance near the point which would suit me no not fit to be your own guardian isabella now and i being your legal protector must detain you in my custody however distasteful the obligation may be go upstairs i have something to say to ellen dean in private not the way upstairs i tell you why this is the road upstairs child 
 he seized and thrust her from the room and returned muttering 
 i have no pity i have no pity the more the worms writhe the more i yearn to crush out their entrails it is a moral teething and i grind with greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain 
 do you understand what the word pity means i said hastening to resume my bonnet did you ever feel a touch of it in your life 
 put that down he interrupted perceiving my intention to depart you are not going yet come here now nelly i must either persuade or compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see catherine and that without delay i swear that i meditate no harm i desire to cause any disturbance or to exasperate or insult mr linton i only wish to hear from herself how she is and why she has been ill and to ask if anything that i could do would be of use to her last night i was in the grange garden six hours and return there tonight and every night haunt the place and every day till i find an opportunity of entering if edgar linton meets me i shall not hesitate to knock him down and give him enough to insure his quiescence while i stay if his servants oppose me i shall threaten them off with these pistols but it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them or their master and you could do it so easily warn you when i came and then you might let me in unobserved as soon as she was alone and watch till i departed your conscience quite calm you would be hindering mischief 
 i protested against playing that treacherous part in my house and besides i urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying mrs tranquillity for his satisfaction the commonest occurrence startles her painfully i said all nerves and she bear the surprise positive persist sir or else i shall be obliged to inform my master of your designs and take measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions 
 in that case take measures to secure you woman exclaimed heathcliff you shall not leave wuthering heights till tomorrow morning it is a foolish story to assert that catherine could not bear to see me and as to surprising her i desire it you must prepare her ask her if i may come you say she never mentions my name and that i am never mentioned to her to whom should she mention me if i am a forbidden topic in the house she thinks you are all spies for her husband oh no doubt in hell among you i guess by her silence as much as anything what she feels you say she is often restless and is that a proof of tranquillity you talk of her mind being unsettled how the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation and that insipid paltry creature attending her from duty and humanity from pity and charity he might as well plant an oak in a flowerpot and expect it to thrive as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares let us settle it at once will you stay here and am i to fight my way to catherine over linton and his footmen or will you be my friend as you have been hitherto and do what i request decide cause there is no reason for my lingering another minute if you persist in your stubborn 
 well mr lockwood i argued and complained and flatly refused him fifty times but in the long run he forced me to an agreement i engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress and should she consent i promised to let him have intelligence of next absence from home when he might come and get in as he was able i be there and my should be equally out of the way was it right or wrong i fear it was wrong though expedient i thought i prevented another explosion by my compliance and i thought too it might create a favourable crisis in mental illness and then i remembered mr stern rebuke of my carrying tales and i tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject by affirming with frequent iteration that that betrayal of trust if it merited so harsh an appellation should be the last notwithstanding my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither and many misgivings i had ere i could prevail on myself to put the missive into mrs hand 
 but here is kenneth go down and tell him how much better you are my history is dree as we say and will serve to while away another morning 
 dree and dreary i reflected as the good woman descended to receive the doctor and not exactly of the kind which i should have chosen to amuse me but never mind extract wholesome medicines from mrs bitter herbs and firstly let me beware the fascination that lurks in catherine brilliant eyes i should be in a curious taking if i surrendered my heart to that young person and the daughter turned out a second edition of the mother

 chapter fourteen 
 
 jo was very busy in the garret for the october days began to grow chilly and the afternoons were short for two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window showing jo seated on the old sofa writing busily with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her while scrabble the pet rat promenaded the beams overhead accompanied by his oldest son a fine young fellow who was evidently very proud of his whiskers quite absorbed in her work jo scribbled away till the last page was filled when she signed her name with a flourish and threw down her pen exclaiming 
 there done my best if this suit i shall have to wait till i can do better 
 lying back on the sofa she read the manuscript carefully through making dashes here and there and putting in many exclamation points which looked like little balloons then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon and sat a minute looking at it with a sober wistful expression which plainly showed how ernest her work had been desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall it it she kept her papers and a few books safely shut away from scrabble who being likewise of a literary turn was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves from this tin receptacle jo produced another manuscript and putting both in her pocket crept quietly downstairs leaving her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink 
 she put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible and going to the back entry window got out upon the roof of a low porch swung herself down to the grassy bank and took a roundabout way to the road once there she composed herself hailed a passing omnibus and rolled away to town looking very merry and mysterious 
 if anyone had been watching her he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar for on alighting she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street having found the place with some difficulty she went into the doorway looked up the dirty stairs and after standing stock still a minute suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came this maneuver she repeated several times to the great amusement of a young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite on returning for the third time jo gave herself a shake pulled her hat over her eyes and walked up the stairs looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out 
 there was a sign among others which adorned the entrance and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth the young gentleman put on his coat took his hat and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway saying with a smile and a shiver like her to come alone but if she has a bad time need someone to help her home 
 in ten minutes jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort when she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased and passed him with a nod but he followed asking with an air of sympathy did you have a bad time 
 not very 
 you got through quickly 
 yes thank goodness 
 why did you go alone 
 want anyone to know 
 the oddest fellow i ever saw how many did you have out 
 jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something 
 there are two which i want to have come out but i must wait a week 
 what are you laughing at you are up to some mischief jo said laurie looking mystified 
 so are you what were you doing sir up in that billiard saloon 
 begging your pardon it a billiard saloon but a gymnasium and i was taking a lesson in fencing 
 glad of that 
 why 
 you can teach me and then when we play hamlet you can be laertes and make a fine thing of the fencing scene 
 laurie burst out with a hearty laugh which made several smile in spite of themselves 
 teach you whether we play hamlet or not grand fun and will straighten you up capitally but i believe that was your only reason for saying glad in that decided way was it now 
 no i was glad that you were not in the saloon because i hope you never go to such places do you 
 not often 
 i wish you 
 no harm jo i have billiards at home but no fun unless you have good players so as fond of it i come sometimes and have a game with ned moffat or some of the other fellows 
 oh dear so sorry for get to liking it better and better and will waste time and money and grow like those dreadful boys i did hope stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends said jo shaking her head 
 a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability asked laurie looking nettled 
 that depends upon how and where he takes it i like ned and his set and wish keep out of it mother let us have him at our house though he wants to come and if you grow like him she be willing to have us frolic together as we do now 
 she asked laurie anxiously 
 no she bear fashionable young men and shut us all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them 
 well she get out her bandboxes yet not a fashionable party and mean to be but i do like harmless larks now and then you 
 yes nobody minds them so lark away but get wild will you or there will be an end of all our good times 
 be a double distilled saint 
 i bear saints just be a simple honest respectable boy and never desert you i know what i should do if you acted like mr son he had plenty of money but know how to spend it and got tipsy and gambled and ran away and forged his name i believe and was altogether horrid 
 you think likely to do the same much obliged 
 no i dear i hear people talking about money being such a temptation and i sometimes wish you were poor i worry then 
 do you worry about me jo 
 a little when you look moody and discontented as you sometimes do for got such a strong will if you once get started wrong afraid it would be hard to stop you 
 laurie walked in silence a few minutes and jo watched him wishing she had held her tongue for his eyes looked angry though his lips smiled as if at her warnings 
 are you going to deliver lectures all the way home he asked presently 
 of course not why 
 because if you are take a bus if not like to walk with you and tell you something very interesting 
 i preach any more and like to hear the news immensely 
 very well then come on a secret and if i tell you you must tell me yours 
 i got any began jo but stopped suddenly remembering that she had 
 you know you hide anything so up and fess or i tell cried laurie 
 is your secret a nice one 
 oh it all about people you know and such fun you ought to hear it and been aching to tell it this long time come you begin 
 not say anything about it at home will you 
 not a word 
 and you tease me in private 
 i never tease 
 yes you do you get everything you want out of people i know how you do it but you are a born wheedler 
 thank you fire away 
 well left two stories with a newspaperman and to give his answer next week whispered jo in her ear 
 hurrah for miss march the celebrated american authoress cried laurie throwing up his hat and catching it again to the great delight of two ducks four cats five hens and half a dozen irish children for they were out of the city now hush it come to anything i dare say but i rest till i had tried and i said nothing about it because i want anyone else to be disappointed 
 it fail why jo your stories are works of shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day it be fun to see them in print and we feel proud of our authoress 
 eyes sparkled for it is always pleasant to be believed in and a praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs 
 your secret play fair teddy or never believe you again she said trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement 
 i may get into a scrape for telling but i promise not to so i will for i never feel easy in my mind till told you any plummy bit of news i get i know where glove is 
 is that all said jo looking disappointed as laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence 
 quite enough for the present as agree when i tell you where it is 
 tell then 
 laurie bent and whispered three words in ear which produced a comical change she stood and stared at him for a minute looking both surprised and displeased then walked on saying sharply how do you know 
 saw it 
 where 
 pocket 
 all this time 
 yes that romantic 
 no horrid 
 you like it 
 of course i ridiculous it be allowed my patience what would meg say 
 you are not to tell anyone mind that 
 i promise 
 that was understood and i trusted you 
 well i for the present anyway but disgusted and wish you told me 
 i thought be pleased 
 at the idea of anybody coming to take meg away no thank you 
 feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away 
 like to see anyone try it cried jo fiercely 
 so should i and laurie chuckled at the idea 
 i think secrets agree with me i feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that said jo rather ungratefully 
 race down this hill with me and be all right suggested laurie 
 no one was in sight the smooth road sloped invitingly before her and finding the temptation irresistible jo darted away soon leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his treatment for his atalanta came panting up with flying hair bright eyes ruddy cheeks and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face 
 i wish i was a horse then i could run for miles in this splendid air and not lose my breath it was capital but see what a guy made me go pick up my things like a cherub as you are said jo dropping down under a maple tree which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves 
 laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property and jo bundled up her braids hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again but someone did pass and who should it be but meg looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit for she had been making calls 
 what in the world are you doing here she asked regarding her disheveled sister with surprise 
 getting leaves meekly answered jo sorting the rosy handful she had just swept up 
 and hairpins added laurie throwing half a dozen into lap they grow on this road meg so do combs and brown straw hats 
 you have been running jo how could you when will you stop such romping ways said meg reprovingly as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair with which the wind had taken liberties 
 never till stiff and old and have to use a crutch try to make me grow up before my time meg hard enough to have you change all of a sudden let me be a little girl as long as i can 
 as she spoke jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips for lately she had felt that margaret was fast getting to be a woman and secret made her dread the separation which must surely come some time and now seemed very near he saw the trouble in her face and drew attention from it by asking quickly where have you been calling all so fine 
 at the gardiners and sallie has been telling me all about belle wedding it was very splendid and they have gone to spend the winter in paris just think how delightful that must be 
 do you envy her meg said laurie 
 afraid i do 
 glad of it muttered jo tying on her hat with a jerk 
 why asked meg looking surprised 
 because if you care much about riches you will never go and marry a poor man said jo frowning at laurie who was mutely warning her to mind what she said 
 i shall never go and marry anyone observed meg walking on with great dignity while the others followed laughing whispering skipping stones and behaving like children as meg said to herself though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on 
 for a week or two jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite bewildered she rushed to the door when the postman rang was rude to mr brooke whenever they met would sit looking at meg with a face occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner laurie and she were always making signs to one another and talking about spread eagles till the girls declared they had both lost their wits on the second saturday after jo got out of the window meg as she sat sewing at her window was scandalized by the sight of laurie chasing jo all over the garden and finally capturing her in bower what went on there meg could not see but shrieks of laughter were heard followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers 
 what shall we do with that girl she never will behave like a young lady sighed meg as she watched the race with a disapproving face 
 i hope she she is so funny and dear as she is said beth who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at having secrets with anyone but her 
 very trying but we never can make her commy la fo added amy who sat making some new frills for herself with her curls tied up in a very becoming way two agreeable things that made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike 
 in a few minutes jo bounced in laid herself on the sofa and affected to read 
 have you anything interesting there asked meg with condescension 
 nothing but a story amount to much i guess returned jo carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight 
 better read it aloud that will amuse us and keep you out of mischief said amy in her most tone 
 the name asked beth wondering why jo kept her face behind the sheet 
 the rival painters 
 that sounds well read it said meg 
 with a loud hem and a long breath jo began to read very fast the girls listened with interest for the tale was romantic and somewhat pathetic as most of the characters died in the end i like that about the splendid picture was approving remark as jo paused 
 i prefer the lovering part viola and angelo are two of our favorite names that queer said meg wiping her eyes for the lovering part was tragical 
 who wrote it asked beth who had caught a glimpse of face 
 the reader suddenly sat up cast away the paper displaying a flushed countenance and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement replied in a loud voice your sister 
 you cried meg dropping her work 
 very good said amy critically 
 i knew it i knew it oh my jo i am so proud and beth ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success 
 dear me how delighted they all were to be sure how meg believe it till she saw the words miss josephine march actually printed in the paper how graciously amy critisized the artistic parts of the story and offered hints for a sequel which unfortunately be carried out as the hero and heroine were dead how beth got excited and skipped and sang with joy how hannah came in to exclaim sakes alive well i never in great astonishment at that how proud mrs march was when she knew it how jo laughed with tears in her eyes as she declared she might as well be a peacock and done with it and how th spread eagle might be said to flap his wings triumphantly over the house of march as the paper passed from hand to hand 
 tell us about it when did it come how much did you get for it what will father say laurie laugh cried the family all in one breath as they clustered about jo for these foolish affectionate people mad a jubilee of every little household joy 
 stop jabbering girls and tell you everything said jo wondering if miss burney felt any grander over her evilina than she did over her rival painters having told how she disposed of her tales jo added and when i went to get my answer the man said he liked them both but pay beginners only let them print in his paper and noticed the stories it was good practice he said and when the beginners improved anyone would pay so i let him have the two stories and today this was sent to me and laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it so i let him and he said it was good and i shall write more and going to get the next paid for and i am so happy for in time i may be able to support myself and help the girls 
 breath gave out here and wrapping her head in the paper she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end

 they look at each other and she throws her self into his arms holding her tight they kiss passionately then hold each other for a few more moments and ann cries against his shoulder they release enough for her to turn around to look back down the street then she looks at back him they manage a smile at each other and then ann looks down unable to stay the inevitable turning away from him she opens the door and gets out without looking back she starts off down the street her walk turning into a run joe watches her as she disappears round the corner joe looks out at the empty street toward the gate and looking as if he might go after her but after a pause he looks away glumly then switches on the engine and drives off 
 in the embassy princess ann stands in a large room across from the others in their bedclothes ambassador the countess who is upset wiping her nose with a handkerchief and the general who stands

 they stand for a moment then bow and walk away at the door the countess takes a tray from a servant 
 no milk and crackers 
 
 the countess gives them back about to shut the door 
 that will be all thank you countess 
 
 the countess bows in respect and then goes out closing the door 
 alone in the room the princess walks slowly over to a window looking out over the city in silence 
 
 the next day joe sits in his apartment looking out of his window over the town there is a knock at the door and joe looks up hopefully the knocking persists and he walks to the door slowly and opens it then turns around in disappointment

lionfish nov chapter fourteen cornelius fudgecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry ron and hermione had always known that hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures during their first year at hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant dog christened fluffy and if as a boy hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle harry was sure have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs harry could just imagine the hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it but he was equally certain that hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody 
 
 harry half wished he found out how to work diary again and again ron and hermione made him recount what seen until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long circular conversations that followed 
 
 riddle might have got the wrong person said hermione maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people 
 
 how many monsters think this place can hold ron asked dully 
 
 we always knew hagrid had been expelled said harry miserably and the attacks stopped after hagrid was kicked out otherwise riddle have got his award 
 
 ron tried a different tack 
 
 riddle does sound like percy who asked him to squeal on hagrid anyway 
 
 but the monster had killed someone ron said hermione 
 
 and riddle was going to go back to some muggle orphanage if they closed hogwarts said harry i blame him for wanting to stay here 
 
 you met hagrid down knockturn alley you harry 
 
 he was buying a slug repellent said harry quickly 
 
 the three of them fell silent after a long pause hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice 
 
 do you think we should go and ask hagrid about it all 
 
 be a cheerful visit said ron hello hagrid tell us have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately 
 
 in the end they decided that they would not say anything to hagrid unless there was another attack and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled it was now nearly four months since justin and nearly headless nick had been petrified and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker whoever it was had retired for good peeves had finally got bored of his oh potter you rotter song ernie macmillan asked harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in herbology one day and in march several of the mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three this made professor sprout very happy 
 
 the moment they start trying to move into each pots know fully mature she told harry then be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing 
 
 the second years were given something new to think about during their easter holidays the time had come to choose their subjects for the third year a matter that hermione at least took very seriously 
 
 it could affect our whole future she told harry and ron as they pored over lists of new subjects marking them with checks 
 
 i just want to give up potions said harry 
 
 we said ron gloomily we keep all our old subjects or ditched defense against the dark arts 
 
 but very important said hermione shocked 
 
 not the way lockhart teaches it said ron i learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose 
 
 neville longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family all giving him different advice on what to choose confused and worried he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out asking people whether they thought arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of ancient runes dean thomas who like harry had grown up with muggles ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list then picking the subjects it landed on hermione took advice but signed up for everything 
 
 harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what uncle vernon and aunt petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them not that he get any guidance percy weasley was eager to share his experience 
 
 depends where you want to go harry he said never too early to think about the future so recommend divination people say muggle studies is a soft option but i personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the community particularly if thinking of working in close contact with them look at my father he has to deal with muggle business all the time my brother charlie was always more of an outdoor type so he went for care of magical creatures play to your strengths harry 
 
 but the only thing harry felt he was really good at was quidditch in the end he chose the same new subjects as ron feeling that if he was lousy at them at least have someone friendly to help him 
 
 next quidditch match would be against hufflepuff wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner so that harry barely had time for anything but quidditch and homework however the training sessions were getting better or at least drier and the evening before match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling chances for the quidditch cup had never been better 
 
 but his cheerful mood last long at the top of the stairs to the dormitory he met neville longbottom who was looking frantic 
 
 harry i know who did it i just found 
 
 watching harry fearfully neville pushed open the door 
 
 the contents of trunk had been thrown everywhere his cloak lay ripped on the floor the bedclothes had been pulled off his and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet the contents strewn over the mattress 
 
 harry walked over to the bed treading on a few loose pages of travels with trolls as he and neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed ron dean and seamus came in dean swore loudly 
 
 what happened harry 
 
 no idea said harry but ron was examining robes all the pockets were hanging out 
 
 been looking for something said ron is there anything missing 
 
 harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk it was only as he threw the last of the lockhart books back into it that he realized what there 
 
 gone he said in an undertone to ron 
 
 what 
 
 harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and ron followed him out they hurried down to the gryffindor common room which was and joined hermione who was sitting alone reading a book called ancient runes made easy 
 
 hermione looked aghast at the news 
 
 but only a gryffindor could have stolen nobody else knows our password 
 
 exactly said harry 
 
 they woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light refreshing breeze 
 
 perfect quidditch conditions said wood enthusiastically at the gryffindor table loading the plates with scrambled eggs harry buck up there you need a decent breakfast 
 
 harry had been staring down the packed gryffindor table wondering if the new owner of diary was right in front of his eyes hermione had been urging him to report the robbery but harry like the idea have to tell a teacher all about the diary and how many people knew why hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago he want to be the one who brought it all up again 
 
 as he left the great hall with ron and hermione to go and collect his quidditch things another very serious worry was added to growing list he had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again 
 
 kill this time let me rip tear 
 
 he shouted aloud and ron and hermione both jumped away from him in alarm 
 
 the voice said harry looking over his shoulder i just heard it again you 
 
 ron shook his head hermione however clapped a hand to her forehead 
 
 harry i think just understood something got to go to the library 
 
 and she sprinted away up the stairs 
 
 what does she understand said harry distractedly still looking around trying to tell where the voice had come from 
 
 loads more than i do said ron shaking his head 
 
 but she got to go to the library 
 
 because what hermione does said ron shrugging when in doubt go to the library 
 
 harry stood irresolute trying to catch the voice again but people were now emerging from the great hall behind him talking loudly exiting through the front doors on their way to the quidditch pitch 
 
 better get moving said ron nearly eleven the match 
 
 harry raced up to gryffindor tower collected his nimbus two thousand and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game 
 
 the teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause oliver wood took off for a flight around the goal posts madam hooch released the balls the hufflepuffs who played in canary yellow were standing in a huddle having a discussion of tactics 
 
 harry was just mounting his broom when professor mcgonagall came half marching half running across the pitch carrying an enormous purple megaphone 
 
 heart dropped like a stone 
 
 this match has been cancelled professor mcgonagall called through the megaphone addressing the packed stadium there were boos and shouts oliver wood looking devastated landed and ran toward professor mcgonagall without getting off his broomstick 
 
 but professor he shouted got to play the cup gryffindor 
 
 professor mcgonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone 
 
 all students are to make their way back to the house common rooms where their heads of houses will give them further information as quickly as you can please 
 
 then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned harry over to her 
 
 potter i think better come with me 
 
 wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time harry saw ron detach himself from the complaining crowd he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle to surprise professor mcgonagall object 
 
 yes perhaps better come too weasley 
 
 some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled others looked worried harry and ron followed professor mcgonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase but they taken to office this time 
 
 this will be a bit of a shock said professor mcgonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary there has been another attack another double attack 
 
 insides did a horrible somersault professor mcgonagall pushed the door open and he and ron entered madam pomfrey was bending over a girl with long curly hair harry recognized her as the ravenclaw accidentally asked for directions to the slytherin common room and on the bed next to her was 
 
 hermione ron groaned 
 
 hermione lay utterly still her eyes open and glassy 
 
 they were found near the library said professor mcgonagall i suppose either of you can explain this it was on the floor next to them 
 
 she was holding up a small circular mirror 
 
 harry and ron shook their heads both staring at hermione 
 
 i will escort you back to gryffindor tower said professor mcgonagall heavily i need to address the students in any case 
 
 all students will return to their house common rooms by six in the evening no student is to leave the dormitories after that time you will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher no student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher all further quidditch training and matches are to be postponed there will be no more evening activities 
 
 the gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to professor mcgonagall in silence she rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice i need hardly add that i have rarely been so distressed it is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught i would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward 
 
 she climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole and the gryffindors began talking immediately 
 
 two gryffindors down not counting a gryffindor ghost one ravenclaw and one hufflepuff said the weasley lee jordan counting on his fingers any of the teachers noticed that the slytherins are all safe it obvious all this coming from slytherin the heir of slytherin the monster of slytherin why they just chuck all the slytherins out he roared to nods and scattered applause 
 
 percy weasley was sitting in a chair behind lee but for once he seem keen to make his views heard he was looking pale and stunned 
 
 in shock george told harry quietly that ravenclaw girl penelope clearwater a prefect i think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect 
 
 but harry was only he seem to be able to get rid of the picture of hermione lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone and if the culprit caught soon he was looking at a lifetime back with the dursleys tom riddle had turned hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a muggle orphanage if the school closed harry now knew exactly how he had felt 
 
 we going to do said ron quietly in ear think they suspect hagrid 
 
 got to go and talk to him said harry making up his mind i believe him this time but if he set the monster loose last time know how to get inside the chamber of secrets and a start 
 
 but mcgonagall said got to stay in our tower unless in class 
 
 i think said harry more quietly still time to get my old cloak out again 
 
 harry had inherited just one thing from his father a long and silvery invisibility cloak it was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit hagrid without anyone knowing about it they went to bed at the usual time waited until neville dean and seamus had stopped discussing the chamber of secrets and finally fallen asleep then got up dressed again and threw the cloak over themselves 
 
 the journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors enjoyable harry who had wandered the castle at night several times before had never seen it so crowded after sunset teachers prefects and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs staring around for any unusual activity their invisibility cloak stop them making any noise and there was a particularly tense moment when ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where snape stood standing guard thankfully snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment ron swore it was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open 
 
 it was a clear starry night they hurried toward the lit windows of house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door 
 
 seconds after they had knocked hagrid flung it open they found themselves with him aiming a crossbow at them fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him 
 
 oh he said lowering the weapon and staring at them you two 
 
 that for said harry pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside 
 
 nothin nothin hagrid muttered bin expectin sit down make tea 
 
 he hardly seemed to know what he was doing he nearly extinguished the fire spilling water from the kettle on it and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand 
 
 are you okay hagrid said harry did you hear about hermione 
 
 oh i heard all righ said hagrid a slight break in his voice 
 
 he kept glancing nervously at the windows he poured them both large mugs of boiling water he had forgotten to add tea bags and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door 
 
 hagrid dropped the fruitcake harry and ron exchanged panicstricken looks then threw the invisibility cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner hagrid checked that they were hidden seized his crossbow and flung open his door once more 
 
 good evening hagrid 
 
 it was dumbledore he entered looking deadly serious and was followed by a second very man 
 
 the stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes a pinstriped suit a scarlet tie a long black cloak and pointed purple boots under his arm he carried a bowler 
 
 boss ron breathed cornelius fudge the minister of magic 
 
 harry elbowed ron hard to make him shut up 
 
 hagrid had gone pale and sweaty he dropped into one of his chairs and looked from dumbledore to cornelius fudge 
 
 bad business hagrid said fudge in rather clipped tones very bad business had to come four attacks on gone far enough got to act 
 
 i never said hagrid looking imploringly at dumbledore you know i never professor dumbledore sir 
 
 i want it understood cornelius that hagrid has my full confidence said dumbledore frowning at fudge 
 
 look albus said fudge uncomfortably against him got to do something the school governors have been in touch 
 
 yet again cornelius i tell you that taking hagrid away will not help in the slightest said dumbledore his blue eyes were full of a fire harry had never seen before 
 
 look at it from my point of view said fudge fidgeting with his bowler under a lot of pressure got to be seen to be doing something if it turns out it hagrid be back and no more said but got to take him got to be doing my duty 
 
 take me said hagrid who was trembling take me where 
 
 for a short stretch only said fudge not meeting eyes not a punishment hagrid more a precaution if someone else is caught be let out with a full apology 
 
 not azkaban croaked hagrid 
 
 before fudge could answer there was another loud rap on the door 
 
 dumbledore answered it it was turn for an elbow in the ribs let out an audible gasp 
 
 mr lucius malfoy strode into hut swathed in a long black traveling cloak smiling a cold and satisfied smile fang started to growl 
 
 already here fudge he said approvingly good good 
 
 you said hagrid furiously get outta my house 
 
 my dear man please believe me i have no pleasure at all in being inside your er call this a house said lucius malfoy sneering as he looked around the small cabin i simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here 
 
 and what exactly did you want with me lucius said dumbledore he spoke politely but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes 
 
 dreadful thing dumbledore said malfoy lazily taking out a long roll of parchment but the governors feel time for you to step aside this is an order of suspension find all twelve signatures on it afraid we feel losing your touch how many attacks have there been now two more this afternoon it at this rate be no left at hogwarts and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school 
 
 oh now see here lucius said fudge looking alarmed dumbledore suspended no no last thing we want just now 
 
 the appointment or suspension of the headmaster is a matter for the governors fudge said mr malfoy smoothly and as dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks 
 
 see here malfoy if dumbledore stop them said fudge whose upper lip was sweating now i mean to say who can 
 
 that remains to be seen said mr malfoy with a nasty smile but as all twelve of us have voted 
 
 hagrid leapt to his feet his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling 
 
 many did yeh have ter threaten before they agreed malfoy eh he roared 
 
 dear dear you know that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days hagrid said mr malfoy i would advise you not to shout at the azkaban guards like that they like it at all 
 
 yeh dumbledore yelled hagrid making fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket take him away a chance be 
 
 calm yourself hagrid said dumbledore sharply he looked at lucius malfoy 
 
 if the governors want my removal lucius i shall of course step aside 
 
 but stuttered fudge 
 
 no growled hagrid 
 
 dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off lucius cold gray ones 
 
 however said dumbledore speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word you will find that i will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it 
 
 for a second harry was almost sure eyes flickered toward the corner where he and ron were hidden 
 
 admirable sentiments said malfoy bowing we shall all miss your er highly individual way of running things albus and only hope your successor willl manage to prevent any ah killins 
 
 he strode to the cabin door opened it and bowed dumbledore out fudge fiddling with his bowler waited for hagrid to go ahead of him but hagrid stood his ground took a deep breath and said carefully if anyone wanted ter find out some stuff all have ter do would be ter follow the spiders lead em right all sayin 
 
 fudge stared at him in amazement 
 
 all right comin said hagrid pulling on his moleskin overcoat but as he was about to follow fudge through the door he stopped again and said loudly need ter feed fang while away 
 
 the door banged shut and ron pulled off the invisibility cloak 
 
 in trouble now ron said hoarsely no dumbledore they might as well close the school tonight be an attack a day with him gone 
 
 fang started howling scratching at the closed door 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter fourteen grudgecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 no one in gryffindor tower slept that night they knew that the castle was being searched again and the whole house stayed awake in the common room waiting to hear whether black had been caught professor mcgonagall came back at dawn to tell them that he had again escaped 
 
 throughout the day everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security professor flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of sirius black filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes sir cadogan had been fired his portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor and the fat lady was back she had been expertly restored but was still extremely nervous and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection a bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her they paced the corridor in a menacing group talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs 
 
 harry help noticing that the statue of the witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked it seemed that fred and george had been right in thinking that they and now harry ron and hermione were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it 
 
 reckon we should tell someone harry asked ron 
 
 we know not coming in through said ron dismissively heard if the shop had been broken into 
 
 harry was glad ron took this view if the witch was boarded up too he would never be able to go into hogsmeade again 
 
 ron had become an instant celebrity for the first time in his life people were paying more attention to him than to harry and it was clear that ron was rather enjoying the experience though still severely shaken by the events he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened with a wealth of detail 
 
 i was asleep and i heard this ripping noise and i thought it was in my dream you know but then there was this drafti woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled downi rolled overand i saw him standing over melike a skeleton with loads of filthy hairholding this great long knife been twelve inchesand he looked at me and i looked at him and then i yelled and he scampered 
 
 why though ron added to harry as the group of second year girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed why did he run 
 
 harry had been wondering the same thing why had black having got the wrong bed not silenced ron and proceeded to harry black had proved twelve years ago that he mind murdering innocent people and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys four of whom were asleep 
 
 he known have a job getting back out of the castle once yelled and woken people up said harry thoughtfully had to kill the whole house to get back through the portrait holethen he met the teachers 
 
 neville was in total disgrace professor mcgonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future hogsmeade visits given him a detention and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower poor neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him none of these punishments however came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him two days after she sent neville the very worst thing a hogwarts student could receive over breakfast a howler 
 
 the school owls swooped into the great hall carrying the mail as usual and neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak harry and ron who were sitting opposite him recognized the letter as a howler at once ron had got one from his mother the year before 
 
 run for it neville ron advised 
 
 neville need telling twice he seized the envelope and holding it before him like a bomb sprinted out of the hall while the slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him they heard the howler go off in the entrance hall voice magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family 
 
 harry was too busy feeling sorry for neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist 
 
 ouch oh thanks hedwig 
 
 harry tore open the envelope while hedwig helped herself to some of cornflakes the note inside said 
 
 dear harry and ron 
 how about having tea with me this afternoon round six come collect you from the castle wait for me in the entrance hall not allowed out on your own 
 cheers 
 hagrid 
 he probably wants to hear all about black said ron 
 
 so at six that afternoon harry and ron left gryffindor tower passed the security trolls at a run and headed down to the entrance hall 
 
 hagrid was already waiting for them 
 
 all right hagrid said ron you want to hear about saturday night do you 
 
 already heard all abou it said hagrid opening the front doors and leading them outside 
 
 oh said ron looking slightly put out 
 
 the first thing they saw on entering cabin was buckbeak who was stretched out on top of patchwork quilt his enormous wings folded tight to his body enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight harry saw a gigantic hairy brown suit and a very horrible tie hanging from the top of wardrobe door 
 
 what are they for hagrid said harry 
 
 case against the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures said hagrid this friday him an be goin down ter london together booked two beds on the knight bus 
 
 harry felt a nasty pang of guilt he had completely forgotten that trial was so near and judging by the uneasy look on face he had too they had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare defense the arrival of the firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds 
 
 hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of bath buns but they knew better than to accept they had had too much experience with cooking 
 
 i got somethin ter discuss with you two said hagrid sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious 
 
 what said harry 
 
 hermione said hagrid 
 
 what about her said ron 
 
 in a righ state what bin comin down ter visit me a lot since bin feelin lonely firs yeh weren talking to her because o the firebolt now yer not talkin to her because her cat 
 
 c ate scabbers ron interjected angrily 
 
 because her cat acted like all cats do hagrid continued doggedly cried a fair few times yeh know goin through a rough time at the moment bitten off she can chew if yeh ask me all the work tryin ter do still found time ter help me with case found some really good stuff fer mereckon stand a good chance now 
 
 hagrid we helped as well sorry harry began awkwardly 
 
 not blamin yeh said hagrid waving apology aside gawd knows had enough ter be getting on with seen yeh practicin quidditch hour o the day an night but i gotta tell yeh i thought you value yer friend broomsticks or rats all 
 
 harry and ron exchanged uncomfortable looks 
 
 really upset she was when black nearly stabbed yeh ron got her heart in the right place hermione has an you two not talkin to her 
 
 if just get rid of that cat speak to her again ron said angrily but still sticking up for it a maniac and she hear a word against it 
 
 ah well people can be a bit stupid abou their pets said hagrid wisely behind him buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto pillow 
 
 they spent the rest of their visit discussing improved chances for the quidditch cup at nine hagrid walked them back up to the castle 
 
 a large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room 
 
 hogsmeade next weekend said ron craning over the heads to read the new notice what reckon he added quietly to harry as they went to sit down 
 
 well filch done anything about the passage into honeydukes harry said even more quietly 
 
 harry said a voice in his right ear harry started and looked around at hermione who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her 
 
 harry if you go into hogsmeade tell professor mcgonagall about that map said hermione 
 
 can you hear someone talking harry growled ron not looking at hermione 
 
 ron how can you let him go with you after what sirius black nearly did to you i mean it tell 
 
 so now trying to get harry expelled said ron furiously you done enough damage this year 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to respond but with a soft hiss crookshanks leapt onto her lap hermione took one frightened look at the expression on face gathered up crookshanks and hurried away toward the girls dormitories 
 
 so how about it ron said to harry as though there had been no interruption come on last time we went you see anything you even been inside yet 
 
 harry looked around to check that hermione was well out of earshot 
 
 okay he said but taking the invisibility cloak this time 
 
 
 
 on saturday morning harry packed his invisibility cloak in his bag slipped the map into his pocket and went down to breakfast with everyone else hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors 
 
 bye harry called to ron see you when you get back 
 
 ron grinned and winked 
 
 harry hurried up to the third floor slipping the map out of his pocket as he went crouching behind the witch he smoothed it out a tiny dot was moving in his direction harry squinted at it the minuscule writing next to it read neville longbottom 
 
 harry quickly pulled out his wand muttered dissendium and shoved his bag into the statue but before he could climb in himself neville came around the corner 
 
 harry i forgot you going to hogsmeade either 
 
 hi neville said harry moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket what are you up to 
 
 nothing shrugged neville want a game of exploding snap 
 
 er not now i was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for lupin 
 
 come with you said neville brightly i done it either 
 
 er hang on yeah i forgot i finished it last night 
 
 great you can help me said neville his round face anxious i understand that thing about the garlic at all do they have to eat it or 
 
 he broke off with a small gasp looking over shoulder 
 
 it was snape neville took a quick step behind harry 
 
 and what are you two doing here said snape coming to a halt and looking from one to the other an odd place to meet 
 
 to immense disquiet black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them and then to the witch 
 
 not meeting here said harry we just met here 
 
 indeed said snape you have a habit of turning up in unexpected places potter and you are very rarely there for no good reasoni suggest the pair of you return to gryffindor tower where you belong 
 
 harry and neville set off without another word as they turned the corner harry looked back snape was running one of his hands over the head examining it closely 
 
 harry managed to shake neville off at the fat lady by telling him the password then pretending left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back once out of sight of the security trolls he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose 
 
 the third floor corridor seemed to be deserted harry scanned the map carefully and saw with a leap of relief that the tiny dot labeled severus snape was now back in its office 
 
 he sprinted back to the witch opened her hump heaved himself inside and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute he wiped the map blank again then set off at a run 
 
 
 
 harry completely hidden beneath the invisibility cloak emerged into the sunlight outside honeydukes and prodded ron in the back 
 
 me he muttered 
 
 what kept you ron hissed 
 
 snape was hanging around 
 
 they set off up the high street 
 
 where are you ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth are you still there this feels weird 
 
 they went to the post office ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to bill in egypt so that harry could have a good look around the owls sat hooting softly down at him at least three hundred of them from great grays right down to tiny little scops owls local deliveries only which were so small they could have sat in the palm of hand 
 
 then they visited which was so packed with students harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic there were jokes and tricks to fulfill even and wildest dreams harry gave ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak they left with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering but their pockets bulging with dungbombs hiccup sweets frog spawn soap and a teacup apiece 
 
 the day was fine and breezy and neither of them felt like staying indoors so they walked past the three broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the shrieking shack the most haunted dwelling in britain it stood a little way above the rest of the village and even in daylight was slightly creepy with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden 
 
 even the hogwarts ghosts avoid it said ron as they leaned on the fence looking up at it i asked nearly headless nickhe says heard a very rough crowd lives here no one can get in fred and george tried obviously but all the entrances are sealed shut 
 
 harry feeling hot from their climb was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill moments later malfoy had appeared followed closely by crabbe and goyle malfoy was speaking 
 
 should have an owl from father any time now he had to go to the hearing to tell them about my armabout how i use it for three months 
 
 crabbe and goyle sniggered 
 
 i really wish i could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend no arm in im onest that as good as dead 
 
 malfoy suddenly caught sight of ron his pale face split in a malevolent grin 
 
 what are you doing weasley 
 
 malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind ron 
 
 suppose love to live here you weasley dreaming about having your own bedroom i heard your family all sleep in one room is that true 
 
 harry seized the back of robes to stop him from leaping on malfoy 
 
 leave him to me he hissed in ear 
 
 the opportunity was too perfect to miss harry crept silently around behind malfoy crabbe and goyle bent down and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path 
 
 we were just discussing your friend hagrid malfoy said to ron just trying to imagine what saying to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures think cry when they cut off his 
 
 splat 
 
 head jerked forward as the mud hit him his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in muck 
 
 what the 
 
 ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing he was laughing so hard malfoy crabbe and goyle spun stupidly on the spot staring wildly around malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean 
 
 what was that who did that 
 
 very haunted up here it said ron with the air of one commenting on the weather 
 
 crabbe and goyle were looking scared their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape 
 
 harry sneaked along the path where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some green sludge 
 
 splatter 
 
 crabbe and goyle caught some this time goyle hopped furiously on the spot trying to rub it out of his small dull eyes 
 
 it came from over there said malfoy wiping his face and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of harry 
 
 crabbe blundered forward his long arms outstretched like a zombie harry dodged around him picked up a stick and lobbed it at back harry doubled up with silent laughter as crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair trying to see who had thrown it as ron was the only person crabbe could see it was ron he started toward but harry stuck out his leg crabbe stumbled and his huge flat foot caught the hem of cloak harry felt a great tug then the cloak slid off his face 
 
 for a split second malfoy stared at him 
 
 aaargh he yelled pointing at head then he turned tail and ran at breakneck speed back down the hill crabbe and goyle behind him 
 
 harry tugged the cloak up again but the damage was done 
 
 harry ron said stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where harry had disappeared better run for it if malfoy tells anyone better get back to the castle quick 
 
 see you later said harry and without another word he tore back down the path toward hogsmeade 
 
 would malfoy believe what he had seen would anyone believe malfoy nobody knew about the invisibility cloak nobody except dumbledore stomach turned over dumbledore would know exactly what had happened if malfoy said anything 
 
 back into honeydukes back down the cellar steps across the stone floor through the trapdoor harry pulled off the cloak tucked it under his arm and ran flat out along the passagemalfoy would get back first how long would it take him to find a teacher panting a sharp pain in his side harry slow down until he reached the stone slide he would have to leave the cloak where it was it was too much of a giveaway in case malfoy had tipped off a teacher he hid it in a shadowy corner then started to climb fast as he could his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute he reached the inside of the hump tapped it with his wand stuck his head through and hoisted himself out the hump closed and just as harry jumped out from behind the statue he heard quick footsteps approaching 
 
 it was snape he approached harry at a swift walk his black robes swishing then stopped in front of him 
 
 so he said 
 
 there was a look of suppressed triumph about him harry tried to look innocent all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands which he quickly hid in his pockets 
 
 come with me potter said snape 
 
 harry followed him downstairs trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without snape noticing they walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into office 
 
 harry had been in here only once before and he had been in very serious trouble then too snape had acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time all standing on shelves behind his desk glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere 
 
 sit said snape 
 
 harry sat snape however remained standing 
 
 mr malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story potter said snape 
 
 harry say anything 
 
 he tells me that he was up by the shrieking shack when he ran into weasley apparently alone 
 
 still harry speak 
 
 mr malfoy states that he was standing talking to weasley when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head how do you think that could have happened 
 
 harry tried to look mildly surprised 
 
 i know professor 
 
 eyes were boring into it was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff harry tried hard not to blink 
 
 mr malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition can you imagine what it might have been potter 
 
 no said harry now trying to sound innocently curious 
 
 it was your head potter floating in midair 
 
 there was a long silence 
 
 maybe better go to madam pomfrey said harry if seeing things like 
 
 what would your head have been doing in hogsmeade potter said snape softly your head is not allowed in hogsmeade no part of your body has permission to be in hogsmeade 
 
 i know that said harry striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear it sounds like having hallucin 
 
 malfoy is not having hallucinations snarled snape and he bent down a hand on each arm of chair so that their faces were a foot apart if your head was in hogsmeade so was the rest of you 
 
 been up in gryffindor tower said harry like you told 
 
 can anyone confirm that 
 
 harry say anything thin mouth curled into a horrible smile 
 
 so he said straightening up again everyone from the minister of magic downward has been trying to keep famous harry potter safe from sirius black but famous harry potter is a law unto himself let the ordinary people worry about his safety famous harry potter goes where he wants to with no thought for the consequences 
 
 harry stayed silent snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth he going to do it snape had no proof yet 
 
 how extraordinarily like your father you are potter snape said suddenly his eyes glinting he too was exceedingly arrogant a small amount of talent on the quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too strutting around the place with his friends and admirersthe resemblance between you is uncanny 
 
 my dad strut said harry before he could stop himself and neither do i 
 
 your father set much store by rules either snape went on pressing his advantage his thin face full of malice rules were for lesser mortals not quidditch his head was so swollen 
 
 shut up 
 
 harry was suddenly on his feet rage such as he had not felt since his last night in privet drive was coursing through him he care that face had gone rigid the black eyes flashing dangerously 
 
 what did you say to me potter 
 
 i told you to shut up about my dad harry yelled i know the truth all right he saved your life dumbledore told me you even be here if it for my dad 
 
 sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk 
 
 and did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life he whispered or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious delicate ears 
 
 harry bit his lip he know what had happened and want to admit it but snape seemed to have guessed the truth 
 
 i would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father potter he said a terrible grin twisting his face have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism then let me correct you your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father got cold feet at the last moment there was nothing brave about what he did he was saving his own skin as much as mine had their joke succeeded he would have been expelled from hogwarts 
 
 uneven yellowish teeth were bared 
 
 turn out your pockets potter he spat suddenly 
 
 harry move there was a pounding in his ears 
 
 turn out your pockets or we go straight to the headmaster pull them out potter 
 
 cold with dread harry slowly pulled out the bag of tricks and the map 
 
 snap picked up the bag 
 
 ron gave them to me said harry praying get a chance to tip ron off before snape saw him he brought them back from hogsmeade last time 
 
 indeed and been carrying them around ever since how very touchingand what is this 
 
 snape had picked up the map harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive 
 
 spare bit of parchment he said with a shrug 
 
 snape turned it over his eyes on harry 
 
 surely you need such a very old piece of parchment he said why i just throw this away 
 
 his hand moved toward the fire 
 
 no harry said quickly 
 
 so said snape his long nostrils quivering is this another treasured gift from mr weasley or is it something else a letter perhaps written in invisible ink or instructions to get into hogsmeade without passing the dementors 
 
 harry blinked eyes gleamed 
 
 let me see let me see he muttered taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk reveal your secret he said touching the wand to the parchment 
 
 nothing happened harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking 
 
 show yourself snape said tapping the map sharply 
 
 it stayed blank harry was taking deep calming breaths 
 
 professor severus snape master of this school commands you to yield the information you conceal snape said hitting the map with his wand 
 
 as though an invisible hand were writing upon it words appeared on the smooth surface of the map 
 
 mooney presents his compliments to professor snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other business 
 
 snape froze harry stared dumbstruck at the message but the map stop there more writing was appearing beneath the first 
 
 mr prongs agrees with mr mooney and would like to add that professor snape is an ugly git 
 
 it would have been very funny if the situation been so serious and there was more 
 
 mr padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor 
 
 harry closed his eyes in horror when opened them the map had had its last word 
 
 mr wormtail bids professor snape good day and advises him to wash his hair the slimeball 
 
 harry waited for the blow to fall 
 
 so said snape softly see about this 
 
 he strode across to his fire seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace and threw it into the flames 
 
 lupin snape called into the fire i want a word 
 
 utterly bewildered harry stared at the fire a large shape had appeared in it revolving very fast seconds later professor lupin was clambering out of the fireplace brushing ash off his shabby robes 
 
 you called severus said lupin mildly 
 
 i certainly did said snape his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk i have just asked potter to empty his pockets he was carrying this 
 
 snape pointed at the parchment on which the words of messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs were still shining an odd closed expression appeared on face 
 
 well said snape 
 
 lupin continued to stare at the map harry had the impression that lupin was doing some very quick thinking 
 
 well said snape again this parchment is plainly full of dark magic this is supposed to be your area of expertise lupin where do you imagine potter got such a thing 
 
 lupin looked up and by the merest in direction warned him not to interrupt 
 
 full of dark magic he repeated mildly do you really think so severus it looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it childish but surely not dangerous i imagine harry got it from a joke shop 
 
 indeed said snape his jaw had gone rigid with anger you think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing you think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers 
 
 harry understand what snape was talking about nor apparently did lupin 
 
 you mean by mr wormtail or one of these people he said harry do you know any of these men 
 
 no said harry quickly 
 
 you see severus said lupin turning back to snape it looks like a zonko product to me 
 
 right on cue ron came bursting into the office he was completely out of breath and stopped just short of desk clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak 
 
 i gave harry that stuff he choked bought itin ages ago 
 
 well said lupin clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully that seems to clear that up severus take this back shall i he folded the map and tucked it inside his robes harry ron come with me i need a word about my vampire essay excuse us severus 
 
 harry dare look at snape as they left his office he ron and lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking then harry turned to lupin 
 
 professor i 
 
 i want to hear explanations said lupin shortly he glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice i happen to know that this map was confiscated by mr filch many years ago yes i know a map he said as harry and ron looked amazed i want to know how it fell into your possession i am however astounded that you hand it in particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around and i let you have it back harry 
 
 harry had expected that and was too keen for explanations to protest 
 
 why did snape think got it from the manufacturers 
 
 because lupin hesitated because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school think it extremely entertaining 
 
 do you know them said harry impressed 
 
 met he said shortly he was looking at harry more seriously than ever before 
 
 expect me to cover up for you again harry i cannot make you take sirius black seriously but i would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you your parents gave their lives to keep you alive harry a poor way to repay them gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks 
 
 he walked away leaving harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in office slowly he and ron mounted the marble staircase as harry passed the witch he remembered the invisibility cloak it was still down there but he dare go and get it 
 
 my fault said ron abruptly i persuaded you to go right it was stupid we done it 
 
 he broke off they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing and hermione was walking toward them one look at her face convinced harry that she had heard what had happened his heart plummeted had she told professor mcgonagall 
 
 come to have a good gloat said ron savagely as she stopped in front of them or have you just been to tell on us 
 
 no said hermione she was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling i just thought you ought to knowhagrid lost his case buckbeak is going to be executed

lionfish nov chapter fourteen the unforgivable cursescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the next two days passed without great incident unless you counted neville melting his sixth cauldron in potions professor snape who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer gave neville detention and neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads 
 
 you know why in such a foul mood you said ron to harry as they watched hermione teaching neville a scouring charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails 
 
 yeah said harry moody 
 
 it was common knowledge that snape really wanted the dark arts job and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running snape had disliked all of their previous dark arts teachers and shown it but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to moody indeed whenever harry saw the two of them together at mealtimes or when they passed in the corridors he had the distinct impression that snape was avoiding eye whether magical or normal 
 
 i reckon a bit scared of him you know harry said thoughtfully 
 
 imagine if moody turned snape into a horned toad said ron his eyes misting over and bounced him all around his dungeon 
 
 the gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to first lesson so much that they arrived early on thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung the only person missing was hermione who turned up just in time for the lesson 
 
 been in the 
 
 library harry finished her sentence for her quick or we get decent seats 
 
 they hurried into three chairs right in front of the desk took out their copies of the dark forces a guide to and waited unusually quiet soon they heard distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor and he entered the room looking as strange and frightening as ever they could just see his clawed wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes 
 
 you can put those away he growled stumping over to his desk and sitting down those books you need them 
 
 they returned the books to their bags ron looking excited 
 
 moody took out a register shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face and began to call out names his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around fixing upon each student as he or she answered 
 
 right then he said when the last person had declared themselves present had a letter from professor lupin about this class seems had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling dark creatures covered boggarts red caps hinkypunks grindylows kappas and werewolves is that right 
 
 there was a general murmur of assent 
 
 but behind very behind on dealing with curses said moody so here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other got one year to teach you how to deal with dark 
 
 what you staying ron blurted out 
 
 magical eye spun around to stare at ron ron looked extremely apprehensive but after a moment moody smiled the first time harry had seen him do so the effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever but it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile ron looked deeply relieved 
 
 be arthur son eh moody said your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days staying just the one year special favor to year and then back to my quiet retirement 
 
 he gave a harsh laugh and then clapped his gnarled hands together 
 
 so straight into it curses they come in many strengths and forms now according to the ministry of magic supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that not supposed to show you what illegal dark curses look like until in the sixth year not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then but professor got a higher opinion of your nerves he reckons you can cope and i say the sooner you know what up against the better how are you supposed to defend yourself against something never seen a wizard about to put an illegal curse on you going to tell you what about to do not going to do it nice and polite to your face you need to be prepared you need to be alert and watchful you need to put that away miss brown when talking 
 
 lavender jumped and blushed she had been showing parvati her completed horoscope under the desk apparently magical eye could see through solid wood as well as out of the back of his head 
 
 sodo any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law 
 
 several hands rose tentatively into the air including and moody pointed at ron though his magical eye was still fixed on lavender 
 
 er said ron tentatively my dad told me about it called the imperius curse or something 
 
 ah yes said moody appreciatively your father would know that one gave the ministry a lot of trouble at one time the imperius curse 
 
 moody got heavily to his mismatched feet opened his desk drawer and took out a glass jar three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it harry felt ron recoil slightly next to him ron hated spiders 
 
 moody reached into the jar caught one of the spiders and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it he then pointed his wand at it and muttered imperio 
 
 the spider leapt from hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze it stretched out its legs rigidly then did a back flip breaking the thread and landing on the desk where it began to cartwheel in circles moody jerked his wand and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance 
 
 everyone was laughing everyone except moody 
 
 think funny do you he growled like it would you if i did it to you 
 
 the laughter died away almost instantly 
 
 total control said moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over i could make it jump out of the window drown itself throw itself down one of your throats 
 
 ron gave an involuntary shudder 
 
 years back there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the imperius curse said moody and harry knew he was talking about the days in which voldemort had been some job for the ministry trying to sort out who was being forced to act and who was acting of their own free will 
 
 the imperius curse can be fought and be teaching you how but it takes real strength of character and not got it better avoid being hit with it if you can constant vigilance he barked and everyone jumped 
 
 moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar 
 
 anyone else know one another illegal curse 
 
 hand flew into the air again and so to slight surprise did the only class in which neville usually volunteered information was herbology which was easily his best subject neville looked surprised at his own daring 
 
 yes said moody his magical eye rolling right over to fix on neville 
 
 one the cruciatus curse said neville in a small but distinct voice 
 
 moody was looking very intently at neville this time with both eyes 
 
 your longbottom he said his magical eye swooping down to check the register again 
 
 neville nodded nervously but moody made no further inquiries turning back to the class at large he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop where it remained motionless apparently too scared to move 
 
 the cruciatus curse said moody needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea he said pointing his wand at the spider engorgio 
 
 the spider swelled it was now larger than a tarantula abandoning all pretense ron pushed his chair backward as far away from desk as possible 
 
 moody raised his wand again pointed it at the spider and muttered crucio 
 
 at once the legs bent in upon its body it rolled over and began to twitch horribly rocking from side to side no sound came from it but harry was sure that if it could have given voice it would have been screaming moody did not remove his wand and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently 
 
 stop it hermione said shrilly 
 
 harry looked around at her she was looking not at the spider but at neville and harry following her gaze saw that hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him his knuckles white his eyes wide and horrified 
 
 moody raised his wand the legs relaxed but it continued to twitch 
 
 reducio moody muttered and the spider shrank back to its proper size he put it back into the jar 
 
 pain said moody softly you need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the cruciatus one was very popular once too 
 
 rightanyone know any others 
 
 harry looked around from the looks on faces he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider hand shook slightly as for the third time she raised it into the air 
 
 yes said moody looking at her 
 
 avada kedavra hermione whispered 
 
 several people looked uneasily around at her including ron 
 
 ah said moody another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth yes the last and worst avada killing curse 
 
 he put his hand into the glass jar and almost as though it knew what was coming the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar trying to evade fingers but he trapped it and placed it upon the desktop it started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface 
 
 moody raised his wand and harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding 
 
 avada kedavra moody roared 
 
 there was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound as though a vast invisible something was soaring through the air instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back unmarked but unmistakably dead several of the students stifled cries ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him 
 
 moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor 
 
 not nice he said calmly not pleasant and no countercurse no blocking it only one known person has ever survived it and sitting right in front of me 
 
 harry felt his face redden as eyes both of them looked into his own he could feel everyone else looking around at him too harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it but not really seeing it at all 
 
 so that was how his parents had diedexactly like that spider had they been unblemished and unmarked too had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death before life was wiped from their bodies 
 
 harry had been picturing his parents deaths over and over again for three years now ever since found out they had been murdered ever since found out what had happened that night wormtail had betrayed his parents whereabouts to voldemort who had come to find them at their cottage how voldemort had killed father first how james potter had tried to hold him off while he shouted at his wife to take harry and runvoldemort had advanced on lily potter told her to move aside so that he could kill harryhow she had begged him to kill her instead refused to stop shielding her sonand so voldemort had murdered her too before turning his wand on harry 
 
 harry knew these details because he had heard his parents voices when he had fought the dementors last year for that was the terrible power of the dementors to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives and drown powerless in their own despair 
 
 moody was speaking again from a great distance it seemed to harry with a massive effort he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what moody was saying 
 
 avada a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words and i doubt get so much as a nosebleed but that matter not here to teach you how to do it 
 
 now if no countercurse why am i showing you because got to know got to appreciate what the worst is you want to find yourself in a situation where facing it constant vigilance he roared and the whole class jumped again 
 
 nowthose three curses avada kedavra imperius and cruciatus are known as the unforgivable curses the use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in azkaban what up against what got to teach you to fight you need preparing you need arming but most of all you need to practice constant vigilance get out your quillscopy this down 
 
 they spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the unforgivable curses no one spoke until the bell rang but when moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom a torrent of talk burst forth most people were discussing the curses in awed voices did you see it twitch and when he killed it just like that 
 
 they were talking about the lesson harry thought as though it had been some sort of spectacular show but he found it very entertaining and nor it seemed had hermione 
 
 hurry up she said tensely to harry and ron 
 
 not the ruddy library again said ron 
 
 no said hermione curtly pointing up a side passage neville 
 
 neville was standing alone halfway up the passage staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified look he had worn when moody had demonstrated the cruciatus curse 
 
 neville hermione said gently 
 
 neville looked around 
 
 oh hello he said his voice much higher than usual interesting lesson it i wonder for dinner starving you 
 
 neville are you all right said hermione 
 
 oh yes fine neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice very interesting dinner i mean lesson for eating 
 
 ron gave harry a startled look 
 
 neville what 
 
 but an odd clunking noise sounded behind them and they turned to see professor moody limping toward them all four of them fell silent watching him apprehensively but when he spoke it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard 
 
 all right sonny he said to neville why you come up to my office come onwe can have a cup of tea 
 
 neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with moody he neither moved nor spoke moody turned his magical eye upon harry 
 
 you all right are you potter 
 
 yes said harry almost defiantly 
 
 blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed harry then he said got to know it seems harsh maybe but got to know no point pretendingwellcome on longbottom got some books that might interest you 
 
 neville looked pleadingly at harry ron and hermione but they say anything so neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away one of gnarled hands on his shoulder 
 
 what was that about said ron watching neville and moody turn the corner 
 
 i know said hermione looking pensive 
 
 some lesson though eh said ron to harry as they set off for the great hall fred and george were right they he really knows his stuff moody he when he did avada kedavra the way that spider just died just snuffed it right 
 
 but ron fell suddenly silent at the look on face and speak again until they reached the great hall when he said he supposed they had better make a start on professor predictions tonight since they would take hours 
 
 hermione did not join in with harry and conversation during dinner but ate furiously fast and then left for the library again harry and ron walked back to gryffindor tower and harry who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner now raised the subject of the unforgivable curses himself 
 
 moody and dumbledore be in trouble with the ministry if they knew seen the curses harry asked as they approached the fat lady 
 
 yeah probably said ron but always done things his way he and been getting in trouble for years i reckon attacks first and asks questions later look at his dustbins balderdash 
 
 the fat lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole and they climbed into the gryffindor common room which was crowded and noisy 
 
 shall we get our divination stuff then said harry 
 
 i ron groaned 
 
 they went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts to find neville there alone sitting on his bed reading he looked a good deal calmer than at the end of lesson though still not entirely normal his eyes were rather red 
 
 you all right neville harry asked him 
 
 oh yes said neville fine thanks just reading this book professor moody lent me 
 
 he held up the book magical water plants of the mediterranean 
 
 apparently professor sprout told professor moody really good at herbology neville said there was a faint note of pride in his voice that harry had rarely heard there before he thought like this 
 
 telling neville what professor sprout had said harry thought had been a very tactful way of cheering neville up for neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything it was the sort of thing professor lupin would have done 
 
 harry and ron took their copies of unfogging the future back down to the common room found a table and set to work on their predictions for the coming month an hour later they had made very little progress though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols and brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from professor fire 
 
 i got a clue what this supposed to mean he said staring down at a long list of calculations 
 
 you know said ron whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration i think back to the old divination standby 
 
 what make it up 
 
 yeah said ron sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table dipping his pen into some ink and starting to write 
 
 next monday he said as he scribbled i am likely to develop a cough owing to the unlucky conjunction of mars and jupiter he looked up at harry you know her just put in loads of misery lap it up 
 
 right said harry crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire okayon monday i will be in danger of er burns 
 
 yeah you will be said ron darkly seeing the skrewts again on monday okay tuesday 
 
 lose a treasured possession said harry who was flicking through unfogging the future for ideas 
 
 good one said ron copying it down because ofermmercury why you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend 
 
 yeahcool said harry scribbling it down becausevenus is in the twelfth house 
 
 and on wednesday i think come off worst in a fight 
 
 aaah i was going to have a fight okay lose a bet 
 
 yeah be betting win my fight 
 
 they continued to make up predictions which grew steadily more tragic for another hour while the common room around them slowly emptied as people went up to bed crookshanks wandered over to them leapt lightly into an empty chair and stared inscrutably at harry rather as hermione might look if she knew they doing their homework properly 
 
 staring around the room trying to think of a kind of misfortune he yet used harry saw fred and george sitting together against the opposite wall heads together quills out poring over a single piece of parchment it was most unusual to see fred and george hidden away in a corner and working silently they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention there was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment and harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the burrow he had thought then that it was another order form for weasleys wizard wheezes but it look like that this time if it had been they would surely have let lee jordan in on the joke he wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the triwizard tournament 
 
 as harry watched george shook his head at fred scratched out something with his quill and said in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the almost deserted room no that sounds like accusing him got to be careful 
 
 then george looked over and saw harry watching him harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions he want george to think he was eavesdropping shortly after that the twins rolled up their parchment said good night and went off to bed 
 
 fred and george had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other crookshanks arched his back purring 
 
 hello she said just finished 
 
 so have i said ron triumphantly throwing down his quill 
 
 hermione sat down laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair and pulled predictions toward her 
 
 not going to have a very good month are you she said sardonically as crookshanks curled up in her lap 
 
 ah well at least forewarned ron yawned 
 
 you seem to be drowning twice said hermione 
 
 oh am i said ron peering down at his predictions better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff 
 
 you think a bit obvious made these up said hermione 
 
 how dare you said ron in mock outrage been working like here 
 
 hermione raised her eyebrows 
 
 just an expression said ron hastily 
 
 harry laid down his quill too having just finished predicting his own death by decapitation 
 
 in the box he asked pointing at it 
 
 funny you should ask said hermione with a nasty look at ron she took off the lid and showed them the contents 
 
 inside were about fifty badges all of different colors but all bearing the same letters s p e w 
 
 spew said harry picking up a badge and looking at it this about 
 
 not spew said hermione impatiently stands for the society for the promotion of elfish welfare 
 
 never heard of it said ron 
 
 well of course you said hermione briskly only just started it 
 
 yeah said ron in mild surprise how many members have you got 
 
 well if you two join three said hermione 
 
 and you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying spew do you said ron 
 
 said hermione hotly i was going to put stop the outrageous abuse of our fellow magical creatures and campaign for a change in their legal status but it fit so the heading of our manifesto 
 
 she brandished the sheaf of parchment at them 
 
 been researching it thoroughly in the library elf enslavement goes back centuries i believe no done anything about it before now 
 
 hermione open your ears said ron loudly they like it they like being enslaved 
 
 our aims said hermione speaking even more loudly than ron and acting as though she heard a word are to secure fair wages and working conditions our aims include changing the law about use and trying to get an elf into the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures because shockingly underrepresented 
 
 and how do we do all this harry asked 
 
 we start by recruiting members said hermione happily i thought two sickles to join that buys a badge and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign treasurer ron got you a collecting tin upstairs and harry secretary so you might want to write down everything saying now as a record of our first meeting 
 
 there was a pause in which hermione beamed at the pair of them and harry sat torn between exasperation at hermione and amusement at the look on face the silence was broken not by ron who in any case looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck but by a soft tap tap on the window harry looked across the now empty common room and saw illuminated by the moonlight a snowy owl perched on the windowsill 
 
 hedwig he shouted and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window 
 
 hedwig flew inside soared across the room and landed on the table on top of predictions 
 
 about time said harry hurrying after her 
 
 got an answer said ron excitedly pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to leg 
 
 harry hastily untied it and sat down to read whereupon hedwig fluttered onto his knee hooting softly 
 
 what does it say hermione asked breathlessly 
 
 the letter was very short and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry harry read it aloud 
 
 harry 
 flying north immediately this news about your scar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here if it hurts again go straight to dumbledore saying got out of retirement which means reading the signs even if no one else is 
 be in touch soon my best to ron and hermione keep your eyes open harry 
 sirius 
 harry looked up at ron and hermione who stared back at him 
 
 flying north hermione whispered coming back 
 
 reading what signs said ron looking perplexed harry up 
 
 for harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist jolting hedwig out of his lap 
 
 i told him harry said furiously 
 
 what are you on about said ron in surprise 
 
 made him think got to come back said harry now slamming his fist on the table so that hedwig landed on the back of chair hooting indignantly coming back because he thinks in trouble and nothing wrong with me and i got anything for you harry snapped at hedwig who was clicking her beak expectantly have to go up to the owlery if you want food 
 
 hedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open window cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went 
 
 harry hermione began in a pacifying sort of voice 
 
 going to bed said harry shortly see you in the morning 
 
 upstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his but he feel remotely tired 
 
 if sirius came back and got caught it would be his fault why he kept his mouth shut a few seconds pain and had to just had the sense to keep it to himself 
 
 he heard ron come up into the dormitory a short while later but did not speak to him for a long time harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed the dormitory was completely silent and had he been less preoccupied harry would have realized that the absence of usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter fourteen percy and padfootcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry was first to wake up in his dormitory next morning he lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the ray of sunlight coming through the gap in his hangings and savoured the thought that it was saturday the first week of term seemed to have dragged on for ever like one gigantic history of magic lesson 
 
 judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight it was just after daybreak he pulled open the curtains around his bed got up and started to dress the only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow deep breathing of his fellow gryffindors he opened his schoolbag carefully pulled out parchment and quill and headed out of the dormitory for the common room 
 
 making straight for his favourite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room the detritus of bits of parchment old gobstones empty ingredient jars and sweet wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone as were all elf hats wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not harry uncorked his ink bottle dipped his quill into it then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment thinking hard but after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate at a complete loss for what to say 
 
 he could now appreciate how hard it had been for ron and hermione to write him letters over the summer how was he supposed to tell sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential a lot of information he did not want them to have 
 
 he sat quite motionless for a while gazing into the fireplace then finally coming to a decision he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely on the parchment 
 
 dear snuffles 
 
 hope ok the first week back been terrible really glad the weekend 
 
 got a new defence against the dark arts teacher professor umbridge nearly as nice as your mum writing because that thing i wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when i was doing a detention with umbridge 
 
 all missing our biggest friend we hope be back soon 
 
 please write back quickly 
 
 best 
 
 harry 
 
 harry reread the letter several times trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider he could not see how they would know what he was talking aboutor who he was talking tojust from reading this letter he did hope sirius would pick up the hint about hagrid and tell them when he might be back harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what hagrid might be up to while he was not at hogwarts 
 
 considering it was a very short letter it had taken a long time to write sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above sealing the parchment carefully he climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the owlery 
 
 i would not go that way if i were you said nearly headless nick drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of harry as he walked down the passage peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of paracelsus halfway down the corridor 
 
 does it involve paracelsus falling on top of the head asked harry 
 
 funnily enough it does said nearly headless nick in a bored voice subtlety has never been strong point off to try and find the bloody baron he might be able to put a stop to it see you harry 
 
 yeah bye said harry and instead of turning right he turned left taking a longer but safer route up to the owlery his spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky he had training later he would be back on the quidditch pitch at last 
 
 something brushed his ankles he looked down and saw the skeletal grey cat mrs norris slinking past him she turned lamplike yellow eyes on him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of wilfred the wistful 
 
 not doing anything wrong harry called after her she had the unmistakeable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss yet harry could not see why he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the owlery on a saturday morning 
 
 the sun was high in the sky now and when harry entered the owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters a little restless in the light some clearly just returned from hunting the floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones craning his neck for a sight of hedwig 
 
 there you are he said spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling get down here got a letter for you 
 
 with a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down on to his shoulder 
 
 right i know this says snuffles on the outside he told her giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and without knowing exactly why whispering but for sirius ok 
 
 she blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood 
 
 safe flight then said harry and he carried her to one of the windows with a moments pressure on his arm hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky he watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished then switched his gaze to hut clearly visible from this window and just as clearly uninhabited the chimney smokeless the curtains drawn 
 
 the treetops of the forbidden forest swayed in a light breeze harry watched them savouring the fresh air on his face thinking about quidditch later then he saw it a great reptilian winged hcrse just like the ones pulling the hogwarts carriages with leahery black wings spread wide like a rose up out of the trees like a grotesque giant bird it soared in a great circle then plunged back into the trees the whole thing had happened so quickly harry could hardly believe what he had seen except that his heart was hammering madly 
 
 the owlery door opened behind him he leapt in shock and turning quickly saw cho chang holding a letter and a parcel in his hands 
 
 hi said harry automatically 
 
 oh hi she said breathlessly i think anyone would be up here this early i only remembered five minutes ago my birthday 
 
 she held up the parcel 
 
 right said harry his brain seemed to have jammed he wanted to say something funny and interesting but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his mind 
 
 nice day he said gesturing to the windows his insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment the weather he was talking about the weather 
 
 yeah said cho looking around for a suitable owl good quidditch conditions i been out all week have you 
 
 no said harry 
 
 cho had selected one of the school barn owls she coaxed it down on to her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel 
 
 hey has gryffindor got a new keeper yet she asked 
 
 yeah said harry my friend ron weasley know him 
 
 the said cho rather coolly is he any good 
 
 yeah said harry i think so i see his tryout though i was in detention 
 
 cho looked up the parcel only to the legs 
 
 that umbridge foul she said in a low voice putting you in detention just because you told the truth about howhowhow he died everyone heard about it it was all over the school you were really brave standing up to her like that 
 
 insides so rapidly he felt as though he might actually float a few inches off the floor who cared about a stupid flying horse cho thought he had been really brave for a moment he considered showing her his cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel on to her owl but the very instant this thrilling thought occurred the owlery door opened again 
 
 filch the caretaker came wheezing into the room there were purple patches on his sunken veined cheeks his jowls were aquiver and his thin grey hair dishevelled he had obviously run here mrs norris came trotting at his heels gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily there was a restless shifting of wings from above and a large brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion 
 
 aha said filch taking a step towards harry his pouchy cheeks trembling with anger had a that you are intending to place a massive order for dungbombs 
 
 harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker 
 
 who told you i was ordering dungbombs 
 
 cho was looking from harry to filch also frowning the barn owl on her arm tired of standing on one leg gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it 
 
 i have my sources said filch in a hiss now hand over whatever it is sending 
 
 feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter harry said i gone 
 
 gone said filch his face contorting with rage 
 
 gone said harry calmly 
 
 filch opened his mouth furiously mouthed for a few seconds then raked robes with his eyes 
 
 how do i know you got it in your pocket 
 
 because 
 
 i saw him send it said cho angrily 
 
 filch rounded on her 
 
 you saw him 
 
 right i saw him she said fiercely 
 
 there was a pause in which filch glared at cho and cho glared right back then the caretaker turned on his heel and shuffled back towards the door he stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at harry 
 
 if i get so much as a whiff of a dungbomb 
 
 he stumped off down the stairs mrs norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed him 
 
 harry and cho looked at each other 
 
 thanks harry said 
 
 no problem said cho finally fixing the parcel to the barn other leg her face slightly pink you ordering dungbombs were you 
 
 no said harry 
 
 i wonder why he thought you were then she said as she carried the owl to the window 
 
 harry shrugged he was quite as mystified by that as she was though oddly it was not bothering him very much at the moment 
 
 they left the owlery together at the entrance of a corridor that led towards the west wing of the castle cho said going this see you around harry 
 
 yeah see you 
 
 she smiled at him and departed harry walked on feeling quietly elated he had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once you were really brave standing up to her like that cho had called him brave she did not hate him for being alive 
 
 of course she had preferred cedric he knew that though if only asked her to the ball before cedric had things might have turned out differently she had seemed sincerely sorry that had to refuse when harry asked her 
 
 morning harry said brightly to ron and hermione as he joined them at the gryffindor table in the great hall 
 
 what are you looking so pleased about said ron eyeing harry in surprise 
 
 erm quidditch later said harry happily pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs towards him 
 
 oh yeah said ron he put down the piece of toast he was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice then he said listen you fancy going out a bit earlier with me do you just toergive me some practice before training so i can you know get my eye in a bit 
 
 yeah ok said harry 
 
 look i think you should said hermione seriously both really behind on homework as it 
 
 but she broke off the morning post was arriving and as usual the daily prophet was soaring towards her in the beak of a screech owl which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg hermione pushed a knut into its leather pouch took the newspaper and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off 
 
 anything interesting said ron harry grinned knowing ron was keen to keep her off the subject of homework 
 
 no she sighed just some guff about the bass player in the weird sisters getting married 
 
 hermione opened the paper and disappeared behind it harry devoted himself to another helping of eggs and bacon ron was staring up at the high windows looking slightly preoccupied 
 
 wait a moment said hermione suddenly oh no sirius 
 
 happened said harry snatching at the paper so violently it ripped down the middle with him and hermione each holding one half 
 
 the ministry of magic has received a from a reliable source that sirius black notorious mass murderer blah blah blah is currently hiding in read from her half in an anguished whisper 
 
 lucius malfoy bet anything said harry in a low furious voice he did recognise sirius on the platform 
 
 what said ron looking alarmed you say 
 
 shh said the other two 
 
 ministry warns wizarding community that black is very dangerous killed thirteen people broke out of azkaban the usual rubbish hermione concluded laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully at harry and ron well he just be able to leave the house again all she whispered dumbledore did warn him not to 
 
 harry looked down glumly at the bit of the prophet he had torn off most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for madam robes for all occasions which was apparently having a sale 
 
 hey he said flattening it down so hermione and ron could see it look at this 
 
 got all the robes i want said ron 
 
 no said harry look this little piece here 
 
 ron and hermione bent closer to read it the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column it was headlined 
 
 trespass at ministry 
 
 
 
 sturgis podmore of number two laburnum gardens clapham has appeared in front of the wizcngamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the ministry of magic on st august podmore was arrested by ministry of magic watchwizard eric munch who found him attempting to force his way through a door at one in the morning podmore who refused to speak in his own defence was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in azkaban 
 
 
 
 sturgis podmore said ron slowly that bloke who looks like his been thatched he one of the ord 
 
 ron shh said hermione casting a terrified look around them 
 
 six months in azkaban whispered harry shocked just for trying to get through a door 
 
 be silly it just for trying to get through a door what on earth was he doing at the ministry of magic at one in the morning breathed hermione 
 
 reckon he was doing something for the order ron muttered 
 
 wait a moment said harry slowly sturgis was supposed to come and see us off remember 
 
 the other two looked at him 
 
 yeah he was supposed to be part of our guard going to cross remember and moody was all annoyed because he turn up so he have been on a job for them could he 
 
 well maybe they expect him to get caught said hermione 
 
 it could be a ron exclaimed excitedly nolisten he went on dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look on face the ministry suspects one of lot soi dunnothey lured him to the ministry and he trying to get through a door at all maybe just made something up to get him 
 
 there was a pause while harry and hermione considered this harry thought it seemed hermione on the other hand looked rather impressed 
 
 do you know i be at all surprised if that were true 
 
 she folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully as harry laid down his knife and fork she seemed to come out of a reverie 
 
 right well i think we should tackle that essay for sprout on shrubs first and if lucky be able to start inanimatus conjurus spell before lunch 
 
 harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him upstairs but the sky was a clear exhilarating blue and he had not been on his firebolt for a week 
 
 i mean we can do it tonight said ron as he and harry walked down the sloping lawns towards the quidditch pitch their broomsticks over their shoulders and with dire warnings that they would fail all their owls still ringing in their ears and got tomorrow she gets too worked up about work her trouble there was a pause and he added in a slightly more anxious tone think she meant it when she said we copying from her 
 
 yeah i do said harry still this is important too got to practise if we want to stay on the quidditch team 
 
 yeah right said ron in a heartened tone and we have got plenty of time to do it all 
 
 as they approached the quidditch pitch harry glanced over to his right to where the trees of the forbidden forest were swaying darkly nothing flew out of them the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the owlery tower he had enough to worry about the flying horse doing him any harm he pushed it out of his mind 
 
 they collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work ron guarding the three tall goalposts harry playing chaser and trying to get the quaffle past ron harry thought ron was pretty good he blocked of the goals harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practised after a couple of hours they returned to the castle for lunchduring which hermione made it quite clear she thought they were irresponsiblethen returned to the quidditch pitch for the real training session all their teammates but angelina were already in the changing room when they entered 
 
 all right ron said george winking at him 
 
 yeah said ron who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch 
 
 ready to show us all up ickle prefect said fred emerging from the neck of his quidditch robes a slightly malicious grin on his face 
 
 shut up said ron pulling on his own team robes for the first time they fitted him well considering they had been oliver who was rather broader in the shoulder 
 
 ok everyone said angelina entering from the office already changed get to it alicia and fred if you can just bring out the ball crate for us oh and there are a couple of people out there watching but i want you to just ignore them all right 
 
 something in her casual voice made harry think he might know who the uninvited spectators were and sure enough when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the slytherin quidditch team and assorted who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium 
 
 that riding malfoy called in his sneering drawl why would anyone put a flying charm on a mouldy old log like that 
 
 crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and harry followed him watching his ears turn red from behind 
 
 ignore them he said accelerating to catch up with ron see laughing after we play them 
 
 exactly the attitude i want harry said angelina approvingly soaring around them with the quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team ok everyone going to start with some passes just to warm up the whole team please 
 
 hey johnson with that hairstyle anyway shrieked pansy parkinson from below why would anyone want to look like got worms coming out of their head 
 
 angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and continued calmly spread out then and see what we can do 
 
 harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch ron fell back towards the opposite goal angelina raised the quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to fred who passed to george who passed to harry who passed to ron who dropped it 
 
 the slytherins led by malfoy roared and screamed with laughter ron who had pelted towards the ground to catch the quaffle before it landed pulled out of the dive untidily so that he slipped sideways on his broom and returned to playing height blushing harry saw fred and george exchange looks but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything for which he was grateful 
 
 pass it on ron called angelina as though nothing had happened 
 
 ron threw the quaffle to alicia who passed back to harry who passed to george 
 
 hey potter your scar feeling called malfoy sure you need a lie down it must be what a whole week since you were in the hospital wing a record for you it 
 
 george passed to angelina she to harry who had not been expecting it but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to ron who lunged for it and missed by inches 
 
 come on now ron said angelina crossly as he dived for the ground again chasing the quaffle pay attention 
 
 it would have been hard to say whether face or the quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he again returned to playing height malfoy and the rest of the slytherin team were howling with laughter 
 
 on his third attempt ron caught the quaffle perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight though outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face 
 
 sorry ron groaned zooming forwards to see whether he had done any damage 
 
 get back in position fine barked angelina but as passing to a teammate do try not to knock her off her broom you got bludgers for that 
 
 nose was bleeding down below the slytherins were stamping their feet and jeering fred and george converged on katie 
 
 here take this fred told her handing her something small anc purple from out of his pocket clear it up in no time 
 
 all right called angelina fred george go and get your bats and a bludger ron get up to the goalposts harry release the snitch when i say so going to aim for goal obviously 
 
 harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the snitch 
 
 making a right ear of things he muttered george as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the bludgers and the snitch 
 
 just nervous said harry he was fine when i was practising with him this morning 
 
 yeah well i hope he peaked too soon said fred gloomily 
 
 they returned to the air when angelina blew her whistle harry released the snitch and fred and george let fly the bludger from that moment on harry was barely aware of what the others were doing it was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points to the team and doing so required enormous speed and skill he accelerated rolling and swerving in and out of the chasers the warm autumn air whipping his face and the distant yells of the slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears but too soon the whistle brought him to a halt again 
 
 stopstop stop screamed angelina not covering your middle post 
 
 harry looked round at ron who was hovering in front of the hoop leaving the other two completely unprotected 
 
 oh sorry 
 
 you keep shifting around while watching the chasers said angelina either stay in centre position until you have to move to defend a hoop or else circle the hoops but drift vaguely off to one side how you let in the last three goals 
 
 sorry ron repeated his red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky 
 
 and katie you do something about that nosebleed 
 
 just getting worse said katie thickly attempting to stem the flow with her sleeve 
 
 harry glanced round at fred who was looking anxious and checking his pockets he saw fred pull out something purple examine it for a second and then look round at katie evidently 
 
 well try again said angelina she was ignoring the slytherins who had now set up a chant of gryffindor are losers gryffindor are losers but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless 
 
 this time they had been flying for barely three minutes when angelinas whistle sounded harry who had just sighted the snitch circling the opposite goalpost pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved 
 
 what now he said impatiently to alicia who was nearest 
 
 katie she said shortly 
 
 harry turned and saw angelina fred and george all flying as fast as they could towards katie harry and alicia sped towards her too it was plain that angelina had stopped training just in time katie was now chalk white and covered in blood 
 
 she needs the hospital wing said angelina 
 
 take her said fred sheermight have swallowed a blood blisterpod by mistake 
 
 well no point continuing with no beaters and a chaser gone said angelina glumly as fred and george zoomed off towards the castle supporting katie between them come on go and get changed 
 
 the slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the changing rooms 
 
 how was practice asked hermione rather coolly half an hour later as harry and ron climbed through the portrait hole into the gryffindor common room 
 
 it was harry began 
 
 completely lousy said ron in a hollow voice sinking into a chair beside hermione she looked up at ron and her frost mess seemed to melt 
 
 well it was only your first one she said consolingly bound to take time to 
 
 who said it was me who made it lousy snapped ron 
 
 no one said hermione looking taken aback i thought 
 
 you thought i was bound to be rubbish 
 
 no of course i look you said it was lousy so i just 
 
 going to get started on some homework said ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys dormitories and vanished from sight hermione turned to harry 
 
 was he lousy 
 
 no said harry loyally 
 
 hermione raised her eyebrows 
 
 well i suppose he played better harry muttered but it was only the first training session like you said 
 
 neither harry nor ron seemed to make much headway with their homework that night harry knew ron was too preoccupied with how badly he had performed at quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the gryffindor are losers chant out of his head 
 
 they spent the whole of sunday in the common room buried in heir books while the room around them filled up then emptied it was another clear fine day and most of their fellow gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year by the evening harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull 
 
 you know we probably should try and get more homework done during the week harry muttered to ron as they finally laid aside professor long essay on the inanimatus conjurus spell and turned miserably to professor equally long and difficult essay about many moons 
 
 yeah said ron rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them listen shall we just ask hermione if we can have a look at what done 
 
 harry glanced over at her she was sitting with crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks 
 
 no he said heavily you know she let us 
 
 and so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker slowly the crowd in the common room began to thin again at half past eleven hermione wandered over to them yawning 
 
 nearly done 
 
 no said ron shortly 
 
 biggest moon is ganymede not callisto she said pointing over shoulder at a line in his astronomy essay and io got the volcanoes 
 
 thanks snarled ron scratching out the offending sentences 
 
 sorry i only 
 
 yeah well if just come over here to criticise 
 
 ron 
 
 i got time to listen to a sermon all right hermione up to my neck in it here 
 
 nolook 
 
 hermione was pointing to the nearest window harry and ron both looked over a handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill gazing into the room at ron 
 
 that hermes said hermione sounding amazed 
 
 blimey it is said ron quietly throwing down his quill and getting to his feet percy writing to me for 
 
 he crossed to the window and opened it hermes flew inside landed on essay and held out a leg to which a letter was attached ron took the letter off it and the owl departed at once leaving inky footprints across drawing of the moon io 
 
 definitely handwriting said ron sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll ronald weasley gryffindor house hogwarts he looked up at the other two what reckon 
 
 open it said hermione eagerly and harry nodded 
 
 ron unrolled the scroll and began to read the further clown the parchment his eyes travelled the more pronounced became his scowl when he had finished reading he looked disgusted he thrust the letter at harry and hermione who leaned towards each other to read it together 
 
 dear ron 
 
 i have only just heard from no less a person than the minister for magic himself who has it from your new teacher professor umbridge that you have become a hogwarts prefect 
 
 i was most pleasantly surprised when f heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations i must admit that i have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the fred and george route rather than following in my footsteps so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility 
 
 but i want to give you more than congratulations ron i want to give you some advice which is why i am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post hopefully you will be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions 
 
 from something the minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect i gather that you are still seeing a lot of harry potter i must tell you ron that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternisation with that boy yes i am sure you are surprised to hear this no doubt you will say that potter has always been favouritebut i feel bound to tell you that dumbledore may not be in charge at hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very differentand probably more accurateview of behaviour i shall say no more here but if you look at the daily prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowingand see if you can spot yours truly 
 
 seriously ron you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as potter it could be very damaging to your future prospects and i am talking here about life after school too as you must be aware given that our father escorted him to court potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good he got off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the people spoken to remain convinced of his guilt 
 
 it may be that you are afraid to sever ties with potteri know that he can be unbalanced and for all i know violentbut if you have any worries about this or have spotted anything else in behaviour that is troubling you i urge you to speak to dolores umbridge a truly delightful woman who i know will be only too happy to advise you 
 
 this leads me to my other bit of advice as i have hinted above regime at hogwarts may soon be over your loyalty ron should be not to him but to the school and the ministry i am very sorry to hear that so far professor umbridge is encountering very little from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes within hogwarts that the ministry so ardently desires although she should find this easier from next week again see the daily prophet tomorrow i shall say only thisa student who shows himself willing to help professor umbridge now may be very for head boyship in a couple of years 
 
 i am sorry that i was unable to see more of you over the summer it pains me to criticise our parents but i am afraid i can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around dumbledore if you are writing to mother at any point you might tell her that a certain sturgis podmore who is a great friend of has recently been sent to azkaban for trespass at the ministry perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders i count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such peoplethe minister really could not be more gracious to meand i do hope ron that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents beliefs and actions either i sincerely hope that in time they will realise how mistaken they were and i shall of course be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes 
 
 please think over what i have said most carefully particularly the bit about harry potter and congratulations again on becoming prefect 
 
 your brother 
 
 percy 
 
 harry looked up at ron 
 
 well he said trying to sound as though he found the whole thing a joke if you want toer what is checked ties with me i swear i get violent 
 
 give it back said ron holding out his hand he is ron said jerkily tearing letter in half the he tore it into quarters biggest he tore it into eighths git he threw the pieces into the fire 
 
 come on got to get this finished sometime before dawn he said briskly to harry pulling professor essay back towards him 
 
 hermione was looking at ron with an odd expression on her face 
 
 oh give them here she said abruptly 
 
 what said ron 
 
 give them to me look through them and correct them she said 
 
 are you serious ah hermione a said ron what can i 
 
 what you can say is we promise never leave our homework this late again she said holding out both hands for their essays but she looked slightly amused all the same 
 
 thanks a million hermione said harry weakly passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair rubbing his eyes 
 
 it was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and crookshanks the only sound was that of quill scratching out sentences here and there on their essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table harry was exhausted he also felt an odd sick empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire 
 
 he knew that half the people inside hogwarts thought him strange even mad he knew that the daily prophet had been making snide allusions to him for months but there was something about seeing it written down like that in writing about knowing that percy was advising ron to drop him and even to tell tales about him to umbridge that made his situation real to him as nothing else had he had known percy for four years had stayed in his house during the summer holidays shared a tent with him during the quidditch world cup had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the triwizard tournament last year yet now percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent 
 
 and with a surge of sympathy for his godfather harry thought sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment because sirius was in the same situation nearly everyone in the wizarding world thought sirius a dangerous murderer and a great voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years 
 
 harry blinked he had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there it had flashed into sight and vanished immediately no it could not have been he had imagined it because he had been thinking about sirius 
 
 ok write that down hermione said to ron pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to ron then add this conclusion written for you 
 
 hermione you are honestly the most wonderful person ever met said ron weakly and if ever rude to you again 
 
 know back to normal said hermione harry yours is ok except for this bit at the end i think you must have misheard professor sinistra covered in ice not miceharry 
 
 harry had slid off his chair on to his knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug gazing into the flames 
 
 erharry said ron uncertainly why are you down there 
 
 because just seen head in the fire said harry 
 
 he spoke quite calmly after all he had seen head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it too nevertheless he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time it had vanished so quickly 
 
 head hermione repeated you mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the triwizard tournament but he do that now it would be toosirius 
 
 she gasped gazing at the fire ron dropped his quill there in the middle of the dancing flames sat head long dark hair failing around his grinning face 
 
 i was starting to think go to bed before everyone else had disappeared he said been checking every hour 
 
 been popping into the fire every hour harry said 
 
 just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear 
 
 but what if been seen said hermione anxiously 
 
 well i think a by the look of get a glimpse of me earlier but worry sirius said hastily as hermione clapped a hand to her mouth i was gone the moment she looked back at me and bet she just thought i was an log or something 
 
 but sirius this is taking an awful risk hermione began 
 
 you sound like molly said sirius this was the only way i could come up with of answering letter without resorting to a codeand codes are breakable 
 
 at the mention of letter hermione and ron both turned to stare at him 
 
 you say written to sirius said hermione accusingly 
 
 i forgot said harry which was perfectly true his meeting with cho in the owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind look at me like that hermione there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it was there sirius 
 
 no it was very good said sirius smiling anyway better be quick just in case disturbedyour scar 
 
 what about ron began but hermione interrupted him 
 
 tell you afterwards go on sirius 
 
 well i know it be fun when it hurts but we think its anything to really worry about it kept aching all last year it 
 
 yeah and dumbledore said it happened whenever voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion said harry ignoring as usual ron and winces so maybe he was just i dunno really angry or something the night i had that detention 
 
 well now back bound to hurt more often said sirius 
 
 so you think it had anything to do with umbridge touching me when i was in detention with her harry asked 
 
 i doubt it said sirius i know her by reputation and sure no death eater 
 
 foul enough to be one said harry darkly and ron and hermione nodded vigorously in agreement 
 
 yes but the world split into good people and death eaters said sirius with a wry smile i know a nasty piece of work thoughyou should hear remus talk about her 
 
 does lupin know her asked harry quickly remembering comments about dangerous during her first lesson 
 
 no said sirius but she drafted a bit of legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job 
 
 harry remembered how much shabbier lupin looked these days and his dislike of umbridge deepened even further 
 
 she got against werewolves said hermione angrily 
 
 scared of them i expect said sirius smiling at her indignation apparently she loathes she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year too imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like kreacher on the loose 
 
 ron laughed but hermione looked upset 
 
 sirius she said reproachfully honestly if you made a bit of an effort with kreacher sure respond after all you are the only member of his family got left and professor dumbledore said 
 
 so what are lessons like sirius interrupted is she training you all to kill 
 
 no said harry ignoring affronted look at being cut off in her defence of kreacher not letting us use magic at all 
 
 all we do is read the stupid textbook said ron 
 
 ah well that figures said sirius our information from inside the ministry is that fudge want you trained in combat 
 
 trained in combat repeated harry incredulously what does he think doing here forming some sort of wizard army 
 
 exactly what he thinks doing said sirius or rather exactly what afraid doingforming his own private army with which he will be able to take on the ministry of magic 
 
 there was a pause at this then ron said the most stupid thing ever heard including all the stuff that luna lovegood comes out with 
 
 so being prevented from learning defence against the dark arts because fudge is scared use spells against the ministry said hermione looking furious 
 
 yep said sirius fudge thinks dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power getting more paranoid about dumbledore by the day a matter of time before he has dumbledore arrested on some charge 
 
 this reminded harry of letter 
 
 know if going to be anything about dumbledore in the daily prophet tomorrow brother percy reckons there will be 
 
 i know said sirius i seen anyone from the order all weekend all busy just been kreacher and me here 
 
 there was a definite note of bitterness in voice 
 
 so you had any news about hagrid either 
 
 ah said sirius well he was supposed to be back by now no sure happened to him then seeing their stricken faces he added quickly but not worried so you three get yourselves in a state sure fine 
 
 but if he was supposed to be back by now said hermione in a small anxious voice 
 
 madame maxime was with him been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey homebut nothing to suggest hurt orwell nothing to suggest not perfectly ok 
 
 unconvinced harry ron and hermione exchanged worried looks 
 
 listen go asking too many questions about hagrid said sirius hastily just draw even more attention to the fact that not back and i know dumbledore want that tough be ok and when they did not appear cheered by this sirius added your next hogsmeade weekend anyway i was thinking we got away with the dog disguise at the station we i thought i could 
 
 no said harry and hermione together very loudly 
 
 sirius you see the daily prophet said hermione anxiously 
 
 oh that said sirius grinning always guessing where i am they really got a clue 
 
 yeah but we think this time they have said harry something malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you and his father was on the platform sirius you know lucius malfoyso come up here whatever you do if malfoy recognises you again 
 
 all right all right got the point said sirius he looked most displeased just an idea thought you might like to get together 
 
 i would i just want you chucked back in azkaban said harry 
 
 there was a pause in which sirius looked out of the fire at harry a crease between his sunken eyes 
 
 less like your father than i thought he said finally a definite coolness in his voice the risk been what made it fun for james 
 
 look 
 
 well better get going i can hear kreacher coming down the stairs said sirius but harry was sure he was lying write to tell you a time i can make it back into the fire then shall i if you can stand to risk it 
 
 there was a tiny pop and the place where head had been was flickering flame once more 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter fourteen felix feliciscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry had herbology first thing the following morning he had been unable to tell ron and hermione about his lesson with dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses the brutal wind had died out at last the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse 
 
 wow scary thought the boy said ron quietly as they took their places around one of the gnarled snargaluff stumps that formed this project and began pulling on their protective gloves but i still get why showing you all this i mean really interesting and everything but the point 
 
 dunno said harry inserting a gum shield but he says its all important and help me survive 
 
 i think fascinating said hermione earnestly it makes absolute sense to know as much about voldemort as possible how else will you find out his weaknesses 
 
 so how was latest party harry asked her thickly through the gum shield 
 
 oh it was quite fun really said hermione now putting on protective goggles i mean he drones on about famous exploits a bit and he absolutely fawns on mclaggen because so well connected but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to gwenog jones 
 
 gwenog jones said ron his eyes widening under his own goggles the gwenog jones captain of the holyhead harpies 
 
 right said hermione personally i thought she was a bit full of herself but 
 
 quite enough chat over here said professor sprout briskly bustling over and looking stern lagging behind everybody else has started and already got his first pod 
 
 they looked around sure enough there sat neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit 
 
 okay professor starting now said ron adding quietly when she had turned away again used muffliato harry 
 
 no we said hermione at once looking as she always did intensely cross at the thought of the prince and his spells well come on better get going 
 
 she gave the other two an apprehensive look they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them 
 
 it sprang to life at once long prickly vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air one tangled itself in hair and ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together a hole opened in the middle of all the branches hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole which closed like a trap around her elbow harry and ron tugged and wrenched at the vines forcing the hole to open again and hermione snatched her arm free clutching in her fingers a pod just like at once the prickly vines shot back inside and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood 
 
 you know i think be having any of these in my garden when got my own place said ron pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face 
 
 pass me a bowl said hermione holding the pulsating pod at length harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face 
 
 be squeamish squeeze it out best when fresh called professor sprout 
 
 anyway said hermione continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them going to have a christmas party harry and no way be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come 
 
 harry groaned meanwhile ron who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it standing up and squashing it as hard as he could said angrily and this is another party just for favorites is it 
 
 just for the slug club yes said hermione 
 
 the pod flew out from under fingers and hit the green house glass rebounding onto the back of professor head and knocking off her old patched hat harry went to retrieve the pod when he got back hermione was saying look i make up the name slug club 
 
 slug club repeated ron with a sneer worthy of malfoy pathetic well i hope you enjoy your party why you try hooking up with mclaggen then slughorn can make you king and queen slug 
 
 allowed to bring guests said hermione who for some reason had turned a bright boiling scarlet and i was going to ask you to come but if you think that stupid then i bother 
 
 harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them unnoticed by either he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of unfortunately he could still hear every word of their conversation 
 
 you were going to ask me asked ron in a completely different voice 
 
 yes said hermione angrily but obviously if rather i hooked up with mclaggen 
 
 there was a pause while harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel 
 
 no i said ron in a very quiet voice 
 
 harry missed the pod hit the bowl and shattered it 
 
 reparo he said hastily poking the pieces with his wand and the bowl sprang back together again the crash however appeared to have awoken ron and hermione to presence hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of trees of the world to find out the correct way to juice snargaluff pods ron on the other hand looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself 
 
 hand that over harry said hermione hurriedly it says supposed to puncture them with something sharp 
 
 harry passed her the pod in the bowl he and ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived once more for the stump 
 
 it was not as though he was really surprised thought harry as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later but he was not sure how he felt about it he and cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other let alone talk to each other what if ron and hermione started going out together then split up could their friendship survive it harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them and then what if they split up what if they became like bill and fleur and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence so that he was shut out for good 
 
 gotcha yelled ron pulling a second pod from the stump just as hermione managed to burst the first one open so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms 
 
 the rest of the lesson passed without further mention of party although harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days ron and hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer in dimly lit room on the night of the party in the meantime however he had more pressing worries 
 
 katie bell was still in st hospital with no prospect of leaving which meant that the promising gryffindor team harry had been training so carefully since september was one chaser short he kept putting off replacing katie in the hope that she would return but their opening match against slytherin was looming and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play 
 
 harry did not think he could stand another tryout with a sinking feeling that had little to do with quidditch he cornered dean thomas after transfiguration one day most of the class had already left although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room all of creation nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air 
 
 are you still interested in playing chaser 
 
 why yeah of course said dean excitedly over shoulder harry saw seamus finnegan slamming his books into his bag looking sour one of the reasons why harry would have preferred not to have to ask dean to play was that he knew seamus would not like it on the other hand he had to do what was best for the team and dean had outflown seamus at the tryouts 
 
 well then in said harry a practice tonight seven 
 
 right said dean cheers harry blimey i wait to tell ginny 
 
 he sprinted out of the room leaving harry and seamus alone together an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on head as one of canaries whizzed over them 
 
 seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of substitute there was much muttering in the common room about the fact that harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team as harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career he was not particularly bothered but all the same the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against slytherin if gryffindor won harry knew that the whole house would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team if they lost well harry thought wryly he had still endured worse mutterings 
 
 harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw dean fly that evening he worked well with ginny and demelza the beaters peakes and coote were getting better all the time the only problem was ron 
 
 harry had known all along that ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence and unfortunately the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities after letting in half a dozen goals most of them scored by ginny his technique became wilder and wilder until he finally punched an oncoming demelza robins in the mouth 
 
 it was an accident sorry demelza really sorry ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground dripping blood everywhere i just 
 
 panicked ginny said angrily landing next to demelza and examining her fat lip you prat ron look at the state of her 
 
 i can fix that said harry landing beside the two girls pointing his wand at demelzas mouth and saying episkey and ginny call ron a prat not the captain of this team 
 
 well you seemed too busy to call him a prat and i thought someone should 
 
 harry forced himself not to laugh 
 
 in the air everyone go 
 
 overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term though harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match 
 
 good work everyone i think flatten slytherin he said bracingly and the chasers and beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves 
 
 i played like a sack of dragon dung said ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind ginny 
 
 no you said harry firmly the best keeper i tried out ron your only problem is nerves 
 
 he kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle and by the time they reached the second floor ron was looking marginally more cheerful when harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to gryffindor tower however they found themselves looking at dean and ginny who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together 
 
 it was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in stomach clawing at his insides hot blood seemed to flood his brain so that all thought was extinguished replaced by a savage urge to jinx dean into a jelly wrestling with this sudden madness he heard voice as though from a great distance away 
 
 oi 
 
 dean and ginny broke apart and looked around 
 
 what said ginny 
 
 i want to find my own sister snogging people in public 
 
 this was a deserted corridor till you came butting in said ginny 
 
 dean was looking embarrassed he gave harry a shifty grin that harry did not return as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for instant dismissal from the team 
 
 er ginny said dean go back to the common room 
 
 you go said ginny i want a word with my dear brother 
 
 dean left looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene 
 
 right said ginny tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at ron get this straight once and for all it is none of your business who i go out with or what i do with them ron 
 
 yeah it is said ron just as angrily d you think i want people saying my a 
 
 a what shouted ginny drawing her wand a what exactly 
 
 he mean anything ginny said harry automatically though the monster was roaring its approval of words 
 
 oh yes he does she said flaring up at harry just because never snogged anyone in his life just because the best kiss ever had is from our auntie muriel 
 
 shut your mouth bellowed ron bypassing red and turning maroon 
 
 no i will not yelled ginny beside herself seen you with phlegm hoping kiss you on the cheek every time you see her pathetic if you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself you mind so much that everyone else does it 
 
 ron had pulled out his wand too harry stepped swiftly between them 
 
 you know what talking about ron roared trying to get a clear shot at ginny around harry who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched just because i do it in public 
 
 ginny screamed with derisive laughter trying to push harry out of the way 
 
 been kissing pigwidgeon have you or have you got a picture of auntie muriel stashed under your pillow you 
 
 a streak of orange light flew under left arm and missed ginny by inches harry pushed ron up against the wall 
 
 be stupid 
 
 snogged cho chang shouted ginny who sounded close to tears now and hermione snogged viktor krum only you who acts like something disgusting ron and because got about as much experience as a 
 
 and with that she stormed away harry quickly let go of ron the look on his face was murderous they both stood there breathing heavily until mrs norris cat appeared around the corner which broke the tension 
 
 said harry as the sound of shuffling feet reached their ears 
 
 they hurried up the stairs and along a corridor oi out of the way ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of 
 
 harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass he felt disoriented dizzy being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this just because sister he told himself you just like seeing her kissing dean because sister 
 
 but unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing ginny instead the monster in his chest purred but then he saw ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on harry shouting things like betrayal of trust supposed to be my friend 
 
 think hermione did snog krum ron asked abruptly as they approached the fat lady harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no ron intruded in which he and ginny were quite alone 
 
 what he said confusedly oh er 
 
 the honest answer was yes but he did not want to give it however ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on face 
 
 dilligrout he said darkly to the fat lady and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room 
 
 neither of them mentioned ginny or hermione again indeed they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence each absorbed in his own thoughts 
 
 harry lay awake for a long time looking up at the canopy of his and trying to convince himself that his feelings for ginny were entirely they had lived had they not like brother and sister all summer playing quidditch teasing ron and having a laugh about bill and phlegm he had known ginny for years now it was natural that he should feel protective natural that he should want to look out for her want to rip dean limb from limb for kissing her no he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling 
 
 ron gave a great grunting snore 
 
 sister harry told himself firmly sister he would not risk his friendship with ron for anything he punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near ginny 
 
 harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which ron had chased him with a bat but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream ron for the real one who was not only ginny and dean but also treating a hurt and bewildered hermione with an icy sneering indifference what was more ron seemed to have become overnight as touchy and ready to lash out as the average skrewt harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between ron and hermione with no success finally hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon and ron stalked off to the boys dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened for looking at him 
 
 to dismay new aggression did not wear off over the next few days worse still it coincided with an even deeper dip in his keeping skills which made him still more aggressive so that during the final quidditch practice before match he failed to save every single goal the chasers aimed at him but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced demelza robins to tears 
 
 you shut up and leave her alone shouted peakes who was about height though admittedly carrying a heavy bat 
 
 enough bellowed harry who had seen ginny glowering in direction and remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the hex soared over to intervene before things got out of hand peakes go and pack up the bludgers demelza pull yourself together you played really well today ron he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it my best mate but carry on treating the rest of them like this and going to kick you off the team 
 
 he really thought for a moment that ron might hit him but then something much worse happened ron seemed to sag on his broom all the fight went out of him and he said i resign pathetic 
 
 not pathetic and not resigning said harry fiercely seizing ron by the front of his robes you can save anything when on form a mental problem got 
 
 you calling me mental 
 
 yeah maybe i am 
 
 they glared at each other for a moment then ron shook his head wearily 
 
 i know you got any time to find another keeper so play tomorrow but if we lose and we will taking myself off the team 
 
 nothing harry said made any difference he tried boosting confidence all through dinner but ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with hermione to notice harry persisted in the common room that evening but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner clearly muttering about ron and casting him nasty looks finally harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking ron into a defiant and hopefully attitude but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever 
 
 harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness he did not want to lose the upcoming match not only was it his first as captain but he was determined to beat draco malfoy at quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him yet if ron played as he had done in the last few practices their chances of winning were very slim 
 
 if only there was something he could do to make ron pull himself together make him play at the top of his form something that would ensure that ron had a really good day 
 
 and the answer came to harry in one sudden glorious stroke of inspiration 
 
 breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning the slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the gryffindor team entered the great hall harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear pale blue sky a good omen 
 
 the gryffindor table a solid mass of red and gold cheered as harry and ron approached harry grinned and waved ron grimaced weakly and shook his head 
 
 cheer up ron called lavender i know be brilliant 
 
 ron ignored her 
 
 tea harry asked him coffee pumpkin juice 
 
 anything said ron glumly taking a moody bite of toast 
 
 a few minutes later hermione who had become so tired of recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them paused on her way up the table 
 
 how are you both feeling she asked tentatively her eyes on the back of head 
 
 fine said harry who was concentrating on handing ron a glass of pumpkin juice there you go ron drink up 
 
 ron had just raised the glass to his lips when hermione spoke sharply 
 
 drink that ron 
 
 both harry and ron looked up at her 
 
 why not said ron 
 
 hermione was now staring at harry as though she could not believe her eyes 
 
 you just put something in that drink 
 
 excuse me said harry 
 
 you heard me i saw you you just tipped something into drink got the bottle in your hand right now 
 
 i dont know what talking about said harry stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket 
 
 ron i warn you drink it hermione said again alarmed but ron picked up the glass drained it in one gulp and said stop bossing me around hermione 
 
 she looked scandalized bending low so that only harry could hear her she hissed you should be expelled for that never have believed it of you harry 
 
 look talking he whispered back confunded anyone lately 
 
 she stormed up the table away from them harry watched her go without regret hermione had never really understood what a serious business quidditch was he then looked around at ron who was smacking his lips 
 
 nearly time said harry blithely 
 
 the frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium 
 
 pretty lucky the weathers this good eh harry asked ron 
 
 yeah said ron who was pale and 
 
 ginny and demelza were already wearing their quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room 
 
 conditions look ideal said ginny ignoring ron and guess what that slytherin chaser vaisey he took a bludger in the head yesterday during their practice and too sore to play and even better than gone off sick too 
 
 what said harry wheeling around to stare at her ill wrong with him 
 
 no idea but great for us said ginny brightly playing harper instead in my year and an idiot 
 
 harry smiled back vaguely but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from quidditch malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the slytherins better why was he now happy to let a substitute go on was he really ill or was he faking 
 
 fishy it he said in an undertone to ron malfoy not playing 
 
 lucky i call it said ron looking slightly more animated and vaisey off too their best goal scorer i fancyhey he said suddenly freezing halfway through pulling on his keepers gloves and staring at harry 
 
 what 
 
 i you ron had dropped his voice he looked both scared and excited my drink my pumpkin juice you 
 
 harry raised his eyebrows but said nothing except be starting in about five minutes better get your boots on 
 
 they walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos one end of the stadium was solid red and gold the other a sea of green and silver many hufflepuffs and ravenclaws had taken sides too amidst all the yelling and clapping harry could distinctly hear the roar of luna famous hat 
 
 harry stepped up to madam hooch the referee who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate 
 
 captains shake hands she said and harry had his hand crushed by the new slytherin captain urquhart mount your brooms on the whistle three two one 
 
 the whistle sounded harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground and they were away 
 
 harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds looking around for the snitch and keeping one eye on harper who was zigzagging far below him then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual started up 
 
 well there they go and i think all surprised to see the team that put together this year many thought given ronald patchy performance as keeper last year that he might be off the team but of course a close personal friendship with the captain does help 
 
 these words were greeted with jeers and applause from the slytherin end of the pitch harry craned around on his broom to look toward the podium a call skinny blond buy with an upturned nose was standing there talking into the magical megaphone that had once been lee harry recognized zacharias smith a hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked 
 
 oh and here comes first attempt on goal urquhart streaking down the pitch and 
 
 stomach turned over 
 
 weasley saves it well bound to get lucky sometimes i suppose 
 
 right smith he is muttered harry grinning to himself as he dived amongst the chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive snitch 
 
 with half an hour of the game gone gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero ron having made some truly spectacular saves some by the very tips of his gloves and ginny having scored four of six goals this effectively stopped zacharias wondering loudly whether the two weasleys were only there because harry liked them and he started on peakes and coote instead 
 
 of course coote really the usual build for a beater said zacharias loftily generally got a bit more muscle 
 
 hit a bludger at him harry called to coote as he zoomed past but coote grinning broadly chose to aim the next bludger at harper instead who was just passing harry in the opposite direction harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the bludger had found its mark 
 
 it seemed as though gryffindor could do no wrong again and again they scored and again and again at the other end of the pitch ron saved goals with apparent ease he was actually smiling now and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a rousing chorus of the old favorite weasley is our king he pretended to conduct them from on high 
 
 thinks something special today he said a snide voice and harry was nearly knocked off his broom as harper collided with him hard and deliberately your pal 
 
 madam back was turned and though gryffindors below shouted in anger by the time she looked around harper had already sped off his shoulder aching harry raced after him determined to ram him back 
 
 and i think harper of seen the snitch said zacharias smith through his megaphone yes certainly seen something potter 
 
 smith really was an idiot thought harry he noticed them collide but next moment his stomach seemed to drop out of the skysmith was right and harry was wrong harper had not sped upward at random he had spotted what harry had not the snitch was speeding along high above them glinting brightly against the clear blue sky 
 
 harry accelerated the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of commentary or the crowd but harper was still ahead of him and gryffindor was only a hundred points up if harper got there first gryffindor had lost and now harper was feet from it his hand outstretched 
 
 oi harper yelled harry in desperation how much did malfoy pay you to come on instead of him 
 
 he did not know what made him say it but harper did a he fumbled the snitch let it slip through his fingers and shot right past it harry made a great swipe for the tiny fluttering ball and caught it 
 
 yes hairy yelled wheeling around he hurtled back toward the ground the snitch held high in his hand as the crowd realized what had happened a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game 
 
 ginny you going yelled harry who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team but ginny sped right on past them until with an almighty crash she collided with the podium as the crowd shrieked and laughed the gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which zacharias was feebly stirring harry heard ginny saying blithely to an irate professor mcgonagall forgot to brake professor sorry 
 
 laughing harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged ginny but let go very quickly avoiding her gaze he clapped cheering ron on the back instead as all enmity forgotten the gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm punching the air and waving to their supporters 
 
 the atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant party up in the common room seamus said yelled dean exuberantly ginny demelza 
 
 ron and harry were the last two in the changing room they were just about to leave when hermione entered she was twisting her gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined 
 
 i want a word with you harry she took a deep breath you have done it you heard slughorn illegal 
 
 what are you going to do turn us in demanded ron 
 
 what are you two talking about asked harry turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning 
 
 you know perfectly well what talking about said hermione shrilly you spiked juice with lucky potion at breakfast felix felicis 
 
 no i said harry turning back to face them both 
 
 yes you did harry and why everything went right there were slytherin players missing and ron saved everything 
 
 i put it in said harry grinning broadly he slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that hermione had seen in his hand that morning it was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax i wanted ron to think done it so i faked it when i knew you were looking he looked at ron you saved everything because you felt lucky you did it all yourself 
 
 he pocketed the potion again 
 
 there really anything in my pumpkin juice ron said astounded but the good and vaisey play i honestly been given lucky potion 
 
 harry shook his head ron gaped at him for a moment then rounded on hermione imitating her voice 
 
 you added felix felicis to juice this morning why he saved everything see i can save goals without help hermione 
 
 i never said you ron you thought been given it too 
 
 but ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder 
 
 er said harry into the sudden silence he had not expected his plan to backfire like this shall shall we go up to the party then 
 
 you go said hermione blinking back tears sick of ron at the moment i know what supposed to have done 
 
 and she stormed out of the changing room too 
 
 harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd many of whom shouted congratulations at him but he felt a great sense of he had been sure that if ron won the match he and hermione would be friends again immediately he did not see how he could possibly explain to hermione that what she had done to offend ron was kiss viktor krum not when the offense had occurred so long ago 
 
 harry could not see hermione at the gryffindor celebration party which was in full swing when he arrived renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him what with trying to shake off the creevey brothers who wanted a match analysis and the large group of girls that encircled him laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids it was some time before he could try and find ron at last he extricated himself from romilda vane who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to christmas party with him as he was ducking toward the drinks table he walked straight into ginny arnold the pygmy puff riding on her shoulder and crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels 
 
 looking for ron she asked smirking over there the filthy hypocrite 
 
 harry looked into the corner she was indicating there in full view of the whole room stood ron wrapped so closely around lavender brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose 
 
 it looks like eating her face it said ginny dispassionately but i suppose got to refine his technique somehow good game harry 
 
 she patted him on the arm harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer crookshanks trotted after her his yellow eyes fixed upon arnold 
 
 harry turned away from ron who did not look like he would be surfacing soon just as the portrait hole was closing with a sinking feeling he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight 
 
 he darted forward sidestepped romilda vane again and pushed open the portrait of the fat lady the corridor outside seemed to be deserted 
 
 hermione 
 
 he found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried she was sitting on the desk alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head which she had clearly just conjured out of midair harry could not help admiring her at a time like this 
 
 oh hello harry she said in a brittle voice i was just practicing 
 
 yeah really good said harry 
 
 he had no idea what to say to her he was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed ron that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy when she said in an unnaturally voice ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations 
 
 er does he said harry 
 
 pretend you see him said hermione he exactly hiding it was 
 
 the door behind them burst open to horror ron came in laughing pulling lavender by the hand 
 
 oh he said drawing up short at the sight of harry and hermione 
 
 oops said lavender and she backed out of the room giggling the door swung shut behind her 
 
 there was a horrible swelling billowing silence hermione was staring at ron who refused to look at her but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness hi harry wondered where got to 
 
 hermione slid off the desk the little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange feathery model of the solar system 
 
 you leave lavender waiting outside she said quietly wonder where gone 
 
 she walked very slowly and erectly toward the door harry glanced at ron who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened 
 
 oppugno came a shriek from the doorway 
 
 harry spun around to see hermione pointing her wand at ron her expression wild the little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward ron who yelped and covered his face with his hands but the birds attacked pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach 
 
 gerremoffme he yelled but with one last look of vindictive fury hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter fourteen the thiefcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green he had no idea what had happened he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened he blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him then an object twitched close to his face he pushed himself onto his hands and knees ready to face some small fierce creature but saw that the object was rons foot looking around harry saw that they and hermione were lying on a forest floor apparently alone 
 
 harrys first thought was of the forbidden forest and for a moment even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of hogwarts his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to hagrids hut however in the few moments it took for ron to give a low groan and harry to start crawling toward him he realized that this was not the forbidden forest the trees looked younger they were more widely spaced the ground clearer 
 
 he met hermione also on her hands and knees at rons head the moment his eyes fell upon ron all other concerns fled harrys mind for blood drenched the whole of rons left side and his face stood out against the earth the polyjuice potion was wearing off now ron was halfway between cattermole and himself in appearance his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it had left 
 
 whats happened to him 
 
 splinched said hermione her fingers already busy at rons sleeve where the blood was wettest and darkest 
 
 harry watched horrified as she tore open rons short he had always thought of splinching as something comical but this his insides crawled unpleasantly as hermione laid bare rons upper arm where a great chunk of flesh was missing scooped cleanly away as though by a knife 
 
 harry quickly in my bag theres a small bottle labeled essence of dittanyc 
 
 bag c right c 
 
 harry sped to the place where hermione had landed seized the tiny beaded bag and thrust his hand inside it at once object after object began presenting itself to his touch he felt the leather spines of books woolly sleeves of jumpers heels of shoes c 
 
 quickly 
 
 he grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag 
 
 accio dittany 
 
 a small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag he caught it and hastened back to hermione and ron whose eyes were now strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids 
 
 hes fainted said hermione who was also rather pale she no longer looked like mafalda though her hair was still gray in places unstopper it for me harry my hands are shaking 
 
 harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared harry saw that the bleeding had stopped the wound now looked several days old new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh 
 
 wow said harry 
 
 its all i feel safe doing said hermione shakily there are spells that would put him completely right but i darent try in case i do them wrong and cause more damage hes lost so much blood already 
 
 how did he get hurt i mean c harry shook his head trying to clear it to make sense of whatever had just taken place c why are we here i thought we were going back to grimmauld place 
 
 hermione took a deep breath she looked close to tears 
 
 harry i dont think were going to be able to go back there 
 
 what dyou c 
 
 as we disapparated yaxley caught hold of me and i couldnt get rid of him he was too strong and he was still holding on when we arrived at grimmauld place and then c well i think he must have seen the door and thought we were stopping there so he slackened his grip and i managed to sake him off and i brought us here instead 
 
 but then wheres he hang on you dont mean hes at grimmauld place he cant get in there 
 
 her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded 
 
 harry i think he can i c i forced him to let go with a revulsion jinx but id already taken him inside the fidelius charms protection since dumbledore died were so ive given him the secret havent i 
 
 there was no pretending harry was sure she was right it was a serious blow if yaxley could now get inside the house there was no way that they could return even now he could be bringing other death eaters in there by apparition gloomy and oppressive though the house was it had been their one safe refuge even now that kreacher was so much happier and friendlier a kind of home with a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food harry imagined the busying himself over the pie that harry ron and hermione would never eat 
 
 harry im sorry im so sorry 
 
 dont be stupid it wasnt your fault if anything it was mine 
 
 harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out eye hermione recoiled looking horrified 
 
 umbridge had stuck it to her office door to spy on people i couldnt leave it there but thats how they knew there were intruders 
 
 before hermione could answer ron groaned and opened his eyes he was still gray and his face glistened with sweat 
 
 how dyou feel hermione whispered 
 
 lousy croaked ron wincing as he felt his injured arm where are we 
 
 in the woods where they held the quidditch world cup said hermione i wanted somewhere enclosed undercover and this was c 
 
 c the first place you thought of harry finished for her glancing around at the apparently deserted glade he could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had apparated to the first place hermione had thought of c how death eaters had found them within minutes had it been legilimency did voldemort or his henchmen know even now where hermione had taken them 
 
 dyou reckon we should move on ron asked harry and harry could tell by the look on rons face that he was thinking the same 
 
 i dunno 
 
 ron still looked pale and clammy he had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so the prospect of moving him was daunting 
 
 lets stay here for now harry said 
 
 looking relieved hermione sprang to her feet 
 
 where are you going asked ron 
 
 if were staying we should put some protective enchantments around the place she replied and raising her wand she began to walk in a wide circle around harry and ron murmuring incantations as she went harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air it was as if hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing 
 
 salvio hexia protego totalum repello muggletum muffliato you could get out the tent harry 
 
 tent 
 
 in the bag 
 
 in the of course said harry 
 
 he did not bother to grope inside it this time but used another summoning charm the tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas ropes and poles harry recognized it partly because of the smell of cats as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the quidditch world cup 
 
 i thought this belonged to that bloke perkins at the ministry he asked starting to disentangle the pent pegs 
 
 apparently he didnt want it back his lumbagos so bad said hermione now performing complicated movements with her wand so rons dad said i could borrow it erecto she added pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas which in one fluid motion rose into the air and settled fully constructed onto the ground before harry out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope 
 
 cave inimicum hermione finished with a skyward flourish thats as much as i can do at the very least we should know theyre coming i cant guarantee it will keep out vol c 
 
 dont say the name ron cut across her his voice harsh 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other 
 
 im sorry ron said moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them but it feels like a c a jinx or something cant we call him c please 
 
 dumbledore said fear of a name c began harry 
 
 in case you hadnt noticed mate calling by his name didnt do dumbledore much good in the end ron snapped back just c just show some respect will you 
 
 respect harry repeated but hermione shot him a warning look apparently he was not to argue with ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition 
 
 harry and hermione half carried half dragged ron through the entrance of the tent the interior was exactly as harry remembered it a small flat complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen he shoved aside an old armchair and lowered ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed even this very short journey had turned ron whiter still and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while 
 
 ill make some tea said hermione breathlessly pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen 
 
 harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that had died it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest after a minute or two ron broke the silence 
 
 what dyou reckon happened to the cattermoles 
 
 with any luck theyll have got away said hermione clutching her hot mug for comfort as long as mr cattermole had his wits about him hell have transported mrs cattermole by and theyll be fleeing the country right now with their children thats what harry told her to do 
 
 blimey i hope they escaped said ron leaning back on his pillows the tea seemed to be doing him good a little of his color had returned i didnt get the feeling reg cattermole was all that though the way everyone was talking to me when i was him god i hope they made it if they both end up in azkaban because of us 
 
 harry looked over at hermione and the question he had been about to ask c about whether mrs cattermoles lack of a wand would prevent her apparating alongside her husband c died in his throat hermione was watching ron fret over the fate of the cattermoles and there was such tenderness in her expression that harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him 
 
 so have you got it harry asked her partly to remind her that he was there 
 
 got c got what she said with a little start 
 
 what did we just go through all that for the locket wheres the locket 
 
 you got it shouted ron raising himself a little higher on his pillows no one tells me anything blimey you could have mentioned it 
 
 well we were running for our lives from the death eaters werent we said hermione here 
 
 and she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to ron 
 
 it was as large as a chickens egg an ornate letter s inlaid with many small green stones glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tents canvas roof 
 
 there isnt any chance someones destroyed it since kreacher had it asked ron hopefully i mean are we sure its still a horcrux 
 
 i think so said hermione taking it back from him and looking at it closely thered be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed 
 
 she passed it to harry who turned it over in his fingers the thing looked perfect pristine he remembered the mangled remains of the diary and how the stone in the horcrux ring had been cracked open when dumbledore destroyed it 
 
 i reckon kreachers right said harry were going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it 
 
 sudden awareness of what he was holding of what lived behind the little golden doors hit harry as he spoke even after all their efforts to find it he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him mastering himself again he tried to pry the locket apart with his fingers then attempted the charm hermione had used to open reguluss bedroom door neither worked he handed the locket back to ron and hermione each of whom did their best but were no more successful at opening it than he had been 
 
 can you feel it though ron asked in a hushed voice as he held it tight in his clenched fist 
 
 what dyou mean 
 
 ron passed the horcrux to harry after a moment or two harry thought he knew what ron meant was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could feel or was it something beating inside the locket like a tiny metal heart 
 
 what are we going to do with it hermione asked 
 
 keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it harry replied and little though he wanted to he hung the chain around his own neck dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes where it rested against his chest beside the pouch hagrid had given him 
 
 i think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent he added to hermione standing up and stretching and well need to think about some food as well you stay there he added sharply as ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green 
 
 with the sneakoscope hermione had given harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent harry and hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout however the sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day and whether because of the protective enchantments and charms hermione had spread around them or because people rarely ventured this way their patch of wood remained deserted apart from occasional birds and squirrels evening brought no change harry lit his wand as he swapped places with hermione at ten oclock and looked out upon a deserted scene noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing 
 
 he felt hungry now and a little hermione had not packed any food in her magical bag as she had assumed that they would be returning to grimmauld place that night so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that hermione had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan after a couple of mouthfuls ron had pushed his portion away looking queasy harry had only persevered so as to not hurt hermiones feelings 
 
 the surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready his insides already uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms tingled with unease 
 
 he had though that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the horcrux but somehow he did not all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness of which his wand lit only a tiny part was worry about what would happen next it was as though he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks months maybe even years but how he had come to an abrupt halt run out of road 
 
 there were other horcruxes out there somewhere but he did not have the faintest idea where they could be he did not even know what all of them were meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to destroy the only one that they had found the horcrux that currently lay against the bare flesh of his chest curiously it had not taken heat from his body but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water from time to time harry thought or perhaps imagined that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the dark he tried to resist them push them away yet they came at him relentlessly neither can live while the other survives ron and hermione now talking softly behind him in the tent could walk away if they wanted to he could not and it seemed to harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion that the horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left stupid idea he told himself dont think that 
 
 his scar was starting to prickle again he was afraid that he was making it happen by having these thoughts and tried to direct them into another channel he thought of poor kreacher who had expected them home and had received yaxley instead would the elf keep silent or would he tell the death eater everything he knew harry wanted to believe that kreacher had changed towards him in the past month that he would be loyal now but who knew what would happen what if the death eaters tortured the elf sick images swarmed into harrys head and he tried to push these away too for there was nothing he could do for kreacher he and hermione had already decided against trying to summon him what if someone from the ministry came too they could not count on elfish apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken yaxley to grimmauld place on the hem of hermiones sleeve 
 
 harrys scar was burning now he thought that there was so much they did not know lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined why hadnt dumbledore explained more had he thought that there would be time that he would live for years for centuries perhaps like his friend nicolas flamel if so he had been wrong snape had seen to that snape the sleeping snake who had struck at the top of the tower 
 
 and dumbledore had fallen fallen 
 
 give it to me gregorovitch 
 
 harrys voice was high clear and cold his wand held in front of him by a white hand the man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair though there were no ropes holding him he swung there invisibly and eerily bound his limbs wrapped about him his terrified face on a level with harrys ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head he had hair and a thick bushy beard a father christmas 
 
 i have it not i have it no more it was many years ago stolen from me 
 
 do not lie to lord voldemort gregorovitch he knows he always knows 
 
 the hanging mans pupils were wide dilated with fear and they seemed to swell bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed harry whole c 
 
 and how harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little gregorovitchs wake as he held a lantern aloft gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a workshop wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of light and there on the window ledge sat perched like a giant bird a young man with golden hair in the split second that the lanterns light illuminated him harry saw the delight upon his handsome face then the intruder shot a stunning spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a crow of laughter 
 
 and harry was hurtling back out of those wide tunnellike pupils and gregorovitchs face was stricken with terror 
 
 who was the thief gregorovitch said the high cold voice 
 
 i do not know i never knew a young man c no c please c please 
 
 a scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light c 
 
 harry 
 
 he opened his eyes panting his forehead throbbing he had passed out against the side of the tent had slid sideways down the canvas and was sprawled on the ground he looked up at hermione whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high above them 
 
 dream he said sitting up quickly and attempting to meet hermiones glower with a look of innocence mustve dozed off sorry 
 
 i know it was your scar i can tell by the look on your face you were looking into vol c 
 
 dont say his name came rons angry voice from the depths of the tent 
 
 fine retorted hermione mind then 
 
 i didnt mean it to happen harry said it was a dream can you control what you dream about hermione 
 
 if you just learned to apply occlumency c 
 
 but harry was not interested in being told off he wanted to discuss what he had just seen 
 
 hes found gregorovitch hermione and i think hes killed him but before he killed him he read gregorovitchs mind and i saw c 
 
 i think id better take over the watch if youre so tired youre falling sleep said hermione coldly 
 
 i can finish the watch 
 
 no youre obviously exhausted go and lie down 
 
 she dropped down in the mouth of the tent looking stubborn angry but wishing to avoid a row harry ducked back inside 
 
 rons face was poking out from the lower bunk harry climbed into the one above him lay down and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling after several moments ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to hermione huddle in the entrance 
 
 whats doing 
 
 harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail then whispered into the darkness 
 
 he found gregorovitch he had him tied up he was torturing him 
 
 hows gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if hes tied up 
 
 i dunno its weird isnt it 
 
 harry closed his eyes thinking of all that he had seen and heard the more he recalled the less sense it made voldemort had said nothing about harrys wand nothing about the twin cores nothing about gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat harrys 
 
 he wanted something from gregorovitch harry said eyes still closed tight he asked him to hand it over but gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him and then then 
 
 he remembered how he as voldemort had seemed to hurtle through gregorovitchs eyes into his memories 
 
 he read gregorovitchs mind and i saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill and he fired a curse at gregorovitch and jumped out of sight he stole it he stole whatever after and i i think ive seen him somewhere 
 
 harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boys face the theft had happened many years ago according to gregorovitch why did the young thief look familiar 
 
 the noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent all harry could hear was rons breathing after a while ron whispered couldnt you see what the thief was holding 
 
 no it mustve been something small 
 
 harry 
 
 the wooden slats of rons bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed 
 
 harry you dont reckon after something else to turn into a horcrux 
 
 i dont know said harry slowly maybe but wouldnt it be dangerous for him to make another one didnt hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already 
 
 yeah but maybe he doesnt know that 
 
 yeahmaybe said harry 
 
 he had been sure that voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem of the twin cores sure that voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker and yet he had killed him apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore 
 
 what was voldemort trying to find why with the ministry of magic and the wizarding world at his feet was he far away intent on the pursuit of an object that gregorovitch had once owned and which had been stolen by the unknown thief 
 
 harry could still see the youths face it was merry wild there was a fred and air of triumphant trickery about him he had soared from the windowsill like a bird and harry had seen him before but he could not think where 
 
 with gregorovitch dead it was the thief who was in danger now and it was on him that harrys thoughts dwelled as rons snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 holger danske 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in denmark there stands an old castle named kronenburg close by 
 the sound of elsinore where large ships both english russian and 
 prussian pass by hundreds every day and they salute the old castle 
 with cannons boom boom which is as if they said 
 and the cannons of the old castle answer boom which means many thanks in winter no ships sail by for the whole sound is covered with ice as far as the swedish coast and has quite the appearance of a the danish and the swedish flags wave and danes and swedes say and thank you to each other not with cannons but with a friendly shake of the hand and they exchange white bread and biscuits with each other because foreign articles taste the best 
 
 but the most beautiful sight of all is the old castle of kronenburg where holger danske sits in the deep dark cellar into which no one goes he is clad in iron and steel and rests his head on his strong arm his long beard hangs down upon the marble table into which it has become firmly rooted he sleeps and dreams but in his dreams he sees everything that happens in denmark on each an angel comes to him and tells him that all he has dreamed is true and that he may go to sleep again in peace as denmark is not yet in any real danger but should danger ever come then holger danske will rouse himself and the table will burst asunder as he draws out his beard then he will come forth in his strength and strike a blow that shall sound in all the countries of the world 
 
 an old grandfather sat and told his little grandson all this about 
 holger danske and the boy knew that what his grandfather told him 
 must be true as the old man related this story he was carving an 
 image in wood to represent holger danske to be fastened to the prow of a ship for the old grandfather was a carver in wood that is 
 one who carved figures for the heads of ships according to the 
 names given to them and now he had carved holger danske who stood there erect and proud with his long beard holding in one hand his broad while with the other he leaned on the danish arms 
 
 the old grandfather told the little boy a great deal about danish 
 men and women who had distinguished themselves in olden times so that he fancied he knew as much even as holger danske himself who after all could only dream and when the little fellow went to bed he thought so much about it that he actually pressed his chin against the counterpane and imagined that he had a long beard which had become rooted to it but the old grandfather remained sitting at his work and carving away at the last part of it which was the danish arms and when he had finished he looked at the whole figure and thought of all he had heard and read and what he had that evening related to his little grandson then he nodded his head wiped his spectacles and put them on and said ah yes holger danske will not appear in my lifetime but the boy who is in bed there may very likely live to see him when the event really comes to pass and the old grandfather nodded again and the more he looked at holger danske the more satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him it seemed to glow with the color of life the armor glittered like iron and steel the hearts in the danish arms grew more and more red while the lions with gold crowns on their heads were leaping up 
 that is the most beautiful coat of arms in the world said the old man 
 
 the lions represent strength and the hearts gentleness and love 
 and as he gazed on the uppermost lion he thought of king canute 
 who chained great england to throne and he looked at the 
 second lion and thought of waldemar who untied denmark and conquered the vandals the third lion reminded him of margaret who united denmark sweden and norway but when he gazed at the red hearts their colors glowed more deeply even as flames and his memory followed each in turn the first led him to a dark narrow prison in which sat a prisoner a beautiful woman daughter of christian the fourth eleanor ulfeld and the flame became a rose on her bosom and its blossoms were not more pure than the heart of this noblest and best of all danish women ah yes that is indeed a noble heart in the danish arms said the grandfather and his spirit 
 followed the second flame which carried him out to sea where cannons roared and the ships lay shrouded in smoke and the flaming heart attached itself to the breast of hvitfeldt in the form of the ribbon 
 of an order as he blew himself and his ship into the air in order 
 to save the fleet and the third flame led him to wretched 
 huts where the preacher hans egede ruled with love in every word 
 and action the flame was as a star on his breast and added another 
 heart to the danish arms and as the old spirit followed 
 the next hovering flame he knew whither it would lead him in a 
 peasant humble room stood frederick the sixth writing his 
 name with chalk on the beam the flame trembled on his breast and in 
 his heart and it was in the room that his heart became 
 one for the danish arms the old grandfather wiped his eyes for he 
 had known king frederick with his silvery locks and his honest blue 
 eyes and had lived for him and he folded his hands and remained 
 for some time silent then his daughter came to him and said it was 
 getting late that he ought to rest for a while and that the supper 
 was on the table 
 
 what you have been carving is very beautiful grandfather 
 said she holger danske and the old coat of arms it seems to me as 
 if i have seen the face somewhere 
 
 no that is impossible replied the old grandfather but i have 
 seen it and i have tried to carve it in wood as i have retained it 
 in my memory it was a long time ago while the english fleet lay in 
 the roads on the second of april when we showed that we were true ancient danes i was on board the denmark in steene squadron i had a man by my side whom even the cannon balls seemed to fear he sung old songs in a merry voice and fired and fought as if he were something more than a man i still remember his face but from whence he came or whither he went i know not no one knows i have often thought it might have been holger danske himself who had swam down to us from kronenburg to help us in the hour of danger that was my idea and there stands his likeness 
 the wooden figure threw a gigantic shadow on the wall and even on 
 part of the ceiling it seemed as if the real holger danske stood 
 behind it for the shadow moved but this was no doubt caused by the flame of the lamp not burning steadily then the 
 kissed the old grandfather and led him to a large by the 
 table and she and her husband who was the son of the old man and 
 the father of the little boy who lay in bed sat down to supper with 
 him and the old grandfather talked of the danish lions and the danish hearts emblems of strength and gentleness and explained quite clearly that there is another strength than that which lies in a 
 sword and he pointed to a shelf where lay a number of old books 
 and amongst them a collection of plays which are much 
 read and are so clever and amusing that it is easy to fancy we have 
 known the people of those days who are described in them 
 
 he knew how to fight also said the old man for he lashed 
 the follies and prejudices of people during his whole life 
 then the grandfather nodded to a place above the 
 where hung an almanac with a representation of the round tower upon it and said tycho brahe was another of those who used a sword but not one to cut into the flesh and bone but to make the way of the stars of heaven clear and plain to be understood and then he whose father belonged to my calling yes he the son of the old he whom we ourselves have seen with his silvery locks and his broad shoulders whose name is known in all lands yes he was a sculptor while i am only a carver holger danske can appear in marble so that people in all countries of the world may hear of the strength of denmark now let us drink the health of bertel 
 but the little boy in bed saw plainly the old castle of kronenburg and the sound of elsinore and holger danske far down in the cellar with his beard rooted to the table and dreaming of everything that was passing above him 
 
 and holger danske did dream of the little humble room in which the 
 sat he heard all that had been said and he nodded in 
 his dream saying ah yes remember me you danish people keep me in your memory i will come to you in the hour of need 
 
 the bright morning light shone over kronenburg and the wind 
 brought the sound of the across from the neighboring 
 shores the ships sailed by and saluted the castle with the boom of 
 the cannon and kronenburg returned the salute boom boom but 
 the roaring cannons did not awake holger danske for they meant only good morning and thank you they must fire in another fashion before he awakes but wake he will for there is energy yet in 
 holger danske

 some of his particular characteristics 
 the street paris is the dwarf of the giant 
 let us not exaggerate this cherub of the gutter sometimes has a shirt but in that case he owns but one he sometimes has shoes but then they have no soles he sometimes has a lodging and he loves it for he finds his mother there but he prefers the street because there he finds liberty 
 he has his own games his own bits of mischief whose foundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois his peculiar metaphors 
 to be dead is to eat dandelions by the root his own occupations calling letting down establishing means of transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains which he calls making the bridge of arts crying discourses pronounced by the authorities in favor of the french people cleaning out the cracks in the pavement he has his own coinage which is composed of all the little morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets this curious money which receives the name of an invariable and currency in this little bohemia of children 
 lastly he has his own fauna which he observes attentively in the corners the the the the devil a black insect which menaces by twisting about its tail armed with two horns 
 he has his fabulous monster which has scales under its belly but is not a lizard which has pustules on its back but is not a toad which inhabits the nooks of old and wells that have run dry which is black hairy sticky which crawls sometimes slowly sometimes rapidly which has no cry but which has a look and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it he calls this monster the deaf thing 
 the search for these deaf things among the stones is a joy of formidable nature 
 another pleasure consists in suddenly prying up a and taking a look at the each region of paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which are to be found there 
 there are in the of the ursulines there are millepeds in the pantheon there are tadpoles in the ditches of the 
 as far as sayings are concerned this child has as many of them as talleyrand 
 he is no less cynical but he is more honest he is endowed with a certain indescribable unexpected joviality he upsets the composure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter he ranges boldly from high comedy to farce 
 a funeral passes by 
 among those who accompany the dead there is a doctor 
 hey there shouts some street arab how long has it been customary for doctors to carry home their own work 
 another is in a crowd 
 a grave man adorned with spectacles and trinkets turns round indignantly 
 you you have seized my sir 
 search me

 chapter v 
 
 boris had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in petersburg so with the same object in view he came to moscow there he wavered between the two richest heiresses julie and princess mary though princess mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than julie he without knowing why felt awkward about paying court to her when they had last met on the old name day she had answered at random all his attempts to talk sentimentally evidently not listening to what he was saying 
 julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily though in a manner peculiar to herself 
 she was after the death of her brothers she had become very wealthy she was by now decidedly plain but thought herself not merely as as before but even far more attractive she was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less dangerous she became to men and the more freely they could associate with her and avail themselves of her suppers soirees and the animated company that assembled at her house without incurring any obligation a man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there for fear of compromising her and committing himself would now go boldly every day and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance 
 that winter the karagins house was the most agreeable and hospitable in moscow in addition to the formal evening and dinner parties a large company chiefly of men gathered there every day supping at midnight and staying till three in the morning julie never missed a ball a promenade or a play her dresses were always of the latest fashion but in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love or any of the joys of life and expected peace only yonder she adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment like a girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in that light and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered much in life this melancholy which did not prevent her amusing herself did not hinder the young people who came to her house from passing the time pleasantly every visitor who came to the house paid his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess and then amused himself with society gossip dancing intellectual games and bouts rimes which were in vogue at the karagins only a few of these young men among them boris entered more deeply into melancholy and with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of all worldly things and to them she showed her albums filled with mournful sketches maxims and verses 
 to boris julie was particularly gracious she regretted his early disillusionment with life offered him such consolation of friendship as she who had herself suffered so much could render and showed him her album boris sketched two trees in the album and wrote rustic trees your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me 
 on another page he drew a tomb and wrote 
 la mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille 
 ah contre les douleurs il a pas asile 
 death gives relief and death is peaceful 
 ah from suffering there is no other refuge julia said this was charming 
 there is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy she said to boris repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a book it is a ray of light in the darkness a shade between sadness and despair showing the possibility of consolation 
 in reply boris wrote these lines 
 aliment de poison ame trop sensible 
 toi sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible 
 tendre melancholie ah viens me consoler 
 viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite 
 et mele une douceur secrete 
 a ces pleurs que je sens couler 
 poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul 
 thou without whom happiness would for me be impossible 
 tender melancholy ah come to console me 
 come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat 
 and mingle a secret sweetness 
 with these tears that i feel to be flowing 
 for boris julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp boris read poor liza aloud to her and more than once interrupted the reading because of the emotions that choked him meeting at large gatherings julie and boris looked on one another as the only souls who understood one another in a world of indifferent people 
 anna mikhaylovna who often visited the karagins while playing cards with the mother made careful inquiries as to dowry she was to have two estates in penza and the nizhegorod forests anna mikhaylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy julie with emotion and resignation to the divine will 
 you are always charming and melancholy my dear julie she said to the daughter boris says his soul finds repose at your house he has suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive said she to the mother ah my dear i tell you how fond i have grown of julie latterly she said to her son but who could help loving her she is an angelic being ah boris boris she paused and how i pity her mother she went on today she showed me her accounts and letters from penza they have enormous estates there and she poor thing has no one to help her and they do cheat her so 
 boris smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother he laughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what she had to say and sometimes questioned her carefully about the penza and nizhegorod estates 
 julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and was ready to accept it but some secret feeling of repulsion for her for her passionate desire to get married for her artificiality and a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still restrained boris his leave was expiring he spent every day and whole days at the karagins and every day on thinking the matter over told himself that he would propose tomorrow but in presence looking at her red face and chin nearly always powdered her moist eyes and her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural rapture of married bliss boris could not utter the decisive words though in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of those penza and nizhegorod estates and had apportioned the use of the income from them julie saw boris indecision and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him but her feminine immediately supplied her with consolation and she told herself that he was only shy from love her melancholy however began to turn to irritability and not long before boris departure she formed a definite plan of action just as boris leave of absence was expiring anatole kuragin made his appearance in moscow and of course in the karagins drawing room and julie suddenly abandoning her melancholy became cheerful and very attentive to kuragin 
 my dear said anna mikhaylovna to her son i know from a reliable source that prince vasili has sent his son to moscow to get him married to julie i am so fond of julie that i should be sorry for her what do you think of it my dear 
 the idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole month of arduous melancholy service to julie and of seeing all the revenue from the penza estates which he had already mentally apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another and especially into the hands of that idiot anatole pained boris he drove to the karagins with the firm intention of proposing julie met him in a gay careless manner spoke casually of how she had enjoyed ball and asked when he was leaving though boris had come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender he began speaking irritably of feminine inconstancy of how easily women can turn from sadness to joy and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them julie was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs variety and the same thing over and over again would weary anyone 
 then i should advise you boris began wishing to sting her but at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to leave moscow without having accomplished his aim and have vainly wasted his efforts which was a thing he never allowed to happen 
 he checked himself in the middle of the sentence lowered his eyes to avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face and said 
 i did not come here at all to quarrel with you on the contrary 
 he glanced at her to make sure that he might go on her irritability had suddenly quite vanished and her anxious imploring eyes were fixed on him with greedy expectation i can always arrange so as not to see her often thought boris the affair has been begun and must be finished he blushed hotly raised his eyes to hers and said 
 you know my feelings for you 
 there was no need to say more face shone with triumph and but she forced boris to say all that is said on such occasions that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more than her she knew that for the penza estates and nizhegorod forests she could demand this and she received what she demanded 
 the affianced couple no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and melancholy upon them planned the arrangements of a splendid house in petersburg paid calls and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding

 he is agreeable 
 in the evening thanks to a few sous which he always finds means to procure the homuncio enters a theatre 
 on crossing that magic threshold he becomes transfigured he was the street arab he becomes the titi theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with the keel in the air 
 it is in that keel that the titi huddle together 
 the titi is to the gamin what the moth is to the larva the same being endowed with wings and soaring it suffices for him to be there with his radiance of happiness with his power of enthusiasm and joy with his which resembles a clapping of wings to confer on that narrow dark fetid sordid unhealthy hideous abominable keel the name of paradise 
 chicken 
 slang allusion to the noise made in calling poultry 
 bestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary and you have the gamin 
 the gamin is not devoid of literary intuition 
 his tendency and we say it with the proper amount of regret would not constitute classic taste 
 he is not very academic by nature 
 thus to give an example the popularity of mademoiselle mars among that little audience of stormy children was seasoned with a touch of irony the gamin called her mademoiselle yourself 
 this being bawls and scoffs and ridicules and fights has rags like a baby and tatters like a philosopher fishes in the sewer hunts in the cesspool extracts mirth from foulness whips up the squares with his wit grins and bites whistles and sings shouts and shrieks tempers alleluia with chants every rhythm from the de profundis to the finds without seeking knows what he is ignorant of is a spartan to the point of thieving is mad to wisdom is lyrical to filth would crouch down on olympus wallows in the dunghill and emerges from it covered with stars the gamin of paris is rabelais in this youth 
 he is not content with his trousers unless they have a 
 he is not easily astonished he is still less easily terrified he makes songs on superstitions he takes the wind out of exaggerations he twits mysteries he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts he takes the poetry out of stilted things he introduces caricature into epic extravaganzas 
 it is not that he is prosaic far from that but he replaces the solemn vision by the farcical phantasmagoria if adamastor were to appear to him the street arab would say hi there

 at the end of january old count rostov went to moscow with natasha and sonya the countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was impossible to wait for her recovery prince andrew was expected in moscow any day the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near moscow had to be sold besides which the opportunity of presenting his future to old prince bolkonski while he was in moscow could not be missed the rostovs moscow house had not been heated that winter and as they had come only for a short time and the countess was not with them the count decided to stay with marya dmitrievna akhrosimova who had long been pressing her hospitality on them 
 late one evening the rostovs four sleighs drove into marya courtyard in the old konyusheny street marya dmitrievna lived alone she had already married off her daughter and her sons were all in the service 
 she held herself as erect told everyone her opinion as candidly loudly and bluntly as ever and her whole bearing seemed a reproach to others for any weakness passion or temptation the possibility of which she did not admit from early in the morning wearing a dressing jacket she attended to her household affairs and then she drove out on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on affairs of which she never spoke to anyone on ordinary days after dressing she received petitioners of various classes of whom there were always some then she had dinner a substantial and appetizing meal at which there were always three or four guests after dinner she played a game of boston and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read to her while she knitted she rarely made an exception and went out to pay visits and then only to the most important persons in the town 
 she had not yet gone to bed when the rostovs arrived and the pulley of the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the rostovs and their servants marya dmitrievna with her spectacles hanging down on her nose and her head flung back stood in the hall doorway looking with a stern grim face at the new arrivals one might have thought she was angry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out had she not at the same time been giving careful instructions to the servants for the accommodation of the visitors and their belongings 
 the things bring them here she said pointing to the portmanteaus and not greeting anyone the young ladies there to the left now what are you dawdling for she cried to the maids get the samovar ready grown plumper and prettier she remarked drawing natasha whose cheeks were glowing from the cold to her by the hood foo you are cold now take off your things quick she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand half frozen sure bring some rum for tea bonjour sonya dear she added turning to sonya and indicating by this french greeting her slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her 
 when they came in to tea having taken off their outdoor things and tidied themselves up after their journey marya dmitrievna kissed them all in due order 
 heartily glad you have come and are staying with me it was high time she said giving natasha a significant look the old man is here and his expected any day have to make his aquaintance but speak of that later on she added glancing at sonya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her presence now listen she said to the count what do you want tomorrow whom will you send for shinshin she crooked one of her fingers the sniveling anna mikhaylovna two here with her son the son is getting married then bezukhov eh he is here too with his wife he ran away from her and she came galloping after him he dined with me on wednesday as for them and she pointed to the girls tomorrow take them first to the iberian shrine of the mother of god and then drive to the i suppose have everything new judge by me sleeves nowadays are this size the other day young princess irina vasilevna came to see me she was an awful sight looked as if she had put two barrels on her arms you know not a day passes now without some new fashion and what have you to do yourself she asked the count sternly 
 one thing has come on top of another her rags to buy and now a purchaser has turned up for the moscow estate and for the house if you will be so kind fix a time and go down to the estate just for a day and leave my lassies with you 
 all right all right be safe with me as safe as in chancery take them where they must go scold them a bit and pet them a bit said marya dmitrievna touching her goddaughter and favorite natasha on the cheek with her large hand 
 next morning marya dmitrievna took the young ladies to the iberian shrine of the mother of god and to madame who was so afraid of marya dmitrievna that she always let her have costumes at a loss merely to get rid of her marya dmitrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau when they got home she turned everybody out of the room except nataisha and then called her pet to her armchair 
 well now talk i congratulate you on your betrothed hooked a fine fellow i am glad for your sake and known him since he was so high she held her hand a couple of feet from the ground natasha blushed happily i like him and all his family now listen you know that old prince nicholas much dislikes his marrying the old crotchety of course prince andrew is not a child and can shift without him but not nice to enter a family against a will one wants to do it peacefully and lovingly a clever girl and know how to manage be kind and use your wits then all will be well 
 natasha remained silent from shyness marya dmitrievna supposed but really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love of prince andrew which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs that no one could understand it she loved and knew prince andrew he loved her only and was to come one of these days and take her she wanted nothing more 
 you see i have known him a long time and am also fond of mary your future husbands sisters bring up blisters but this one hurt a fly she has asked me to bring you two together tomorrow go with your father to see her be very nice and affectionate to her younger than she when he comes find you already know his sister and father and are liked by them am i right or not that be best 
 yes it will natasha answered reluctantly

 next day by marya advice count rostov took natasha to call on prince nicholas bolkonski the count did not set out cheerfully on this visit at heart he felt afraid he well remembered the last interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the enrollment when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of men natasha on the other hand having put on her best gown was in the highest spirits they help liking me she thought everybody always has liked me and i am so willing to do anything they wish so ready to be fond of him for being his father and of her for being his sister that there is no reason for them not to like me 
 they drove up to the gloomy old house on the vozdvizhenka and entered the vestibule 
 well the lord have mercy on us said the count half in jest half in earnest but natasha noticed that her father was flurried on entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and princess were at home 
 when they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the servants the footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by another in the large hall and they whispered to one another then a maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something mentioning the princess at last an old cross looking footman came and announced to the rostovs that the prince was not receiving but that the princess begged them to walk up the first person who came to meet the visitors was mademoiselle bourienne she greeted the father and daughter with special politeness and showed them to the princess room the princess looking excited and nervous her face flushed in patches ran in to meet the visitors treading heavily and vainly trying to appear cordial and at ease from the first glance princess mary did not like natasha she thought her too fashionably dressed frivolously gay and vain she did not at all realize that before having seen her future she was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty youth and happiness as well as by jealousy of her love for her apart from this insuperable antipathy to her princess mary was agitated just then because on the rostovs being announced the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them that princess mary might do so if she chose but they were not to be admitted to him she had decided to receive them but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in some freak as he seemed much upset by the rostovs visit 
 there my dear princess brought you my songstress said the count bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince might appear i am so glad you should get to know one another very sorry the prince is still ailing and after a few more commonplace remarks he rose if allow me to leave my natasha in your hands for a quarter of an hour princess drive round to see anna semenovna quite near in the dogs square and then come back for her 
 the count had devised this diplomatic ruse as he afterwards told his daughter to give the future an opportunity to talk to one another freely but another motive was to avoid the danger of encountering the old prince of whom he was afraid he did not mention this to his daughter but natasha noticed her nervousness and anxiety and felt mortified by it she blushed for him grew still angrier at having blushed and looked at the princess with a bold and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody the princess told the count that she would be delighted and only begged him to stay longer at anna and he departed 
 despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by princess mary who wished to have a with natasha mademoiselle bourienne remained in the room and persistently talked about moscow amusements and theaters natasha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom by her nervousness and by the unnatural manner of the princess who she thought was making a favor of receiving her and so everything displeased her she did not like princess mary whom she thought very plain affected and dry natasha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated princess mary still more after five minutes of irksome constrained conversation they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching princess mary looked frightened 
 the door opened and the old prince in a dress ing gown and a white nightcap came in 
 ah madam he began madam countess countess rostova if i am not mistaken i beg you to excuse me to excuse me i did not know madam god is my witness i did not know you had honored us with a visit and i came in such a costume only to see my daughter i beg you to excuse me god is my witness i know he repeated stressing the word god so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that princess mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her father or at natasha 
 nor did the latter having risen and curtsied know what to do mademoiselle bourienne alone smiled agreeably 
 i beg you to excuse me excuse me god is my witness i did not know muttered the old man and after looking natasha over from head to foot he went out 
 mademoiselle bourienne was the first to recover herself after this apparition and began speaking about the indisposition natasha and princess mary looked at one another in silence and the longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say the greater grew their antipathy to one another 
 when the count returned natasha was impolitely pleased and hastened to get away at that moment she hated the stiff elderly princess who could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an hour with her without once mentioning prince andrew i begin talking about him in the presence of that frenchwoman thought natasha the same thought was meanwhile tormenting princess mary she knew what she ought to have said to natasha but she had been unable to say it because mademoiselle bourienne was in the way and because without knowing why she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage when the count was already leaving the room princess mary went up hurriedly to natasha took her by the hand and said with a deep sigh 
 wait i must 
 natasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why 
 dear natalie said princess mary i want you to know that i am glad my brother has found happiness 
 she paused feeling that she was not telling the truth natasha noticed this and guessed its reason 
 i think princess it is not convenient to speak of that now she said with external dignity and coldness though she felt the tears choking her 
 what have i said and what have i done thought she as soon as she was out of the room 
 they waited a long time for natasha to come to dinner that day she sat in her room crying like a child blowing her nose and sobbing sonya stood beside her kissing her hair 
 natasha what is it about she asked what do they matter to you it will all pass natasha 
 but if you only knew how offensive it was as if i 
 talk about it natasha it your fault so why should you mind kiss me said sonya 
 natasha raised her head and kissing her friend on the lips pressed her wet face against her 
 i tell you i know no to blame said natasha my fault but it all hurts terribly oh why he come 
 she came in to dinner with red eyes marya dmitrievna who knew how the prince had received the rostovs pretended not to notice how upset natasha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count and the other guests

 his frontiers 
 the gamin loves the city he also loves solitude since he has something of the sage in him 
 urbis amator like fuscus ruris amator like flaccus 
 to roam thoughtfully about that is to say to lounge is a fine employment of time in the eyes of the philosopher particularly in that rather illegitimate species of campaign which is tolerably ugly but odd and composed of two natures which surrounds certain great cities notably paris 
 to study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal 
 end of the trees beginning of the roofs end of the grass beginning of the pavements end of the furrows beginning of the shops end of the beginning of the passions end of the divine murmur beginning of the human uproar hence an extraordinary interest 
 hence in these not very attractive places indelibly stamped by the passing stroller with the epithet 
 melancholy the apparently objectless promenades of the dreamer 
 he who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers of paris and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs that turf those pebbly paths that chalk those pools those harsh monotonies of waste and fallow lands the plants of early suddenly springing into sight in a bottom that mixture of the savage and the citizen those vast desert nooks where the garrison drums practise noisily and produce a sort of lisping of battle those hermits by day and by night that clumsy mill which turns in the wind the of the quarries the at the corners of the cemeteries the mysterious charm of great sombre walls squarely intersecting immense vague stretches of land inundated with sunshine and full of this attracted him 
 there is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with those singular spots the glaciere the cunette the hideous wall of grenelle all speckled with balls the aubiers on the bank of the marne the the de chatillon where there is an old exhausted quarry which no longer serves any purpose except to raise mushrooms and which is closed on a level with the ground by a of rotten planks the campagna of rome is one idea the banlieue of paris is another to behold nothing but fields houses or trees in what a stretch of country offers us is to remain on the surface all aspects of things are thoughts of god 
 the spot where a plain effects its junction with a city is always stamped with a certain piercing melancholy nature and humanity both appeal to you at the same time there local originalities there make their appearance 
 any one who like ourselves has wandered about in these solitudes contiguous to our faubourgs which may be designated as the limbos of paris has seen here and there in the most desert spot at the most unexpected moment behind a meagre hedge or in the corner of a lugubrious wall children grouped tumultuously fetid muddy dusty ragged dishevelled playing and crowned with all of them are little ones who have made their escape from poor families 
 the outer boulevard is their breathing space the suburbs belong to them 
 there they are eternally playing truant there they innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs there they are or rather there they exist far from every eye in the sweet light of may or june kneeling round a hole in the ground snapping marbles with their thumbs quarrelling over irresponsible volatile free and happy and no sooner do they catch sight of you than they recollect that they have an industry and that they must earn their living and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled with cockchafers or a bunch of lilacs these encounters with strange children are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces of the environs of paris 
 sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys are they their are almost young maidens thin feverish with sunburnt hands covered with freckles crowned with poppies and ears of rye gay haggard barefooted 
 they can be seen devouring cherries among the wheat 
 in the evening they can be heard laughing these groups warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday or indistinctly seen in the twilight occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time and these visions mingle with his dreams 
 paris centre banlieue circumference this constitutes all the earth to those children 
 they never venture beyond this they can no more escape from the parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the water 
 for them nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers

 that evening the rostovs went to the opera for which marya dmitrievna had taken a box 
 natasha did not want to go but could not refuse marya kind offer which was intended expressly for her when she came ready dressed into the ballroom to await her father and looking in the large mirror there saw that she was pretty very pretty she felt even more sad but it was a sweet tender sadness 
 o god if he were here now i would not behave as i did then but differently i would not be silly and afraid of things i would simply embrace him cling to him and make him look at me with those searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me and then i would make him laugh as he used to laugh and his eyes how i see those eyes thought natasha and what do his father and sister matter to me i love him alone him him with that face and those eyes with his smile manly and yet childlike no i had better not think of him not think of him but forget him quite forget him for the present i bear this waiting and i shall cry in a minute and she turned away from the glass making an effort not to cry and how can sonya love nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so long and so patiently thought she looking at sonya who also came in quite ready with a fan in her hand no altogether different i 
 natasha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not enough for her to love and know she was beloved she wanted now at once to embrace the man she loved to speak and hear from him words of love such as filled her heart while she sat in the carriage beside her father pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on the frozen window she felt still sadder and more in love and forgot where she was going and with whom having fallen into the line of carriages the rostovs carriage drove up to the theater its wheels squeaking over the snow natasha and sonya holding up their dresses jumped out quickly the count got out helped by the footmen and passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes through the closed doors the music was already audible 
 natasha your hair whispered sonya 
 an attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and opened the door of their box the music sounded louder and through the door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and shoulders and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms glittered before their eyes a lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy at natasha the curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being played natasha smoothing her gown went in with sonya and sat down scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite a sensation she had not experienced for a long time that of hundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and neck suddenly affected her both agreeably and disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories desires and emotions associated with that feeling 
 the two remarkably pretty girls natasha and sonya with count rostov who had not been seen in moscow for a long time attracted general attention moreover everybody knew vaguely of engagement to prince andrew and knew that the rostovs had lived in the country ever since and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who was making one of the best matches in russia 
 looks as everyone told her had improved in the country and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty she struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty combined with her indifference to everything about her her black eyes looked at the crowd without seeking anyone and her delicate arm bare to above the elbow lay on the velvet edge of the box while evidently unconsciously she opened and closed her hand in time to the music crumpling her program look alenina said sonya with her mother it 
 dear me michael kirilovich has grown still stouter remarked the count 
 look at our anna mikhaylovna what a headdress she has on 
 the karagins julie and boris with them one can see at once that engaged 
 drubetskoy has proposed 
 oh yes i heard it today said shinshin coming into the rostovs box 
 natasha looked in the direction in which her eyes were turned and saw julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck which natasha knew was covered with powder behind them wearing a smile and leaning over with an ear to mouth was boris handsome smoothly brushed head he looked the rostovs from under his brows and said something smiling to his betrothed 
 they are talking about us about me and him thought natasha and he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me they trouble themselves if only they knew how little i am concerned about any of them 
 behind them sat anna mikhaylovna wearing a green headdress and with a happy look of resignation to the will of god on her face their box was pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which natasha knew so well and liked so much she turned away and suddenly remembered all that had been so humiliating in her visit 
 what right has he not to wish to receive me into his family oh better not think of it not till he comes back she told herself and began looking at the faces some strange and some familiar in the stalls in the front in the very center leaning back against the orchestra rail stood dolokhov in a persian dress his curly hair brushed up into a huge shock he stood in full view of the audience well aware that he was attracting attention yet as much at ease as though he were in his own room around him thronged most brilliant young men whom he evidently dominated 
 the count laughing nudged the blushing sonya and pointed to her former adorer 
 do you recognize him said he and where has he sprung from he asked turning to shinshin he vanish somewhere 
 he did replied shinshin he was in the caucasus and ran away from there they say he has been acting as minister to some ruling prince in persia where he killed the brother now all the moscow ladies are mad about him dolokhov the persian that does it we never hear a word but dolokhov is mentioned they swear by him they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet dolokhov and anatole kuragin have turned all our ladies heads 
 a tall beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed plump white shoulders and neck round which she wore a double string of large pearls entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress and took a long time settling into her place 
 natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck those shoulders and pearls and coiffure and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls while natasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady looked round and meeting the eyes nodded to him and smiled she was the countess bezukhova wife and the count who knew everyone in society leaned over and spoke to her 
 have you been here long countess he inquired call call to kiss your hand here on business and have brought my girls with me they say semenova acts marvelously count pierre never used to forget us is he here 
 yes he meant to look in answered helene and glanced attentively at natasha 
 count rostov resumed his seat 
 handsome she he whispered to natasha 
 wonderful answered natasha a woman one could easily fall in love with 
 just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor tapped with his stick some latecomers took their seats in the stalls and the curtain rose 
 as soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent and all the men old and young in uniform and evening dress and all the women with gems on their bare flesh turned their whole attention with eager curiosity to the stage natasha too began to look at it

 a bit of history 
 at the epoch nearly contemporary by the way when the action of this book takes place there was not as there is a policeman at the corner of every street a benefit which there is no time to discuss here stray children abounded in paris the statistics give an average of two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that period by the police patrols in unenclosed lands in houses in process of construction and under the arches of the bridges 
 one of these nests which has become famous produced the swallows of the bridge of arcola this is moreover the most disastrous of social symptoms all crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child 
 let us make an exception in favor of paris nevertheless 
 in a relative measure and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled the exception is just 
 while in any other great city the vagabond child is a lost man while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is in some sort sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the public vices which devour in him honesty and conscience the street boy of paris we insist on this point however defaced and injured on the surface is almost intact on the interior 
 it is a magnificent thing to put on record and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our popular revolutions that a certain incorruptibility results from the idea which exists in the air of paris as salt exists in the water of the ocean to breathe paris preserves the soul 
 what we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which one experiences every time that one meets one of these children around whom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken family 
 in the civilization of the present day incomplete as it still is it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families pouring themselves out into the darkness not knowing clearly what has become of their children and allowing their own entrails to fall on the public highway hence these obscure destinies 
 this is called for this sad thing has given rise to an expression to be cast on the pavements of paris 
 let it be said by the way that this abandonment of children was not discouraged by the ancient monarchy 
 a little of egypt and bohemia in the lower regions suited the upper spheres and compassed the aims of the powerful 
 the hatred of instruction for the children of the people was a dogma 
 what is the use of such was the countersign 
 now the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child 
 besides this the monarchy sometimes was in need of children and in that case it skimmed the streets 
 under louis xiv not to go any further back the king rightly desired to create a fleet 
 the idea was a good one 
 but let us consider the means 
 there can be no fleet if beside the sailing ship that plaything of the winds and for the purpose of towing it in case of necessity there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases either by means of oars or of steam the galleys were then to the marine what steamers are therefore galleys were necessary but the galley is moved only by the hence were required 
 colbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliaments make as many convicts as possible the magistracy showed a great deal of complaisance in the matter a man kept his hat on in the presence of a was a huguenot attitude he was sent to the galleys 
 a child was encountered in the streets provided that he was fifteen years of age and did not know where he was to sleep he was sent to the galleys grand reign grand century 
 under louis xv 
 children disappeared in paris the police carried them off for what mysterious purpose no one knew people whispered with terror monstrous conjectures as to the baths of purple 
 barbier speaks ingenuously of these things it sometimes happened that the exempts of the guard when they ran short of children took those who had fathers 
 the fathers in despair attacked the exempts 
 in that case the parliament intervened and had some one hung 
 who 
 the exempts 
 no the fathers

 chapter ix 
 
 the floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards at the sides was some painted cardboard representing trees and at the back was a cloth stretched over boards in the center of the stage sat some girls in red bodices and white skirts one very fat girl in a white silk dress sat apart on a low bench to the back of which a piece of green cardboard was glued they all sang something when they had finished their song the girl in white went up to the box and a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs and holding a plume and a dagger went up to her and began singing waving his arms about 
 first the man in the tight trousers sang alone then she sang then they both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand of the girl in white obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with her they sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and shouting while the man and woman on the stage who represented lovers began smiling spreading out their arms and bowing 
 after her life in the country and in her present serious mood all this seemed grotesque and amazing to natasha she could not follow the opera nor even listen to the music she saw only the painted cardboard and the queerly dressed men and women who moved spoke and sang so strangely in that brilliant light she knew what it was all meant to represent but it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused at them she looked at the faces of the audience seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she herself experienced but they all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage and expressed delight which to natasha seemed feigned i suppose it has to be like this she thought she kept looking round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude women in the boxes especially at helene in the next box who apparently quite unclothed sat with a quiet tranquil smile not taking her eyes off the stage and feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd natasha little by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long while she did not realize who and where she was nor what was going on before her as she looked and thought the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her mind the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the air the actress was singing then she wished to touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her then to lean over to helene and tickle her 
 at a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song a door leading to the stalls on the side nearest the rostovs box creaked and the steps of a belated arrival were heard kuragin whispered shinshin countess bezukhova turned smiling to the newcomer and natasha following the direction of that look saw an exceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their box with a yet courteous bearing this was anatole kuragin whom she had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in petersburg he was now in an uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot he moved with a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so and had his handsome face not worn such an expression of complacency and gaiety though the performance was proceeding he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high having looked at natasha he approached his sister laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her box nodded to her and leaning forward asked a question with a motion toward natasha 
 mais charmante said he evidently referring to natasha who did not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his lips then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down beside dolokhov nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way that dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly he winked at him gaily smiled and rested his foot against the orchestra screen 
 how like the brother is to the sister remarked the count and how handsome they both are 
 shinshin lowering his voice began to tell the count of some intrigue of in moscow and natasha tried to overhear it just because he had said she was charmante 
 the first act was over in the stalls everyone began moving about going out and coming in 
 boris came to the rostovs box received their congratulations very simply and raising his eyebrows with an smile conveyed to natasha and sonya his invitation to her wedding and went away natasha with a gay coquettish smile talked to him and congratulated on his approaching wedding that same boris with whom she had formerly been in love in the state of intoxication she was in everything seemed simple and natural 
 the scantily clad helene smiled at everyone in the same way and natasha gave boris a similar smile 
 box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most distinguished and intellectual men who seemed to vie with one another in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her 
 during the whole of that kuragin stood with dolokhov in front of the orchestra partition looking at the rostovs box natasha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure she even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming aspect before the beginning of the second act pierre appeared in the stalls the rostovs had not seen him since their arrival his face looked sad and he had grown still stouter since natasha last saw him he passed up to the front rows not noticing anyone anatole went up to him and began speaking to him looking at and indicating the rostovs box on seeing natasha pierre grew animated and hastily passing between the rows came toward their box when he got there he leaned on his elbows and smiling talked to her for a long time while conversing with pierre natasha heard a voice in countess box and something told her it was kuragin she turned and their eyes met almost smiling he gazed straight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be so near him to look at him like that to be so sure he admired her and not to be acquainted with him 
 in the second act there was scenery representing tombstones there was a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon shades were raised over the footlights and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding things like daggers in their hands they began waving their arms then some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been in white and was now in light blue they did not drag her away at once but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off and behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyone knelt down and sang a prayer all these things were repeatedly interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience 
 during this act every time natasha looked toward the stalls she saw anatole kuragin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair staring at her she was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it 
 when the second act was over countess bezukhova rose turned to the rostovs box her whole bosom completely exposed beckoned the old count with a gloved finger and paying no attention to those who had entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile 
 do make me acquainted with your charming daughters said she the whole town is singing their praises and i even know then 
 natasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess she was so pleased by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure 
 i want to become a moscovite too now said helene how is it not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country 
 countess bezukhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating woman she could say what she did not think especially what was flattering quite simply and naturally 
 dear count you must let me look after your daughters though i am not staying here long this time nor are you i will try to amuse them i have already heard much of you in petersburg and wanted to get to know you said she to natasha with her stereotyped and lovely smile i had heard about you from my page drubetskoy have you heard he is getting married and also from my friend bolkonski prince andrew bolkonski she went on with special emphasis implying that she knew of his relation to natasha to get better acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the performance and natasha moved over to it 
 the scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the walls in the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen the king waved his right arm and evidently nervous sang something badly and sat down on a crimson throne the maiden who had been first in white and then in light blue now wore only a smock and stood beside the throne with her hair down she sang something mournfully addressing the queen but the king waved his arm severely and men and women with bare legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together then the violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick bare legs and thin arms separating from the others went behind the wings adjusted her bodice returned to the middle of the stage and began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other in the stalls everyone clapped and shouted bravo then one of the men went into a corner of the stage the cymbals and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly and this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet about very rapidly he was duport who received sixty thousand rubles a year for this art everybody in the stalls boxes and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might and the man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides then other men and women danced with bare legs then the king again shouted to the sound of music and they all began singing but suddenly a storm came on chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the orchestra everyone ran off again dragging one of their number away and the curtain dropped once more there was a terrible noise and clatter among the audience and with rapturous faces everyone began shouting duport duport duport natasha no longer thought this strange she look about with pleasure smiling joyfully 
 duport delightful helene asked her 
 oh yes replied natasha

 the gamin should have his place in the classifications of india 
 the body of street arabs in paris almost constitutes a caste one might almost say 
 not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so 
 this word gamin was printed for the first time and reached popular speech through the literary tongue in 
 it is in a little work entitled claude gueux that this word made its appearance the horror was lively 
 the word passed into circulation 
 the elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for each other are very various 
 we have known and associated with one who was greatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall from the top of the tower of another because he had succeeded in making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the dome of the invalides had been temporarily deposited and had prigged some lead from them a third because he had seen a diligence tip over still another because he knew a soldier who came near putting out the eye of a citizen 
 this explains that famous exclamation of a parisian gamin a profound epiphonema which the vulgar herd laughs at without de dieu 
 what i do have to think that i have never yet seen anybody tumble from a window i have pronounced and fifth pronounced fift 
 surely this saying of a peasant is a fine one 
 father your wife has died of her malady why did you not send for the doctor what would you have sir we poor folks die of ourselves but if the whole passivity lies in this saying the whole of the anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is assuredly contained in this other saying 
 a man condemned to death is listening to his confessor in the tumbrel 
 the child of paris exclaims he is talking to his black cap 
 oh the sneak 
 a certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin to be is an important item 
 to be present at executions constitutes a duty 
 he shows himself at the guillotine and he laughs 
 he calls it by all sorts of pet names the end of the soup the growler the mother in the blue the sky the last mouthful etc etc 
 in order not to lose anything of the affair he scales the walls he hoists himself to balconies he ascends trees he suspends himself to gratings he clings fast to chimneys 
 the gamin is born a tiler as he is born a mariner a roof inspires him with no more fear than a mast 
 there is no festival which comes up to an execution on the place de greve samson and the abbe montes are the truly popular names 
 they hoot at the victim in order to encourage him 
 they sometimes admire him lacenaire when a gamin on seeing the hideous dautin die bravely uttered these words which contain a future 
 i was jealous of him in the brotherhood of gamins voltaire is not known but papavoine is politicians are confused with assassins in the same legend they have a tradition as to last garment 
 it is known that tolleron had a cap avril an otter cap losvel a round hat that old delaporte was bald and that castaing was all ruddy and very handsome that bories had a romantic small beard that jean martin kept on his suspenders that lecouffe and his mother quarrelled 
 reproach each other for your basket shouted a gamin to them 
 another in order to get a look at debacker as he passed and being too small in the crowd caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbed it 
 a gendarme stationed opposite frowned 
 let me climb up le gendarme said the gamin 
 and to soften the heart of the authorities he added i will not fall 
 i care if you do retorted the gendarme 
 in the brotherhood of gamins a memorable accident counts for a great deal 
 one reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cut self very deeply to the very bone 
 the fist is no mediocre element of respect 
 one of the things that the gamin is fondest of saying is 
 i am fine and strong come now 
 to be renders you very enviable 
 a squint is highly esteemed

 during the a whiff of cold air came into box the door opened and anatole entered stooping and trying not to brush against anyone 
 let me introduce my brother to you said helene her eyes shifting uneasily from natasha to anatole 
 natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer and smiled at him over her bare shoulder anatole who was as handsome at close quarters as at a distance sat down beside her and told her he had long wished to have this happiness ever since the naryshkins ball in fact at which he had had the pleasure of seeing her kuragin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men he talked boldly and naturally and natasha was strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much talk but that on the contrary his smile was most naive cheerful and 
 kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a previous performance semenova had fallen down on the stage 
 and do you know countess he said suddenly addressing her as an old familiar acquaintance we are getting up a costume tournament you ought to take part in it it will be great fun we shall all meet at the karagins please come no really eh said he 
 while saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face her neck and her bare arms natasha knew for certain that he was enraptured by her this pleased her yet his presence made her feel constrained and oppressed when she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking at her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should look into hers rather than this but looking into his eyes she was frightened realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other men she did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to this man when she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck they spoke of most ordinary things yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man natasha kept turning to helene and to her father as if asking what it all meant but helene was engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer her look and her eyes said nothing but what they always said having a good time well glad of it 
 during one of these moments of awkward silence when prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her natasha to break the silence asked him how he liked moscow she asked the question and blushed she felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing something improper anatole smiled as though to encourage her 
 at first i did not like it much because what makes a town pleasant ce sont les jolies femmes that so but now i like it very much indeed he said looking at her significantly come to the costume tournament countess do come and putting out his hand to her bouquet and dropping his voice he added you will be the prettiest there do come dear countess and give me this flower as a pledge 
 are the pretty women 
 natasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did himself but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper intention she did not know what to say and turned away as if she had not heard his remark but as soon as she had turned away she felt that he was there behind so close behind her 
 how is he now confused angry ought i to put it right she asked herself and she could not refrain from turning round she looked straight into his eyes and his nearness and the tenderness of his smile vanquished her she smiled just as he was doing gazing straight into his eyes and again she felt with horror that no barrier lay between him and her 
 the curtain rose again anatole left the box serene and gay natasha went back to her father in the other box now quite submissive to the world she found herself in all that was going on before her now seemed quite natural but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her betrothed of princess mary or of life in the country did not once recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past 
 in the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm about till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared down below that was the only part of the fourth act that natasha saw she felt agitated and tormented and the cause of this was kuragin whom she could not help watching as they were leaving the theater anatole came up to them called their carriage and helped them in as he was putting natasha in he pressed her arm above the elbow agitated and flushed she turned round he was looking at her with glittering eyes smiling tenderly 
 only after she had reached home was natasha able clearly to think over what had happened to her and suddenly remembering prince andrew she was horrified and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera she gave a loud exclamation flushed and ran out of the room 
 o god i am lost she said to herself how could i let him she sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize what had happened to her but was unable either to understand what had happened or what she felt everything seemed dark obscure and terrible there in that enormous illuminated theater where the duport in a jacket jumped about to the music on wet boards and young girls and old men and the nearly naked helene with her proud calm smile rapturously cried bravo there in the presence of that helene it had all seemed clear and simple but now alone by herself it was incomprehensible what is it what was that terror i felt of him what is this gnawing of conscience i am feeling now she thought 
 only to the old countess at night in bed could natasha have told all she was feeling she knew that sonya with her severe and simple views would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a confession so natasha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself 
 am i spoiled for love or not she asked herself and with soothing irony replied what a fool i am to ask that what did happen to me nothing i have done nothing i lead him on at all nobody will know and i shall never see him again she told herself so it is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of and andrew can love me still but why still o god why he here natasha quieted herself for a moment but again some instinct told her that though all this was true and though nothing had happened yet the former purity of her love for prince andrew had perished and again in imagination she went over her whole conversation with kuragin and again saw the face gestures and tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm

 chapter viii 
 
 in which the reader will find a charming saying of the last king 
 in summer he metamorphoses himself into a frog and in the evening when night is falling in front of the bridges of austerlitz and jena from the tops of coal wagons and the boats he hurls himself headlong into the seine and into all possible infractions of the laws of modesty and of the police 
 nevertheless the police keep an eye on him and the result is a highly dramatic situation which once gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry that cry which was celebrated about is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin it scans like a verse from homer with a notation as inexpressible as the eleusiac chant of the panathenaea and in it one encounters again the ancient evohe 
 here it is ohe titi oheee 
 here comes the bobby here comes the pick up your duds and be off through the sewer with you 
 sometimes this is what he calls how to read sometimes he knows how to write he always knows how to daub he does not hesitate to acquire by no one knows what mysterious mutual instruction all the talents which can be of use to the public from to he imitated the cry of the turkey from to he scrawled pears on the walls 
 one summer evening when louis philippe was returning home on foot he saw a little fellow no higher than his knee perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one of the pillars of the gate of neuilly the king with that which came to him from henry iv helped the gamin finished the pear and gave the child a louis saying 
 the pear is on that also the gamin loves uproar a certain state of violence pleases him 
 he execrates the cures one day in the rue de one of these scamps was putting his thumb to his nose at the carriage gate of no 
 why are you doing that at the gate a asked 
 the boy replied there is a cure there 
 it was there in fact that the papal nuncio lived 
 louis xviii 
 is represented in comic pictures of that day as having a head 
 nevertheless whatever may be the voltairianism of the small gamin if the occasion to become a chorister presents itself it is quite possible that he will accept and in that case he serves the mass civilly 
 there are two things to which he plays tantalus and which he always desires without ever attaining them to overthrow the government and to get his trousers sewed up again 
 the gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of paris and can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to meet 
 he can tell them off on the tips of his fingers he studies their habits and he has special notes on each one of them 
 he reads the souls of the police like an open book he will tell you fluently and without flinching 
 such an one is a traitor such another is very malicious such another is great such another is ridiculous 
 all these words traitor malicious great ridiculous have a particular meaning in his mouth that one imagines that he owns the and he prevents people from walking on the cornice outside the parapet that other has a mania for pulling ears etc etc

 anatole kuragin was staying in moscow because his father had sent him away from petersburg where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles a year in cash besides running up debts for as much more which his creditors demanded from his father 
 his father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the last time but only on condition that he went to moscow as adjutant to the commander in chief a post his father had procured for him and would at last try to make a good match there he indicated to him princess mary and julie karagina 
 anatole consented and went to moscow where he put up at house pierre received him unwillingly at first but got used to him after a while sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals and gave him money under the guise of loans 
 as shinshin had remarked from the time of his arrival anatole had turned the heads of the moscow ladies especially by the fact that he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and french actresses with the chief of whom mademoiselle george he was said to be on intimate relations he had never missed a carousal at or other moscow revelers drank whole nights through outvying everyone else and was at all the balls and parties of the best society there was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies and he flirted with a few of them at the balls but he did not run after the unmarried girls especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain there was a special reason for this as he had got married two years before a fact known only to his most intimate friends at that time while with his regiment in poland a polish landowner of small means had forced him to marry his daughter anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and for a payment which he agreed to send to his had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor 
 anatole was always content with his position with himself and with others he was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that was impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had never in his life done anything base he was incapable of considering how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or that action of his might be he was convinced that as a duck is so made that it must live in water so god had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in society he believed this so firmly that others looking at him were persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place in society or money which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay 
 he was not a gambler at any rate he did not care about winning he was not vain he did not mind what people thought of him still less could he be accused of ambition more than once he had vexed his father by spoiling his own career and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds he was not mean and did not refuse anyone who asked of him all he cared about was gaiety and women and as according to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in these tastes and he was incapable of considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others he honestly considered himself irreproachable sincerely despised rogues and bad people and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high 
 rakes those male magdalenes have a secret feeling of innocence similar to that which female magdalenes have based on the same hope of forgiveness all will be forgiven her for she loved much and all will be forgiven him for he enjoyed much 
 dolokhov who had reappeared that year in moscow after his exile and his persian adventures and was leading a life of luxury gambling and dissipation associated with his old petersburg comrade kuragin and made use of him for his own ends 
 anatole was sincerely fond of dolokhov for his cleverness and audacity dolokhov who needed anatole name position and connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set made use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it apart from the advantage he derived from anatole the very process of dominating will was in itself a pleasure a habit and a necessity to dolokhov 
 natasha had made a strong impression on kuragin at supper after the opera he described to dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur the attractions of her arms shoulders feet and hair and expressed his intention of making love to her anatole had no notion and was incapable of considering what might come of such as he never had any notion of the outcome of any of his actions 
 my dear fellow but not for us replied dolokhov 
 i will tell my sister to ask her to dinner said anatole eh 
 better wait till married 
 you know i adore little girls they lose their heads at once pursued anatole 
 you have been caught once already by a little girl said dolokhov who knew of marriage take care 
 well that happen twice eh said anatole with a laugh

 the old soul of gaul 
 there was something of that boy in poquelin the son of the beaumarchais had something of it 
 gaminerie is a shade of the gallic spirit 
 mingled with good sense it sometimes adds force to the latter as alcohol does to wine 
 sometimes it is a defect homer repeats himself eternally granted one may say that voltaire plays the gamin 
 camille desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs 
 championnet who treated miracles brutally rose from the pavements of paris he had when a small lad inundated the porticos of de beauvais and of du mont he had addressed the shrine of familiarly to give orders to the phial of saint januarius 
 the gamin of paris is respectful ironical and insolent 
 he has villainous teeth because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers and handsome eyes because he has wit 
 if jehovah himself were present he would go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot he is strong on boxing 
 all beliefs are possible to him he plays in the gutter and straightens himself up with a revolt his effrontery persists even in the presence of he was a scapegrace he is a hero like the little theban he shakes the skin from the lion barra the was a gamin of paris he shouts forward as the horse of scripture says vah and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to the giant 
 this child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal measure that spread of wings which reaches from moliere to barra 
 to sum up the whole and in one word the gamin is a being who amuses himself because he is unhappy

 the day after the opera the rostovs went nowhere and nobody came to see them marya dmitrievna talked to the count about something which they concealed from natasha natasha guessed they were talking about the old prince and planning something and this disquieted and offended her she was expecting prince andrew any moment and twice that day sent a manservant to the vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he had come he had not arrived she suffered more now than during her first days in moscow to her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant recollection of her interview with princess mary and the old prince and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause she continually fancied that either he would never come or that something would happen to her before he came she could no longer think of him by herself calmly and continuously as she had done before as soon as she began to think of him the recollection of the old prince of princess mary of the theater and of kuragin mingled with her thoughts the question again presented itself whether she was not guilty whether she had not already broken faith with prince andrew and again she found herself recalling to the minutest detail every word every gesture and every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling to the family natasha seemed livelier than usual but she was far less tranquil and happy than before 
 on sunday morning marya dmitrievna invited her visitors to mass at her parish church the church of the assumption built over the graves of victims of the plague 
 i like those fashionable churches she said evidently priding herself on her independence of thought god is the same every where we have an excellent priest he conducts the service decently and with dignity and the deacon is the same what holiness is there in giving concerts in the choir i like it just 
 marya dmitrievna liked sundays and knew how to keep them her whole house was scrubbed and cleaned on saturdays neither she nor the servants worked and they all wore holiday dress and went to church at her table there were extra dishes at dinner and the servants had vodka and roast goose or suckling pig but in nothing in the house was the holiday so noticeable as in marya broad stern face which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity 
 after mass when they had finished their coffee in the dining room where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture a servant announced that the carriage was ready and marya dmitrievna rose with a stern air she wore her holiday shawl in which she paid calls and announced that she was going to see prince nicholas bolkonski to have an explanation with him about natasha 
 after she had gone a dressmaker from madame waited on the rostovs and natasha very glad of this diversion having shut herself into a room adjoining the drawing room occupied herself trying on the new dresses just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and only tacked together and was turning her head to see in the glass how the back fitted she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of her voice and a that made her flush it was helene natasha had not time to take off the bodice before the door opened and countess bezukhova dressed in a purple velvet gown with a high collar came into the room beaming with amiable smiles 
 oh my enchantress she cried to the blushing natasha charming no this is really beyond anything my dear count said she to count rostov who had followed her in how can you live in moscow and go nowhere no i let you off mademoiselle george will recite at my house tonight and be some people and if you bring your lovely girls who are prettier than mademoiselle george i know you my husband is away in tver or i would send him to fetch you you must come you positively must between eight and nine 
 she nodded to the dressmaker whom she knew and who had curtsied respectfully to her and seated herself in an armchair beside the looking glass draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely she did not cease chattering and gaily continually praising beauty she looked at dresses and praised them as well as a new dress of her own made of metallic gauze which she had received from paris and advised natasha to have one like it 
 but anything suits you my charmer she remarked 
 a smile of pleasure never left face she felt happy and as if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear countess bezukhova who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was now so kind to her natasha brightened up and felt almost in love with this woman who was so beautiful and so kind helene for her part was sincerely delighted with natasha and wished to give her a good time anatole had asked her to bring him and natasha together and she was calling on the rostovs for that purpose the idea of throwing her brother and natasha together amused her 
 though at one time in petersburg she had been annoyed with natasha for drawing boris away she did not think of that now and in her own way heartily wished natasha well as she was leaving the rostovs she called her protegee aside 
 my brother dined with me yesterday we nearly died of laughter he ate nothing and kept sighing for you my charmer he is madly quite madly in love with you my dear 
 natasha blushed scarlet when she heard this 
 how she blushes how she blushes my pretty said helene you must certainly come if you love somebody my charmer that is not a reason to shut yourself up even if you are engaged i am sure your fiance would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to death 
 so she knows i am engaged and she and her husband pierre that good pierre have talked and laughed about this so all right and again under influence what had seemed terrible now seemed simple and natural and she is such a grande dame so kind and evidently likes me so much and why not enjoy myself thought natasha gazing at helene with wondering eyes 
 marya dmitrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious having evidently suffered a defeat at the old she was still too agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly in answer to the inquiries she replied that things were all right and that she would tell about it next day on hearing of countess visit and the invitation for that evening marya dmitrievna remarked 
 i care to have anything to do with bezukhova and advise you to however if promised go it will divert your thoughts she added addressing natasha

 ecce paris ecce homo 
 to sum it all up once more the paris gamin of like the graeculus of rome in days gone by is the infant populace with the wrinkle of the old world on his brow 
 the gamin is a grace to the nation and at the same time a disease a disease which must be cured how 
 by light 
 light renders healthy 
 light kindles 
 all generous social irradiations spring from science letters arts education 
 make men make men 
 give them light that they may warm you sooner or later the splendid question of universal education will present itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth and then those who govern under the superintendence of the french idea will have to make this choice the children of france or the gamins of paris flames in the light or in the gloom 
 the gamin expresses paris and paris expresses the world 
 for paris is a total 
 paris is the ceiling of the human race the whole of this prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and living manners 
 he who sees paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history with heaven and constellations in the intervals 
 paris has a capital the a parthenon a mount aventine the faubourg an asinarium the sorbonne a pantheon the pantheon a via sacra the boulevard des italiens a temple of the winds opinion and it replaces the gemoniae by ridicule its majo is called faraud its transteverin is the man of the faubourgs its hammal is the its lazzarone is the pegre its cockney is the native of ghent 
 everything that exists elsewhere exists at paris

 seek something that paris has not 
 the vat of trophonius contains nothing that is not in tub ergaphilas lives again in cagliostro the brahmin vasaphanta become incarnate in the comte de the cemetery of works quite as good miracles as the mosque of oumoumie at damascus 
 paris has an and a canidia mademoiselle lenormand it is terrified like delphos at the fulgurating realities of the vision it makes tables turn as dodona did tripods 
 it places the grisette on the throne as rome placed the courtesan there and taking it altogether if louis xv 
 is worse than claudian madame dubarry is better than messalina 
 paris combines in an unprecedented type which has existed and which we have elbowed grecian nudity the hebraic ulcer and the gascon pun it mingles diogenes job and dresses up a spectre in old numbers of the constitutional and makes chodruc duclos 
 although plutarch says 
 the tyrant never grows old rome under sylla as under domitian resigned itself and willingly put water in its wine 
 the tiber was a lethe if the rather doctrinary eulogium made of it by varus vibiscus is to be credited 
 contra gracchos tiberim habemus bibere tiberim id est seditionem oblivisci paris drinks a million litres of water a day but that does not prevent it from occasionally beating the general alarm and ringing the tocsin 
 with that exception paris is amiable 
 it accepts everything royally it is not too particular about its venus its callipyge is hottentot provided that it is made to laugh it condones ugliness cheers it deformity provokes it to laughter vice diverts it be eccentric and you may be an eccentric even hypocrisy that supreme cynicism does not disgust it it is so literary that it does not hold its nose before basile and is no more scandalized by the prayer of tartuffe than horace was repelled by the hiccup of priapus no trait of the universal face is lacking in the profile of paris the bal mabile is not the polymnia dance of the janiculum but the dealer in ladies wearing apparel there devours the lorette with her eyes exactly as the procuress staphyla lay in wait for the virgin planesium 
 the barriere du combat is not the coliseum but people are as ferocious there as though caesar were looking on the syrian hostess has more grace than mother saguet but if virgil haunted the roman david balzac and charlet have sat at the tables of parisian taverns 
 paris reigns geniuses flash forth there the red tails prosper there adonai passes on his chariot with its twelve wheels of thunder and lightning silenus makes his entry there on his ass 
 for silenus read ramponneau 
 paris is the synonym of cosmos paris is athens sybaris jerusalem pantin 
 all civilizations are there in an abridged form all barbarisms also 
 paris would greatly regret it if it had not a guillotine 
 a little of the place de greve is a good thing 
 what would all that eternal festival be without this seasoning 
 our laws are wisely provided and thanks to them this blade drips on this shrove tuesday

 count rostov took the girls to countess there were a good many people there but nearly all strangers to natasha count rostov was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct mademoiselle george was standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young men there were several frenchmen present among them metivier who from the time helene reached moscow had been an intimate in her house the count decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight and to get away as soon as mademoiselle performance was over 
 anatole was at the door evidently on the lookout for the rostovs immediately after greeting the count he went up to natasha and followed her as soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had had at the opera gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at the absence of a moral barrier between them 
 helene welcomed natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her beauty and her dress soon after their arrival mademoiselle george went out of the room to change her costume in the drawing room people began arranging the chairs and taking their seats anatole moved a chair for natasha and was about to sit down beside her but the count who never lost sight of her took the seat himself anatole sat down behind her 
 mademoiselle george with her bare fat dimpled arms and a red shawl draped over one shoulder came into the space left vacant for her and assumed an unnatural pose enthusiastic whispering was audible 
 mademoiselle george looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and began reciting some french verses describing her guilty love for her son in some places she raised her voice in others she whispered lifting her head triumphantly sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse sounds rolling her eyes 
 adorable divine delicious was heard from every side 
 natasha looked at the fat actress but neither saw nor heard nor understood anything of what went on before her she only felt herself again completely borne away into this strange senseless world so remote from her old world a world in which it was impossible to know what was good or bad reasonable or senseless behind her sat anatole and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of expectancy 
 after the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded mademoiselle george expressing their enthusiasm 
 how beautiful she is natasha remarked to her father who had also risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress 
 i think so when i look at you said anatole following natasha he said this at a moment when she alone could hear him you are enchanting from the moment i saw you i have never ceased 
 come come natasha said the count as he turned back for his daughter how beautiful she is natasha without saying anything stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring eyes 
 after giving several recitations mademoiselle george left and countess bezukhova asked her visitors into the ballroom 
 the count wished to go home but helene entreated him not to spoil her improvised ball and the rostovs stayed on anatole asked natasha for a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her she was bewitching and that he loved her during the ecossaise which she also danced with him anatole said nothing when they happened to be by themselves but merely gazed at her natasha lifted her frightened eyes to him but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate look and smile that she could not whilst looking at him say what she had to say she lowered her eyes 
 say such things to me i am betrothed and love another she said rapidly she glanced at him 
 anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said 
 speak to me of that what can i do said he i tell you i am madly madly in love with you is it my fault that you are enchanting our turn to begin 
 natasha animated and excited looked about her with frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual she understood hardly anything that went on that evening they danced the ecossaise and the grossvater her father asked her to come home but she begged to remain wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to she felt his eyes upon her later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress that helene had followed her and spoken laughingly of her love and that she again met anatole in the little sitting room helene had disappeared leaving them alone and anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice 
 i cannot come to visit you but is it possible that i shall never see you i love you madly can i never and blocking her path he brought his face close to hers 
 his large glittering masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw nothing but them 
 natalie he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being painfully pressed natalie 
 i understand i have nothing to say her eyes replied 
 burning lips were pressed to hers and at the same instant she felt herself released and footsteps and the rustle of her dress were heard in the room natasha looked round at her and then red and trembling threw a frightened look of inquiry at anatole and moved toward the door 
 one word just one for sake cried anatole 
 she paused she so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what had happened and to which she could find no answer 
 natalie just a word only one he kept repeating evidently not knowing what to say and he repeated it till helene came up to them 
 helene returned with natasha to the drawing room the rostovs went away without staying for supper 
 after reaching home natasha did not sleep all night she was tormented by the insoluble question whether she loved anatole or prince andrew she loved prince andrew she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved him but she also loved anatole of that there was no doubt else how could all this have happened thought she if after that i could return his smile when saying if i was able to let it come to that it means that i loved him from the first it means that he is kind noble and splendid and i could not help loving him what am i to do if i love him and the other one too she asked herself unable to find an answer to these terrible questions

 to scoff to reign 
 there is no limit to paris 
 no city has had that domination which sometimes derides those whom it subjugates 
 to please you o athenians exclaimed alexander 
 paris makes more than the law it makes the fashion paris sets more than the fashion it sets the routine 
 paris may be stupid if it sees fit it sometimes allows itself this luxury then the universe is stupid in company with it then paris awakes rubs its eyes says 
 how stupid i am and bursts out laughing in the face of the human race what a marvel is such a city it is a strange thing that this grandioseness and this burlesque should be amicable neighbors that all this majesty should not be thrown into disorder by all this parody and that the same mouth can blow into the trump of the judgment day and into the paris has a sovereign joviality 
 its gayety is of the thunder and its farce holds a sceptre 
 its tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace

 such is paris 
 the smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe a heap of mud and stone if you will but above all a moral being it is more than great it is immense 
 why 
 because it is daring 
 to dare that is the price of progress 
 all sublime conquests are more or less the prizes of daring in order that the revolution should take place it does not suffice that montesquieu should foresee it that diderot should preach it that beaumarchais should announce it that condorcet should calculate it that arouet should prepare it that rousseau should premeditate it it is necessary that danton should dare it 
 the cry 
 audacity is a fiat lux 
 it is necessary for the sake of the forward march of the human race that there should be proud lessons of courage permanently on the heights 
 daring deeds dazzle history and are one of great sources of light the dawn dares when it rises 
 to attempt to brave to persist to persevere to be faithful to self to grasp fate bodily to astound catastrophe by the small amount of fear that it occasions us now to affront unjust power again to insult drunken victory to hold position to stand ground that is the example which nations need that is the light which electrifies them the same formidable lightning proceeds from the torch of prometheus to short pipe

 book eight 
 chapter xiv 
 
 morning came with its cares and bustle everyone got up and began to move about and talk dressmakers came again marya dmitrievna appeared and they were called to breakfast natasha kept looking uneasily at everybody with eyes as if wishing to intercept every glance directed toward her and tried to appear the same as usual 
 after breakfast which was her best time marya dmitrievna sat down in her armchair and called natasha and the count to her 
 well friends i have now thought the whole matter over and this is my advice she began yesterday as you know i went to see prince bolkonski well i had a talk with him he took it into his head to begin shouting but i am not one to be shouted down i said what i had to say 
 well and he asked the count 
 he crazy he did not want to listen but the use of talking as it is we have worn the poor girl out said marya dmitrievna my advice to you is finish your business and go back home to otradnoe and wait there 
 oh no exclaimed natasha 
 yes go back said marya dmitrievna and wait there if your betrothed comes here now there will be no avoiding a quarrel but alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you 
 count rostov approved of this suggestion appreciating its reasonableness if the old man came round it would be all the better to visit him in moscow or at bald hills later on and if not the wedding against his wishes could only be arranged at otradnoe 
 that is perfectly true and i am sorry i went to see him and took her said the old count 
 no why be sorry being here you had to pay your respects but if he his affair said marya dmitrievna looking for something in her reticule besides the trousseau is ready so there is nothing to wait for and what is not ready send after you though i like letting you go it is the best way so go with blessing 
 having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to natasha it was a letter from princess mary 
 she has written to you how she torments herself poor thing afraid you might think that she does not like you 
 but she like me said natasha 
 talk nonsense cried marya dmitrievna 
 i believe anyone i know she like me replied natasha boldly as she took the letter and her face expressed a cold and angry resolution that caused marya dmitrievna to look at her more intently and to frown 
 answer like that my good girl she said what i say is true write an answer natasha did not reply and went to her own room to read princess letter 
 princess mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that had occurred between them whatever her feelings might be she begged natasha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one chosen by her brother for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice everything 
 do not think however she wrote that my father is toward you he is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy princess mary went on to ask natasha to fix a time when she could see her again 
 after reading the letter natasha sat down at the writing table to answer it dear princess she wrote in french quickly and mechanically and then paused what more could she write after all that had happened the evening before yes yes all that has happened and now all is changed she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her must i break off with him must i really awful and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to sonya and began sorting patterns with her 
 after dinner natasha went to her room and again took up princess letter can it be that it is all over she thought can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before she recalled her love for prince andrew in all its former strength and at the same time felt that she loved kuragin she vividly pictured herself as prince wife and the scenes of happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination and at the same time aglow with excitement recalled every detail of interview with anatole 
 why could that not be as well she sometimes asked herself in complete bewilderment only so could i be completely happy but now i have to choose and i be happy without either of them only she thought to tell prince andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both equally impossible but with that one nothing is spoiled but am i really to abandon forever the joy of prince love in which i have lived so long 
 please miss whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious air a man told me to give you this and she handed natasha a letter 
 only for sake the girl went on as natasha without thinking mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from anatole of which without taking in a word she understood only that it was a letter from him from the man she loved yes she loved him or else how could that have happened which had happened and how could she have a love letter from him in her hand 
 with trembling hands natasha held that passionate love letter which dolokhov had composed for anatole and as she read it she found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling 
 since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed to be loved by you or to die there is no other way for me the letter began then he went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him for this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her but that if she loved him she need only say the word yes and no human power could hinder their bliss love would conquer all he would steal her away and carry her off to the ends of the earth 
 yes yes i love him thought natasha reading the letter for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of it 
 that evening marya dmitrievna was going to the akharovs and proposed to take the girls with her natasha pleading a headache remained at home

 of seditions troubles 
 shepherds of people had need know the calendars of tempests in state which are commonly greatest when things grow to equality as natural tempests are greatest about the equinoxes and as there are certain hollow blasts of wind and secret swellings of seas before a tempest so are there in states ille etiam caecos instare tumultus sa epe et operta tumescere bella libels and licentious discourses against the state when they are frequent and open and in like sort false news often running up and down to the disadvantage of the 
 state and hastily embraced are amongst the signs of troubles virgil giving the 
 pedigree of fame saith she was sister to the giants 
 illam terra parens ira irritata deorun progenuit as if fame were the relics of seditions past but they are no less indeed the preludes of seditions to come howsoever he noteth it right that seditious tumults and seditious fame differ no more but as brother and sister masculine and feminine especially if it come to that that the best actions of a state and the most plausible and which ought to give greatest contentment are taken in ill sense and traduced for that shows the envy great as tacitus saith conflata magnia invidia seu bene seu male gesta premunt neither doth it follow that because these fames are a sign of troubles that the suppressing of them with too much severity should be a remedy 
 of troubles 
 for the despising of them many times checks them best and the going 
 about to stop them doth but make a wonder also that kind of obedience which tacitus speaketh of is to be held suspected erant in cfficio sed tamen qvi mallent mandata imperantium interpretari quam exseqid disputing excusing calling upon mandates and directions is a kind of shaking off the yoke and assay of disobedience especially if in those disputings they which are for the direction speak fearfully and tenderly and those that are against it audaciously 
 also as machiavelli noteth well when princes that ought to be common parents make themselves as a party and lean to a side it is as a boat that is overthrown by uneven weight on the one side as was well seen in the time of henry the third of france for first himself entered league for the extirpation of the protestants and presently after the same league was turned upon himself for when the authority of princes is made but an accessory to a cause and that there be other bands that tie faster than the band of sovereignty kings begin to be put almost out of possession 
 also when discords and quarrels and factions are carried openly and audaciously it is a sign the reverence of government is lost for the motions of the greatest persons in a government ought to be as the motions of the planets under primum mobile according to the old opinion which is that every of them is carried swiftly by the highest motion and softly in their own motion 
 and therefore when great ones in their own particular motion move violently and as tacitus expressed it well liberals quam ut imperantium meminissent it is a sign the orbs are out of frame 
 for reverence is that wherewith princes are girt from god who threatneth the 
 dissolving thereof solvam cingula regum 
 so when any of the four pillars of government are mainly shaken or weakened which are religion justice counsel and treasure men had need to pray for fair weather but let us pass from this part of predictions concerning which nevertheless more light may be taken from that which followeth and let us speak first of the materials of seditions then of the motives of them and thirdly of the remedies 
 concerning the materials of seditions it is a thing well to be considered for the 
 surest way to prevent seditions if the times do bear it is to take away the matter of them for if there be fuel prepared it is hard to tell whence the spark shall come that shall set it on fire the matter of seditions is of two kinds much poverty and much discontentment it is certain so many overthrown estates so many votes for troubles lucan noteth well the state of rome before the civil war 
 hinc usura vorax rapidumque in tempore foenus hinc concussa fides et multis utile bellum this same mutes utile bellurn is an assured and infallible sign of a state disposed to seditions and troubles and if this poverty and broken estate in the better sort be joined with a want and necessity in the mean people the danger is imminent and great for the rebellions of the belly are the worst as for discontentments they are in the politic body like to humours in the natural which are apt to gather a preternatural heat and to inflame and let no prince measure the danger of them by this whether they be just or unjust for that were to imagine people to be too reasonable who do often spurn at their own good nor yet by this whether me griefs whereupon they rise be in fact great or small for they are the most dangerous discontentments where the fear is greater than the feeling dolendi modus timendi non item besides in great oppressions the same things that provoke the patience do withal mate the courage but in fears it is not so neither let any prince or state be secure concerning discontentments because they have been often or have been long and yet no peril hath ensued for as it is true that every vapour or fume 
 doth not turn into a storm so it is nevertheless true that storms though they 
 blow over divers times yet may fall at last and as me spanish proverb noteth well 
 
 the cord hreaketh at the last by me weakest pull 
 the causes and motives of seditions are innovation in religion 
 taxes alteration of laws and customs breaking of privileges general oppression 
 advancement of unworthy persons strangers dearths disbanded soldiers factions grown desperate and whatsoever in offending people joined and knitteth them in a common cause 
 
 for the remedies there may be some general preservatives whereof we will speak as for the just cure it must answer to the particular disease and so be left to counsel rather than rule 
 
 the first remedy or prevention is to remove by all means possible that material 
 cause of sedition whereof we spoke which is want and poverty in the estate 
 to which purpose serveth the opening and well balancing of trade the cherishing of manufactures me banishing of idleness the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws the improvement and husbanding of the soil the regulating of prices of things vendible the moderating of taxes and tributes and the like 
 generally it is to be foreseen that the population of a kingdom especially if it be not mown down by wars do not exceed the stock of the kingdom which should maintain them neither is the population to be reckoned only by number for a smaller number that spend more and earn less do wear out an estate sooner than a greater number that live lower and gather more therefore the multiplying of nobility and other degrees of quality in an over proportion to the common people doth speedily bring a state to necessity and so doth likewise an overgrown clergy for they bring nothing to the stock and in like manner when more are bred scholars than preferments can take off it is likewise to be remembered that for as much as the increase of any estate must be upon the foreigner for whatsoever is somewhere gotten is somewhere lost there 
 be but three things which one nation selleth unto another the commodity nature 
 yieldeth it the manufacture and the vecture or carriage 
 so that if these three wheels go wealth will flow as in a spring tide and it cometh many times to pass that materiam superabit opus that the work and carriage is more worth than the material and enricheth a state more as is notably seen in the low countrymen who have the best mines above ground in the world 
 above all things good policy is to be used that the treasure and moneys in a state be not gathered into few hands for otherwise a state may have a great stock and yet starve and money is like muck not good except it be spread this is done chiefly by suppressing or at the least keeping a strait hand upon the devouring trades of usury engrossing great pasturages and the like 
 for removing discontentments or at least the danger of them there is in every state as we know two portions of subjects the noblesse and the commonality 
 when one of these is discontent the danger is not great for common 
 people are of slow motion if they be not excited by the greater sort and the greater sort are of small strength except the multitude be apt and ready to move of themselves 
 
 then is the danger when the greater sort do but wait for the troubling of the waters amongst the meaner that then they may declare themselves the poets feign that the rest of the gods would have bound jupiter which he hearing of by the counsel of pallas sent for briareus with his hundred hands to come in to his aid an emblem no doubt to show how safe it is for monarchs to make sure of the good will of common people 
 
 to give moderate liberty for griefs and discontentments to evaporate so it be without too great insolency or bravery is a safe way for he that turneth the humours back and maketh the wound bleed inwards endangereth malign ulcers and pernicious impostumations 
 
 the part of epimetheus mought well become prometheus in the case of discontentments for mere is not a better provision against them epimetheus when griefs and evils flew abroad at last shut the lid and kept hope in the bottom of the vessel certainly the politic and artificial nourishing and entertaining of hopes and carrying men from hopes to hopes is one of the best antidotes against me poison of discontentments and it is a certain sign of a wise government and proceeding when it can hold hearts by hopes when it cannot by satisfaction and when it can handle things in such manner as no evil shall appear so peremptory but that it hath some outlet of hope which is me less hard to do because both particular persons and factions are apt 
 enough to flatter themselves or at least to brave that which they believe not 
 
 also the foresight and prevention that there be no likely or fit head whereunto 
 discontented persons may resort and under whom they may join is a known but an excellent point of caution i understand a fit head to be one that hath greatness and reputation that hath confidence with the discontented party and upon whom they turn their eyes and that is thought discontented in his own particular which kind of persons are either to be won and reconciled to the state and that in a fast and true manner or to be fronted with some other of the same party that may oppose them and so divide the reputation 
 generally the dividing and breaking of all factions and combinations that are adverse to the state and setting them at distance or at least distrust amongst themselves is not one of the worst remedies for it is a desperate case if those that hold with the proceeding of the state be full of discord and faction and those that are against it be entire and united i have noted that some witty and sharp speeches which have fallen from princes have given fire to seditions caesar did himself infinite hurt in that speech sulla nescivit literas non potuit dictare for it did utterly cut off that hope which men had entertained that he would at one time or other give over his dictatorship galba undid himself by that speech legi a se militem non am for it put the soldiers out of hope of the donative probus likewise by that speech si vixero non opus erit amplius romanio imperio militibus a speech of great despair for the soldiers 
 and many the like surely princes had need in tender matters and ticklish times 
 to beware what they say especially in these short speeches which flee abroad like darts and are thought to be shot out of their secret intentions 
 for as for large discourses they are flat things and not so much noted 
 lastly let princes against all events not be without some great person one or 
 rather more of military valour near unto them for the repressing of seditions in 
 their beginnings 
 for without that there useth to be more trepidation in court upon the first breaking out of troubles than were fit and the state runneth the danger 
 of that which tacitus saith atque is habitus animorum fuit ut pessimum facinus 
 auderent pauci plures vellent crimes paterentur but let such military persons be 
 assured and well reputed of rather then factious and popular holding also good correspondence with the other great men in the state or else the remedy is worse than the disease

 book just man 
 chapter xiv 
 
 what he thought 
 one last word 
 since this sort of details might particularly at the present moment and to use an expression now in fashion give to the bishop of d a certain pantheistical physiognomy and induce the belief either to his credit or discredit that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion we insist upon it that not one of those persons who knew monseigneur welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort that which enlightened this man was his heart 
 his wisdom was made of the light which comes from there 
 no systems many works 
 abstruse speculations contain vertigo no there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses the apostle may be daring but the bishop must be timid 
 he would probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are in a manner reserved for terrible great minds there is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma those gloomy openings stand yawning there but something tells you you a in life that you must not enter woe to him who penetrates thither 
 geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation situated so to speak above all dogmas propose their ideas to god 
 their prayer audaciously offers discussion their adoration interrogates 
 this is direct religion which is full of anxiety and responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs 
 human meditation has no limits 
 at his own risk and peril it analyzes and digs deep into its own bedazzlement 
 one might almost say that by a sort of splendid reaction it with it dazzles nature the mysterious world which surrounds us renders back what it has received it is probable that the contemplators are contemplated 
 however that may be there are on earth men they men perceive distinctly at the verge of the horizons of revery the heights of the absolute and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain 
 monseigneur welcome was one of these men monseigneur welcome was not a genius 
 he would have feared those sublimities whence some very great men even like swedenborg and pascal have slipped into insanity 
 certainly these powerful reveries have their moral utility and by these arduous paths one approaches to ideal perfection 
 as for him he took the path which shortens the 
 he did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of mantle he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events he did not see to condense in flame the light of things he had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him this humble soul loved and that was all 
 that he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is probable 
 but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts saint theresa and saint jerome would be heretics 
 he inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates the universe appeared to him like an immense malady everywhere he felt fever everywhere he heard the sound of suffering and without seeking to solve the enigma he strove to dress the wound the terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him he was occupied only in finding for himself and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve 
 that which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation 
 there are men who toil at extracting gold he toiled at the extraction of pity 
 universal misery was his mine 
 the sadness which reigned everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness 
 love each other he declared this to be complete desired nothing further and that was the whole of his doctrine 
 one day that man who believed himself to be a philosopher the senator who has already been alluded to said to the bishop 
 just survey the spectacle of the world all war against all the strongest has the most wit 
 your love each other is replied monseigneur welcome without contesting the point if it is nonsense the soul should shut itself up in it as the pearl in the oyster 
 thus he shut himself up he lived there he was absolutely satisfied with it leaving on one side the prodigious questions which attract and terrify the fathomless perspectives of abstraction the precipices of those profundities which converge for the apostle in god for the atheist in nothingness destiny good and evil the way of being against being the conscience of man the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal the transformation in death the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains the incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent i the essence the substance the nile and the ens the soul nature liberty necessity perpendicular problems sinister obscurities where lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind formidable abysses which lucretius manou saint paul dante contemplate with eyes flashing lightning which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze forth there 
 monseigneur bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of mysterious questions without scrutinizing them and without troubling his own mind with them and who cherished in his own soul a grave respect for darkness

 reaching the last of the journalists ann turns and walks slowly up the steps the press gathering applauds her warmly as she reaches the top her back to them slowly she turns to face them smiling broadly to the the gathering as she looks over them inevitably her eyes fall to joe he smiles back then her expression grows sorrowful she manages another slight smile then turns away from them and walks slowly and gracefully towards the exit the officials step aside for her to pass and then file after her through the door 
 as she leaves joe watches her solemnly the press turning to leave also before turning to go himself irving looks to joe but seeing his gaze unmoved walks away with the rest of them

 the empire strikes back 
 i 
 
 now this is what i call cold luke voice broke the silence he hadobserved since leaving the newly established rebel base hours earlier he wasastride a tauntaun the only other living being as far as the eye could see he felttired and alone and the sound of his own voice startled him 
 luke as well as his fellow members of the rebel alliance took turns exploringthe white wastelands of hoth gathering information about their new home they allreturned to base with mixed feelings of comfort and loneliness there was nothingto contradict their earliest findings that no intelligent lifeforms existed on this coldplanet all that luke had seen on his solitary expeditions were barren white plainsand ranges of mountains that seemed to vanish in the mists of the distanthorizons 
 luke smiled behind the masklike gray bandana that protected him against winds peering out at the icy wastes through his goggles he pulled cap down more snugly about his head 
 one corner of his mouth curled upward as he tried to visualize the officialresearchers in the service of the imperial government the galaxy is peppered withsettlements of colonizers who care little about the affairs of the empire or itsopposition the rebel alliance he thought but a settler would have to be crazy tostake his claims on hoth this planet have a thing to offer anyone exceptus 
 the rebel alliance had established an outpost on the ice world little more than amonth before luke was on the base and although barely old he was addressed as commander skywalker by other rebel warriors thetitle made him feel a bit uncomfortable nonetheless he was already in the positionof giving orders to a band of seasoned soldiers so much had happened to luke andhe had changed a great deal luke himself found it hard to believe that only threeyears ago he was a farm boy on his home world of tatooine 
 the youthful commander spurred his tauntaun come on girl he urged 
 the gray body was insulated from the cold by a covering of thickfur it galloped on muscular hind legs its tridact feet terminating in large hookedclaws that dug up great plumes of snow the lamalike head thrustforward and its serpentine tail coiled out behind as the beast ran up the ice horned head turned from side to side buffeting the winds that assaulted itshaggy muzzle 
 luke wished his mission were finished his body felt nearly frozen in spite ofhis heavily padded clothing but he knew that it was his choice to bethere he had volunteered to ride across the ice fields looking for other lifeforms heshivered as he looked at the long shadow he and the beast cast on the snow thewinds are picking up he thought and these chilling winds bring unendurabletemperatures to the plains after nightfall he was tempted to return to the base alittle early but he knew the importance of establishing the certainty that the rebelswere alone on hoth 
 the tauntaun quickly turned to the right almost throwing luke was still getting used to riding the unpredictable creatures no offense he saidto his mount but feel a lot more at ease in the cockpit of my old reliablelandspeeder but for this mission a its themost efficient and practical form of transportation available on hoth 
 when the beast reached the top of another ice slope luke brought the animal tohalt he pulled off his goggles and squinted for a few moments justlong enough for his eyes to adjust to the blinding glare of the snow 
 suddenly his attention was diverted by the appearance of an object streakingacross the sky leaving behind a lingering trail of smoke as it dipped toward the mistyhorizon luke flashed his gloved hand to his utility belt and clutched his pair ofelectrobinoculars apprehensive he felt a chill that competed with the coldness ofthe hoth atmosphere what he had seen could have been manmade perhaps evensomething launched by the empire the young commander still focused on theobject followed its fiery course and watched intently as it crashed on the whiteground and was consumed in its own explosive brilliance 
 at the sound of the explosion tauntaun shuddered a fearful growlescaped its muzzle and it began to claw nervously at the snow luke patted head trying to reassure the beast he found it difficult to hear himself overthe blustering wind easy girl just another meteorite he shouted theanimal calmed and luke brought the communicator to his mouth echo three toecho seven han ol buddy do you read me 
 static crackled from the receiver then a familiar voice cut through theinterference is that you kid up 
 the voice sounded a little older and somewhat sharper than for amoment luke fondly recalled first meeting the corellian space smuggler in that cantina at a spaceport on tatooine and now he was one of friends who was not an official member of the rebel alliance 
 finished my circle and i picked up any life readings luke spokeinto his comlink pressing his mouth close to the transmitter 
 there enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser han to make his voice heard above the whistling winds my sentry markers areplaced heading back to base 
 see you shortly luke replied he still had his eye on the twisting column ofdark smoke rising from a black spot in the distance a meteorite just hit the groundnear here and i want to check it out i be long 
 clicking off his comlink luke turned his attention to his tauntaun thereptilian creature was pacing shifting its weight from one foot to the other it gaveout a roar that seemed to signal fear 
 whoa girl he said patting the head the matteryousmell something nothing out there 
 but luke too was beginning to feel uneasy for the first time since he had setout from the hidden rebel base if he knew anything about these itwas that their senses were keen without question the animal was trying to tell lukethat something some danger was near 
 not wasting a moment luke removed a small object from his utility belt andadjusted its miniature controls the device was sensitive enough to zero in on eventhe most minute life readings by detecting body temperature and internal life as luke began to scan the readings he realized there was no 
 a shadow crossed over him towering above by a good meter and a half lukespun around and suddenly it seemed as if the terrain itself had come to life a bulk perfectly camouflaged against the sprawling mounds of savagely at him 
 son of a jumpin 
 hand blaster never cleared its holster the huge claw of the wampa icecreature struck him hard and flat against his face knocking him off the tauntaun andinto the freezing snow 
 unconsciousness came swiftly to luke so swiftly that he never even heard thepitiful screams of the tauntaun nor the abrupt silence following the sound of asnapping neck and he never felt his own ankle savagely gripped by his giant hairyattacker or felt his body dragged like a lifeless doll across the plain 
 black smoke was still rising from the depression in the hillside where thing had fallen the smoky clouds had thinned considerably since theobject had crashed to the ground and formed a smoldering crater the dark fumesbeing dispersed over the plains by the icy hoth winds 
 something stirred within the crater 
 first there was only a sound a droning mechanical sound swelling in intensity asif to compete with the howling wind then the thing that glintedin the bright afternoon light as it slowly began to ride from the crater 
 the object appeared to be some form of alien organic life its head a horror its blister eyes training their cold gaze across the evencolder reaches of wilderness but as the thing rose higher from the crater its formshowed it clearly to be a machine of some sort a circular head and equipped withcameras sensors and metal appendages some of which terminated in crablikegrasping pincers 
 the machine hovered over the smoking crater and extended its appendages invarious directions then a signal was set off within its internal mechanical the machine began to float across the icy plain 
 the dark probe droid soon vanished over the distant horizon 
 another rider bundled in winter clothing and mounted on a spotted graytauntaun raced across the slopes of hoth toward the rebel base of operations 
 the eyes like points of cold metal glanced without interest at the domesof dull gray the myriad gun turrets and the colossal power generators that were theonly indications of civilized life on this world han solo gradually slowed guiding the reins so the creature trotted through the entrance of theenormous ice cave 
 han welcomed the relative warmth of the vast complex of caverns warmed byrebel heating units that obtained their power from the huge generators outside thissubterranean base was both a natural ice cave and a maze of angular tunnels blastedfrom a solid mountain of ice by rebel lasers the corellian had been in moredesolate in the galaxy but for the moment he remember the exactlocation of any one of them 
 he dismounted his tauntaun then glanced around to watch the activity takingplace inside the mammoth cave wherever he looked he saw things being or repaired rebels in gray uniforms rushed to unload supplies andadjust equipment and there were robots mostly r units and power droids thatseemed to be everywhere rolling or walking through the ice corridors efficientlyperforming their innumerable tasks 
 han was beginning to wonder if he were mellowing with age at first he hadhad no personal interest in or loyalty to this whole rebel affair his ultimateinvolvement in the conflict between empire and rebel alliance began as a merebusiness transaction selling his services and use of his ship the millennium job had seemed simple enough just pilot ben kenobi plus young luke andtwo droids to the alderaan system how could han have known at the time that hewould also be called on to rescue a princess from the most feared battlestation the death star 
 princess leia organa 
 the more solo thought about her the more he realized how much trouble heeventually bought himself by accepting ben money all han had wantedoriginally was to collect his fee and rocket off to pay back some bad debts that hungover his head like a meteor ready to fall never had he intended to become a hero 
 and yet something had kept him around to join luke and his crazy rebelfriends as they launched the space attack on the death for the present han decide just what that something was 
 now long after the death destruction han was still with the rebelalliance lending his assistance to establish this base on hoth probably the bleakestof all planets in the galaxy but all that was about to change he told himself asfar as he was concerned han solo and the rebels were about to blast off on divergentcourses 
 he walked rapidly through the underground hangar deck where several rebelfighter ship were docked and being serviced by men in gray assisted by droids ofvarious designs of greatest concern to han was the freighter shipresting on its newly installed landing pods this the largest ship in the hangar hadgarnered a few new dents in its metal hull since han first hooked up with skywalkerand kenobi yet the millennium falcon was famous not for its outward appearancebut for its speed this freighter was still fastest ship ever to make the kessel run orto outrun an imperial tie fighter 
 much of the success could be attributed to its maintenance nowentrusted to the shaggy hands of a mountain of brown hair whose facewas at the moment hidden behind a mask 
 chewbacca han giant wookiee copilot was repairing the central lifter when he noticed solo approaching the wookiee stopped hiswork and raised his face shield exposing his furry countenance a growl that in the universe could translate roared from his toothy mouth 
 han solo was one of those few cold the word for it chewie thecorellian replied take a good fight any day over all this hiding and noticed the smoky wisps rising from the newly welded section of metal howare you coming with those lifters 
 chewbacca replied with a typical wookiee grumble 
 all right han said fully agreeing with his desire to return to space tosome other but hoth go to report then give you ahand soon as those lifters are fixed out of here 
 the wookiee barked a joyful chuckle and returned to his work as hancontinued through the artificial ice cavern 
 the command center was alive with electronic equipment and monitoringdevices reaching toward the icy ceiling as in the hangar rebel personnel filled thecommand center the room was full of controller troopers with droid of varying models and sizes all of whom were diligentlyinvolved in converting the chamber into a workable base to replace the one on yavin 
 the man han solo had come to see was busily engaged behind a great attention riveted to a computer screen flashing brilliantly colored wearing the uniform of a rebel general straightened his tall frame to facesolo as he approached 
 general there a hint of life in the area han reported but all theperimeter markings are set so know if anyone comes calling 
 as usual general rieekan did not smile at flippancy but he admiredthe young taking a kind of unofficial membership in the rebellion soimpressed was rieekan by qualities that he often considered giving him anhonorary commission 
 has commander skywalker reported in yet the general inquired 
 checking out a meteorite that hit near him han answered be insoon 
 rieekan quickly glanced at a newly installed radar screen and studied theflashing images with all the meteor activity in this system going to bedifficult to spot approaching ships 
 general i han hesitated i think time for me to move on 
 attention was drawn from general rieekan to a steadily approachingfigure her walk was both graceful and determined and somehow the feminine features seemed incongruous with her white combat at this distance han could tell princess leia was upset 
 good in a fight the general remarked to han adding i hate to loseyou 
 thank you general but a price on my head if i pay off jabbathe hut a walking dead man 
 a death mark is not an easy thing to live with the officer began as hanturned to princess leia solo was not a sentimental sort but he was aware that hewas very emotional now i guess this is it your highness he paused notknowing what response to expect from the princess 
 right leia replied coldly her sudden aloofness was quickly evolvinginto genuine anger 
 han shook his head long ago he had told himself that or some biological class yet to be beyond his meagerpowers of comprehension better leave them to mystery often advised himself 
 but for a while at least han had begun to believe that there was at least onefemale in all the cosmos that he was beginning to understand and yet he had beenwrong before 
 well han said go all mushy on me so long princess 
 abruptly turning his back to her han strode into the quiet corridor thatconnected with the command center his destination was the hangar deck where agiant wookiee and a realities he did for him he was not about to stop walking 
 han leia was rushing after him slightly out of breath 
 coolly he stopped and turned toward her yes your highness 
 i thought you had decided to stay 
 there seemed to be real concern in voice but han could not be certain 
 that bounty hunter we ran into on ord mantell changed my mind 
 does luke know she asked 
 know when he gets back han replied gruffly 
 princess eyes narrowed her gaze judging him with a look he knew a moment han felt like one of the icicles on the surface of the planet 
 give me that look he said sternly every day more bounty hunters aresearching for me going to pay off jabba before he sends any more of hisremotes gank killers and who know what else got to get this price off myhead while i still have a head 
 leia was obviously affected by his words and han could see that she wasconcerned for him as well as perhaps feeling something more 
 but we still need you she said 
 we he asked 
 yes 
 what about you han was careful to emphasize the last word but really why maybe it was something he had for some time wanted to say but hadlacked the he amended the expose his feelings at themoment there seemed to be little to lose and he was ready for whatever she mightsay 
 me she said bluntly i know what you mean 
 incredulous han solo shook his head no you probably 
 and what precisely am i supposed to know anger was growing in her voiceagain probably because han thought she was finally beginning to understand 
 he smiled you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me 
 again the princess mellowed well yes been a great help she before going on to us a natural leader 
 but han refused to let her finish cutting her off in midsentence no yourworship not it 
 suddenly leia was staring directly into face with eyes that were at understanding she started to laugh imagining things 
 am i i think you were afraid i was going to leave you without even a eyes focused on her lips kiss 
 she began to laugh harder now just as soon kiss a wookiee 
 i can arrange that he moved closer to her and she looked radiant even in thecold light of the ice chamber believe me you could use a good kiss so busy giving orders forgotten how to be a woman if have letgo for a moment i could have helped you but too late now sweetheart yourbig opportunity is flying out of here 
 i think i can survive she said obviously irked 
 good luck 
 you even care if the 
 he knew what she was going to say and let her finish spare he interrupted tell me about the rebellion again all you thinkabout as cold as this planet 
 and you think the one to apply some heat 
 sure if i were interested but i think be much fun with stepped back and looked at her again appraising her coolly meetagain he said maybe by then have warmed up a little her expressionhad changed again han had seen killers with kinder eyes 
 you have all the breeding of a bantha she snarled but not as much your trip hot shot princess leia quickly turned away from han and hurrieddown the corridor

 book one 
 chapter xv 
 
 my dear boris said princess anna mikhaylovna to her son as countess carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of count cyril vladimirovich house my dear boris said the mother drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her arm be affectionate and attentive to him count cyril vladimirovich is your godfather after all your future depends on him remember that my dear and be nice to him as you so well know how to be 
 if only i knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it answered her son coldly but i have promised and will do it for your sake 
 although the hall porter saw carriage standing at the entrance after scrutinizing the mother and son who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches and looking significantly at the old cloak he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses and hearing that they wished to see the count said his excellency was worse today and that his excellency was not receiving anyone 
 we may as well go back said the son in french 
 my dear exclaimed his mother imploringly again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him 
 boris said no more but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak 
 my friend said anna mikhaylovna in gentle tones addressing the hall porter i know count cyril vladimirovich is very ill why i have come i am a relation i shall not disturb him my friend i only need see prince vasili sergeevich he is staying here is he not please announce me 
 the hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs and turned away 
 princess drubetskaya to see prince vasili sergeevich he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches shoes and a coat who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing 
 the mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large venetian mirror in the wall and in her shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs 
 my dear she said to her son once more stimulating him by a touch you promised me 
 the son lowering his eyes followed her quietly 
 they entered the large hall from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to prince vasili 
 just as the mother and son having reached the middle of the hall were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and prince vasili came out wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast as was his custom when at home taking leave of a man this was the celebrated petersburg doctor lorrain 
 then it is certain said the prince 
 prince humanum est errare but replied the doctor swallowing his and pronouncing the latin words with a french accent 
 to err is human 
 very well very well 
 seeing anna mikhaylovna and her son prince vasili dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry the son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his face and he smiled slightly 
 ah prince in what sad circumstances we meet again and how is our dear invalid said she as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her 
 prince vasili stared at her and at boris questioningly and perplexed boris bowed politely prince vasili without acknowledging the bow turned to anna mikhaylovna answering her query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient 
 is it possible exclaimed anna mikhaylovna oh how awful it is terrible to think this is my son she added indicating boris he wanted to thank you himself 
 boris bowed again politely 
 believe me prince a heart will never forget what you have done for us 
 i am glad i was able to do you a service my dear anna mikhaylovna said prince vasili arranging his lace frill and in tone and manner here in moscow to anna mikhaylovna whom he had placed under an obligation assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in petersburg at anna reception 
 try to serve well and show yourself worthy added he addressing boris with severity i am glad are you here on leave he went on in his usual tone of indifference 
 i am awaiting orders to join my new regiment your excellency replied boris betraying neither annoyance at the brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance 
 are you living with your mother 
 i am living at countess replied boris again adding your excellency 
 that is with ilya rostov who married nataly shinshina said anna mikhaylovna 
 i know i know answered prince vasili in his monotonous voice i never could understand how nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear a perfectly absurd and stupid fellow and a gambler too i am told 
 but a very kind man prince said anna mikhaylovna with a pathetic smile as though she too knew that count rostov deserved this censure but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man what do the doctors say asked the princess after a pause her worn face again expressing deep sorrow 
 they give little hope replied the prince 
 and i should so like to thank uncle once for all his kindness to me and boris he is his godson she added her tone suggesting that this fact ought to give prince vasili much satisfaction 
 prince vasili became thoughtful and frowned anna mikhaylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for count fortune and hastened to reassure him 
 if it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to uncle said she uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern i know his character noble upright but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses they are still young she bent her head and continued in a whisper has he performed his final duty prince how priceless are those last moments it can make things no worse and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill we women prince and she smiled tenderly always know how to say these things i absolutely must see him however painful it may be for me i am used to suffering 
 evidently the prince understood her and also understood as he had done at anna that it would be difficult to get rid of anna mikhaylovna 
 would not such a meeting be too trying for him dear anna mikhaylovna said he let us wait until evening the doctors are expecting a crisis 
 but one cannot delay prince at such a moment consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake ah it is awful the duties of a christian 
 a door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses the niece entered with a cold stern face the length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs prince vasili turned to her 
 well how is he 
 still the same but what can you expect this noise said the princess looking at anna mikhaylovna as at a stranger 
 ah my dear i hardly knew you said anna mikhaylovna with a happy smile ambling lightly up to the niece i have come and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle i imagine what you have gone through and she sympathetically turned up her eyes 
 the princess gave no reply and did not even smile but left the room at anna mikhaylovna took off her gloves and occupying the position she had conquered settled down in an armchair inviting prince vasili to take a seat beside her 
 boris she said to her son with a smile i shall go in to see the count my uncle but you my dear had better go to pierre meanwhile and forget to give him the rostovs invitation they ask him to dinner i suppose he go she continued turning to the prince 
 on the contrary replied the prince who had plainly become depressed i shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man here he is and the count has not once asked for him 
 he shrugged his shoulders a footman conducted boris down one flight of stairs and up another to rooms

 chapter 
 
 another week i am so many days nearer health and spring i have now heard all my history at different sittings as the housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations continue it in her own words only a little condensed she is on the whole a very fair narrator and i think i could improve her style 
 in the evening she said the evening of my visit to the heights i knew as well as if i saw him that mr heathcliff was about the place and i shunned going out because i still carried his letter in my pocket and want to be threatened or teased any more i had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere as i could not guess how its receipt would affect catherine the consequence was that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days the fourth was sunday and i brought it into her room after the family were gone to church there was a manservant left to keep the house with me and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that i set them wide open and to fulfil my engagement as i knew who would be coming i told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges and he must run over to the village and get a few to be paid for on the morrow he departed and i went upstairs 
 mrs linton sat in a loose white dress with a light shawl over her shoulders in the recess of the open window as usual her thick long hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness and now she wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck her appearance was altered as i had told heathcliff but when she was calm there seemed unearthly beauty in the change the flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness they no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her they appeared always to gaze beyond and far would have said out of this world then the paleness of her haggard aspect having vanished as she recovered the peculiar expression arising from her mental state though painfully suggestive of their causes added to the touching interest which she awakened to me i know and to any person who saw her i should more tangible proofs of convalescence and stamped her as one doomed to decay 
 a book lay spread on the sill before her and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals i believe linton had laid it there for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading or occupation of any kind and he would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her amusement she was conscious of his aim and in her better moods endured his efforts placidly only showing their uselessness by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh and checking him at last with the saddest of smiles and kisses at other times she would turn petulantly away and hide her face in her hands or even push him off angrily and then he took care to let her alone for he was certain of doing no good 
 gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing and the full mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear it was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage which drowned that music about the grange when the trees were in leaf at wuthering heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a season of steady rain and of wuthering heights catherine was thinking as she listened that is if she thought or listened at all but she had the vague distant look i mentioned before which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear or eye 
 a letter for you mrs linton i said gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her knee you must read it immediately because it wants an answer shall i break the seal 
 yes she answered without altering the direction of her eyes i opened was very short now i continued read it she drew away her hand and let it fall i replaced it in her lap and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down but that movement was so long delayed that at last i resumed 
 must i read it it is from mr heathcliff 
 there was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection and a struggle to arrange her ideas she lifted the letter and seemed to peruse it and when she came to the signature she sighed yet still i found she had not gathered its import for upon my desiring to hear her reply she merely pointed to the name and gazed at me with mournful and questioning eagerness 
 well he wishes to see you said i guessing her need of an interpreter in the garden by this time and impatient to know what answer i shall bring 
 as i spoke i observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise its ears as if about to bark and then smoothing them back announce by a wag of the tail that someone approached whom it did not consider a stranger mrs linton bent forward and listened breathlessly the minute after a step traversed the hall the open house was too tempting for heathcliff to resist walking in most likely he supposed that i was inclined to shirk my promise and so resolved to trust to his own audacity with straining eagerness catherine gazed towards the entrance of her chamber he did not hit the right room directly she motioned me to admit him but he found it out ere i could reach the door and in a stride or two was at her side and had her grasped in his arms 
 he neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before i dare say but then my mistress had kissed him first and i plainly saw that he could hardly bear for downright agony to look into her face the same conviction had stricken him as me from the instant he beheld her that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery was fated sure to die 
 oh cathy oh my life how can i bear it was the first sentence he uttered in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair and now he stared at her so earnestly that i thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears into his eyes but they burned with anguish they did not melt 
 what now said catherine leaning back and returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying caprices you and edgar have broken my heart heathcliff and you both came to bewail the deed to me as if you were the people to be pitied i shall not pity you not i you have killed thriven on it i think how strong you are how many years do you mean to live after i am gone 
 heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her he attempted to rise but she seized his hair and kept him down 
 i wish i could hold you she continued bitterly till we were both dead i care what you suffered i care nothing for your sufferings why you suffer i do will you forget me will you be happy when i am in the earth will you say twenty years hence the grave of catherine earnshaw i loved her long ago and was wretched to lose her but it is past loved many others since my children are dearer to me than she was and at death i shall not rejoice that i am going to her i shall be sorry that i must leave them will you say so heathcliff 
 torture me till i am as mad as yourself cried he wrenching his head free and grinding his teeth 
 the two to a cool spectator made a strange and fearful picture well might catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also her present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek and a bloodless lip and scintillating eye and she retained in her closed fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping as to her companion while raising himself with one hand he had taken her arm with the other and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her condition that on his letting go i saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin 
 are you possessed with a devil he pursued savagely to talk in that manner to me when you are dying do you reflect that all those words will be branded on my memory and eating deeper eternally after you have left me you know you lie to say i have killed you and catherine you know that i could as soon forget you as my existence is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness that while you are at peace i shall writhe in the torments of hell 
 i shall not be at peace moaned catherine recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent unequal throbbing of her heart which beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation she said nothing further till the paroxysm was over then she continued more kindly 
 not wishing you greater torment than i have heathcliff i only wish us never to be parted and should a word of mine distress you hereafter think i feel the same distress underground and for my own sake forgive me come here and kneel down again you never harmed me in your life nay if you nurse anger that will be worse to remember than my harsh words you come here again do 
 heathcliff went to the back of her chair and leant over but not so far as to let her see his face which was livid with emotion she bent round to look at him he would not permit it turning abruptly he walked to the fireplace where he stood silent with his back towards us mrs glance followed him suspiciously every movement woke a new sentiment in her after a pause and a prolonged gaze she resumed addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment 
 oh you see nelly he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave that is how loved well never mind that is not my heathcliff i shall love mine yet and take him with me in my soul and added she musingly the thing that irks me most in this shattered prison after all tired tired of being enclosed here wearying to escape into that glorious world and to be always there not seeing it dimly through tears and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart but really with it and in it nelly you think you are better and more fortunate than i in full health and strength you are sorry for soon that will be altered i shall be sorry for you i shall be incomparably beyond and above you all i wonder he be near me she went on to herself i thought he wished it heathcliff dear you should not be sullen now do come to me heathcliff 
 in her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair at that earnest appeal he turned to her looking absolutely desperate his eyes wide and wet at last flashed fiercely on her his breast heaved convulsively an instant they held asunder and then how they met i hardly saw but catherine made a spring and he caught her and they were locked in an embrace from which i thought my mistress would never be released alive in fact to my eyes she seemed directly insensible he flung himself into the nearest seat and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted he gnashed at me and foamed like a mad dog and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy i did not feel as if i were in the company of a creature of my own species it appeared that he would not understand though i spoke to him so i stood off and held my tongue in great perplexity 
 a movement of relieved me a little presently she put up her hand to clasp his neck and bring her cheek to his as he held her while he in return covering her with frantic caresses said wildly 
 you teach me now how cruel and false why did you despise me why did you betray your own heart cathy i have not one word of comfort you deserve this you have killed yourself yes you may kiss me and cry and ring out my kisses and tears blight damn you you loved what right had you to leave me what the poor fancy you felt for linton because misery and degradation and death and nothing that god or satan could inflict would have parted us you of your own will did it i have not broken your have broken it and in breaking it you have broken mine so much the worse for me that i am strong do i want to live what kind of living will it be when god would you like to live with your soul in the grave 
 let me alone let me alone sobbed catherine if i have done wrong dying for it it is enough you left me too but i upbraid you i forgive you forgive me 
 it is hard to forgive and to look at those eyes and feel those wasted hands he answered kiss me again and let me see your eyes i forgive what you have done to me i love my yours how can i 
 they were faces hid against each other and washed by each tears at least i suppose the weeping was on both sides as it seemed heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this 
 i grew very uncomfortable meanwhile for the afternoon wore fast away the man whom i had sent off returned from his errand and i could distinguish by the shine of the westering sun up the valley a concourse thickening outside gimmerton chapel porch 
 service is over i announced my master will be here in half an hour 
 heathcliff groaned a curse and strained catherine closer she never moved 
 ere long i perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards the kitchen wing mr linton was not far behind he opened the gate himself and sauntered slowly up probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as summer 
 now he is here i exclaimed for sake hurry down not meet anyone on the front stairs do be quick and stay among the trees till he is fairly in 
 i must go cathy said heathcliff seeking to extricate himself from his arms but if i live see you again before you are asleep i stray five yards from your window 
 you must not go she answered holding him as firmly as her strength allowed you shall not i tell you 
 for one hour he pleaded earnestly 
 not for one minute she replied 
 i will be up immediately persisted the alarmed intruder 
 he would have risen and unfixed her fingers by the clung fast gasping there was mad resolution in her face 
 no she shrieked oh go it is the last time edgar will not hurt us heathcliff i shall die i shall die 
 damn the fool there he is cried heathcliff sinking back into his seat hush my darling hush hush catherine stay if he shot me so expire with a blessing on my lips 
 and there they were fast again i heard my master mounting the cold sweat ran from my forehead i was horrified 
 are you going to listen to her ravings i said passionately she does not know what she says will you ruin her because she has not wit to help herself get up you could be free instantly that is the most diabolical deed that ever you did we are all done mistress and servant 
 i wrung my hands and cried out mr linton hastened his step at the noise in the midst of my agitation i was sincerely glad to observe that arms had fallen relaxed and her head hung down 
 fainted or dead i thought so much the better far better that she should be dead than lingering a burden and a to all about her 
 edgar sprang to his unbidden guest blanched with astonishment and rage what he meant to do i cannot tell however the other stopped all demonstrations at once by placing the lifeless looking form in his arms 
 look there he said unless you be a fiend help her you shall speak to me 
 he walked into the parlour and sat down mr linton summoned me and with great difficulty and after resorting to many means we managed to restore her to sensation but she was all bewildered she sighed and moaned and knew nobody edgar in his anxiety for her forgot her hated friend i did not i went at the earliest opportunity and besought him to depart affirming that catherine was better and he should hear from me in the morning how she passed the night 
 i shall not refuse to go out of doors he answered but i shall stay in the garden and nelly mind you keep your word to morrow i shall be under those larch trees mind or i pay another visit whether linton be in or not 
 he sent a rapid glance through the door of the chamber and ascertaining that what i stated was apparently true delivered the house of his luckless presence

 chapter fifteen 
 
 november is the most disagreeable month in the whole year said margaret standing at the window one dull afternoon looking out at the frostbitten garden 
 the reason i was born in it observed jo pensively quite unconscious of the blot on her nose 
 if something very pleasant should happen now we should think it a delightful month said beth who took a hopeful view of everything even november 
 i dare say but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this family said meg who was out of sorts we go grubbing along day after day without a bit of change and very little fun we might as well be in a treadmill 
 my patience how blue we are cried jo i much wonder poor dear for you see other girls having splendid times while you grind grind year in and year out oh i wish i could manage things for you as i do for my heroines pretty enough and good enough already so have some rich relation leave you a fortune unexpectedly then dash out as an heiress scorn everyone who has slighted you go abroad and come home my lady something in a blaze of splendor and elegance 
 people have fortunes left them in that style nowadays men have to work and women marry for money a dreadfully unjust world said meg bitterly 
 jo and i are going to make fortunes for you all just wait ten years and see if we said amy who sat in a corner making mud pies as hannah called her little clay models of birds fruit and faces 
 wait and afraid i much faith in ink and dirt though grateful for your good intentions 
 meg sighed and turned to the frostbitten garden again jo groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude but amy spatted away energetically and beth who sat at the other window said smiling two pleasant things are going to happen right away marmee is coming down the street and laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell 
 in they both came mrs march with her usual question any letter from father girls and laurie to say in his persuasive way some of you come for a drive been working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle and going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn a dull day but the air bad and going to take brooke home so it will be gay inside if it out come jo you and beth will go you 
 of course we will 
 much obliged but busy and meg whisked out her workbasket for she had agreed with her mother that it was best for her at least not to drive too often with the young gentleman 
 we three will be ready in a minute cried amy running away to wash her hands 
 can i do anything for you madam mother asked laurie leaning over mrs chair with the affectionate look and tone he always gave her 
 no thank you except call at the office if be so kind dear our day for a letter and the postman been father is as regular as the sun but some delay on the way perhaps 
 a sharp ring interrupted her and a minute after hannah came in with a letter 
 one of them horrid telegraph things mum she said handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage 
 at the word telegraph mrs march snatched it read the two lines it contained and dropped back into her chair as white as if the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart laurie dashed downstairs for water while meg and hannah supported her and jo read aloud in a frightened voice 
 
 
 mrs march 
 your husband is very ill come at once 
 
 s hale 
 blank hospital washington 
 
 how still the room was as they listened breathlessly how strangely the day darkened outside and how suddenly the whole world seemed to change as the girls gathered about their mother feeling as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be taken from them 
 mrs march was herself again directly read the message over and stretched out her arms to her daughters saying in a tone they never forgot i shall go at once but it may be too late oh children children help me to bear it 
 for several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing in the room mingled with broken words of comfort tender assurances of help and hopeful whispers that died away in tears poor hannah was the first to recover and with unconscious wisdom she set all the rest a good example for with her work was panacea for most afflictions 
 the lord keep the dear man i waste no time but git your things ready right away mum she said heartily as she wiped her face on her apron gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her own hard one and went away to work like three women in one 
 right no time for tears now be calm girls and let me think 
 they tried to be calm poor things as their mother sat up looking pale but steady and put away her grief to think and plan for them 
 laurie she asked presently when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done 
 here oh let me do something cried the boy hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see 
 send a telegram saying i will come at once the next train goes early in the morning take that 
 what else the horses are ready i can go anywhere do anything he said looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth 
 leave a note at aunt jo give me that pen and paper 
 tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages jo drew the table before her mother well knowing that money for the long sad journey must be borrowed and feeling as if she could do anything to add to a little to the sum for her father 
 now go dear but kill yourself driving at a desperate pace there is no need of that 
 mrs warning was evidently thrown away for five minutes later laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse riding as if for his life 
 jo run to the rooms and tell mrs king that i come on the way get these things put them down be needed and i must go prepared for nursing hospital stores are not always good beth go and ask mr laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine not too proud to beg for father he shall have the best of everything amy tell hannah to get down the black trunk and meg come and help me find my things for half bewildered 
 writing thinking and directing all at once might well bewilder the poor lady and meg begged her to sit quietly in her room for a little while and let them work everyone scattered like leaves before a gust of wind and the quiet happy household was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell 
 mr laurence came hurrying back with beth bringing every comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid and friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the absence which comforted her very much there was nothing he offer from his own dressing gown to himself as escort but the last was impossible mrs march would not hear of the old undertaking the long journey yet an expression of relief was visible when he spoke of it for anxiety ill fits one for traveling he saw the look knit his heavy eyebrows rubbed his hands and marched abruptly away saying be back directly no one had time to think of him again till as meg ran through the entry with a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other she came suddenly upon mr brooke 
 very sorry to hear of this miss march he said in the kind quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed spirit i came to offer myself as escort to your mother mr laurence has commissions for me in washington and it will give me real satisfaction to be of service to her there 
 down dropped the rubbers and the tea was very near following as meg put out her hand with a face so full of gratitude that mr brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take 
 how kind you all are mother will accept sure and it will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her thank you very very much 
 meg spoke earnestly and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea and lead the way into the parlor saying she would call her mother 
 everything was arranged by the time laurie returned with a note from aunt march enclosing the desired sum and a few lines repeating what she had often said before that she had always told them it was absurd for march to go into the army always predicted that no good would come of it and she hoped they would take her advice the next time mrs march put the note in the fire the money in her purse and went on with her preparations with her lips folded tightly in a way which jo would have understood if she had been there 
 the short afternoon wore away all other errands were done and meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework while beth and amy goth tea and hannah finished her ironing with what she called a slap and a bang but still jo did not come they began to get anxious and laurie went off to find her for no one knew what freak jo might take into her head he missed her however and she came walking in with a very queer expression of countenance for there was a mixture of fun and fear satisfaction and regret in it which puzzled the family as much as did the roll of bills she laid before her mother saying with a little choke in her voice my contribution toward making father comfortable and bringing him home 
 my dear where did you get it dollars jo i hope you done anything rash 
 no mine honestly i beg borrow or steal it i earned it and i think blame me for i only sold what was my own 
 as she spoke jo took off her bonnet and a general outcry arose for all her abundant hair was cut short 
 your hair your beautiful hair oh jo how could you your one beauty my dear girl there was no need of this she look like my jo any more but i love her dearly for it 
 as everyone exclaimed and beth hugged the cropped head tenderly jo assumed an indifferent air which did not deceive anyone a particle and said rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it it affect the fate of the nation so wail beth it will be good for my vanity i getting too proud of my wig it will do my brains good to have that mop taken off my head feels deliciously light and cool and the barber said i could soon have a curly crop which will be boyish becoming and easy to keep in order satisfied so please take the money and have supper 
 tell me all about it jo i am not quite satisfied but i blame you for i know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity as you call it to your love but my dear it was not necessary and afraid you will regret it one of these days said mrs march 
 no i returned jo stoutly feeling much relieved that her prank was not entirely condemned 
 what made you do it asked amy who would as soon have thought of cutting off her head as her pretty hair 
 well i was wild to to something for father replied jo as they gathered about the table for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble i hate to borrow as much as mother does and i knew aunt march would croak she always does if you ask for a ninepence meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent and i only got some clothes with mine so i felt wicked and was bound to have some money if i sold the nose off my face to get it 
 you feel wicked my child you had no winter things and got the simplest with your own hard earnings said mrs march with a look that warmed heart 
 i the least idea of selling my hair at first but as i went along i kept thinking what i could do and feeling as if like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself in a window i saw tails of hair with the prices marked and one black tail not so thick as mine was forty dollars it came to me all of a sudden that i had one thing to make money out of and without stopping to think i walked in asked if they bought hair and what they would give for mine 
 i see how you dared to do it said beth in a tone of awe 
 oh he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil his hair he rather stared at first as if he used to having girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair he said he care about mine it the fashionable color and he never paid much for it in the first place the work he put it into it made it dear and so on it was getting late and i was afraid if it done right away that i have it done at all and you know when i start to do a thing i hate to give it up so i begged him to take it and told him why i was in such a hurry it was silly i dare say but it changed his mind for i got rather excited and told the story in my way and his wife heard and said so kindly take it thomas and oblige the young lady do as much for our jimmy any day if i had a spire of hair worth selling 
 who was jimmy asked amy who liked to have things explained as they went along 
 her son she said who was in the army how friendly such things make strangers feel they she talked away all the time the man clipped and diverted my mind nicely 
 you feel dreadfully when the first cut came asked meg with a shiver 
 i took a last look at my hair while the man got his things and that was the end of it i never snivel over trifles like that i will confess though i felt queer when i saw the dear old hair laid out on the table and felt only the short rough ends of my head it almost seemed as if an arm or leg off the woman saw me look at it and picked out a long lock for me to keep give it to you marmee just to remember past glories by for a crop is so comfortable i think i shall ever have a mane again 
 mrs march folded the wavy chestnut lock and laid it away with a short gray one in her desk she only said thank you deary but something in her face made the girls change the subject and talk as cheerfully as they could about mr kindness the prospect of a fine day tomorrow and the happy times they would have when father came home to be nursed 
 no one wanted to go to bed when at ten mrs march put by the last finished job and said come girls beth went to the piano and played the favorite hymn all began bravely but broke down one by one till beth was left alone singing with all her heart for to her music was always a sweet consoler 
 go to bed and talk for we must be up early and shall need all the sleep we can get good night my darlings said mrs march as the hymn ended for no one cared to try another 
 they kissed her quietly and went to bed as silently as if the dear invalid lay in the next room beth and amy soon fell asleep in spite of the great trouble but meg lay awake thinking the most serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life jo lay motionless and her sister fancied that she was asleep till a stifled sob made her exclaim as she touched a wet cheek 
 jo dear what is it are you crying about father 
 no not now 
 what then 
 hair burst out poor jo trying vainly to smother her emotion in the pillow 
 it did not seem at all comical to meg who kissed and caressed the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner 
 not sorry protested jo with a choke do it again tomorrow if i could only the vain part of me that goes and cries in this silly way tell anyone all over now i thought you were asleep so i just made a little private moan for my one beauty how came you to be awake 
 i sleep so anxious said meg 
 think about something pleasant and soon drop off 
 i tried it but felt wider awake than ever 
 what did you think of 
 handsome particularly answered meg smiling to herself in the dark 
 what color do you like best 
 brown that is sometimes blue are lovely 
 jo laughed and meg sharply ordered her not to talk then amiably promised to make her hair curl and fell asleep to dream of living in her castle in the air 
 the clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed smoothing a coverlet here settling a pillow there and pausing to look long and tenderly at eachunconscious face to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed and to pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter as she lifted the curtain to look out into the dreary night the moon broke suddenly from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright benignant face which seemed to whisper in the silence be comforted dear soul there is always light behind the clouds

lionfish nov chapter fifteen aragogcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses but with no hagrid visible from the castle windows striding the grounds with fang at his heels the scene look right to harry no better in fact than the inside of the castle where things were so horribly wrong 
 
 harry and ron had tried to visit hermione but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing 
 
 taking no more chances madam pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door no sorry every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off 
 
 with dumbledore gone fear had spread as never before so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows there was barely a face to be seen in the school that look worried and tense and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled 
 
 harry constantly repeated final words to himself i will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it but what good were these words who exactly were they supposed to ask for help when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were 
 
 hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was there seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow harry looked everywhere he went helped rather reluctantly by ron they were hampered of course by the fact that they allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other gryffindors most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers but harry found it very irksome 
 
 one person however seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion draco malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed head boy harry realize what he was so pleased about until the potions lesson about two weeks after dumbledore and hagrid had left when sitting right behind malfoy harry overheard him gloating to crabbe and goyle 
 
 i always thought father might be the one who got rid of dumbledore he said not troubling to keep his voice down i told you he thinks the worst headmaster the ever had maybe get a decent headmaster now someone who want the chamber of secrets closed mcgonagall last long only filling in 
 
 snape swept past harry making no comment about empty seat and cauldron 
 
 sir said malfoy loudly sir why you apply for the job 
 
 now now malfoy said snape though he suppress a smile professor dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors i daresay be back with us soon enough 
 
 yeah right said malfoy smirking i expect have vote sir if you wanted to apply for the job tell father the best teacher here sir 
 
 snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon fortunately not spotting seamus finnigan who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron 
 
 quite surprised the mudbloods all packed their bags by now malfoy went on bet you five galleons the next one dies pity it granger 
 
 the bell rang at that moment which was lucky at last words ron had leapt off his stool and in the scramble to collect bags and books his attempts to reach malfoy went unnoticed 
 
 let me at him ron growled as harry and dean hung onto his arms i care i need my wand going to kill him with my bare hands 
 
 hurry up got to take you all to herbology barked snape over the heads and off they marched with harry ron and dean bringing up the rear ron still trying to get loose it was only safe to let go of him when snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses 
 
 the herbology class was very subdued there were now two missing from their number justin and hermione 
 
 professor sprout set them all to work pruning the abyssinian shrivelfigs harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself with ernie macmillan ernie took a deep breath and said very formally i just want to say harry that sorry i ever suspected you i know never attack hermione granger and i apologize for all the stuff i said all in the same boat now and well 
 
 he held out a pudgy hand and harry shook it 
 
 ernie and his friend hannah came to work at the same shrivelfig as harry and ron 
 
 that draco malfoy character said ernie breaking off dead twigs he seems very pleased about all this he know i think he might be heir 
 
 clever of you said ron who seem to have forgiven ernie as readily as harry 
 
 do you think malfoy harry ernie asked 
 
 no said harry so firmly that ernie and hannah stared 
 
 a second later harry spotted something 
 
 several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting harry hit ron over the hand with his pruning shears 
 
 ouch you 
 
 harry pointed out the spiders following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun 
 
 oh yeah said ron trying and failing to look pleased but we follow them now 
 
 ernie and hannah were listening curiously 
 
 eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders if they pursued their fixed course there could be no doubt about where they would end up 
 
 looks like heading for the forbidden forest 
 
 and ron looked even unhappier about that 
 
 at the end of the lesson professor sprout escorted the class to their defense against the dark arts lesson harry and ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot 
 
 have to use the invisibility cloak again harry told ron we can take fang with us used to going into the forest with hagrid he might be some help 
 
 right said ron who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers er there there supposed to be werewolves in the forest he added as they took their usual places at the back of classroom 
 
 preferring not to answer that question harry said there are good things in there too the centaurs are all right and the unicorns 
 
 ron had never been into the forbidden forest before harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again 
 
 lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual but lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant 
 
 come now he cried beaming around him why all these long faces 
 
 people swapped exasperated looks but nobody answered 
 
 you people realize said lockhart speaking slowly as though they were all a bit dim the danger has passed the culprit has been taken away 
 
 says who said dean thomas loudly 
 
 my dear young man the minister of magic have taken hagrid if he been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty said lockhart in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two 
 
 oh yes he would said ron even more loudly than dean 
 
 i flatter myself i know a touch more about arrest than you do mr weasley said lockhart in a tone 
 
 ron started to say that he think so somehow but stopped in midsentence when harry kicked him hard under the desk 
 
 we there remember harry muttered 
 
 but disgusting cheeriness his hints that he had always thought hagrid was no good his confidence that the whole business was now at an end irritated harry so much that he yearned to throw gadding with ghouls right in stupid face instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to ron do it tonight 
 
 ron read the message swallowed hard and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by hermione the sight seemed to stiffen his resolve and he nodded 
 
 the gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days because from six onward the gryffindors had nowhere else to go they also had plenty to talk about with the result that the common room often empty until past midnight 
 
 harry went to get the invisibility cloak out of his trunk right after dinner and spent the evening sitting on it waiting for the room to clear fred and george challenged harry and ron to a few games of exploding snap and ginny sat watching them very subdued in usual chair harry and ron kept losing on purpose trying to finish the games quickly but even so it was well past midnight when fred george and ginny finally went to bed 
 
 harry and ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak throwing it over themselves and climbing through the portrait hole 
 
 it was another difficult journey through the castle dodging all the teachers at last they reached the entrance hall slid back the lock on the oak front doors squeezed between them trying to stop any creaking and stepped out into the moonlit grounds 
 
 course said ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass we might get to the forest and find nothing to follow those spiders might been going there at all i know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction but 
 
 his voice trailed away hopefully 
 
 they reached house sad and with its blank windows when harry pushed the door open fang went mad with joy at the sight of them worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep booming barks they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece which glued his teeth together 
 
 harry left the invisibility cloak on table there would be no need for it in the forest 
 
 fang going for a walk said harry patting his leg and fang bounded happily out of the house behind them dashed to the edge of the forest and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree 
 
 harry took out his wand murmured lumos and a tiny light appeared at the end of it just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders 
 
 good thinking said ron light mine too but you know probably blow up or something 
 
 harry tapped ron on the shoulder pointing at the grass two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees 
 
 okay ron sighed as though resigned to the worst ready go 
 
 so with fang scampering around them sniffing tree roots and leaves they entered the forest by the glow of wand they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path they walked behind them for about twenty minutes not speaking listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves then when the trees had become thicker than ever so that the stars overhead were no longer visible and wand shone alone in the sea of dark they saw their spider guides leaving the path 
 
 harry paused trying to see where the spiders were going but everything outside his little sphere of light was he had never been this deep into the forest before he could vividly remember hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time been in here but hagrid was miles away now probably sitting in a cell in azkaban and he had also said to follow the spiders 
 
 something wet touched hand and he jumped backward crushing foot but it was only nose 
 
 what reckon harry said to ron whose eyes he could just make out reflecting the light from his wand 
 
 come this far said ron 
 
 so they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees they move very quickly now there were tree roots and stumps in their way barely visible in the near blackness harry could feel hot breath on his hand more than once they had to stop so that harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight 
 
 they walked for what seemed like at least half an hour their robes snagging on branches and brambles after a while they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward though the trees were as thick as ever 
 
 then fang suddenly let loose a great echoing bark making both harry and ron jump out of their skins 
 
 what said ron loudly looking around into the and gripping elbow very hard 
 
 something moving over there harry breathed listen sounds like something big 
 
 they listened some distance to their right the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees 
 
 oh no said ron oh no oh no oh 
 
 shut up said harry frantically hear you 
 
 hear me said ron in an unnaturally high voice already heard fang 
 
 the darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood terrified waiting there was a strange rumbling noise and then silence 
 
 what think doing said harry 
 
 probably getting ready to pounce said ron 
 
 they waited shivering hardly daring to move 
 
 think gone harry whispered 
 
 dunno 
 
 then to their right came a sudden blaze of light so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes fang yelped and tried to run but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder 
 
 harry ron shouted his voice breaking with relief harry our car 
 
 what 
 
 come on 
 
 harry blundered after ron toward the light stumbling and tripping and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing 
 
 mr car was standing empty in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches its headlights ablaze as ron walked toward it it moved slowly toward him exactly like a large turquoise dog greeting its owner 
 
 been here all the time said ron delightedly walking around the car look at it the turned it wild 
 
 the sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own fang seem at all keen on it he kept close to harry who could feel him quivering his breathing slowing down again harry stuffed his wand back into his robes 
 
 and we thought it was going to attack us said ron leaning against the car and patting it i wondered where it had gone 
 
 harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights 
 
 lost the trail he said go and find them 
 
 ron speak he move his eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor right behind harry his face was livid with terror 
 
 harry even have time to turn around there was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground so that he was hanging facedown struggling terrified he heard more clicking and saw legs leave the ground too heard fang whimpering and howling next moment he was being swept away into the dark trees 
 
 head hanging harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long hairy legs the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers behind him he could hear another of the creatures no doubt carrying ron they were moving into the very heart of the forest harry could hear fang fighting to free himself from a third monster whining loudly but harry have yelled even if he had wanted to he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing 
 
 he never knew how long he was in the clutches he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the ground was now swarming with spiders craning his neck sideways he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow a hollow that had been cleared of trees so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on 
 
 spiders not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below spiders the size of carthorses black hairy gigantic the massive specimen that was carrying harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty domed web in the very center of the hollow while its fellows closed in all around it clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load 
 
 harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him ron and fang thudded down next to him fang howling anymore but cowering silently on the spot ron looked exactly like harry felt his mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping 
 
 harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something it had been hard to tell because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke 
 
 aragog it called aragog 
 
 and from the middle of the misty domed web a spider the size of a small elephant emerged very slowly there was gray in the black of his body and legs and each of the eyes on his ugly pincered head was milky white he was blind 
 
 what is it he said clicking his pincers rapidly 
 
 men clicked the spider who had caught harry 
 
 is it hagrid said aragog moving closer his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely 
 
 strangers clicked the spider who had brought ron 
 
 kill them clicked aragog fretfully i was sleeping 
 
 friends of harry shouted his heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat 
 
 click click click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow 
 
 aragog paused 
 
 hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he said slowly 
 
 in trouble said harry breathing very fast why come 
 
 in trouble said the aged spider and harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers but why has he sent you 
 
 harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it he think his legs would support him so he spoke from the ground as calmly as he could 
 
 they think up at the school that been setting a a something on students taken him to azkaban 
 
 aragog clicked his pincers furiously and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders it was like applause except applause usually make harry feel sick with fear 
 
 but that was years ago said aragog fretfully years and years ago i remember it well why they made him leave the school they believed that i was the monster that dwells in what they call the chamber of secrets they thought that hagrid had opened the chamber and set me free 
 
 and you you come from the chamber of secrets said harry who could feel cold sweat on his forehead 
 
 i said aragog clicking angrily i was not born in the castle i come from a distant land a traveler gave me to hagrid when i was an egg hagrid was only a boy but he cared for me hidden in a cupboard in the castle feeding me on scraps from the table hagrid is my good friend and a good man when i was discovered and blamed for the death of a girl he protected me i have lived here in the forest ever since where hagrid still visits me he even found me a wife mosag and you see how our family has grown all through goodness 
 
 harry summoned what remained of his courage 
 
 so you never never attacked anyone 
 
 never croaked the old spider it would have been my instinct but out of respect for hagrid i never harmed a human the body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom i never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which i grew up our kind like the dark and the quiet 
 
 but then do you know what did kill that girl said harry because whatever it is back and attacking people again 
 
 his words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily large black shapes shifted all around him 
 
 the thing that lives in the castle said aragog is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others well do i remember how i pleaded with hagrid to let me go when i sensed the beast moving about the school 
 
 what is it said harry urgently 
 
 more loud clicking more rustling the spiders seemed to be closing in 
 
 we do not speak of it said aragog fiercely we do not name it i never even told hagrid the name of that dread creature though he asked me many times 
 
 harry want to press the subject not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides aragog seemed to be tired of talking he was backing slowly into his domed web but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward harry and ron 
 
 just go then harry called desperately to aragog hearing leaves rustling behind him 
 
 go said aragog slowly i think not 
 
 but but 
 
 my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid on my command but i cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst friend of hagrid 
 
 harry spun around feet away towering above him was a solid wall of spiders clicking their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads 
 
 even as he reached for his wand harry knew it was no good there were too many of them but as he tried to stand ready to die fighting a loud long note sounded and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow 
 
 mr car was thundering down the slope headlights glaring its horn screeching knocking spiders aside several were thrown onto their backs their endless legs waving in the air the car screeched to a halt in front of harry and ron and the doors flew open 
 
 get fang harry yelled diving into the front seat ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him yelping into the back of the car the doors slammed shut ron touch the accelerator but the car need him the engine roared and they were off hitting more spiders they sped up the slope out of the hollow and they were soon crashing through the forest branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps following a path it obviously knew 
 
 harry looked sideways at ron his mouth was still open in the silent scream but his eyes popping anymore 
 
 are you okay 
 
 ron stared straight ahead unable to speak 
 
 they smashed their way through the undergrowth fang howling loudly in the back seat and harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak after ten noisy rocky minutes the trees thinned and harry could again see patches of sky 
 
 the car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield they had reached the edge of the forest fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out and when harry opened the door he shot off through the trees to house tail between his legs harry got out too and after a minute or so ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed still and staring harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view 
 
 harry went back into cabin to get the invisibility cloak fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket when harry got outside again he found ron being violent sick in the pumpkin patch 
 
 follow the spiders said ron weakly wiping his mouth on his sleeve never forgive hagrid lucky to be alive 
 
 i bet he thought aragog hurt friends of his said harry 
 
 exactly problem said ron thumping the wall of the cabin he always thinks monsters as bad as made out and look where got him a cell in azkaban he was shivering uncontrollably now what was the point of sending us in there what have we found out like to know 
 
 that hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets said harry throwing the cloak over ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk he was innocent 
 
 ron gave a loud snort evidently hatching aragog in a cupboard his idea of being innocent 
 
 as the castle loomed nearer harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden then pushed the creaking front doors ajar they walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking at last they reached the safety of the gryffindor common room where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash they took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory 
 
 ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed harry however feel very sleepy he sat on the edge of his fourposter thinking hard about everything aragog had said 
 
 the creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle he thought sounded like a sort of monster voldemort even other monsters want to name it but he and ron were no closer to finding out what it was or how it petrified its victims even hagrid had never known what was in the chamber of secrets 
 
 harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window 
 
 he see what else they could do they had hit dead ends everywhere riddle had caught the wrong person the heir of slytherin had got off and no one could tell whether it was the same person or a different one who had opened the chamber this time there was nobody else to ask harry lay down still thinking about what aragog had said 
 
 he was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him and he suddenly sat bolt upright 
 
 ron he hissed through the dark ron 
 
 ron woke with a yelp like stared wildly around and saw harry 
 
 ron that girl who died aragog said she was found in a bathroom said harry ignoring snuffling snores from the corner what if she never left the bathroom what if still there 
 
 ron rubbed his eyes frowning through the moonlight and then he understood too 
 
 you think not moaning myrtle 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter fourteen grudgecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 no one in gryffindor tower slept that night they knew that the castle was being searched again and the whole house stayed awake in the common room waiting to hear whether black had been caught professor mcgonagall came back at dawn to tell them that he had again escaped 
 
 throughout the day everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security professor flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of sirius black filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes sir cadogan had been fired his portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor and the fat lady was back she had been expertly restored but was still extremely nervous and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection a bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her they paced the corridor in a menacing group talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs 
 
 harry help noticing that the statue of the witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked it seemed that fred and george had been right in thinking that they and now harry ron and hermione were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it 
 
 reckon we should tell someone harry asked ron 
 
 we know not coming in through said ron dismissively heard if the shop had been broken into 
 
 harry was glad ron took this view if the witch was boarded up too he would never be able to go into hogsmeade again 
 
 ron had become an instant celebrity for the first time in his life people were paying more attention to him than to harry and it was clear that ron was rather enjoying the experience though still severely shaken by the events he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened with a wealth of detail 
 
 i was asleep and i heard this ripping noise and i thought it was in my dream you know but then there was this drafti woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled downi rolled overand i saw him standing over melike a skeleton with loads of filthy hairholding this great long knife been twelve inchesand he looked at me and i looked at him and then i yelled and he scampered 
 
 why though ron added to harry as the group of second year girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed why did he run 
 
 harry had been wondering the same thing why had black having got the wrong bed not silenced ron and proceeded to harry black had proved twelve years ago that he mind murdering innocent people and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys four of whom were asleep 
 
 he known have a job getting back out of the castle once yelled and woken people up said harry thoughtfully had to kill the whole house to get back through the portrait holethen he met the teachers 
 
 neville was in total disgrace professor mcgonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future hogsmeade visits given him a detention and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower poor neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him none of these punishments however came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him two days after she sent neville the very worst thing a hogwarts student could receive over breakfast a howler 
 
 the school owls swooped into the great hall carrying the mail as usual and neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak harry and ron who were sitting opposite him recognized the letter as a howler at once ron had got one from his mother the year before 
 
 run for it neville ron advised 
 
 neville need telling twice he seized the envelope and holding it before him like a bomb sprinted out of the hall while the slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him they heard the howler go off in the entrance hall voice magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family 
 
 harry was too busy feeling sorry for neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist 
 
 ouch oh thanks hedwig 
 
 harry tore open the envelope while hedwig helped herself to some of cornflakes the note inside said 
 
 dear harry and ron 
 how about having tea with me this afternoon round six come collect you from the castle wait for me in the entrance hall not allowed out on your own 
 cheers 
 hagrid 
 he probably wants to hear all about black said ron 
 
 so at six that afternoon harry and ron left gryffindor tower passed the security trolls at a run and headed down to the entrance hall 
 
 hagrid was already waiting for them 
 
 all right hagrid said ron you want to hear about saturday night do you 
 
 already heard all abou it said hagrid opening the front doors and leading them outside 
 
 oh said ron looking slightly put out 
 
 the first thing they saw on entering cabin was buckbeak who was stretched out on top of patchwork quilt his enormous wings folded tight to his body enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight harry saw a gigantic hairy brown suit and a very horrible tie hanging from the top of wardrobe door 
 
 what are they for hagrid said harry 
 
 case against the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures said hagrid this friday him an be goin down ter london together booked two beds on the knight bus 
 
 harry felt a nasty pang of guilt he had completely forgotten that trial was so near and judging by the uneasy look on face he had too they had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare defense the arrival of the firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds 
 
 hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of bath buns but they knew better than to accept they had had too much experience with cooking 
 
 i got somethin ter discuss with you two said hagrid sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious 
 
 what said harry 
 
 hermione said hagrid 
 
 what about her said ron 
 
 in a righ state what bin comin down ter visit me a lot since bin feelin lonely firs yeh weren talking to her because o the firebolt now yer not talkin to her because her cat 
 
 c ate scabbers ron interjected angrily 
 
 because her cat acted like all cats do hagrid continued doggedly cried a fair few times yeh know goin through a rough time at the moment bitten off she can chew if yeh ask me all the work tryin ter do still found time ter help me with case found some really good stuff fer mereckon stand a good chance now 
 
 hagrid we helped as well sorry harry began awkwardly 
 
 not blamin yeh said hagrid waving apology aside gawd knows had enough ter be getting on with seen yeh practicin quidditch hour o the day an night but i gotta tell yeh i thought you value yer friend broomsticks or rats all 
 
 harry and ron exchanged uncomfortable looks 
 
 really upset she was when black nearly stabbed yeh ron got her heart in the right place hermione has an you two not talkin to her 
 
 if just get rid of that cat speak to her again ron said angrily but still sticking up for it a maniac and she hear a word against it 
 
 ah well people can be a bit stupid abou their pets said hagrid wisely behind him buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto pillow 
 
 they spent the rest of their visit discussing improved chances for the quidditch cup at nine hagrid walked them back up to the castle 
 
 a large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room 
 
 hogsmeade next weekend said ron craning over the heads to read the new notice what reckon he added quietly to harry as they went to sit down 
 
 well filch done anything about the passage into honeydukes harry said even more quietly 
 
 harry said a voice in his right ear harry started and looked around at hermione who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her 
 
 harry if you go into hogsmeade tell professor mcgonagall about that map said hermione 
 
 can you hear someone talking harry growled ron not looking at hermione 
 
 ron how can you let him go with you after what sirius black nearly did to you i mean it tell 
 
 so now trying to get harry expelled said ron furiously you done enough damage this year 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to respond but with a soft hiss crookshanks leapt onto her lap hermione took one frightened look at the expression on face gathered up crookshanks and hurried away toward the girls dormitories 
 
 so how about it ron said to harry as though there had been no interruption come on last time we went you see anything you even been inside yet 
 
 harry looked around to check that hermione was well out of earshot 
 
 okay he said but taking the invisibility cloak this time 
 
 
 
 on saturday morning harry packed his invisibility cloak in his bag slipped the map into his pocket and went down to breakfast with everyone else hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors 
 
 bye harry called to ron see you when you get back 
 
 ron grinned and winked 
 
 harry hurried up to the third floor slipping the map out of his pocket as he went crouching behind the witch he smoothed it out a tiny dot was moving in his direction harry squinted at it the minuscule writing next to it read neville longbottom 
 
 harry quickly pulled out his wand muttered dissendium and shoved his bag into the statue but before he could climb in himself neville came around the corner 
 
 harry i forgot you going to hogsmeade either 
 
 hi neville said harry moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket what are you up to 
 
 nothing shrugged neville want a game of exploding snap 
 
 er not now i was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for lupin 
 
 come with you said neville brightly i done it either 
 
 er hang on yeah i forgot i finished it last night 
 
 great you can help me said neville his round face anxious i understand that thing about the garlic at all do they have to eat it or 
 
 he broke off with a small gasp looking over shoulder 
 
 it was snape neville took a quick step behind harry 
 
 and what are you two doing here said snape coming to a halt and looking from one to the other an odd place to meet 
 
 to immense disquiet black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them and then to the witch 
 
 not meeting here said harry we just met here 
 
 indeed said snape you have a habit of turning up in unexpected places potter and you are very rarely there for no good reasoni suggest the pair of you return to gryffindor tower where you belong 
 
 harry and neville set off without another word as they turned the corner harry looked back snape was running one of his hands over the head examining it closely 
 
 harry managed to shake neville off at the fat lady by telling him the password then pretending left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back once out of sight of the security trolls he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose 
 
 the third floor corridor seemed to be deserted harry scanned the map carefully and saw with a leap of relief that the tiny dot labeled severus snape was now back in its office 
 
 he sprinted back to the witch opened her hump heaved himself inside and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute he wiped the map blank again then set off at a run 
 
 
 
 harry completely hidden beneath the invisibility cloak emerged into the sunlight outside honeydukes and prodded ron in the back 
 
 me he muttered 
 
 what kept you ron hissed 
 
 snape was hanging around 
 
 they set off up the high street 
 
 where are you ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth are you still there this feels weird 
 
 they went to the post office ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to bill in egypt so that harry could have a good look around the owls sat hooting softly down at him at least three hundred of them from great grays right down to tiny little scops owls local deliveries only which were so small they could have sat in the palm of hand 
 
 then they visited which was so packed with students harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic there were jokes and tricks to fulfill even and wildest dreams harry gave ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak they left with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering but their pockets bulging with dungbombs hiccup sweets frog spawn soap and a teacup apiece 
 
 the day was fine and breezy and neither of them felt like staying indoors so they walked past the three broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the shrieking shack the most haunted dwelling in britain it stood a little way above the rest of the village and even in daylight was slightly creepy with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden 
 
 even the hogwarts ghosts avoid it said ron as they leaned on the fence looking up at it i asked nearly headless nickhe says heard a very rough crowd lives here no one can get in fred and george tried obviously but all the entrances are sealed shut 
 
 harry feeling hot from their climb was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill moments later malfoy had appeared followed closely by crabbe and goyle malfoy was speaking 
 
 should have an owl from father any time now he had to go to the hearing to tell them about my armabout how i use it for three months 
 
 crabbe and goyle sniggered 
 
 i really wish i could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend no arm in im onest that as good as dead 
 
 malfoy suddenly caught sight of ron his pale face split in a malevolent grin 
 
 what are you doing weasley 
 
 malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind ron 
 
 suppose love to live here you weasley dreaming about having your own bedroom i heard your family all sleep in one room is that true 
 
 harry seized the back of robes to stop him from leaping on malfoy 
 
 leave him to me he hissed in ear 
 
 the opportunity was too perfect to miss harry crept silently around behind malfoy crabbe and goyle bent down and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path 
 
 we were just discussing your friend hagrid malfoy said to ron just trying to imagine what saying to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures think cry when they cut off his 
 
 splat 
 
 head jerked forward as the mud hit him his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in muck 
 
 what the 
 
 ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing he was laughing so hard malfoy crabbe and goyle spun stupidly on the spot staring wildly around malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean 
 
 what was that who did that 
 
 very haunted up here it said ron with the air of one commenting on the weather 
 
 crabbe and goyle were looking scared their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape 
 
 harry sneaked along the path where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some green sludge 
 
 splatter 
 
 crabbe and goyle caught some this time goyle hopped furiously on the spot trying to rub it out of his small dull eyes 
 
 it came from over there said malfoy wiping his face and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of harry 
 
 crabbe blundered forward his long arms outstretched like a zombie harry dodged around him picked up a stick and lobbed it at back harry doubled up with silent laughter as crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair trying to see who had thrown it as ron was the only person crabbe could see it was ron he started toward but harry stuck out his leg crabbe stumbled and his huge flat foot caught the hem of cloak harry felt a great tug then the cloak slid off his face 
 
 for a split second malfoy stared at him 
 
 aaargh he yelled pointing at head then he turned tail and ran at breakneck speed back down the hill crabbe and goyle behind him 
 
 harry tugged the cloak up again but the damage was done 
 
 harry ron said stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where harry had disappeared better run for it if malfoy tells anyone better get back to the castle quick 
 
 see you later said harry and without another word he tore back down the path toward hogsmeade 
 
 would malfoy believe what he had seen would anyone believe malfoy nobody knew about the invisibility cloak nobody except dumbledore stomach turned over dumbledore would know exactly what had happened if malfoy said anything 
 
 back into honeydukes back down the cellar steps across the stone floor through the trapdoor harry pulled off the cloak tucked it under his arm and ran flat out along the passagemalfoy would get back first how long would it take him to find a teacher panting a sharp pain in his side harry slow down until he reached the stone slide he would have to leave the cloak where it was it was too much of a giveaway in case malfoy had tipped off a teacher he hid it in a shadowy corner then started to climb fast as he could his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute he reached the inside of the hump tapped it with his wand stuck his head through and hoisted himself out the hump closed and just as harry jumped out from behind the statue he heard quick footsteps approaching 
 
 it was snape he approached harry at a swift walk his black robes swishing then stopped in front of him 
 
 so he said 
 
 there was a look of suppressed triumph about him harry tried to look innocent all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands which he quickly hid in his pockets 
 
 come with me potter said snape 
 
 harry followed him downstairs trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without snape noticing they walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into office 
 
 harry had been in here only once before and he had been in very serious trouble then too snape had acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time all standing on shelves behind his desk glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere 
 
 sit said snape 
 
 harry sat snape however remained standing 
 
 mr malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story potter said snape 
 
 harry say anything 
 
 he tells me that he was up by the shrieking shack when he ran into weasley apparently alone 
 
 still harry speak 
 
 mr malfoy states that he was standing talking to weasley when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head how do you think that could have happened 
 
 harry tried to look mildly surprised 
 
 i know professor 
 
 eyes were boring into it was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff harry tried hard not to blink 
 
 mr malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition can you imagine what it might have been potter 
 
 no said harry now trying to sound innocently curious 
 
 it was your head potter floating in midair 
 
 there was a long silence 
 
 maybe better go to madam pomfrey said harry if seeing things like 
 
 what would your head have been doing in hogsmeade potter said snape softly your head is not allowed in hogsmeade no part of your body has permission to be in hogsmeade 
 
 i know that said harry striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear it sounds like having hallucin 
 
 malfoy is not having hallucinations snarled snape and he bent down a hand on each arm of chair so that their faces were a foot apart if your head was in hogsmeade so was the rest of you 
 
 been up in gryffindor tower said harry like you told 
 
 can anyone confirm that 
 
 harry say anything thin mouth curled into a horrible smile 
 
 so he said straightening up again everyone from the minister of magic downward has been trying to keep famous harry potter safe from sirius black but famous harry potter is a law unto himself let the ordinary people worry about his safety famous harry potter goes where he wants to with no thought for the consequences 
 
 harry stayed silent snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth he going to do it snape had no proof yet 
 
 how extraordinarily like your father you are potter snape said suddenly his eyes glinting he too was exceedingly arrogant a small amount of talent on the quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too strutting around the place with his friends and admirersthe resemblance between you is uncanny 
 
 my dad strut said harry before he could stop himself and neither do i 
 
 your father set much store by rules either snape went on pressing his advantage his thin face full of malice rules were for lesser mortals not quidditch his head was so swollen 
 
 shut up 
 
 harry was suddenly on his feet rage such as he had not felt since his last night in privet drive was coursing through him he care that face had gone rigid the black eyes flashing dangerously 
 
 what did you say to me potter 
 
 i told you to shut up about my dad harry yelled i know the truth all right he saved your life dumbledore told me you even be here if it for my dad 
 
 sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk 
 
 and did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life he whispered or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious delicate ears 
 
 harry bit his lip he know what had happened and want to admit it but snape seemed to have guessed the truth 
 
 i would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father potter he said a terrible grin twisting his face have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism then let me correct you your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father got cold feet at the last moment there was nothing brave about what he did he was saving his own skin as much as mine had their joke succeeded he would have been expelled from hogwarts 
 
 uneven yellowish teeth were bared 
 
 turn out your pockets potter he spat suddenly 
 
 harry move there was a pounding in his ears 
 
 turn out your pockets or we go straight to the headmaster pull them out potter 
 
 cold with dread harry slowly pulled out the bag of tricks and the map 
 
 snap picked up the bag 
 
 ron gave them to me said harry praying get a chance to tip ron off before snape saw him he brought them back from hogsmeade last time 
 
 indeed and been carrying them around ever since how very touchingand what is this 
 
 snape had picked up the map harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive 
 
 spare bit of parchment he said with a shrug 
 
 snape turned it over his eyes on harry 
 
 surely you need such a very old piece of parchment he said why i just throw this away 
 
 his hand moved toward the fire 
 
 no harry said quickly 
 
 so said snape his long nostrils quivering is this another treasured gift from mr weasley or is it something else a letter perhaps written in invisible ink or instructions to get into hogsmeade without passing the dementors 
 
 harry blinked eyes gleamed 
 
 let me see let me see he muttered taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk reveal your secret he said touching the wand to the parchment 
 
 nothing happened harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking 
 
 show yourself snape said tapping the map sharply 
 
 it stayed blank harry was taking deep calming breaths 
 
 professor severus snape master of this school commands you to yield the information you conceal snape said hitting the map with his wand 
 
 as though an invisible hand were writing upon it words appeared on the smooth surface of the map 
 
 mooney presents his compliments to professor snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other business 
 
 snape froze harry stared dumbstruck at the message but the map stop there more writing was appearing beneath the first 
 
 mr prongs agrees with mr mooney and would like to add that professor snape is an ugly git 
 
 it would have been very funny if the situation been so serious and there was more 
 
 mr padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor 
 
 harry closed his eyes in horror when opened them the map had had its last word 
 
 mr wormtail bids professor snape good day and advises him to wash his hair the slimeball 
 
 harry waited for the blow to fall 
 
 so said snape softly see about this 
 
 he strode across to his fire seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace and threw it into the flames 
 
 lupin snape called into the fire i want a word 
 
 utterly bewildered harry stared at the fire a large shape had appeared in it revolving very fast seconds later professor lupin was clambering out of the fireplace brushing ash off his shabby robes 
 
 you called severus said lupin mildly 
 
 i certainly did said snape his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk i have just asked potter to empty his pockets he was carrying this 
 
 snape pointed at the parchment on which the words of messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs were still shining an odd closed expression appeared on face 
 
 well said snape 
 
 lupin continued to stare at the map harry had the impression that lupin was doing some very quick thinking 
 
 well said snape again this parchment is plainly full of dark magic this is supposed to be your area of expertise lupin where do you imagine potter got such a thing 
 
 lupin looked up and by the merest in direction warned him not to interrupt 
 
 full of dark magic he repeated mildly do you really think so severus it looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it childish but surely not dangerous i imagine harry got it from a joke shop 
 
 indeed said snape his jaw had gone rigid with anger you think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing you think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers 
 
 harry understand what snape was talking about nor apparently did lupin 
 
 you mean by mr wormtail or one of these people he said harry do you know any of these men 
 
 no said harry quickly 
 
 you see severus said lupin turning back to snape it looks like a zonko product to me 
 
 right on cue ron came bursting into the office he was completely out of breath and stopped just short of desk clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak 
 
 i gave harry that stuff he choked bought itin ages ago 
 
 well said lupin clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully that seems to clear that up severus take this back shall i he folded the map and tucked it inside his robes harry ron come with me i need a word about my vampire essay excuse us severus 
 
 harry dare look at snape as they left his office he ron and lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking then harry turned to lupin 
 
 professor i 
 
 i want to hear explanations said lupin shortly he glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice i happen to know that this map was confiscated by mr filch many years ago yes i know a map he said as harry and ron looked amazed i want to know how it fell into your possession i am however astounded that you hand it in particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around and i let you have it back harry 
 
 harry had expected that and was too keen for explanations to protest 
 
 why did snape think got it from the manufacturers 
 
 because lupin hesitated because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school think it extremely entertaining 
 
 do you know them said harry impressed 
 
 met he said shortly he was looking at harry more seriously than ever before 
 
 expect me to cover up for you again harry i cannot make you take sirius black seriously but i would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you your parents gave their lives to keep you alive harry a poor way to repay them gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks 
 
 he walked away leaving harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in office slowly he and ron mounted the marble staircase as harry passed the witch he remembered the invisibility cloak it was still down there but he dare go and get it 
 
 my fault said ron abruptly i persuaded you to go right it was stupid we done it 
 
 he broke off they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing and hermione was walking toward them one look at her face convinced harry that she had heard what had happened his heart plummeted had she told professor mcgonagall 
 
 come to have a good gloat said ron savagely as she stopped in front of them or have you just been to tell on us 
 
 no said hermione she was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling i just thought you ought to knowhagrid lost his case buckbeak is going to be executed 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter fifteen beauxbatons and durmstrangcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 early next morning harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night he got up dressed in the pale dawn light left the dormitory without waking ron and went back down to the deserted common room here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter 
 
 dear sirius 
 i reckon i just imagined my scar hurting i was half asleep when i wrote to you last time no point coming back fine here worry about me my head feels completely normal 
 harry 
 he then climbed out of the portrait hole up through the silent castle held up only briefly by peeves who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the corridor finally arriving at the owlery which was situated at the top of west tower 
 
 the owlery was a circular stone room rather cold and drafty because none of the windows had glass in them the floor was entirely covered in straw owl droppings and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower nearly all of them asleep though here and there a round amber eye glared at harry he spotted hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny and hurried over to her sliding a little on the floor 
 
 it took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him as she kept shuffling around on her perch showing him her tail she was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night in the end it was harry suggesting she might be too tired and that perhaps he would ask ron to borrow pigwidgeon that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it 
 
 just find him all right harry said stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall before the dementors do 
 
 she nipped his finger perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach he had been so sure that reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them 
 
 that was a lie harry said hermione sharply over breakfast when he told her and ron what he had done you imagine your scar hurting and you know it 
 
 so what said harry not going back to azkaban because of me 
 
 drop it said ron sharply to hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more and for once hermione heeded him and fell silent 
 
 harry did his best not to worry about sirius over the next couple of weeks true he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived nor late at night before he went to sleep prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of sirius cornered by dementors down some dark london street but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather he wished he still had quidditch to distract him nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good hard training session on the other hand their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before particularly defense against the dark arts 
 
 to their surprise professor moody had announced that he would be putting the imperius curse on each of them in turn to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects 
 
 but but you said illegal professor said hermione uncertainly as moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room you said to use it against another human was 
 
 dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like said moody his magical eye swiveling onto hermione and fixing her with an eerie unblinking stare if rather learn the hard way when putting it on you so they can control you completely fine by me excused off you go 
 
 he pointed one gnarled finger toward the door hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave harry and ron grinned at each other they knew hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson 
 
 moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the imperius curse upon them harry watched as one by one his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence dean thomas hopped three times around the room singing the national anthem lavender brown imitated a squirrel neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse and each of them recovered only when moody had removed it 
 
 potter moody growled you next 
 
 harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom into the space that moody had cleared of desks moody raised his wand pointed it at harry and said imperio 
 
 it was the most wonderful feeling harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away leaving nothing but a vague untraceable happiness he stood there feeling immensely relaxed only dimly aware of everyone watching him 
 
 and then he heard voice echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain jump onto the deskjump onto the desk 
 
 harry bent his knees obediently preparing to spring 
 
 jump onto the desk 
 
 why though another voice had awoken in the back of his brain 
 
 stupid thing to do really said the voice 
 
 jump onto the desk 
 
 no i think i will thanks said the other voice a little more firmlyno i really want to 
 
 jump now 
 
 the next thing harry felt was considerable pain he had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping the result was that smashed headlong into the desk knocking it over and by the feeling in his legs fractured both his kneecaps 
 
 now more like it growled voice and suddenly harry felt the empty echoing feeling in his head disappear he remembered exactly what was happening and the pain in his knees seemed to double 
 
 look at that you lotpotter fought he fought it and he damn near beat it try that again potter and the rest of you pay attention watch his eyes where you see it very good potter very good indeed have trouble controlling you 
 
 
 
 the way he talks harry muttered as he hobbled out of the defense against the dark arts class an hour later moody had insisted on putting harry through his paces four times in a row until harry could throw off the curse entirely think we were all going to be attacked any second 
 
 yeah i know said ron who was skipping on every alternate step he had had much more difficulty with the curse than harry though moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime talk about paranoid ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that moody was definitely out of earshot and went on no wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the ministry did you hear him telling seamus what he did to that witch who shouted boo behind him on april fools day and when are we supposed to read up on resisting the imperius curse with everything else got to do 
 
 all the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term professor mcgonagall explained why when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of transfiguration homework she had assigned 
 
 you are now entering a most important phase of your magical education she told them her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles your ordinary wizarding levels are drawing closer 
 
 we take till fifth year said dean thomas indignantly 
 
 maybe not thomas but believe me you need all the preparation you can get miss granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion i might remind you that your pincushion thomas still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin 
 
 hermione who had turned rather pink again seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself 
 
 harry and ron were deeply amused when professor trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next divination class she read out large portions of their predictions commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes 
 
 meanwhile professor binns the ghost who taught history of magic had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century professor snape was forcing them to research antidotes they took this one seriously as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before christmas to see if their antidote worked professor flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on summoning charms 
 
 even hagrid was adding to their workload the skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate hagrid was delighted and as part of their project suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior 
 
 i will not said draco malfoy flatly when hagrid had proposed this with the air of father christmas pulling an toy out of his sack i see enough of these foul things during lessons thanks 
 
 smile faded off his face 
 
 do wha yer told he growled or be takin a leaf outta professor hear yeh made a good ferret malfoy 
 
 the gryffindors roared with laughter malfoy flushed with anger but apparently the memory of punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting harry ron and hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits seeing hagrid put down malfoy was particularly satisfying especially because malfoy had done his very best to get hagrid sacked the previous year 
 
 when they arrived in the entrance hall they found themselves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there all milling around a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase ron the tallest of the three stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud to the other two 
 
 triwizard tournament 
 the delegations from beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving at on friday the th of october lessons will end half an hour early 
 brilliant said harry potions last thing on friday snape have time to poison us all 
 
 students will return their bags and books to their dormitories and assemble in front of the castle to greet our guests beforethe welcoming feast 
 only a week away said ernie macmillan of hufflepuff emerging from the crowd his eyes gleaming i wonder if cedric knows think go and tell him 
 
 cedric said ron blankly as ernie hurried off 
 
 diggory said harry he must be entering the tournament 
 
 that idiot hogwarts champion said ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase 
 
 not an idiot you just like him because he beat gryffindor at quidditch said hermione heard a really good student and a prefect 
 
 she spoke as though this settled the matter 
 
 you only like him because handsome said ron scathingly 
 
 excuse me i like people just because handsome said hermione indignantly 
 
 ron gave a loud false cough which sounded oddly like lockhart 
 
 the appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle during the following week there seemed to be only one topic of conversation no matter where harry went the triwizard tournament rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs who was going to try for hogwarts champion what the tournament would involve how the students from beauxbatons and durmstrang differed from themselves 
 
 harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an cleaning several grimy portraits had been scrubbed much to the displeasure of their subjects who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces the suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking and argus filch the caretaker was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of girls into hysterics 
 
 other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too 
 
 longbottom kindly do not reveal that you even perform a simple switching spell in front of anyone from durmstrang professor mcgonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson during which neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus 
 
 when they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of october they found that the great hall had been decorated overnight enormous silk banners hung from the walls each of them representing a hogwarts house red with a gold lion for gryffiindor blue with a bronze eagle for ravenclaw yellow with a black badger for hufflepuff and green with a silver serpent for slytherin behind the teachers table the largest banner of all bore the hogwarts coat of arms lion eagle badger and snake united around a large letter h 
 
 harry ron and hermione sat down beside fred and george at the gryffindor table once again and most unusually they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices ron led the way over to them 
 
 a bummer all right george was saying gloomily to fred but if he talk to us in person have to send him the letter after all or stuff it into his hand he avoid us forrever 
 
 avoiding you said ron sitting down next to them 
 
 wish you would said fred looking irritated at the interruption 
 
 a bummer ron asked george 
 
 having a nosy git like you for a brother said george 
 
 you two got any ideas on the triwizard tournament yet harry asked thought any more about trying to enter 
 
 i asked mcgonagall how the champions are chosen but she telling said george bitterly she just told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my raccoon 
 
 wonder what the tasks are going to be said ron thoughtfully you know i bet we could do them harry done dangerous stuff before 
 
 not in front of a panel of judges you said fred mcgonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well done the tasks 
 
 who are the judges harry asked 
 
 well the heads of the participating schools are always on the panel said hermione and everyone looked around at her rather surprised because all three of them were injured during the tournament of when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage 
 
 she noticed them all looking at her and said with her usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all the books she had all in hogwarts a history though of course that not entirely reliable a revised history of hogwarts would be a more accurate title or a highly biased and selective history of hogwarts which glosses over the nastier aspects of the school 
 
 what are you on about said ron though harry thought he knew what was coming 
 
 said hermione her eyes flashing not once in over a thousand pages does hogwarts a history mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves 
 
 harry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs his and lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb determination to pursue justice for true both of them had paid two sickles for a badge but they had only done it to keep her quiet their sickles had been wasted however if anything they seemed to have made hermione more vociferous she had been badgering harry and ron ever since first to wear the badges then to persuade others to do the same and she had also taken to rattling around the gryffindor common room every evening cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses 
 
 you do realize that your sheets are changed your fires lit your classrooms cleaned and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved she kept saying fiercely 
 
 some people like neville had paid up just to stop hermione from glowering at them a few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning many regarded the whole thing as a joke 
 
 ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight and fred became extremely interested in his bacon both twins had refused to buy a badge george however leaned in toward hermione 
 
 listen have you ever been down in the kitchens hermione 
 
 no of course not said hermione curtly i hardly think students are supposed to 
 
 well we have said george indicating fred loads of times to nick food and met them and happy they think got the best job in the world 
 
 because uneducated and brainwashed hermione began hotly but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from overhead which announced the arrival of the post owls harry looked up at once and saw hedwig soaring toward him hermione stopped talking abruptly she and ron watched hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto shoulder folded her wings and held out her leg wearily 
 
 harry pulled off reply and offered hedwig his bacon rinds which she ate gratefully then checking that fred and george were safely immersed in further discussions about the triwizard tournament harry read out letter in a whisper to ron and hermione 
 
 nice try harry 
 back in the country and well hidden i want you to keep me posted on everything going on at hogwarts use hedwig keep changing owls and worry about me just watch out for yourself forget what i said about your scar 
 sirius 
 why have to keep changing owls ron asked in a low voice 
 
 attract too much attention said hermione at once she stands out a snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever hidingi mean not native birds are they 
 
 harry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before he supposed that sirius managing to get back without being caught was something he deny either that the idea that sirius was much nearer was reassuring at least he have to wait so long for a response every time he wrote 
 
 thanks hedwig he said stroking her she hooted sleepily dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice then took off again clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the owlery 
 
 there was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day nobody was very attentive in lessons being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from beauxbatons and durmstrang even potions was more bearable than usual as it was half an hour shorter when the bell rang early harry ron and hermione hurried up to gryffindor tower deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed pulled on their cloaks and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall 
 
 the heads of houses were ordering their students into lines 
 
 weasley straighten your hat professor mcgonagall snapped at ron miss patil take that ridiculous thing out of your hair 
 
 parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plait 
 
 follow me please said professor mcgonagall first years in frontno pushing 
 
 they filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle it was a cold clear evening dusk was falling and a pale moon was already shining over the forbidden forest harry standing between ron and hermione in the fourth row from the front saw dennis creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years 
 
 nearly six said ron checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates how reckon coming the train 
 
 i doubt it said hermione 
 
 how then broomsticks harry suggested looking up at the starry sky 
 
 i think sonot from that far away 
 
 a portkey ron suggested or they could apparate maybe allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from 
 
 you apparate inside the hogwarts grounds how often do i have to tell you said hermione impatiently 
 
 they scanned the darkening grounds excitedly but nothing was moving everything was still silent and quite as usual harry was starting to feel cold he wished hurry the foreign students were preparing a dramatic remembered what mr weasley had said back at the campsite before the quidditch world cup always the same we resist showing off when we get together 
 
 and then dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers 
 
 aha unless i am very much mistaken the delegation from beauxbatons approaches 
 
 where said many students eagerly all looking in different directions 
 
 there yelled a sixth year pointing over the forest 
 
 something large much larger than a broomstick or indeed a hundred broomsticks was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle growing larger all the time 
 
 a dragon shrieked one of the first years losing her head completely 
 
 be a flying house said dennis creevey 
 
 guess was the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the forbidden forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it they saw a gigantic powderblue carriage the size of a large house soaring toward them pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses all palominos and each the size of an elephant 
 
 the front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower coming in to land at a tremendous speed then with an almighty crash that made neville jump backward onto a slytherin fifth foot the horses hooves larger than dinner plates hit the ground a second later the carriage landed too bouncing upon its vast wheels while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large fiery red eyes 
 
 harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms two crossed golden wands each emitting three stars before it opened 
 
 a boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage bent forward fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor and unfolded a set of golden steps he sprang back respectfully then harry saw a shining black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage a shoe the size of a sled followed almost immediately by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life the size of the carriage and of the horses was immediately explained a few people gasped 
 
 harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life and that was hagrid he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights yet somehow maybe simply because he was used to hagrid this woman now at the foot of the steps and looking around at the waiting crowd seemed even more unnaturally large as she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall she was revealed to have a handsome face large black eyes and a rather beaky nose her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck she was dressed from head to foot in black satin and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers 
 
 dumbledore started to clap the students following his lead broke into applause too many of them standing on tiptoe the better to look at this woman 
 
 her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward dumbledore extending a glittering hand dumbledore though tall himself had barely to bend to kiss it 
 
 my dear madame maxime he said welcome to hogwarts 
 
 said madame maxime in a deep voice i ope i find you well 
 
 in excellent form i thank you said dumbledore 
 
 my pupils said madame maxime waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her 
 
 harry whose attention had been focused completely upon madame maxime now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls all by the look of them in their late teens had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind madame maxime they were shivering which was unsurprising given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk and none of them were wearing cloaks a few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads from what harry could see of them they were standing in madame enormous shadow they were staring up at hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces 
 
 as karkaroff arrived yet madame maxime asked 
 
 he should be here any moment said dumbledore would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle 
 
 warm up i think said madame maxime but ze orses 
 
 our care of magical creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them said dumbledore the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other er charges 
 
 skrewts ron muttered to harry grinning 
 
 my steeds require er forceful andling said madame maxime looking as though she doubted whether any care of magical creatures teacher at hogwarts could be up to the job zey are very strong 
 
 i assure you that hagrid will be well up to the job said dumbledore smiling 
 
 very well said madame maxime bowing slightly will you please inform zis agrid zat ze orses drink only whiskey 
 
 it will be attended to said dumbledore also bowing 
 
 come said madame maxime imperiously to her students and the hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps 
 
 how big reckon horses are going to be seamus finnigan said leaning around lavender and parvati to address harry and ron 
 
 well if any bigger than this lot even hagrid be able to handle them said harry if he been attacked by his skrewts wonder up with them 
 
 maybe escaped said ron hopefully 
 
 oh say that said hermione with a shudder imagine that lot loose on the grounds 
 
 they stood shivering slightly now waiting for the durmstrang party to arrive most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky 
 
 for a few minutes the silence was broken only by madame huge horses snorting and stamping but then 
 
 can you hear something said ron suddenly 
 
 harry listened a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness a muffled rumbling and sucking sound as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed 
 
 the lake yelled lee jordan pointing down at it look at the lake 
 
 from their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all some disturbance was taking place deep in the center great bubbles were forming on the surface waves were now washing over the muddy banks and then out in the very middle of the lake a whirlpool appeared as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the floor 
 
 what seemed to be a long black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpooland then harry saw the rigging 
 
 a mast he said to ron and hermione 
 
 slowly magnificently the ship rose out of the water gleaming in the moonlight it had a strangely skeletal look about it as though it were a resurrected wreck and the dim misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes finally with a great sloshing noise the ship emerged entirely bobbing on the turbulent water and began to glide toward the bank a few moments later they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank 
 
 people were disembarking they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in the portholes all of them harry noticed seemed to be built along the lines of crabbe and goylebut then as they drew nearer walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall he saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy matted fur but the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort sleek and silver like his hair 
 
 dumbledore he called heartily as he walked up the slope how are you my dear fellow how are you 
 
 blooming thank you professor karkaroff dumbledore replied karkaroff had a fruity unctuous voice when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like dumbledore but his white hair was short and his goatee finishing in a small curl did not entirely hide his rather weak chin when he reached dumbledore he shook hands with both of his own 
 
 dear old hogwarts he said looking up at the castle and smiling his teeth were rather yellow and harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes which remained cold and shrewd how good it is to be here how come along into the warmthyou mind dumbledore viktor has a slight head cold 
 
 karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students as the boy passed harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows he need the punch on the arm ron gave him or the hiss in his ear to recognize that profile

lionfish nov chapter fifteen the high inquisitorcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 they had expected to have to comb daily prophet carefully next morning to find the article percy had mentioned in his letter however the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of dolores umbridge smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline 
 
 ministry seeks educational reform 
 
 dolores umbridge appointed 
 
 first ever high inquisitor 
 
 high inquisitor said harry darkly his piece of toast slipping from his fingers what does that mean 
 
 hermione read aloud 
 
 in a surprise move last night the ministry of magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 the minister has been growing uneasy about at hogwarts for some time said junior assistant to the minister percy weasley he is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve of 
 
 this is not the first time in recent weeks that the minister cornelius fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the wizarding school as recently as th august educational decree number was passed to ensure that in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post the ministry should select an appropriate person 
 
 how dolores umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at hogwarts said weasley last night dumbledore find anyone so the minister put in umbridge and of course been an immediate success 
 
 been a what said harry loudly 
 
 wait more said hermione grimly 
 
 an immediate success totally revolutionising the teaching of defence against the dark arts and providing the minister with feedback about really happening at hogwarts 
 
 it is this last function that the ministry has now formalised with the passing of educational decree number which creates the new position of hogwarts high inquisitor 
 
 this is an exciting new phase in the plan to get to grips with what some are calling the falling standards at hogwarts said weasley the inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch professor umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post and we are delighted to say that she has accepted 
 
 the new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at hogwarts 
 
 i feel much easier in my mind now that i know dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation said mr lucius malfoy speaking from his wiltshire mansion last night many of us with our best interests at heart have been concerned about some of eccentric decisions in the last few years and are glad to know that the ministry is keeping an eye on the situation 
 
 among those eccentric decisions are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper which have included the employment of werewolf remus lupin rubeus hagrid and delusional moody 
 
 rumours abound of course that albus dumbledore once supreme mugwump of the international confederation of wizards and chief warlock of the wizengamot is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of hogwarts 
 
 i think the appointment of the inquisitor is a first step towards ensuring that hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose our confidence said a ministry insider last night 
 
 wizengamot elders griselda marchbanks and tiberius ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of inquisitor to hogwarts 
 
 hogwarts is a school not an outpost of cornelius office said madam marchbanks this is a further disgusting attempt to discredit albus dumbledore for a full account of madam alleged links to subversive goblin groups turn to page seventeen 
 
 hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two 
 
 so now we know how we ended up with umbridge fudge passed this educational decree and forced her on us and now given her the power to inspect the other teachers hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright i believe this outrageous 
 
 i know it is said harry he looked down at his right hand clenched on the and saw the faint white outline of the words umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin 
 
 but a grin was unfurling on face 
 
 what said harry and hermione together staring at him 
 
 oh i wait to see mcgonagall inspected said ron happily umbridge know hit her 
 
 well come on said hermione jumping up better get going if inspecting class we want to be late 
 
 but professor umbridge was not inspecting their history of magic lesson which was just as dull as the previous monday nor was she in dungeon when they arrived for double potions where moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large spiky black d scrawled in an upper corner 
 
 i have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your owl said snape with a smirk as he swept among them passing back their homework this should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in the examination 
 
 snape reached the front of the class and turned on his heel to face them 
 
 the general standard of this homework was abysmal most of you would have failed had this been your examination i expect to see a great deal more effort for this essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes or i shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get a d 
 
 he smirked as malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper some people got a d ha 
 
 harry realised that hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible feeling that he would rather keep that information private 
 
 determined not to give snape an excuse to tail him this lesson harry read and reread every line of instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them his strengthening solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of but it was at least blue rather than pink like and he delivered a flask of it to desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief 
 
 well that as bad as last week was it said hermione as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall towards lunch and the homework go too badly either did it 
 
 when neither ron nor harry answered she pressed on i mean all right i expect the top grade not if marking to owl standard but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage you say 
 
 harry made a noise in his throat 
 
 of course a lot can happen between now and the exam got plenty of time to improve but the grades getting now are a sort of baseline they something we can build on 
 
 they sat down together at the gryffindor table 
 
 obviously have been thrilled if got an o 
 
 hermione said ron sharply if you want to know what grades we got ask 
 
 i meanwell if you want to tell me 
 
 i got a p said ron ladling soup into his bowl happy 
 
 well nothing to be ashamed of said fred who had just arrived at the table with george and lee jordan and was sitting down on right nothing wrong with a good healthy p 
 
 but said hermione p stand for 
 
 poor yeah said lee jordan still better than d it dreadful 
 
 harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll when he emerged from this he was sorry to find that hermione was still in full flow about owl grades 
 
 so top o for outstanding she was saying and then a 
 
 no e george corrected her e for exceeds expectations and always thought fred and i got e in everything because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams 
 
 they all laughed except hermione who ploughed on so after e a for acceptable and the last pass grade it 
 
 yep said fred dunking an entire roll in his soup transferring it to his mouth and swallowing it whole 
 
 then you get p for poor ron raised both his arms in mock d for dreadful 
 
 and then t george reminded her 
 
 t asked hermione looking appalled even lower than a d what on earth does t stand for 
 
 troll said george promptly 
 
 harry laughed again though he was not sure whether or not george was joking he imagined trying to conceal from hermione that he had received in all his owls and immediately resolved to work harder from now on 
 
 you lot had an inspected lesson yet fred asked them 
 
 no said hermione at once have you 
 
 just now before lunch said george charms 
 
 what was it like harry and hermione asked together 
 
 fred shrugged 
 
 not that bad umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard you know what like he treated her like a guest seem to bother him at all she say much asked alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like alicia told her they were really good that was it 
 
 i see old flitwick getting marked down said george he usually gets everyone through their exams all right 
 
 you got this afternoon fred asked harry 
 
 trelawney 
 
 a t if ever i saw one 
 
 and umbridge herself 
 
 well be a good boy and keep your temper with umbridge today said george do her nut if you miss any more quidditch practices 
 
 but harry did not have to wait for defence against the dark arts to meet professor umbridge he was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy divination room when ron elbowed him in the ribs and looking round he saw professor umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor the class which had been talking cheerily fell silent at once the abrupt fall in the noise level made professor trelawney who had been wafting about handing out copies of the dream oracle look round 
 
 good afternoon professor trelawney said professor umbridge with her wide smile you received my note i trust giving the time and date of your inspection 
 
 professor trelawney nodded curtly and looking very disgruntled turned her back on professor umbridge and continued to give out books still smiling professor umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind professor seat she then sat down took her clipboard from her flowery bag and looked up expectantly waiting for the class to begin 
 
 professor trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses 
 
 we shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones though her voice shook slightly divide into pairs please and interpret each others latest visions with the aid of the oracle 
 
 she made as though to sweep back to her seat saw professor umbridge sitting right beside it and immediately veered left towards parvati and lavender who were already deep in discussion about most recent dream 
 
 harry opened his copy of the dream oracle watching umbridge covertly she was already making notes on her clipboard after a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in wake listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there harry bent his head hurriedly over his book 
 
 think of a dream quick he told ron in case the old toad comes our way 
 
 i did it last time ron protested your turn you tell me one 
 
 oh i dunno said harry desperately who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days say i dreamed i was drowning snape in my cauldron yeah do 
 
 ron chortled as he opened his dream oracle 
 
 ok got to add your age to the date you had the dream the number of letters in the subject would that be drowning or cauldron or snape 
 
 it matter pick any of them said harry chancing a glance behind him professor umbridge was now standing at professor shoulder making notes while the divination teacher questioned neville about his dream diary 
 
 what night did you dream this again ron said immersed in calculations 
 
 i dunno last night whenever you like harry told him trying to listen to what umbridge was saying to professor trelawney they were only a table away from him and ron now professor umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and professor trelawney was looking extremely put out 
 
 now said umbridge looking up at trelawney been in this post how long exactly 
 
 professor trelawney scowled at her arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection after a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it she said in a deeply resentful tone nearly sixteen years 
 
 quite a period said professor umbridge making a note on her clipboard so it was professor dumbledore who appointed you 
 
 right said professor trelawney shortly 
 
 professor umbridge made another note 
 
 and you are a of the celebrated seer cassandra trelawney 
 
 yes said professor trelawney holding her head a little higher 
 
 another note on the clipboard 
 
 but i think correct me if i am mistakenthat you are the first in your family since cassandra to be possessed of second sight 
 
 these things often skiperthree generations said professor trelawney 
 
 professor toadlike smile widened 
 
 of course she said sweetly making yet another note well if you could just predict something for me then and she looked up enquiringly still smiling 
 
 professor trelawney stiffened as though unable to believe her ears i understand you she said clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck 
 
 like you to make a prediction for me said professor umbridge very clearly 
 
 harry and ron were not the only people now watching and listening sneakily from behind their books most of the class were staring transfixed at professor trelawney as she drew herself up to her lull height her beads and bangles clinking 
 
 the inner eye does not see upon command she said in scandalised tones 
 
 i see said professor umbridge softly making yet another note on her clipboard 
 
 ibutbut wait said professor trelawney suddenly in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger i i think i do see something something that concerns you why i sense something something dark some grave peril 
 
 professor trelawney pointed a shaking finger at professor umbridge who continued to smile blandly at her eyebrows raised 
 
 i am afraid i am afraid that you are in grave danger professor trelawney finished dramatically 
 
 there was a pause professor umbridge surveyed professor trelawney 
 
 right she said softly scribbling on her clipboard once more well if really the best you can do 
 
 she turned away leaving professor trelawney standing rooted to the spot her chest heaving harry caught eye and knew that ron was thinking exactly the same as he was they both knew that professor trelawney was an old fraud but on the other hand they loathed umbridge so much that they felt very much on sideuntil she swooped down on them a few seconds later that is 
 
 well she said snapping her long fingers under nose uncharacteristically brisk let me see the start made on your dream diary please 
 
 and by the time she had interpreted dreams at the top of her voice all of which even the ones that involved eating porridge apparently foretold a gruesome and early death he was feeling much less sympathetic towards her all the while professor umbridge stood a few feet away making notes on that clipboard and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first and was waiting for them all when they reached their defence against the dark arts lesson ten minutes later 
 
 she was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room harry and ron told hermione who had been in arithmancy exactly what had happened in divination while they all took out their copies of defensive magical theory but before hermione could ask any questions professor umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell 
 
 wands away she instructed them all with a smile and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags as we finished chapter one last lesson i would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two common defensive theories and their derivation there will be no need to talk 
 
 still smiling her wide smile she sat down at her desk the class gave an audible sigh as it turned as one to page nineteen harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this years lessons and was on the point of checking the contents page when he noticed that hermione had her hand in the air again 
 
 professor umbridge had noticed too and what was more she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed hermione she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face to face then she bent down and whispered so that the rest of the class could not hear what is it this time miss granger 
 
 already read chapter two said hermione 
 
 well then proceed to chapter three 
 
 read that too read the whole book 
 
 professor umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly 
 
 well then you should be able to tell me what slinkhard says about in chapter fifteen 
 
 he says that are improperly named said hermione promptly he says is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable 
 
 professor umbridge raised her eyebrows and harry knew she was impressed against her will 
 
 but i disagree hermione continued 
 
 professor eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder 
 
 you disagree she repeated 
 
 yes i do said hermione who unlike umbridge was not whispering but speaking in a clear carrying voice that had by now attracted the attention of the rest of the class mr slinkhard like jinxes does he but i think they can be very useful when used defensively 
 
 oh you do do you said professor umbridge forgetting to whisper and straightening up well afraid it is mr opinion and not yours that matters within this classroom miss granger 
 
 but hermione began 
 
 that is enough said professor umbridge she walked back to the front of the class and stood before them all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone miss granger i am going to take five points from gryffindor house 
 
 there was an outbreak of muttering at this 
 
 what for said harry angrily 
 
 you get involved hermione whispered urgently to him 
 
 for disrupting my class with pointless interruptions said professor umbridge smoothly i am here to teach you using a method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more licence but as none of themwith the possible exception of professor quirrell who did at least appear to have restricted himself to subjectswould have passed a ministry inspection 
 
 yeah quirrell was a great teacher said harry loudly there was just that minor drawback of him having lord voldemort sticking out of the back of his head 
 
 this pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences harry had ever heard then 
 
 i think another detentions would do you some good mr potter said umbridge sleekly 
 
 the cut on the back of hand had barely healed and by the following morning it was bleeding again he did not complain during the detention he was determined not to give umbridge the satisfaction over and over again he wrote i must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips though the cut deepened with every letter 
 
 the very worst part of this second worth of detentions just as george had predicted reaction she cornered him just as he arrived at the gryffindor table for breakfast on tuesday and shouted so loudly that professor mcgonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table 
 
 miss johnson how dare you make such a racket in the great hall five points from gryffindor 
 
 but professor gone and landed himself in detention again 
 
 this potter said professor mcgonagall sharply rounding on harry detention from whom 
 
 from professor umbridge muttered harry not meeting professor beady eyes 
 
 are you telling me she said lowering her voice so that the group of curious ravenclaws behind them could not hear that after the warning i gave you last monday you lost your temper in professor class again 
 
 yes harry muttered speaking to the floor 
 
 potter you must get a grip on yourself you are heading for serious trouble another five points from gryffindor 
 
 butwhat professor no harry said furious at this injustice already being punished by her why do you have to take points as well 
 
 because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever said professor mcgonagall tartly no not another word of complaint potter and as for you miss johnson you will confine your shouting matches to the quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team captaincy 
 
 professor mcgonagall strode back towards the staff table angelina gave harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away upon which he flung himself on to the bench beside ron fuming 
 
 taken points off gryffindor because having my hand sliced open every night how is that fair how 
 
 i know mate said ron sympathetically tipping bacon on to plate bang out of order 
 
 hermione however merely rustled the pages of her daily prophet and said nothing 
 
 you think mcgonagall was right do you said harry angrily to the picture of cornelius fudge obscuring face 
 
 i wish she taken points from you but i think right to warn you not to lose your temper with umbridge said voice while fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page clearly giving some kind of speech 
 
 harry did not speak to hermione all through charms but when they entered transfiguration he forgot about being cross with her professor umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head 
 
 excellent whispered ron as they sat down in their usual seats see umbridge get what she deserves 
 
 professor mcgonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew professor umbridge was there 
 
 that will do she said and silence fell immediately mr finnigan kindly come here and hand back the homeworkmiss brown please take this box of be silly girl they hurt youand hand one to each student 
 
 hem hem said professor umbridge employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt dumbledore on the first night of term professor mcgonagall ignored her seamus handed back essay harry took it without looking at him and saw to his relief that he had managed an a 
 
 right then everyone listen closelydean thomas if you do that to the mouse again i shall put you in detentionmost of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell today we shall be 
 
 hem hem said professor umbridge 
 
 yes said professor mcgonagall turning round her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long severe line 
 
 i was just wondering professor whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec 
 
 obviously i received it or i would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom said professor mcgonagall turning her back firmly on professor umbridge many of the students exchanged looks of glee as i was saying today we shall be practising the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice now the vanishing spell 
 
 hem hem 
 
 i wonder said professor mcgonagall in cold fury turning on professor umbridge how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me you see i do not generally permit people to talk when i am talking 
 
 professor umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face she did not speak but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously 
 
 looking supremely unconcerned professor mcgonagall addressed the class once more 
 
 as i was saying the vanishing spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished the snail as an invertebrate does not present much of a challenge the mouse as a mammal offers a much greater one this is not therefore magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner so you know the incantation let me see what you can do 
 
 how she can lecture me about not losing my temper with umbridge harry muttered to ron under his breath but he was grinninghis anger with professor mcgonagall had quite evaporated 
 
 professor umbridge did not follow professor mcgonagall around the class as she had followed professor trelawney perhaps she realised professor mcgonagall would not permit it she did however take many more notes while sitting in her corner and when professor mcgonagall finally told them all to pack away she rose with a grim expression on her face 
 
 well a start said ron holding up a long wriggling and dropping it back into the box lavender was passing around 
 
 as they filed out of the classroom harry saw professor umbndge approach the teachers desk he nudged ron who nudged hermione in turn and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop 
 
 how long have you been teaching at hogwarts professor umbridge asked 
 
 years this december said professor mcgonagall brusquely snapping her bag shut 
 
 professor umbridge made a note 
 
 very well she said you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days time 
 
 i can hardly wait said professor mcgonagall in a coldly indifferent voice and she strode off towards the door hurry up you three she added sweeping harry ron and hermione before her 
 
 harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return 
 
 he had thought that the next time he would see umbridge would be in his detention that evening but he was wrong when they walked down the lawns towards the forest for care of magical creatures they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside professor 
 
 you do not usually take this class is that correct harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for woodlice like so many living twigs 
 
 quite correct said professor hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet i am a substitute teacher standing in for professor hagrid 
 
 harry exchanged uneasy looks with ron and hermione malfoy was whispering with crabbe and goyle he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on hagrid to a member of the ministry 
 
 hmm said professor umbridge dropping her voice though harry could still hear her quite clearly i wonderthe headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the mattercan you tell me what is causing professor very extended leave of absence 
 
 harry saw malfoy look up eagerly and watch umbridge and closely 
 
 fraid i said professor breezily know anything more about it than you do got an owl from dumbledore would i like a couple of weeks teaching work i accepted as much as i know well shall i get started then 
 
 yes please do said professor umbridge scribbling on her clipboard 
 
 umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered amongst the students questioning them on magical creatures most people were able to answer well and spirits lifted somewhat at least the class was not letting hagrid down 
 
 overall said professor umbridge returning to professor side after a lengthy interrogation of dean thomas how do you as a temporary member of staffan objective outsider i suppose you might sayhow do you find hogwarts do you feel you receive enough support from the school management 
 
 oh yes excellent said professor heartily yes very happy with the way things are run very happy indeed 
 
 looking politely incredulous umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on and what are you planning to cover with this class this yearassuming of course that professor hagrid does not return 
 
 oh take them through the creatures that most often come up in owl said professor not much left to studied unicorns and nifflers i thought cover porlocks and kneazles make sure they can recognise crups and knarls you know 
 
 well you seem to know what doing at any rate said professor umbridge making a very obvious tick on her clipboard harry did not like the emphasis she put on you and liked it even less when she put her next question to goyle now i hear there have been injuries in this class 
 
 goyle gave a stupid grin malfoy hastened to answer the question 
 
 that was me he said i was slashed by a hippogriff 
 
 a hippogriff said professor umbridge now scribbling frantically 
 
 only because he was too stupid to listen to what hagrid told him to do said harry angrily 
 
 both ron and hermione groaned professor umbridge turned her head slowly in direction 
 
 another detention i think she said softly well thank you very much professor i think all i need here you will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days 
 
 jolly good said professor and professor umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle 
 
 it was nearly midnight when harry left office that night his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it he expected the common room to be empty when he returned but ron and hermione had sat up waiting for him he was pleased to see them especially as hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical 
 
 here she said anxiously pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid towards him soak your hand in that a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles it should help 
 
 harry placed his bleeding aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief crookshanks curled around his legs purring loudly then leapt into his lap and settled down 
 
 thanks he said gratefully scratching behind ears with his left hand 
 
 i still reckon you should complain about this said ron in a low voice 
 
 no said harry flatly 
 
 mcgonagall would go nuts if she knew 
 
 yeah she probably would said harry dully and how long do you reckon take umbridge to pass another decree saying anyone who complains about the high inquisitor gets sacked immediately 
 
 ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again defeated 
 
 an awful woman said hermione in a small voice know i was just saying to ron when you came in got to do something about her 
 
 i suggested poison said ron grimly 
 
 no i mean something about what a dreadful teacher she is and how not going to learn any defence from her at all said hermione 
 
 well what can we do about that said ron yawning s too late it got the job here to stay make sure of that 
 
 well said hermione tentatively you know i was thinking today she shot a slightly nervous look at harry and then plunged on i was thinking that maybe the come when we should justjust do it ourselves 
 
 do what ourselves said harry suspiciously still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles 
 
 welllearn defence against the dark arts ourselves said hermione 
 
 come off it groaned ron you want us to do extra work realise harry and i are behind on homework again and only the second week 
 
 but this is much more important than homework said hermione 
 
 harry and ron goggled at her 
 
 i think there was anything in the universe more important than homework said ron 
 
 be silly of course there is said hermione and harry saw with an ominous feeling that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervour that spew usually inspired in her about preparing ourselves like harry said in first lesson for waiting for us out there about making sure we really can defend ourselves if we learn anything for a whole year 
 
 we do much by ourselves said ron in a defeated voice i mean all right we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practise them i suppose 
 
 no i agree gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books said hermione we need a teacher a proper one who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if going wrong 
 
 if talking about lupin harry began 
 
 no no not talking about lupin said hermione too busy with the order and anyway the most we could see him is during hogsmeade weekends and not nearly often enough 
 
 who then said harry frowning at her 
 
 hermione heaved a very deep sigh 
 
 it obvious she said talking about 
 
 there was a silence a light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind ron and the fire guttered 
 
 about me what said harry 
 
 talking about you teaching us defence against the dark arts 
 
 harry stared at her then he turned to ron ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when hermione elaborated on schemes like spew to consternation however ron did not look exasperated 
 
 he was frowning slightly apparently thinking then he said an idea 
 
 an idea said harry 
 
 you said ron teaching us to do it 
 
 but 
 
 harry was grinning now sure the pair of them were pulling his leg 
 
 but not a teacher i 
 
 harry the best in the year at defence against the dark arts said hermione 
 
 me said harry now grinning more broadly than ever no not beaten me in every test 
 
 actually i said hermione coolly you beat me in our third yearthe only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject but not talking about test results harry think what done 
 
 how mean 
 
 you know what not sure i want someone this stupid teaching me ron said to hermione smirking slightly he turned to harry 
 
 think he said pulling a face like goyle concentrating uh first yearyou saved the stone from 
 
 but that was luck said harry it skill 
 
 second year ron interrupted you killed the basilisk and destroyed riddle 
 
 yeah but if fawkes turned up i 
 
 third year said ron louder still you fought off about a hundred dementors at once 
 
 you know that was a fluke if the 
 
 last year ron said almost shouting now you fought off again 
 
 listen to me said harry almost angrily because ron and hermione were both smirking now just listen to me all right it sounds great when you say it like that but all that stuff was lucki know what i was doing half the time i plan any of it i just did whatever i could think of and i nearly always had help 
 
 ron and hermione were still smirking and harry felt his temper rise he even sure why he was feeling so angry 
 
 sit there grinning like you know better than i do i was there i he said heatedly i know what went on all right and i get through any of that because i was brilliant at defence against the dark arts i got through it all because because help came at the right time or because i guessed rightbut i just blundered through it all i have a clue what i was doingstop laughing 
 
 the bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed he became aware that he was on his feet though he remember standing up crookshanks streaked away under a sofa ron and smiles had vanished 
 
 you know what of never had to face him have you you think just memorising a bunch of spells and throwing them at him like in class or something the whole time sure you know nothing between you and dying except your ownyour own brain or guts or whateverlike you can think straight when you know about a nanosecond from being murdered or tortured or watching your friends die never taught us that in their classes what like to deal with things like thatand you two sit there acting like a clever little boy to be standing here alive like diggory was stupid like he messed upyou just get it that could just as easily have been me it would have been if voldemort needed me 
 
 we saying anything like that mate said ron looking aghast we having a go at diggory we got the wrong end of the 
 
 he looked helplessly at hermione whose face was stricken 
 
 harry she said timidly you see this this is exactly why we need you we need to know what like facing him facing 
 
 it was the first time she had ever said name and it was this more than anything else that calmed harry still breathing hard he sank back into his chair becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again he wished he had not smashed the bowl of murtlap essence 
 
 well think about it said hermione quietly please 
 
 harry could not think of anything to say he was feeling ashamed of his outburst already he nodded hardly aware of what he was agreeing to 
 
 hermione stood up 
 
 well off to bed she said in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it erm night 
 
 ron had got to his feet too 
 
 coming he said awkwardly to harry 
 
 yeah said harry in in a minute just clear this up 
 
 he indicated the smashed bowl on the floor ron nodded and left 
 
 reparo harry muttered pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china they flew back together good as new but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl 
 
 he was suddenly so tired he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there but instead he forced himself to his feet and followed ron upstairs his restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter fifteen the unbreakable vowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 snow was swirling against the icy windows once more christmas was approaching fast hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve christmas trees to the great hall garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time harry went past which caused blockages in the corridors fortunately however frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the secret passageways so that he was often without too much difficulty to navigate routes between classes 
 
 ron who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity simply roared with laughter about it all although harry much preferred this new laughing joking ron to the moody aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks the improved ron came at a heavy price firstly harry had to put up with the frequent presence of lavender brown who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing ron as a moment wasted and secondly harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again 
 
 ron whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from bird attack was taking a defensive and resentful tone 
 
 she complain he told harry she snogged krum so found out someone wants to snog me too well a free country i done anything wrong 
 
 harry did not answer but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before charms next morning quintessence a quest determined as he was to remain friends with both ron and hermione he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight 
 
 i never promised hermione anything ron mumbled i mean all right i was going to go to christmas party with her but she never said just as friends a free agent 
 
 harry turned a page of quintessence aware that ron was watching him voice trailed away in mutters barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire though harry thought he caught the words krum and complain again 
 
 schedule was so full that harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings when ron was in any case so tightly wrapped around lavender that he did not notice what harry was doing hermione refused to sit in the common room while ron was there so harry generally joined her in the library which meant that their conversations were held in whispers 
 
 at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes said hermione while the librarian madam pince prowled the shelves behind them i really care less 
 
 she raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment harry said nothing he thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use he bent a little lower over advanced and continued to make notes on everlasting elixirs occasionally pausing to decipher the useful additions to libatius text 
 
 and incidentally said hermione after a few moments you need to be careful 
 
 for the last time said harry speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after of an silence i am not giving back this book learned more from the prince than snape or slughorn have taught me in 
 
 not talking about your stupid prince said hermione giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her talking about earlier i went into the girls bathroom just before i came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there including that romilda vane trying to decide how to slip you a love potion all hoping going to get you to take them to party and thay all seem to have bought fred and love potions which afraid to say probably work 
 
 why you confiscate them then demanded harry it seemed extraordinary that mania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture 
 
 they have the potions with them in the bathroom said hermione scornfully they were just discussing tactics as i doubt the prince she gave the book another scornful look could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once just invite someone to go with you stop all the others thinking still got a chance tomorrow night getting desperate 
 
 there anyone i want to invite mumbled harry who was still not trying to think about ginny any more than he could help despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that ron could not perform legilimency 
 
 well just be careful what you drink because romilda vane looked like she meant business said hermione grimly 
 
 she hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill harry watched her with his mind a long way away 
 
 hang on a moment he said slowly i thought filch had banned anything bought at wizard wheezes 
 
 and when has anyone ever paid attention to what filch has banned asked hermione still concentrating on her essay 
 
 but i thought all the owls were being searched so how come these girls are able to bring love potions into the school 
 
 fred and george send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions said hermione part of their owl order service 
 
 you know a lot about it 
 
 hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of advanced 
 
 it was all on the back of the bottles they showed ginny and me in the summer she said coldly i go around putting potions in drinks or pretending too either which is just as bad 
 
 yeah well never mind that said harry quickly the point is filch is being fooled he these girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else so why malfoy have brought the necklace into the school 
 
 oh harry not that again 
 
 come on why not demanded harry 
 
 look sighed hermione secrecy sensors detect jinxes curses and concealment charms they used to find dark magic and dark objects have picked up a powerful curse like the one in the necklace within seconds but something just been put in the wrong bottle registerand anyway love potions dark or dangerous 
 
 easy for you to say muttered harry thinking of romilda vane 
 
 so it would be down to filch to realise it a cough potion and not a very good wizard i doubt he can tell one potion from 
 
 hermione stopped dead harry had heard it too somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves they waited and a moment later the countenance of madam pince appeared around the corner her sunken cheeks her skin like parchment and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying 
 
 the library is now closed she said mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correctwhat have you been doing to that book you depraved boy 
 
 it the mine said harry hastily snatching his copy of advanced off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand 
 
 despoiled she hissed desecrated befouled 
 
 just a book been written on said harry tugging it out of her grip 
 
 she looked as though she might have a seizure hermione who had hastily packed her things grabbed harry by the arm and frogmarched him away 
 
 ban you from the library if not careful why did you have to bring that stupid book 
 
 not my fault barking mad hermione or think she overheard you being rude about filch always thought there might be something between them 
 
 oh ha ha 
 
 enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again they made their way along the deserted corridors back to the common room arguing whether or not filch and madam pince were secretly in love with each other 
 
 baubles said harry to the fat lady this being the new festive password 
 
 same to you said the fat lady with a roguish grin and she swung forward to admit them 
 
 hi harry said romilda vane the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole fancy a gillywater 
 
 hermione gave him a look over her shoulder 
 
 no thanks said harry quickly i like it much 
 
 well take these anyway said romilda thrusting a box into his hands chocolate cauldrons got firewhiskey in them my gran sent them to me but i like them 
 
 ohrightthanks a lot said harry who could not think what else to say just going over here with 
 
 he hurried off behind hermione his voice tailing away feebly 
 
 told you said hermione succinctly sooner you ask someone sooner all leave you alone and you can 
 
 but her face suddnly turned blank she had just spotted ron and lavender who were intertwined in the same armchair 
 
 well goodnight harry said hermione though it was only seven in the evening and she left for the girls dormitory without another word 
 
 harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through plus party after which he and ron would depart together for the burrow it now seemed impossible that ron and hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began but perhaps somehow the break would give them time to calm down think better of their behavior 
 
 but his hopes were not high and they sank still lower after enduring a transfiguration lesson with them both next day they had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration working in front of mirrors they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows hermione laughed unkindly at disastrous first attempt during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time professor mcgonagall asked a question which lavender and parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced hermione to the verge of tears again she raced out of the classroom on the bell leaving half her things behind harry deciding that her need was greater than just now scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her 
 
 he finally tracked her down as she emerged from a bathroom on the floor below she was accompanied by luna lovegood who was patting her vaguely on the back 
 
 oh hello harry said luna did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow 
 
 hi luna hermione you left your stuff 
 
 he held out her books 
 
 oh yes said hermione in a choked voice taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case thank you harry well better get going 
 
 and she hurried off without ever giving harry any time to offer words of comfort though admittedly he could not think of any 
 
 a bit upset said luna i thought at first it was moaning myrtle in there but it turned out to be hermione she said something about ron weasley 
 
 yeah had a row said harry 
 
 he says funny things sometimes he said luna as they set off down the corridor together but he can be a bit unkind i noticed that last year 
 
 i said harry luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths he had never met anyone quite like her so have you had a good term 
 
 oh been all right said luna a bit lonely without the been nice though she stopped two boys in our transfiguration class calling me loony the other day 
 
 how would you like to come to party with me tonight 
 
 the words were out of mouth before he could stop them he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking 
 
 luna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise 
 
 party with you 
 
 yeah said harry supposed to bring guests so i thought you might like i mean he was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear i mean just as friends you know but if you want to 
 
 he was already that she want to 
 
 oh no love to go with you as friends said luna beaming as he had never seen her beam before ever asked me to a party before as a friend is that why you dyed your eyebrow for the party should i do mine too 
 
 no said harry firmly that was a mistake get hermione to put it right for me so meet you in the entrance hall at eight then 
 
 aha screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped unnoticed by either of them they had just passed underneath peeves who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them 
 
 potty asked loony to go to the party potty lurves loony potty luuuuuurves looooony 
 
 and he zoomed away cackling and shrieking potty loves loony 
 
 nice to keep these things private said harry and sure enough in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that harry potter was taking luna lovegood to party 
 
 you taken anyone said ron in disbelief over dinner anyone and you chose loony lovegood 
 
 call her that ron snapped ginny pausing behind harry on her way to join friends really glad taking her harry so excited 
 
 and she moved on down the table to sit with dean harry tried to feel pleased that ginny was glad he was taking luna to the party but could not quite manage it a long way along the table hermione was sitting alone playing with her stew harry noticed ron looking at her furtively 
 
 you could say sorry suggested harry bluntly 
 
 what and get attacked by another flock of canaries muttered ron 
 
 what did you have to imitate her for 
 
 she laughed at my mustache 
 
 so did i it was the stupidest thing ever seen 
 
 but ron did not seem to have heard lavender had just arrived with parvati squeezing herself in between harry and ron lavender flung her arms around neck 
 
 hi harry said parvati who like harry looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends 
 
 hi said harry you staying at hogwarts then i heard your parents wanted you to leave 
 
 i managed to talk them out of it for the time being said parvati that katie thing really freaked them out but as there been anything since oh hi hermione 
 
 parvati positively beamed harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at hermione in transfiguration he looked around and saw that hermione was beaming back if possible even more brightly girls were very strange sometimes 
 
 hi parvati said hermione ignoring ron and lavender completely are you going to party tonight 
 
 no invite said parvati gloomily love to go though it sounds like going to be really good going you 
 
 yes meeting cormac at eight and 
 
 there was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and ron surfaced hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything 
 
 going up to the party together 
 
 cormac said parvati cormac mclaggen you mean 
 
 right said hermione sweetly the one who almost she put a great deal of emphasis on the word became gryffindor keeper 
 
 are you going out with him then asked parvati 
 
 you know said harmione with a most giggle 
 
 no said parvati looking positively agog at this piece of gossip wow you like your quidditch players you first krum then mclaggen 
 
 i like really good quidditch players hermione corrected her still smiling well see you got to go and get ready for the party 
 
 she left at once lavender and parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development with everything they had ever heard about mclaggen and all they had ever guessed about hermione ron looked strangely blank and said nothing harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge 
 
 when he arrived in the entrance hall at eight that night he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached luna she was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers but otherwise she looked quite nice harry was glad in any case that she had left off her radish earrings her necklace and her spectrespecs 
 
 hi he said shall we get going then 
 
 oh yes she said happily where is the party 
 
 office said harry leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering did you hear supposed to be a vampire coming 
 
 rufus scrimgeour asked luna 
 
 iwhat said harry disconcerted you mean the minister of magic 
 
 yes a vampire said luna father wrote a very long article about it when scrimgeour first took over from cornelius fudge but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the ministry obviously they want the truth to get out 
 
 harry who thought it most unlikely that rufus scrimgeour was a vampire but who was used to luna repeating her bizarre views as though they were fact did not reply they were already approaching office and the sounds of laughter music and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took 
 
 whether it had been built that way or because he had used magical trickery to make it so office was much larger than the usual study the ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald crimson and gold hangings so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent the room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering each a brilliant speck of light loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation and a number of were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing so that they looked like little roving tables 
 
 harry boomed slughorn almost as soon as harry and luna had squeezed in through the door come in come in so many people like you to meet 
 
 slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket gripping arm so tightly he might have been hoping to disapparate with him slughorn led him purposefully into the party harry seized hand and dragged her along with him 
 
 harry like you to meet eldred worple an old student of mine author of blood brothers my life amongst the vampiresand of course his friend sanguini 
 
 worple who was a small stout bespectacled man grabbed hand and shook it enthusiastically the vampire sanguini who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes merely nodded he looked rather bored a gaggle of girls was standing close to him looking curious and excited 
 
 harry potter i am simply delighted said worple peering up into face i was saying to professor slughorn only the other day where is the biography of harry potter for which we have all been waiting 
 
 er said harry were you 
 
 just as modest as horace described said worple but seriously his manner changed it became suddenly i would be delighted to write it myself people are craving to know more about you dear boy craving if you were prepared to grant me a few interviews say in four or sessions why we could have the book finished within months and all with very little effort on your part i assure youask sanguini here if it quite sanguini stay here added worple suddenly stern for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls a rather hungry look in his eye here have a pasty said worple seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into hand before turning his attention back to harry 
 
 my dear boy the gold you could make you have no idea 
 
 definitely not interested said harry firmly and just seen a friend of mine sorry 
 
 he pulled luna after him into the crowd he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the weird sisters 
 
 hermione hermione 
 
 harry there you are thank goodness hi luna 
 
 happened to you asked harry for hermione looked distinctly disheveled rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of snare 
 
 oh just escapedi mean just left cormac she said under the mistletoe she added in explanation as harry continued to look questioningly at her 
 
 serves you right for coming with him he told her severely 
 
 i thought annoy ron most said hermione dispassionately i debated for a while about zacharias smith but i thought on the whole 
 
 you considered smith said harry revolted 
 
 yes i did and starting to wish chosen him mclaggen makes grawp look a gentleman go this way be able to see him coming so tall 
 
 the three of them made their way over to the other side of the room scooping up goblets of mead on the way realizing too late that professor trelawney was standing there alone 
 
 hello said luna politely to professor trelawney 
 
 good evening my dear said professor trelawney focusing upon luna with some difficulty harry could smell cooking sherry again i seen you in my classes lately 
 
 no got firenze this year said luna 
 
 oh of course said professor trelawney with an angry drunken titter or dobbin as i prefer to think of him you would have thought would you not that now i am returned to the school professor dumbledore might have got rid of the horse but no we share classes an insult frankly an insult do you know 
 
 professor trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized harry under cover of her furious criticisms of firenze harry drew closer to hermione and said let me get something straight are you planning to tell ron that you interfered at keeper tryouts 
 
 hermione raised her eyebrows 
 
 do you really think stoop that low 
 
 harry looked at her shrewdly 
 
 hermione if you can ask out mclaggen 
 
 a difference said hermione with dignity got no plans to tell ron anything about what might or might not have happened at keeper tryouts 
 
 good said harry fervently because just fall apart again and lose the next match 
 
 quidditch said hermione angrily is that all boys care about cormac asked me one single question about myself no just been treated to a hundred great saves made by cormac mclaggen ever sinceoh no here he comes 
 
 she moved so fast it was as though she had disapparated one moment she was there the next she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished 
 
 seen hermione asked mclaggen forcing his way through the throng a minute later 
 
 no sorry said harry and he turned quickly to join in conversation forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking 
 
 harry potter said professor trelawney in deep vibrant tones noticing him for the first time 
 
 oh hello said harry unenthusiastically 
 
 my dear boy she said in a very carrying whisper the rumors the stories the chosen one of course i have known for a very long time the omens were never good harry but why have you not returned to divination for you of all people the subject is of the utmost importance 
 
 ah sybill we all think our most important said a loud voice and slughorn appeared at professor other side his face very red his velvet hat a little askew a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other but i think ever known such a natural at potions said slughorn regarding harry with a fond if bloodshot eye instinctive you knowlike his mother only ever taught a few with this kind of ability i can tell you that sybillwhy even severus 
 
 and to horror slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop snape out of thin air toward them 
 
 stop skulking and come and join us severus hiccuped slughorn happily i was just talking about exceptional some credit must go to you of course you taught him for five years 
 
 trapped with arm around his shoulders snape looked down his hooked nose at harry his black eyes narrowed 
 
 funny i never had the impression that i managed to teach potter anything at all 
 
 well then natural ability shouted slughorn you should have seen what he gave me first lesson draught of living deathnever had a student produce finer on a first attempt i think even you severus 
 
 really said snape quietly his eyes still boring into harry who felt a certain disquiet the last thing he wanted was for snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at potions 
 
 remind me what other subjects taking harry asked slughorn 
 
 defense against the dark arts charms transfiguration herbology 
 
 all the subjects required in short for an auror said snape with the faintest sneer 
 
 yeah well what like to do said harry defiantly 
 
 and a great one make too boomed slughorn 
 
 i think you should be an auror harry said luna unexpectedly everybody looked at her the aurors are part of the rotfang conspiracy i thought everyone knew that planning to bring down the ministry of magic from within using a combination of dark magic and gum disease 
 
 harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh really it had been worth bringing luna just for this emerging from his goblet coughing sopping wet but still grinning he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher draco malfoy being dragged by the ear toward them by argus filch 
 
 professor slughorn wheezed filch his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of in his bulging eyes i discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor he claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out did you issue him with an invitation 
 
 malfoy pulled himself free of grip looking furious 
 
 all right i invited he said angrily i was trying to gatecrash happy 
 
 no not said filch a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face in trouble you are the headmaster say that prowling is out unless got permission he eh 
 
 all right argus all right said slughorn waving a hand christmas and not a crime to want to come to a party just this once forget any punishment you may stay draco 
 
 expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable but why harry wondered watching him did malfoy look almost equally unhappy and why was snape looking at malfoy as though both angry and was it possible a little afraid 
 
 but almost before harry had registered what he had seen filch had turned and shuffled away muttering under his breath malfoy had composed his face into a smile and was thanking slughorn for his generosity and face was smoothly inscrutable again 
 
 nothing nothing said slughorn waving away thanks i did know your grandfather after all 
 
 he always spoke very highly of you sir said malfoy quickly said you were the best ever known 
 
 harry stared at malfoy it was not the that intrigued him he had watched malfoy do that to snape for a long time it was the fact that malfoy did after all look a little ill this was the first time he had seen malfoy close up for ages he now saw that malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin 
 
 like a word with you draco said snape suddenly 
 
 now severus said slughorn hiccuping again christmas be too hard 
 
 his head of house and i shall decide how hard or otherwise to be said snape curtly follow me draco 
 
 they left snape leading the way malfoy looking resentful harry stood there for a moment irresolute then said be back in a bit lunaerbathroom 
 
 all right she said cheerfully and he thought he heard her as he hurried off into the crowd resume the subject of the rotfang conspiracy with professor trelawney who seemed sincerely interested 
 
 it was easy once out of the party to pull his invisibility cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself for the corridor was quite deserted what was more difficult was finding snape and malfoy harry ran down the corridor the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from office behind him perhaps snape had taken malfoy to his office in the dungeons or perhaps he was escorting him back to the slytherin common room harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until with a great jolt of excitement he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices 
 
 cannot afford mistakes draco because if you are expelled 
 
 i have anything to do with it all right 
 
 i hope you are telling the truth because it was both clumsy and foolish already you are suspected of having a hand in it 
 
 who suspects me said malfoy angrily for the last time i do it okay that bell girl had an enemy no one knows look at me like that i know what doing not stupid but it worki can stop you 
 
 there was a pause and then snape said quietly ah aunt bellatrix has been teaching you occlumency i see what thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master draco 
 
 not trying to conceal anything from him i just want you butting in 
 
 harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole what had happened to make malfoy speak to snape like thissnape toward whom he had always shown respect even liking 
 
 so that is why you have been avoiding me this term you have feared my interference you realize that had anybody else failed to come to my office when i had told them repeatedly to be there draco 
 
 so put me in detention report me to dumbledore jeered malfoy 
 
 there was another pause then snape said you know perfectly well that i do not wish to do either of those things 
 
 better stop telling me to come to your office then 
 
 listen to me said snape his voice so low now that harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear i am trying to help you i swore to your mother i would protect you i made the unbreakable vow draco 
 
 looks like have to break it then because i need your protection my job he gave it to me and doing it got a plan and going to work just taking a bit longer than i thought it would 
 
 what is your plan 
 
 none of your business 
 
 if you tell me what you are trying to do i can assist you 
 
 i have all the assistance i need thanks not alone 
 
 you were certainly alone tonight which was foolish in the extreme wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup these are elementary mistakes 
 
 i had crabbe and goyle with me if you put them in detention 
 
 keep your voice down spat snape for voice had risen excitedly if your friends crabbe and goyle intend to pass their defense against the dark arts this time around they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres 
 
 what does it matter said malfoy defense against the dark all just a joke it an act like any of us need protecting against the dark arts 
 
 it is an act that is crucial to success draco said snape where do you think i would have been all these years if i had not known how to act now listen to me you are being incautious wandering around at night getting yourself caught and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like crabbe and goyle 
 
 not the only ones got other people on my side better people 
 
 then why not confide in me and i can 
 
 i know what up to you want to steal my glory 
 
 there was another pause then snape said coldly you are speaking like a child i quite understand that your capture and imprisonment has upset you but 
 
 harry had barely a warning he heard footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open malfoy was striding away down the corridor past the open door of office around the distant corner and out of sight 
 
 hardly daring to breathe harry remained crouched down as snape emerged slowly from the classroom his expression unfathomable he returned to the party harry remained on the floor hidden beneath the cloak his mind racing 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter fifteen the goblins revengecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 early next morning before the other two were awake harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest most gnarled and tree he could find there in its shadows he buried moodys eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand it was not much but harry felt that would have much preferred this to being stuck on dolores umbridges door then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake and discuss what they were going to do next 
 
 harry and hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long and ron agreed with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing while harry and ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there then they disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town 
 
 once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments harry ventured out under the invisibility cloak to find sustenance this however did not go as planned he had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill a descending mist and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood 
 
 but you can make a brilliant patronus protested ron when harry arrived back at the tent empty handed out of breath and mouthing the single word dementors 
 
 i couldnt make one he panted clutching the stitch in his side wouldnt come 
 
 their expressions of consternation and disappointment made harry feel ashamed it had been a nightmarish experience seeing the dementors gliding out of the must in the distance and realizing as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears that he was not going to be able to protect himself it had taken all harrys willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the muggles who might not be able to see them but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went 
 
 so we still havent got any food 
 
 shut up ron snapped hermione harry what happened why do you think you couldnt make your patronus you managed perfectly yesterday 
 
 i dont know 
 
 he sat low in one of perkinss old armchairs feeling more humiliated by the moment he was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him yesterday seemed a long time ago today me might have been thirteen years old again the only one who collapsed on the hogwarts express 
 
 ron kicked a chair leg 
 
 what he snarled at hermione im starving all ive had since i bled half to death is a couple of toadstools 
 
 you go and fight your way through the dementors then said harry stung 
 
 i would but my arms in a sling in case you hadnt noticed 
 
 thats convenient 
 
 and whats that supposed to c 
 
 of course cried hermione clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence harry give me the locket come on she said impatiently clicking her fingers at him when he did not react the horcrux harry youre still wearing it 
 
 she held out her hands and harry lifted the golden chain over his head the moment it parted contact with harrys skin he felt oddly light he had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted 
 
 better asked hermione 
 
 yeah loads better 
 
 harry she said crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick you dont think youve been possessed do you 
 
 what no he said defensively i remember everything weve done while ive bee wearing it i wouldnt know what id done if id been possessed would i ginny told me there were times when she couldnt remember anything 
 
 hmm said hermione looking down at the heavy locket well maybe we ought not to wear it we can just keep it in the tent 
 
 we are not leaving that horcrux lying around harry stated firmly if we lose it if it gets stolen c 
 
 oh all right all right said hermione and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt but well take turns wearing it so nobody keeps it on too long 
 
 great said ron irritably and now weve sorted that out can we please get some food 
 
 fine but well go somewhere else to find it said hermione with half a glance at harry theres no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around 
 
 in the end they settled down for the night in a far flung field belonging to a lonely farm from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread 
 
 its not stealing is it asked hermione in a troubled voice as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast not if i left some money under the chicken coo 
 
 ron rolled his eyes and said with his cheeks bulging oo worry oo much elax 
 
 and indeed it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed the argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night and harry felt cheerful even hopeful as he took the first of the three night watches 
 
 this was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits an empty one bickering and gloom harry was least surprised by this because be had suffered periods of near starvation at the dursleys hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences dour ron however had always been used to three delicious meals a day courtesy of his mother or of the hogwarts and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible whenever lack of food coincided with rons turn to wear the horcrux he became downright unpleasant 
 
 so where next was his constant refrain he did not seem to have any ideas himself but expected harry and hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies accordingly harry and hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other horcruxes and how to destroy the one they already got their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they got no new information 
 
 as dumbledore had told harry that he believed voldemort had hidden the horcruxes in places important to him they kept reciting in a sort of dreary litany those locations they knew that voldemort had lived or visited the orphanage where he had been born and raised hogwarts where he had been educated borgin and burks where he had worked after completing school then albania where he had spent his years of exile these formed the basis of their speculations 
 
 yeah lets go to albania shouldnt take more than an afternoon to search an entire country said ron sarcastically 
 
 there cant be anything there hed already made five of his horcruxes before he went into exile and dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth said hermione we know the snakes not in albania its usually with vol c 
 
 didnt i ask you to stop say that 
 
 fine the snake is usually with c happy 
 
 not particularly 
 
 i cant see him hiding anything at borgin and burkes said harry who had made this point many times before but said it again simply to break the nasty silence borgin and burke were experts at dark objects they wouldve recognized a horcrux straightaway 
 
 ron yawned pointedly repressing a strong urge to throw something at him harry plowed on i still reckon he might have hidden something at hogwarts 
 
 hermione sighed 
 
 but dumbledore would have found it harry 
 
 harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory 
 
 dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of hogwarts secrets im telling you if there was one place vol c 
 
 oi 
 
 then harry shouted goaded past endurance if there was one place that was really important to it was hogwarts 
 
 oh come on scoffed ron his school 
 
 yeah his school it was his first real home the place that meant he was special it meant everything to him and even after he left c 
 
 this is were talking about right not you inquired ron he was tugging at the chain of the horcrux around his neck harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him 
 
 you told us that asked dumbledore to give him a job after he left said hermione 
 
 thats right said harry 
 
 and dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something probably another founders object to make into another horcrux 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 but he didnt get the job did he said hermione so he never got the chance to find a founders object there and hide it in the school 
 
 okay then said harry defeated forget hogwarts 
 
 
 
 
 without any other leads they traveled into london and hidden beneath the invisibility cloak searching for the orphanage in which voldemort had been raised hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before they visited its site and found a tower block of offices 
 
 we could try digging in to foundations hermione suggested halfheartedly 
 
 he wouldnt have hidden a horcrux here harry said he had known it all along the orphanage had been the place voldemort had been determined to escape he would never have hidden a part of his soul there dumbledore had shown harry that voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places this dismal gray corner of london was as far removed as you could imagine from hogwarts of the ministry or a building like gringotts the wizarding banks with its gilded doors and marble floors 
 
 even without any new idea they continued to move through the countryside pitching the tent in a different place each night for security every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot traveling by apparition to more woods to the shadowy crevices of cliffs to purple moors mountainsides and once a sheltered and pebbly cove every twelve hours or so they passed the horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse game of where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety 
 
 harrys scar kept prickling it happened most often he noticed when he was wearing the horcrux sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain 
 
 what what did you see demanded ron whenever he noticed harry wince 
 
 a face muttered harry every time the same face the thief who stole from gregorovitch 
 
 and ron would turn away making no effort to hide his disappointment harry knew that ron was hoping to bear news of his family or the rest of the order of the phoenix but after all he harry was not a television aerial he could only see what voldemort was thinking at the time not tune in to whatever took his fancy apparently voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face whose name and whereabouts harry felt sure voldemort knew no better than he did as harrys scar continued to burn and the merry boy swam tantalizingly in his memory he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief he could not entirely blame them when they were so desperate for a lead on the horcruxes 
 
 as the days stretched into weeks harry began to suspect that ron and hermione were having conversations without and about him several times they stopped talking abruptly when harry entered the tent and twice he came accidentally upon them huddled a little distance away heads together and talking fast both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water 
 
 harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood and harry was starting to fear that hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership in desperation he tried to think of further horcrux locations but the only one that continued to occur to him was hogwarts and as neither of the others thought this at all likely he stopped suggesting it 
 
 autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it they were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves natural mists joined those cast by the dementors wind and rain added to their troubles the fact that hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation the lack of other peoples company or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against voldemort 
 
 my mother said ron on night as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in wales can make good food appear out of thin air 
 
 he prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate harry glanced automatically at rons neck and saw as he has expected the golden chain of the horcrux glinting there he managed to fight down the impulse to swear at ron whose attitude would he knew improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket 
 
 your mother cant produce food out of thin air said hermione no one can food is the first of the five principal exceptions to gamps law of elemental transfigura c 
 
 oh speak english cant you ron said prying a fish out from between his teeth 
 
 its impossible to make good food out of nothing you can summon it if you know where it is you can transform it you can increase the quantity if youve already got some c 
 
 well dont bother increasing this its disgusting said ron 
 
 harry caught the fish and i did my best with it i notice im always the one who ends up sorting out the food because im a girl i suppose 
 
 no its because youre supposed to be the best at magic shot back ron 
 
 hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the floor 
 
 you can do the cooking tomorrow ron you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating and ill sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see you c 
 
 shut up said harry leaping to his feet and holding up both hands shut up now 
 
 hermione looked outraged 
 
 how can you side with him he hardly ever does the cook c 
 
 hermione be quiet i can hear someone 
 
 he was listening hard his hands still raised warning them not to talk then over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them he heard voices again he looked around at the sneakoscope it was not moving 
 
 you cast the muffliato charm over us right he whispered to hermione 
 
 i did everything she whispered back muffliato and disillusionment charms all of it they shouldnt be able to hear of see us whoever they are 
 
 heavy scuffing and scraping noises plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs told them that several people were clambering down the steep wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent they drew their wands waiting the enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient in the near total darkness to shield them from the notice of muggles and normal witches and wizards if these were death eaters then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by dark magic for the first time 
 
 the voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage after a moment she drew out three extendible ears and threw one each to harry and ron who hastily inserted the ends of the strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance 
 
 within seconds harry heard a weary male voice 
 
 there ought to be a few salmon in here or dyou reckon its too early in the season accio salmon 
 
 there were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh somebody grunted appreciatively harry pressed the extendable ear deeper into his own over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices but they were not speaking english or any human language he had ever heard it was a rough and unmelodious tongue a string of rattling guttural noises and there seemed to be two speakers one with a slightly lower slower voice than the other 
 
 a fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas large shadows passed between tent and flames the delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction then came the clinking of cutlery on plates and the first man spoke again 
 
 here griphook gornuk 
 
 goblins hermione mouthed at harry who nodded 
 
 thank you said the goblins together in english 
 
 so you three have been on the run how long asked a new mellow and pleasant voice it was vaguely familiar to harry who pictured a man 
 
 six weeks seven i forget said the tired man met up with griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with gornuk not long after nice to have a but of company there was a pause while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground what made you leave ted continued the man 
 
 knew they were coming for me replied ted and harry suddenly knew who he was tonkss father heard death eaters were in the area last week and decided id better run for it refused to register as a on principle see so i knew it was a matter of time knew id have to leave in the end my wife should be okay shes and then i met dean here what a few days ago son 
 
 yeah said another voice and harry ron and hermione stared at each other silent but besides themselves with excitement sure they recognized the voice of dean thomas their fellow gryffindor 
 
 eh asked the first man 
 
 not sure said dean my dad left my mum when i was a kid ive got no proof he was a wizard though 
 
 there was silence for a while except for the sounds of munching then ted spoke again 
 
 ive got to say dirk im surprised to run into you pleased but surprised word was that youd been caught 
 
 i was said dirk i was halfway to azkaban when i made a break for it stunned dawlish and nicked his broom it was easier than youd think i dont reckon hes quite right at the moment might be confunded if so id like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it probably saved my life 
 
 there was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on the ted said and where do you two fit in i er had the impression the goblins were for on the whole 
 
 you had a false impression said the of the goblins we take no sides this is a wizards war 
 
 how come youre in hiding then 
 
 i deemed in prudent said the goblin having refused what i considered an impertinent request i could see that my person safety was in jeopardy 
 
 what did they ask you to do asked ted 
 
 duties the dignity of my race replied the goblin his voice rougher and less human as he said it i am not a 
 
 what about you griphook 
 
 similar reasons said the higher voiced goblin gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race i recognize no wizarding master 
 
 he added something under his breath in gobbledegook and gornuk laughed 
 
 whats the joke asked dean 
 
 he said replied dirk that there are things wizards dont recognize either 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 i dont get it said dean 
 
 i had my small revenge before i left said griphook in english 
 
 good man c goblin i should say amended ted hastily didnt manage to lock a death eater up in one of the old vaults i suppose 
 
 if i had the sword would not have helped him break out replied griphook gornuk laughed again and even dirk gave a dry chuckle 
 
 dean and i are still missing something here said ted 
 
 so is severus snape though he does not know it said griphook and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter inside the tent harrys breathing was shallow with excitement he and hermione stared at each other listening as hard as they could 
 
 didnt you hear about that ted asked dirk about the kids who tried to steal gryffindors sword out of snapes office at hogwarts 
 
 an electric current seemed to course through harry jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot 
 
 never heard a word said ted not in the prophet was it 
 
 hardly chortled dirk griphook here told me he heard about it from bill weasley who works for the bank one of the kids who tried to take the sword was bills younger sister 
 
 harry glanced toward hermione and ron both of whom were clutching the extendable ears as tightly as lifelines 
 
 she and a couple of friends got into snapes office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase 
 
 ah god bless em said ted what did they think that theyd be able to use the sword on or on snape himself 
 
 well whatever they thought they were going to do with it snape decided the sword wasnt safe where it was said dirk couple of days later once hed got the from i imagine he sent it down to london to be kept in gringotts instead 
 
 the goblins started to laugh again 
 
 im still not seeing the joke said ted 
 
 its a fake rasped griphook 
 
 the sword of gryffindor 
 
 oh yes it is a copy c an excellent copy it is true c but it was the original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only armor possesses wherever the genuine sword of gryffindor is it is not in a vault at gringotts bank 
 
 i see said ted and i take it you didnt bother telling the death eaters this 
 
 i saw no reason to trouble them with the information said griphook smugly and now ted and dean joined in gornuk and dirks laughter 
 
 inside the tent harry closed his eyes willing someone to ask the question he needed answered and after a minute that seemed ten dean obliged he was harry remembered with a jolt an of ginnys too 
 
 what happened to ginny and all the others the ones who tried to steal it 
 
 oh they were punished and cruelly said griphook indifferently 
 
 theyre okay though asked ted quickly i mean the weasleys dont need any more of their kids injured do they 
 
 they suffered no serious injury as far as i am aware said griphook 
 
 lucky for them said ted with snapes track record i suppose we should just be glad theyre still alive 
 
 you believe that story then do you ted asked dirk you believe snape killed dumbledore 
 
 course i do said ted youre not going to sit there and tell me you think potter had anything to do with it 
 
 hard to know what to believe these days muttered dirk 
 
 i know harry potter said dean and i reckon hes the real thing c the chosen one or whatever you want to call it 
 
 yeah theres a lot would like to believe hes that son said dirk me included but where is he run for it by the looks of things youd think if he knew anything we dont or had anything special going for him hed be out there now fighting rallying resistance instead of hiding and you know the prophet made a pretty good case against him c 
 
 the prophet scoffed ted you deserve to be lied to if youre still reading that much dirk you want the facts try the quibbler 
 
 there was a sudden explosion of choking and retching plus a good deal of thumping by the sound of it dirk had swallowed a fish bone at last he sputtered the quibbler that lunatic rag of xeno lovegoods 
 
 its not so lunatic these days said ted you want to give it a look xeno is printing all the stuff the prophets ignoring not a single mention of snorkacks in the last issue how long theyll let him get with it mind i dont know but xeno says front page of every issue that any wizard whos against ought to make helping harry potter their priority 
 
 hard to help a boy whos vanished off the face of the earth said dirk 
 
 listen the fact that they havent caught him yets one hell of an achievement said ted id take tips from him gladly its what were trying to do stay free isnt it 
 
 yeah well youve got a point there said dirk heavily with the whole of the ministry and all their informers looking for him id have expected him to be caught by now mind whos to say they havent already caught and killed him without publicizing it 
 
 ah dont say that dirk murmured ted 
 
 there was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks when they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the back or retreat back up the wooded slope deciding the trees would give better cover they extinguished their fire then clambered back up the incline their voices fading away 
 
 harry ron and hermione reeled in the extendable ears harry who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped now found himself unable to say more then ginny c the sword c 
 
 i know said hermione 
 
 she lunged for the tiny beaded bag this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit 
 
 here we are she said between gritted teeth and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight harry hurried to help her as they lifted the empty portrait of phineas nigellus free of hermiones bag she kept her wand pointing at it ready to cast a spell at any moment 
 
 if somebody swapped the real sword for the face while it was in dumbledores office she panted as they propped the painting against the side of the tent phineas nigellus would have seen it happen he hangs right beside the case 
 
 unless he was asleep said harry but he still held his breath as hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas her wand directed at its center cleared her throat then said 
 
 er c phineas phineas nigellus 
 
 nothing happened 
 
 phineas nigellus said hermione again professor black please could we talk to you please 
 
 please always helps said a cold snide voice and phineas nigellus slid into his portrait at one hermione cried 
 
 obscura 
 
 a black blindfold appeared over phineas nigelluss clever dark eyes causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain 
 
 what c how dare c what are you c 
 
 im very sorry professor black said hermione but its a necessary precaution 
 
 remove this foul addition at once remove it i say you are ruining a great work of art where am i what is going on 
 
 never mind where we are said harry and phineas nigellus froze abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold 
 
 can that possible be the voice of the elusive mr potter 
 
 maybe said harry knowing that this would keep phineas nigelluss interest weve got a couple of questions to ask you c about the sword of gryffindor 
 
 ah said phineas nigellus now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight of harry yes that silly girl acted most unwisely there c 
 
 shut up about my sister said ron roughly phineas nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows 
 
 who else is here he asked turning his head from side to side your tone displeases me the girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme thieving from the headmaster 
 
 they werent thieving said harry that sword isnt snapes 
 
 it belongs to professor snapes school said phineas nigellus exactly what claim did the weasley girl have upon it she deserved her punishment as did the idiot longbottom and the lovegood oddity 
 
 neville is not an idiot and luna is not an oddity said hermione 
 
 where am i repeated phineas nigellus starting to wrestle with the blindfold again where have you brought me why have you removed me from the house of my forebears 
 
 never mind that how did snape punish ginny neville and luna asked harry urgently 
 
 professor snape sent them into the forbidden forest to do some work for the oaf hagrid 
 
 hagrids not an oaf said hermione shrilly 
 
 and snape mightve though that was a punishment said harry but ginny neville and luna probably had a good laugh with hagrid the forbidden forest theyve faced plenty worse than the forbidden forest big deal 
 
 he felt relieved he had been imagining horrors the cruciatus curse at the very least 
 
 what we really wanted to know professor black is whether anyone else has um taken out the sword at all maybe its been taken away for cleaning c or something 
 
 phineas nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered 
 
 he said armor does not require cleaning simple girl goblins silver repels mundane dirt imbibing only that which strengthens it 
 
 dont call hermione simple said harry 
 
 i grow weary of contradiction said phineas nigellus perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmasters office 
 
 still blindfolded he began groping the side of his frame trying to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at hogwarts harry had a sudden inspiration 
 
 dumbledore cant you bring us dumbledore 
 
 i beg your pardon asked phineas nigellus 
 
 professor dumbledores portrait c couldnt you bring him along here into yours 
 
 phineas nigellus turned his face in the direction of harrys voice 
 
 evidently it is not only who are ignorant potter the portraits of hogwarts may commune with each other but they cannot travel outside of the castle except to visit a painting of themselves elsewhere dumbledore cannot come here with me and after the treatment i have received at your hands i can assure you that i will not be making a return visit 
 
 slightly crestfallen harry watched phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame 
 
 professor black said hermione couldnt you just tell us please when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case before ginny took it out i mean 
 
 phineas snorted impatiently 
 
 i believe that the last time i saw the sword of gryffindor leave its case was when professor dumbledore used it to break open a ring 
 
 hermione whipped around to look at harry neither of them dared say more in front of phineas nigellus who had at least managed to locate the exit 
 
 well good night to you he said a little waspishly and he began to move out of sight again only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when harry gave a sudden shout 
 
 wait have you told snape you saw this 
 
 phineas nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture 
 
 professor snape has more important things on his mind that the many eccentricities of albus dumbledore potter 
 
 and with that he vanished completely leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop 
 
 harry hermione cried 
 
 i know harry shouted unable to contain himself he punched the air it was more than he had dared to hope for he strode up and down the tent feeling that he could have run a mile he did not even feel hungry anymore hermione was squashing phineas nigelluss back into the beaded bag when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to harry 
 
 the sword can destroy horcruxes blades imbibe only that which strengthens them c harry that swords impregnated with basilisk venom 
 
 and dumbledore didnt give it to me because he still needed it he wanted to use it on the locket c 
 
 c and he must have realized they wouldnt let you have it if he put it in his will c 
 
 c so he made a copy c 
 
 c and put a fake in the glass case c 
 
 c and he left the real one c where 
 
 they gazed at east other harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them tantalizingly close why hadnt dumbledore told him or had he in fact told harry but harry had not realized it at the time 
 
 think whispered hermione think where would he have left it 
 
 not at hogwarts said harry resuming his pacing 
 
 somewhere in hogsmeade suggested hermione 
 
 the shrieking shack said harry nobody ever goes in there 
 
 but snape knows how to get in wouldnt that be a bit risky 
 
 dumbledore trusted snape harry reminded her 
 
 not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords said hermione 
 
 yeah youre right said harry and he felt even more cheered at the thought that dumbledore had had some reservations however faint about snapes trustworthiness so would he have hidden the sword well away from hogsmeade then what dyou reckon ron ron 
 
 harry looked around for one bewildered moment he thought that ron had left the tent then realized that ron was lying in the shadow of a bunk looking stony 
 
 oh remembered me have you he said 
 
 what 
 
 ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk 
 
 you two carry on dont let me spoil your fun 
 
 perplexed harry looked to hermione for help but she shook her head apparently as nonplussed as he was 
 
 whats the problem asked harry 
 
 problem theres no problem said ron still refusing to look at harry not according to you anyways 
 
 there were several plunks on the canvas over their heads it had started to rain 
 
 well youve obviously got a problem said harry spit it out will you 
 
 ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up he looked mean unlike himself 
 
 all right ill spit it out dont expect me to skip up and down the tent because theres some other damn thing weve got to find just add it to the list of stuff you dont know 
 
 i dont know repeated harry i dont know 
 
 plunk plunk plunk the rain was falling harder and heavier it pattered on the bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark dread doused harrys jubilation ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking 
 
 its not like im not having the time of my life here said ron you know with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night i just hoped you know after wed been running round a few weeks wed have achieved something 
 
 ron hermione said but in such a quiet voice that ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was beating on the tent 
 
 i thought you knew what youd signed up for said harry 
 
 yeah i thought i did too 
 
 so what part of it isnt living up to your expectations asked harry anger was coming to his defense now did you think wed be staying in hotels finding a horcrux every other day did you think youd be back to mummy by christmas 
 
 we thought you knew what you were doing shouted ron standing up and his words harry like scalding knives we thought dumbledore had told you what to do we thought you had a real plan 
 
 ron said hermione this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof but again he ignored her 
 
 well sorry to let you down said harry his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow inadequate ive been straight with you from the start i told you everything dumbledore told me and in the case you havent noticed weve found one horcrux c 
 
 yeah and were about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them c nowhere effing near in other words 
 
 take off the locket ron hermione said her voice unusually high please take it off you wouldnt be talking like this if you hadnt been wearing it all day 
 
 yeah he would said harry who did not want excuses made for ron dyou think i havent noticed the two of you whispering behind my back dyou think i didnt guess you were thinking this stuff 
 
 harry we werent c 
 
 dont lie ron hurled at her you said it too you said you were disappointed you said youd thought he had a bit more to go on than c 
 
 i didnt say it like that c harry i didnt she cried 
 
 the rain was pounding the tent tears were pouring down hermiones face and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been a firework that had flared and died leaving everything dark wet and cold the sword of gryffindor was hidden they knew not where and their were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not yet to be dead 
 
 so why are you still here harry asked ron 
 
 search me said ron 
 
 go home then said harry 
 
 yeah maybe i will shouted ron and he took several steps toward harry who did not back away didnt you hear what they said about my sister but you dont give a rats fart do you its only the forbidden forest harry potter doesnt care what happened to her in there c well i do all right giant spiders and mental stuff c 
 
 i was only saying c she was with the others they were with hagrid c 
 
 yeah i get it you dont care and what about the rest of my family the weasleys dont need another kid injured did you hear that 
 
 yeah i c 
 
 not bothered what it meant though 
 
 ron said hermione forcing her way between them i dont think it means anything new has happened anything we dont know about think ron bills already scared plenty of people must have seen that george has lost an ear by now and youre supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit im sure thats all he meant c 
 
 oh youre sure are you right then well i wont bother myself about them its all right for you isnt it with your parents safely out of the way c 
 
 my parents are dead harry bellowed 
 
 and mine could be going the same way yelled ron 
 
 then go roared harry go back to them pretend youre got over your spattergroit and mummyll be able to feed you up and c 
 
 ron made a sudden movement harry reacted but before either wand was clear of its owners pocket hermione had raised her own 
 
 prestego she cried and an invisible shield expanded between her and harry on the one side and ron on the other all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell and harry and ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time harry felt a corrosive hatred toward ron something had broken between them 
 
 leave the horcrux harry said 
 
 ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair he turned to hermione 
 
 what are you doing 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 are you staying or what 
 
 i she looked anguished yes c yes im staying ron we said wed go with harry we said wed help c 
 
 i get it you choose him 
 
 ron no c please c come back come back 
 
 she was impeded by her own shield charm by the time she had removed it he had already stormed into the night harry stood quite still and silent listening to her sobbing and calling rons name amongst the trees 
 
 after a few minutes she returned her sopping hair plastered to her face 
 
 hes disapparated 
 
 she threw herself into a chair curled up and started to cry 
 
 harry felt dazed he stooped picked up the horcrux and placed it around his own neck he dragged blankets off rons bunk and threw them over hermione then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof listening to the pounding of the rain 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 ib and little christina 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the forest that extends from the banks of the gudenau in north 
 jutland a long way into the country and not far from the clear 
 stream rises a great ridge of land which stretches through the 
 wood like a wall westward of this ridge and not far from the 
 river stands a farmhouse surrounded by such poor land that the sandy soil shows itself between the scanty ears of rye and wheat which grow in it some years have passed since the people who lived here cultivated these fields they kept three sheep a pig and two oxen in fact they maintained themselves very well they had quite enough to live upon as people generally have who are content with their lot they even could have afforded to keep two horses but it was a saying among the farmers in those parts the horse eats himself up that is to say he eats as much as he earns jeppe jans 
 cultivated his fields in summer and in the winter he made wooden 
 shoes he also had an assistant a lad who understood as well as he 
 himself did how to make wooden shoes strong but light and in the 
 fashion they carved shoes and spoons which paid well therefore no one could justly call jeppe jans and his family poor people little 
 ib a boy of seven years old and the only child would sit by 
 watching the workmen or cutting a stick and sometimes his finger 
 instead of the stick but one day ib succeeded so well in his 
 carving that he made two pieces of wood look really like two little 
 wooden shoes and he determined to give them as a present to little 
 christina 
 
 and who was little christina she was the daughter 
 graceful and delicate as the child of a gentleman had she been 
 dressed differently no one would have believed that she lived in a 
 hut on the neighboring heath with her father he was a widower and 
 earned his living by carrying firewood in his large boat from the 
 forest to the and on the estate of silkborg and 
 sometimes even to the distant town of randers there was no one 
 under whose care he could leave little christina so she was almost 
 always with him in his boat or playing in the wood among the 
 blossoming heath or picking the ripe wild berries sometimes when 
 her father had to go as far as the town he would take little 
 christina who was a year younger than ib across the heath to the 
 cottage of jeppe jans and leave her there ib and christina agreed 
 together in everything they divided their bread and berries when they 
 were hungry they were partners in digging their little gardens 
 they ran and crept and played about everywhere once they wandered a long way into the forest and even ventured together to climb the high ridge another time they found a few snipes eggs in the wood which was a great event ib had never been on the heath where father lived nor on the river but at last came an opportunity 
 
 father invited him to go for a sail in his boat and the 
 evening before he accompanied the boatman across the heath to his 
 house the next morning early the two children were placed on the top of a high pile of firewood in the boat and sat eating bread and 
 wild strawberries while father and his man drove the boat 
 forward with poles they floated on swiftly for the tide was in their 
 favor passing over lakes formed by the stream in its course 
 sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and yet 
 there was always room for them to pass out although the old trees 
 overhung the water and the old oaks stretched out their bare branches as if they had turned up their sleeves and wished to show their knotty naked arms old whose roots were loosened from the banks clung with their fibres to the bottom of the stream and the tops of the branches above the water looked like little woody 
 islands the waved themselves to and fro on the river 
 everything made the excursion beautiful and at last they came to 
 the great where the water rushed through the 
 and the children thought this a beautiful sight in those days there 
 was no factory nor any town house nothing but the great farm with 
 its fields in which could be seen a few herd of 
 cattle and one or two farm laborers the rushing of the water through 
 the sluices and the scream of the wild ducks were almost the only 
 signs of active life at silkborg after the firewood had been 
 unloaded father bought a whole bundle of eels and a 
 which were all placed in a basket in the stern of the 
 boat then they returned again up the stream and as the wind was 
 favorable two sails were hoisted which carried the boat on as well 
 as if two horses had been harnessed to it as they sailed on they 
 came by chance to the place where the assistant lived at 
 a little distance from the bank of the river the boat was moored and 
 the two men after desiring the children to sit still both went on 
 shore they obeyed this order for a very short time and then forgot 
 it altogether first they peeped into the basket containing the eels 
 and the then they must needs pull out the pig and take it 
 in their hands and feel it and touch it and as they both wanted 
 to hold it at the same time the consequence was that they let it fall 
 into the water and the pig sailed away with the stream 
 here was a terrible disaster ib jumped ashore and ran a little 
 distance from the boat 
 
 oh take me with you cried christina and she sprang after him 
 in a few minutes they found themselves deep in a thicket and could no longer see the boat or the shore they ran on a little farther and 
 then christina fell down and began to cry 
 
 ib helped her up and said never mind follow me yonder is 
 the house but the house was not yonder and they wandered still 
 farther over the dry rustling leaves of the last year and treading 
 on fallen branches that crackled under their little feet then they 
 heard a loud piercing cry and they stood still to listen 
 
 presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood it was an 
 ugly cry and it frightened the children but before them in the 
 thickest part of the forest grew the most beautiful blackberries 
 in wonderful quantities they looked so inviting that the children 
 could not help stopping and they remained there so long eating 
 that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with the juice 
 
 presently they heard the frightful scream again and christina 
 said we shall get into trouble about that pig 
 oh never mind said ib we will go home to my 
 house it is here in the wood so they went on but the road led them 
 out of the way no house could be seen it grew dark and the children 
 were afraid the solemn stillness that reigned around them was now and then broken by the shrill cries of the great horned owl and other 
 birds that they knew nothing of at last they both lost themselves 
 in the thicket christina began to cry and then ib cried too and 
 after weeping and lamenting for some time they stretched themselves 
 down on the dry leaves and fell asleep 
 
 the sun was high in the heavens when the two children woke they 
 felt cold but not far from their on a hill the sun 
 was shining through the trees they thought if they went there they 
 should be warm and ib fancied he should be able to see his 
 house from such a high spot but they were far away from home now in quite another part of the forest they clambered to the top of 
 the rising ground and found themselves on the edge of a declivity 
 which sloped down to a clear transparent lake great quantities of 
 fish could be seen through the clear water sparkling in the 
 rays they were quite surprised when they came so suddenly upon such an unexpected sight 
 
 close to where they stood grew a covered with 
 beautiful nuts they soon gathered some cracked them and ate the 
 fine young kernels which were only just ripe but there was another 
 surprise and fright in store for them out of the thicket stepped a 
 tall old woman her face quite brown and her hair of a deep shining 
 black the whites of her eyes glittered like a on her back she 
 carried a bundle and in her hand a knotted stick she was a gypsy 
 the children did not at first understand what she said she drew out 
 of her pocket three large nuts in which she told them were hidden the 
 most beautiful and lovely things in the world for they were wishing 
 nuts ib looked at her and as she spoke so kindly he took courage 
 and asked her if she would give him the nuts and the woman gave 
 them to him and then gathered some more from the bushes for 
 herself quite a pocket full ib and christina looked at the wishing 
 nuts with wide open eyes 
 
 is there in this nut a carriage with a pair of horses asked 
 ib 
 
 yes there is a golden carriage with two golden horses replied 
 the woman 
 
 then give me that nut said christina so ib gave it to her and 
 the strange woman tied up the nut for her in her handkerchief 
 ib held up another nut is there in this nut a pretty little 
 neckerchief like the one christina has on her neck asked ib 
 
 there are ten neckerchiefs in it she replied as well as 
 beautiful dresses stockings and a hat and veil 
 
 then i will have that one also said christina and it is a 
 pretty one too and then ib gave her the second nut 
 the third was a little black thing you may keep that one 
 said christina it is quite as pretty 
 
 what is in it asked ib 
 
 the best of all things for you replied the gypsy so ib held 
 the nut very tight 
 
 then the woman promised to lead the children to the right path 
 that they might find their way home and they went forward certainly 
 in quite another direction to the one they meant to take therefore no 
 one ought to speak against the woman and say that she wanted to steal the children in the wild they met a forester who knew ib and by his help ib and christina reached home where they found every one had been very anxious about them they were pardoned and forgiven although they really had both done wrong and deserved to get into trouble first because they had let the fall into the water and secondly because they had run away christina was taken back to her house on the heath and ib remained in the on the borders of the wood near the great land ridge 
 
 the first thing ib did that evening was to take out of his 
 pocket the little black nut in which the best thing of all was said 
 to be enclosed he laid it carefully between the door and the 
 and then shut the door so that the nut cracked directly 
 but there was not much kernel to be seen it was what we should call 
 hollow or and looked as if it had been filled with tobacco or rich black earth it is just what i expected exclaimed ib 
 how should there be room in a little nut like this for the best thing 
 of all christina will find her two nuts just the same there will 
 be neither fine clothes or a golden carriage in them 
 
 winter came and the new year and indeed many years passed 
 away until ib was old enough to be confirmed and therefore he went during a whole winter to the clergyman of the nearest village to be prepared 
 
 one day about this time the boatman paid a visit to 
 parents and told them that christina was going to service and that 
 she had been remarkably fortunate in obtaining a good place with most respectable people only think he said she is going to the rich at the hotel in herning many miles west from here 
 she is to assist the landlady in the housekeeping and if afterwards 
 she behaves well and remains to be confirmed the people will treat 
 her as their own daughter 
 
 so ib and christina took leave of each other people already 
 called them the betrothed and at parting the girl showed ib the two 
 nuts which she had taken care of ever since the time that they lost 
 themselves in the wood and she told him also that the little wooden 
 shoes he once carved for her when he was a boy and gave her as a 
 present had been carefully kept in a drawer ever since and so they 
 parted 
 
 after confirmation he remained at home with his mother 
 for he had become a clever shoemaker and in summer managed the farm for her quite alone his father had been dead some time and his 
 mother kept no farm servants sometimes but very seldom he heard 
 of christina through a postillion or who was passing 
 
 but she was well off with the rich innkeeper and after being 
 confirmed she wrote a letter to her father in which was a kind 
 message to ib and his mother in this letter she mentioned that her 
 master and mistress had made her a present of a beautiful new dress 
 and some nice this was of course pleasant news 
 
 one day in the following spring there came a knock at the door 
 of the house where old mother lived and when they opened it 
 lo and behold in stepped the boatman and christina she had come to pay them a visit and to spend the day a carriage had to come from the herning hotel to the next village and she had taken the 
 opportunity to see her friends once more she looked as elegant as a 
 real lady and wore a pretty dress beautifully made on purpose for 
 her there she stood in full dress while ib wore only his working 
 clothes he could not utter a word he could only seize her hand and 
 hold it fast in his own but he felt too happy and glad to open his 
 lips christina however was quite at her ease she talked and 
 talked and kissed him in the most friendly manner even afterwards 
 when they were left alone and she asked did you know me again ib he still stood holding her hand and said at last you are become quite a grand lady christina and i am only a rough working man but i have often thought of you and of old times then they 
 wandered up the great ridge and looked across the stream to the 
 heath where the little hills were covered with the flowering broom 
 ib said nothing but before the time came for them to part it 
 became quite clear to him that christina must be his wife had they 
 not even in childhood been called the betrothed to him it seemed as 
 if they were really engaged to each other although not a word had 
 been spoken on the subject they had only a few more hours to remain together for christina was obliged to return that evening to the 
 neighboring village to be ready for the carriage which was to start 
 the next morning early for herning ib and her father accompanied 
 her to the village it was a fine moonlight evening and when they 
 arrived ib stood holding hand in his as if he could 
 not let her go his eyes brightened and the words he uttered came 
 with hesitation from his lips but from the deepest recesses of his 
 heart christina if you have not become too grand and if you can be 
 contented to live in my house as my wife we will be 
 married some day but we can wait for a while 
 
 oh yes she replied let us wait a little longer ib i can 
 trust you for i believe that i do love you but let me think it 
 over then he kissed her lips and so they parted 
 
 on the way home ib told the boatman that he and christina were as 
 good as engaged to each other and the boatman found out that he had always expected it would be so and went home with ib that evening and remained the night in the farmhouse but nothing further was said of the engagement during the next year two letters passed 
 between ib and christina they were signed faithful till death but 
 at the end of that time one day the boatman came over to see ib with 
 a kind greeting from christina he had something else to say which 
 made him hesitate in a strange manner at last it came out that 
 christina who had grown a very pretty girl was more lucky than ever 
 
 she was courted and admired by every one but her son who had been home on a visit was so much pleased with christina that he wished to marry her he had a very good situation in an office at copenhagen and as she had also taken a liking for him his parents 
 were not unwilling to consent but christina in her heart often 
 thought of ib and knew how much he thought of her so she felt 
 inclined to refuse this good fortune added the boatman at first ib 
 said not a word but he became as white as the wall and shook his 
 head gently and then he spoke christina must not refuse this 
 good fortune 
 
 then will you write a few words to her said the boatman 
 ib sat down to write but he could not get on at all the words 
 were not what he wished to say so he tore up the page the 
 following morning however a letter lay ready to be sent to 
 christina and the following is what he wrote 
 
 the letter written by you to your father i have read and see 
 from it that you are prosperous in everything and that still better 
 fortune is in store for you ask your own heart christina and 
 think over carefully what awaits you if you take me for your 
 husband for i possess very little in the world do not think of me or 
 of my position think only of your own welfare you are bound to me by no promises and if in your heart you have given me one i release you from it may every blessing and happiness be poured out upon you christina heaven will give me the consolation 
 ever your sincere friend ib 
 this letter was sent and christina received it in due time in 
 the course of the following november her banns were published in 
 the church on the heath and also in copenhagen where the 
 bridegroom lived she was taken to copenhagen under the protection 
 of her future because the bridegroom could not spare 
 time from his numerous occupations for a journey so far into 
 jutland on the journey christina met her father at one of the 
 villages through which they passed and here he took leave of her 
 very little was said about the matter to ib and he did not refer to 
 it his mother however noticed that he had grown very silent and 
 pensive thinking as he did of old times no wonder the three nuts 
 came into his mind which the gypsy woman had given him when a child and of the two which he had given to christina these wishing nuts after all had proved true one had contained a gilded carriage and noble horses and the other beautiful clothes all of 
 these christina would now have in her new home at copenhagen her part had come true and for him the nut had contained only black earth the gypsy woman had said it was the best for him perhaps it was and this also would be fulfilled he understood the gypsy meaning now the black earth the dark grave was the best thing for him now 
 
 again years passed away not many but they seemed long years to 
 ib the old innkeeper and his wife died one after the other and the 
 whole of their property many thousand dollars was inherited by their 
 son christina could have the golden carriage now and plenty of 
 fine clothes during the two long years which followed no letter came 
 from christina to her father and when at last her father received one 
 from her it did not speak of prosperity or happiness poor christina 
 neither she nor her husband understood how to economize or save and the riches brought no blessing with them because they had not asked for it 
 
 years passed and for many summers the heath was covered with 
 bloom in winter the snow rested upon it and the rough winds blew 
 across the ridge under which stood sheltered home one spring day the sun shone brightly and he was guiding the plough across his 
 field the ploughshare struck against something which he fancied was a firestone and then he saw glittering in the earth a splinter of 
 shining metal which the plough had cut from something which gleamed brightly in the furrow he searched and found a large golden armlet of superior workmanship and it was evident that the plough had disturbed a grave he searched further and found more 
 valuable treasures which ib showed to the clergyman who explained 
 their value to him then he went to the magistrate who informed the 
 president of the museum of the discovery and advised ib to take the 
 treasures himself to the president 
 
 you have found in the earth the best thing you could find 
 said the magistrate 
 
 the best thing thought ib the very best thing for me and 
 found in the earth well if it really is so then the gypsy woman was 
 right in her prophecy 
 
 so ib went in the from aarhus to copenhagen to him who had only sailed once or twice on the river near his own home this seemed like a voyage on the ocean and at length he arrived at 
 copenhagen the value of the gold he had found was paid to him it was a large sum six hundred dollars then ib of the heath went out and wandered about in the great city 
 
 on the evening before the day he had settled to return with the 
 captain of the ib lost himself in the streets and 
 took quite a different turning to the one he wished to follow he 
 wandered on till he found himself in a poor street of the suburb 
 called haven not a creature could be seen at last a very 
 little girl came out of one of the houses and ib 
 asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted she looked up 
 timidly at him and began to cry bitterly he asked her what was the 
 matter but what she said he could not understand so he went along 
 the street with her and as they passed under a lamp the light fell 
 on the little face a strange sensation came over ib as he 
 caught sight of it the living breathing embodiment of little 
 christina stood before him just as he remembered her in the days of 
 her childhood he followed the child to the wretched house and 
 ascended the narrow crazy staircase which led to a little garret in 
 the roof the air in the room was heavy and stifling no light was 
 burning and from one corner came sounds of moaning and sighing it was the mother of the child who lay there on a miserable bed with the help of a match ib struck a light and approached her 
 
 can i be of any service to you he asked this little girl 
 brought me up here but i am a stranger in this city are there no 
 neighbors or any one whom i can call 
 
 then he raised the head of the sick woman and smoothed her 
 pillow he started as he did so it was christina of the heath no one 
 had mentioned her name to ib for years it would have disturbed his 
 peace of mind especially as the reports respecting her were not good 
 
 the wealth which her husband had inherited from his parents had made him proud and arrogant he had given up his certain appointment and travelled for six months in foreign lands and on his return had lived in great style and got into terrible debt for a time he had trembled on the high pedestal on which he had placed himself till 
 at last he toppled over and ruin came his numerous merry companions and the visitors at his table said it served him right for he had kept house like a madman one morning his corpse was found in the canal the cold hand of death had already touched the heart of 
 christina her youngest child looked for in the midst of 
 prosperity had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old and 
 at last christina herself became sick unto death and lay forsaken 
 and dying in a miserable room amid poverty she might have borne in 
 her younger days but which was now more painful to her from the 
 luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed it was her eldest 
 child also a little christina whom ib had followed to her home 
 where she suffered hunger and poverty with her mother 
 
 it makes me unhappy to think that i shall die and leave this poor 
 child sighed she oh what will become of her she could say no 
 more 
 
 then ib brought out another match and lighted a piece of candle 
 which he found in the room and it threw a glimmering light over the 
 wretched dwelling ib looked at the little girl and thought of 
 christina in her young days for her sake could he not love this 
 child who was a stranger to him as he thus reflected the dying 
 woman opened her eyes and gazed at him did she recognize him he never knew for not another word escaped her lips 
 
 in the forest by the river gudenau not far from the heath and 
 beneath the ridge of land stood the little farm newly painted and 
 whitewashed the air was heavy and dark there were no blossoms on the heath the autumn winds whirled the yellow leaves towards the 
 hut in which strangers dwelt but the little farm stood 
 safely sheltered beneath the tall trees and the high ridge the turf 
 blazed brightly on the hearth and within was sunlight the 
 sparkling light from the sunny eyes of a child the birdlike tones 
 from the rosy lips ringing like the song of a lark in spring all 
 was life and joy little christina sat on knee ib was to her 
 both father and mother her own parents had vanished from her 
 memory as a vanishes alike from childhood and age 
 house was well and prettily furnished for he was a prosperous man now while the mother of the little girl rested in the churchyard at 
 copenhagen where she had died in poverty ib had money now money which had come to him out of the black earth and he had christina for his own after all

 angle from behind poster 
 as norton rips the poster from before our eyes stunned faces peer in camera pulls slowly reveal the long crumbling tunnel in the wall 
 int cell minutes later 
 rory tremont a guard barely out of his teens tries not to look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest getting instructions from six different people at once 
 red 
 they got this skinny kid named rory tremont to go in the hole he much in the brains department but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job 
 they slap a flashlight in his hands 
 he was willing to go 
 int tunnel day 
 rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly 
 red 
 probably thought win a bronze star or something 
 int vertical shaft day 
 dark as midnight concrete walls rise on both sides if you imagine them as two huge slices of bread the meat of this particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark tangle of pipes between the cellblocks appears shining his flashlight down the shaft somewhere a rat squeaks 
 red 
 it was his third day on the job 
 rory 
 warden a space here between the walls bout three feet across smells pretty damn bad 
 norton 
 i care what it smells like 
 hadley 
 go on boy we got a hold of you 
 looking none too happy about it rory squeezes from the tunnel and dangles into the shaft he gets lowered shining his light smothered by darkness not having a good time 
 rory 
 gettin worse 
 norton 
 never mind i said just keep going 
 rory 
 smells pretty damn bad warden in fact it smells just like shit 
 his feet touch the ground or what he assumed was the ground not in fact just what it smells like he sinks in past his ankles he slips and sits heavily in it 
 rory 
 oh god what it is shit oh my god shit pull me out fore i blow my groceries oh shit shit oh my gawwwwwwd 
 int cell day 
 red and others listen to violent barfing from below 
 red 
 and then came the unmistakable sound of rory tremont losing his 
 last few meals the whole cellblock heard it i mean it echoed 
 it for red he starts laughing laughing hell bellowing laughter laughing so hard he has to hold himself laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks the look of rage on face makes him laugh all the harder 
 int solitary wing night 
 abrupt silence low angle on steel door 
 red 
 i laughed myself right into solitary two week stretch 
 int solitary night 
 red 
 shit shit oh my god shit 
 he starts laughing all over again fit to split

 andy once talked about doing easy time in the hole now i knew what he meant 
 ext shawshank prison wide shot day 
 virgin landscape charming rural road suddenly state police cruisers rocket up the road with sirens and lights 
 red 
 in andy dufresne escaped from shawshank prison 
 ext field day 
 shawshank is half a mile distant we track along a muddy creel as state troopers and prison guards scour the brush a troopee fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick 
 red 
 all they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes a bar of 
 soap and an old damn near worn down to the nub 
 trooper g pulls the from the weeds swish pan 
 to a police photographer his flashbulb glare produces 
 a black and white still photo 
 of the hapless cops posing with reeking uniform and the 
 worn push in on the hammer 
 red 
 i remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel 
 through the wall with it andy did it in less than twenty 
 int cell night 
 once again we see andy using the to scratch his name into the cement suddenly a chunk of cement pops free and hits the floor he stares down at it 
 int cell night 
 andy lies in the dark studying the chunk of concrete in his hands considering the possibilities wrestling with hope 
 red 
 andy loved geology i imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature 
 an ice age here a million years of there plates of 
 bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia 
 int cell night 
 andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen chunk carefully runs his fingertip over it 
 red 
 geology is the study of pressure and time all it takes really pressure and time 
 int cell night 
 rita is now on the wall hanging down over back 
 red 
 that and a big damn poster 
 track in to reveal andy scraping patiently at the concrete 
 red 
 like i said in prison a do most anything to keep his mind 
 occupied

 book eight 
 chapter xv 
 
 on returning late in the evening sonya went to room and to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa open on the table beside her lay letter sonya picked it up and read it 
 as she read she glanced at the sleeping natasha trying to find in her face an explanation of what she was reading but did not find it her face was calm gentle and happy clutching her breast to keep herself from choking sonya pale and trembling with fear and agitation sat down in an armchair and burst into tears 
 how was it i noticed nothing how could it go so far can she have left off loving prince andrew and how could she let kuragin go to such lengths he is a deceiver and a villain plain what will nicholas dear noble nicholas do when he hears of it so this is the meaning of her excited resolute unnatural look the day before yesterday yesterday and today thought sonya but it be that she loves him she probably opened the letter without knowing who it was from probably she is offended by it she could not do such a thing 
 sonya wiped away her tears and went up to natasha again scanning her face 
 natasha she said just audibly 
 natasha awoke and saw sonya 
 ah back 
 and with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of awakening she embraced her friend but noticing look of embarrassment her own face expressed confusion and suspicion 
 sonya read that letter she demanded 
 yes answered sonya softly 
 natasha smiled rapturously 
 no sonya i any longer she said i hide it from you any longer you know we love one another sonya darling he writes sonya 
 sonya stared at natasha unable to believe her ears 
 and bolkonski she asked 
 ah sonya if you only knew how happy i am cried natasha you know what love is 
 but natasha can that be all over 
 natasha looked at sonya with eyes as if she could not grasp the question 
 well then are you refusing prince andrew said sonya 
 oh you understand anything talk nonsense just listen said natasha with momentary vexation 
 but i believe it insisted sonya i understand how is it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly why you have only seen him three times natasha i believe you joking in three days to forget everything and so 
 three days said natasha it seems to me loved him a hundred years it seems to me that i have never loved anyone before you understand it sonya wait a bit sit here and natasha embraced and kissed her 
 i had heard that it happens like this and you must have heard it too but only now that i feel such love not the same as before as soon as i saw him i felt he was my master and i his slave and that i could not help loving him yes his slave whatever he orders i shall do you understand that what can i do what can i do sonya cried natasha with a happy yet frightened expression 
 but think what you are doing cried sonya i leave it like this this secret correspondence how could you let him go so far she went on with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal 
 i told you that i have no will natasha replied why you understand i love him 
 then i let it come to that i shall tell cried sonya bursting into tears 
 what do you mean for sake if you tell you are my enemy declared natasha you want me to be miserable you want us to be separated 
 when she saw fright sonya shed tears of shame and pity for her friend 
 but what has happened between you she asked what has he said to you why he come to the house 
 natasha did not answer her questions 
 for sake sonya tell anyone torture me natasha entreated remember no one ought to interfere in such matters i have confided in you 
 but why this secrecy why he come to the house asked sonya why he openly ask for your hand you know prince andrew gave you complete freedom if it is really so but i believe it natasha have you considered what these secret reasons can be 
 natasha looked at sonya with astonishment evidently this question presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how to answer it 
 i know what the reasons are but there must be reasons 
 sonya sighed and shook her head incredulously 
 if there were reasons she began 
 but natasha guessing her doubts interrupted her in alarm 
 sonya one doubt him one one you understand she cried 
 does he love you 
 does he love me natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her lack of comprehension why you have read his letter and you have seen him 
 but if he is dishonorable 
 he dishonorable if you only knew exclaimed natasha 
 if he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or cease seeing you and if you do this i will i will write to him and i will tell papa said sonya resolutely 
 but i live without him cried natasha 
 natasha i understand you and what are you saying think of your father and of nicholas 
 i want anyone i love anyone but him how dare you say he is dishonorable you know that i love him screamed natasha go away sonya i want to quarrel with you but go for sake go you see how i am suffering natasha cried angrily in a voice of despair and repressed irritation sonya burst into sobs and ran from the room 
 natasha went to the table and without a reflection wrote that answer to princess mary which she had been unable to write all the morning in this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were at an end that availing herself of the magnanimity of prince andrew who when he went abroad had given her her she begged princess mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward her but that she could not be his wife at that moment this all seemed quite easy simple and clear to natasha 
 on friday the rostovs were to return to the country but on wednesday the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near moscow 
 on the day the count left sonya and natasha were invited to a big dinner party at the karagins and marya dmitrievna took them there at that party natasha again met anatole and sonya noticed that she spoke to him trying not to be overheard and that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever when they got home natasha was the first to begin the explanation sonya expected 
 there sonya you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be praised we have had an explanation today 
 well what happened what did he say natasha how glad i am not angry with me tell me everything the whole truth what did he say 
 natasha became thoughtful 
 oh sonya if you knew him as i do he said he asked me what i had promised bolkonski he was glad i was free to refuse him 
 sonya sighed sorrowfully 
 but you refused bolkonski said she 
 perhaps i have perhaps all is over between me and bolkonski why do you think so badly of me 
 i think anything only i understand this 
 wait a bit sonya understand everything see what a man he is now think badly of me or of him i think badly of anyone i love and pity everybody but what am i to do 
 sonya did not succumb to the tender tone natasha used toward her the more emotional and ingratiating the expression of face became the more serious and stern grew 
 natasha said she you asked me not to speak to you and i spoken but now you yourself have begun i trust him natasha why this secrecy 
 again again interrupted natasha 
 natasha i am afraid for you 
 afraid of what 
 i am afraid going to your ruin said sonya resolutely and was herself horrified at what she had said 
 anger again showed in face 
 and go to my ruin i will as soon as possible not your business it be you but i suffer leave me alone leave me alone i hate you 
 natasha moaned sonya aghast 
 i hate you i hate you my enemy forever and natasha ran out of the room 
 natasha did not speak to sonya again and avoided her with the same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house taking up now one occupation now another and at once abandoning them 
 hard as it was for sonya she watched her friend and did not let her out of her sight 
 the day before the count was to return sonya noticed that natasha sat by the drawingroom window all the morning as if expecting something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past whom sonya took to be anatole 
 sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening natasha was in a strange and unnatural state she answered questions at random began sentences she did not finish and laughed at everything 
 after tea sonya noticed a housemaid at door timidly waiting to let her pass she let the girl go in and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered 
 then suddenly it became clear to sonya that natasha had some dreadful plan for that evening sonya knocked at her door natasha did not let her in 
 she will run away with him thought sonya she is capable of anything there was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today she cried as she said to uncle sonya remembered yes it she means to elope with him but what am i to do thought she recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that natasha had some terrible intention the count is away what am i to do write to kuragin demanding an explanation but what is there to oblige him to reply write to pierre as prince andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune but perhaps she really has already refused bolkonski she sent a letter to princess mary yesterday and uncle is away to tell marya dmitrievna who had such faith in natasha seemed to sonya terrible well anyway thought sonya as she stood in the dark passage now or never i must prove that i remember the goodness to me and that i love nicholas yes if i sleep for three nights not leave this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family be disgraced thought she

 chapter xiii 
 
 little gavroche 
 eight or nine years after the events narrated in the second part of this story people noticed on the boulevard du temple and in the regions of the a little boy eleven or twelve years of age who would have realized with tolerable accuracy that ideal of the gamin sketched out above if with the laugh of his age on his lips he had not had a heart absolutely sombre and empty this child was well muffled up in a pair of trousers but he did not get them from his father and a chemise but he did not get it from his mother 
 some people or other had clothed him in rags out of charity 
 still he had a father and a mother but his father did not think of him and his mother did not love him 
 he was one of those children most deserving of pity among all one of those who have father and mother and who are orphans nevertheless 
 this child never felt so well as when he was in the street the pavements were less hard to him than his heart 
 his parents had despatched him into life with a kick 
 he simply took flight 
 he was a boisterous pallid nimble jeering lad with a vivacious but sickly air 
 he went and came sang played at hopscotch scraped the gutters stole a little but like cats and sparrows gayly laughed when he was called a rogue and got angry when called a thief 
 he had no shelter no bread no fire no love but he was merry because he was free 
 when these poor creatures grow to be men the millstones of the social order meet them and crush them but so long as they are children they escape because of their smallness 
 the tiniest hole saves them 
 nevertheless abandoned as this child was it sometimes happened every two or three months that he said come go and see mamma then he quitted the boulevard the cirque the porte descended to the quays crossed the bridges reached the suburbs arrived at the salpetriere and came to a halt where 
 precisely at that double number with which the reader is acquainted at the gorbeau hovel 
 at that epoch the hovel generally deserted and eternally decorated with the placard 
 chambers to let chanced to be a rare thing inhabited by numerous individuals who however as is always the case in paris had no connection with each other all belonged to that indigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of petty bourgeoisie in straitened circumstances and which extends from misery to misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beings in whom all the material things of civilization end the who sweeps up the mud and the ragpicker who collects scraps 
 the principal lodger of jean day was dead and had been replaced by another exactly like her 
 i know not what philosopher has said 
 old women are never lacking 
 this new old woman was named madame bourgon and had nothing remarkable about her life except a dynasty of three paroquets who had reigned in succession over her soul 
 the most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family of four persons consisting of father mother and two daughters already well grown all four of whom were lodged in the same attic one of the cells which we have already mentioned 
 at first sight this family presented no very special feature except its extreme destitution the father when he hired the chamber had stated that his name was jondrette 
 some time after his moving in which had borne a singular resemblance to the entrance of nothing at all to borrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant this jondrette had said to the woman who like her predecessor was at the same time portress and mother if any one should chance to come and inquire for a pole or an italian or even a spaniard perchance it is i 
 this family was that of the merry barefoot boy 
 he arrived there and found distress and what is still sadder no smile a cold hearth and cold hearts 
 when he entered he was asked whence come you 
 he replied 
 from the street 
 when he went away they asked him 
 whither are you going 
 he replied into the streets 
 his mother said to him 
 what did you come here for 
 this child lived in this absence of affection like the pale plants which spring up in cellars 
 it did not cause him suffering and he blamed no one 
 he did not know exactly how a father and mother should be 
 nevertheless his mother loved his sisters 
 we have forgotten to mention that on the boulevard du temple this child was called little gavroche 
 why was he called little gavroche 
 probably because his name was jondrette 
 it seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the thread 
 the chamber which the jondrettes inhabited in the gorbeau hovel was the last at the end of the corridor 
 the cell next to it was occupied by a very poor young man who was called m marius 
 let us explain who this m marius was

 anatole had lately moved to the plan for natalie abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by dolokhov a few days before and on the day that sonya after listening at door resolved to safeguard her it was to have been put into execution natasha had promised to come out to kuragin at the back porch at ten that evening kuragin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of kamenka where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them at kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to the warsaw highroad and from there they would hasten abroad with post horses 
 anatole had a passport an order for post horses ten thousand rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with help 
 two witnesses for the mock marriage khvostikov a retired petty official whom dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions and makarin a retired hussar a kindly weak fellow who had an unbounded affection for kuragin were sitting at tea in front room 
 in his large study the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with persian rugs bearskins and weapons sat dolokhov in a traveling cloak and high boots at an open desk on which lay abacus and some bundles of paper money anatole with uniform unbuttoned walked to and fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting through the study to the room behind where his french valet and others were packing the last of his things dolokhov was counting the money and noting something down 
 well he said khvostikov must have two thousand 
 give it to him then said anatole 
 makarka their name for makarin will go through fire and water for you for nothing so here are our accounts all settled said dolokhov showing him the memorandum is that right 
 yes of course returned anatole evidently not listening to dolokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his face 
 dolokhov banged down the or of his and turned to anatole with an ironic smile 
 do you know really better drop it all still time 
 fool retorted anatole talk nonsense if you only knew the devil knows what 
 no really give it up said dolokhov i am speaking seriously no joke this plot hatched 
 what teasing again go to the devil eh said anatole making a grimace really no time for your stupid jokes and he left the room 
 dolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when anatole had gone out 
 you wait a bit he called after him not joking talking sense come here come here 
 anatole returned and looked at dolokhov trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily 
 now listen to me telling you this for the last time why should i joke about it did i hinder you who arranged everything for you who found the priest and got the passport who raised the money i did it all 
 well thank you for it do you think i am not grateful and anatole sighed and embraced dolokhov 
 i helped you but all the same i must tell you the truth it is a dangerous business and if you think about it a stupid business well carry her off all right will they let it stop at that it will come out that already married why have you in the criminal court 
 oh nonsense nonsense anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace i explain to you what and anatole with the partiality people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning repeated the argument he had already put to dolokhov a hundred times i explain to you that i have come to this conclusion if this marriage is invalid he went on crooking one finger then i have nothing to answer for but if it is valid no matter abroad no one will know anything about it that so and talk to me 
 seriously better drop it only get yourself into a mess 
 go to the devil cried anatole and clutching his hair left the room but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of dolokhov with his feet turned under him the very devil what feel how it beats he took hand and put it on his heart what a foot my dear fellow what a glance a goddess he added in french what 
 dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes looked at him evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him 
 well and when the gone what then 
 what then eh repeated anatole sincerely perplexed by a thought of the future what then then i know but why talk nonsense he glanced at his watch time 
 anatole went into the back room 
 now then nearly ready dawdling he shouted to the servants 
 dolokhov put away the money called a footman whom he ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey and went into the room where khvostikov and makarin were sitting 
 anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself 
 come and eat something have a drink dolokhov shouted to him from the other room 
 i want to answered anatole continuing to smile 
 come balaga is here 
 anatole rose and went into the dining room balaga was a famous troyka driver who had known dolokhov and anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas more than once when regiment was stationed at tver he had taken him from tver in the evening brought him to moscow by daybreak and driven him back again the next night more than once he had enabled dolokhov to escape when pursued more than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies and ladykins as he called the cocottes more than once in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by my gentlemen as he called them he had ruined more than one horse in their service more than once they had beaten him and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and madeira which he loved and he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to siberia they often called balaga into their orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies and more than one thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands in their service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year and in their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy but he liked them liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian and flying at full gallop through the moscow streets he liked to hear those wild tipsy shouts behind him get on get on when it was impossible to go any faster he liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who more dead than alive was already hurrying out of his way real gentlemen he considered them 
 anatole and dolokhov liked balaga too for his masterly driving and because he liked the things they liked with others balaga bargained charging rubles for a two hours drive and rarely drove himself generally letting his young men do so but with his gentlemen he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work only a couple of times a year when he knew from their valets that they had money in hand he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him the gentlemen always made him sit down 
 do help me out theodore ivanych sir or your excellency he would say i am quite out of horses let me have what you can to go to the fair 
 and anatole and dolokhov when they had money would give him a thousand or a couple of thousand rubles 
 balaga was a short and peasant of about with a particularly red thick neck glittering little eyes and a small beard he wore a fine cloth coat over a sheepskin 
 on entering the room now he crossed himself turning toward the front corner of the room and went up to dolokhov holding out a small black hand 
 theodore ivanych he said bowing 
 how do friend well here he is 
 good day your excellency he said again holding out his hand to anatole who had just come in 
 i say balaga said anatole putting his hands on the shoulders do you care for me or not eh now do me a service what horses have you come with eh 
 as your messenger ordered your special beasts replied balaga 
 well listen balaga drive all three to death but get me there in three hours eh 
 when they are dead what shall i drive said balaga with a wink 
 mind smash your face in make jokes cried anatole suddenly rolling his eyes 
 why joke said the driver laughing as if grudge my gentlemen anything as fast as ever the horses can gallop so fast go 
 ah said anatole well sit down 
 yes sit down said dolokhov 
 stand theodore ivanych 
 sit down nonsense have a drink said anatole and filled a large glass of madeira for him 
 the eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine after refusing it for manners sake he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap 
 and when are we to start your excellency 
 well anatole looked at his watch start at once mind balaga get there in time eh 
 that depends on our luck in starting else why we be there in time replied balaga we get you to tver in seven hours i think you remember that your excellency 
 do you know one christmas i drove from tver said anatole smilingly at the recollection and turning to makarin who gazed rapturously at him with eyes will you believe it makarka it took breath away the rate we flew we came across a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them eh 
 those were horses balaga continued the tale that time harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts he went on turning to dolokhov will you believe it theodore ivanych those animals flew forty miles i hold them in my hands grew numb in the sharp frost so that i threw down the reins catch hold yourself your excellency says i and i just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled there it a case of urging them on there was no holding them in till we reached the place the devils took us there in three hours only the near one died of it

 ninety years and teeth 
 in the rue boucherat rue de normandie and the rue de saintonge there still exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved the memory of a worthy man named m gillenormand and who mention him with complaisance 
 this good man was old when they were young this silhouette has not yet entirely those who regard with melancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past from the labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the temple to which under louis xiv the names of all the provinces of france were appended exactly as in our day the streets of the new tivoli quarter have received the names of all the capitals of europe a progression by the way in which progress is visible 
 who was as much alive as possible in was one of those men who had become curiosities to be viewed simply because they have lived a long time and who are strange because they formerly resembled everybody and now resemble nobody he was a peculiar old man and in very truth a man of another age the real complete and rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century who wore his good old bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates 
 he was over ninety years of age his walk was erect he talked loudly saw clearly drank neat ate slept and snored 
 he had all of his teeth he only wore spectacles when he read 
 he was of an amorous disposition but declared that for the last ten years he had wholly and decidedly renounced women 
 he could no longer please he said he did not add 
 i am too old but 
 i am too poor 
 he said if i were not 
 all he had left in fact was an income of about fifteen thousand francs 
 his dream was to come into an inheritance and to have a hundred thousand livres income for mistresses 
 he did not belong as the reader will perceive to that puny variety of octogenaries who like m de voltaire have been dying all their life his was no longevity of a cracked pot this jovial old man had always had good health 
 he was superficial rapid easily angered 
 he flew into a passion at everything generally quite contrary to all reason 
 when contradicted he raised his cane he beat people as he had done in the great century he had a daughter over fifty years of age and unmarried whom he chastised severely with his tongue when in a rage and whom he would have liked to whip 
 she seemed to him to be eight years old he boxed his servants ears soundly and said 
 ah carogne one of his oaths was 
 by the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade he had singular freaks of tranquillity he had himself shaved every day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him being jealous of m gillenormand on account of his wife a pretty and coquettish barberess 
 m gillenormand admired his own discernment in all things and declared that he was extremely sagacious here is one of his sayings 
 i have in truth some penetration i am able to say when a flea bites me from what woman it came 
 the words which he uttered the most frequently were 
 the sensible man and nature 
 he did not give to this last word the grand acceptation which our epoch has accorded to it but he made it enter after his own fashion into his little satires nature he said in order that civilization may have a little of everything gives it even specimens of its amusing barbarism europe possesses specimens of asia and africa on a small scale the cat is a tiger the lizard is a pocket crocodile the dancers at the opera are pink female savages 
 they do not eat men they crunch them or magicians that they are they transform them into oysters and swallow them 
 the caribbeans leave only the bones they leave only the shell 
 such are our morals 
 we do not devour we gnaw we do not exterminate we claw

 anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt and a sable cap jauntily set on one side and very becoming to his handsome face having looked in a mirror and standing before dolokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it he lifted a glass of wine 
 well theodore thank you for everything and farewell said anatole well comrades and friends he considered for a moment of my youth farewell he said turning to makarin and the others 
 though they were all going with him anatole evidently wished to make something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades he spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed one leg 
 all take glasses you too balaga well comrades and friends of my youth had our fling and lived and reveled eh and now when shall we meet again i am going abroad we have had a good time now farewell lads to our health hurrah he cried and emptying his glass flung it on the floor 
 to your health said balaga who also emptied his glass and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief 
 makarin embraced anatole with tears in his eyes 
 ah prince how sorry i am to part from you 
 go go cried anatole 
 balaga was about to leave the room 
 no stop said anatole shut the door we have first to sit down the way 
 they shut the door and all sat down 
 now quick march lads said anatole rising 
 joseph his valet handed him his sabretache and saber and they all went out into the vestibule 
 and the fur cloak asked dolokhov hey ignatka go to matrena matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak i have heard what elopements are like continued dolokhov with a wink why rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing if you delay at all be tears and papa and mamma and frozen in a minute and must go back but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh 
 the valet brought a cloak 
 fool i told you the sable one hey matrena the sable he shouted so that his voice rang far through the rooms 
 a handsome slim and gypsy girl with glittering black eyes and curly hair wearing a red shawl ran out with a sable mantle on her arm 
 here i grudge it take it she said evidently afraid of her master and yet regretful of her cloak 
 dolokhov without answering took the cloak threw it over matrena and wrapped her up in it 
 the way said dolokhov and then so and he turned the collar up round her head leaving only a little of the face uncovered and then so do you see and he pushed head forward to meet the gap left by the collar through which brilliant smile was seen 
 well matrena said anatole kissing her ah my revels here are over remember me to steshka there matrena wish me luck 
 well prince may god give you great luck said matrena in her gypsy accent 
 two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were holding the horses balaga took his seat in the front one and holding his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately anatole and dolokhov got in with him makarin khvostikov and a valet seated themselves in the other sleigh 
 well are you ready asked balaga 
 go he cried twisting the reins round his hands and the troyka tore down the nikitski boulevard 
 tproo get out of the way hi tproo the shouting of balaga and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be heard on the arbat square the troyka caught against a carriage something cracked shouts were heard and the troyka flew along the arbat street 
 after taking a turn along the podnovinski boulevard balaga began to rein in and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old konyusheny street 
 the young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and anatole and dolokhov went along the pavement when they reached the gate dolokhov whistled the whistle was answered and a maidservant ran out 
 come into the courtyard or be seen come out directly said she 
 dolokhov stayed by the gate anatole followed the maid into the courtyard turned the corner and ran up into the porch 
 he was met by gabriel marya gigantic footman 
 come to the mistress please said the footman in his deep bass intercepting any retreat 
 to what mistress who are you asked anatole in a breathless whisper 
 kindly step in my orders are to bring you in 
 kuragin come back shouted dolokhov betrayed back 
 dolokhov after anatole entered had remained at the wicket gate and was struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it with a last desperate effort dolokhov pushed the porter aside and when anatole ran back seized him by the arm pulled him through the wicket and ran back with him to the troyka

 like master like house 
 he lived in the marais rue des no he owned the house 
 this house has since been demolished and rebuilt and the number has probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the streets of paris undergo 
 he occupied an ancient and vast apartment on the first floor between street and gardens furnished to the very ceilings with great gobelins and beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on the he enveloped his bed in a vast screen of coromandel lacquer 
 long full curtains hung from the windows and formed great broken folds that were very magnificent the garden situated immediately under his windows was attached to that one of them which formed the angle by means of a staircase twelve or fifteen steps long which the old gentleman ascended and descended with great agility 
 in addition to a library adjoining his chamber he had a boudoir of which he thought a great deal a gallant and elegant retreat with magnificent hangings of straw with a pattern of flowers and made on the galleys of louis xiv 
 and ordered of his convicts by m de vivonne for his mistress 
 m gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal who had died a centenarian 
 he had had two wives his manners were something between those of the courtier which he had never been and the lawyer which he might have been he was gay and caressing when he had a mind 
 in his youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by their wives and never by their mistresses because they are at the same time the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in existence 
 he was a connoisseur of painting 
 he had in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom painted by jordaens executed with great dashes of the brush with millions of details in a confused and manner 
 m attire was not the habit of louis xiv 
 nor yet that of louis xvi it was that of the incroyables of the directory 
 he had thought himself young up to that period and had followed the fashions his coat was of cloth with voluminous revers a long and large steel buttons 
 with this he wore and buckle shoes 
 he always thrust his hands into his fobs he said authoritatively 
 the french revolution is a heap of blackguards

 marya dmitrievna having found sonya weeping in the corridor made her confess everything and intercepting the note to natasha she read it and went into room with it in her hand 
 you shameless said she i hear a word 
 pushing back natasha who looked at her with astonished but tearless eyes she locked her in and having given orders to the yard porter to admit the persons who would be coming that evening but not to let them out again and having told the footman to bring them up to her she seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors 
 when gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run away again she rose frowning and clasping her hands behind her paced through the rooms a long time considering what she should do toward midnight she went to room fingering the key in her pocket sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor marya dmitrievna for sake let me in to her she pleaded but marya dmitrievna unlocked the door and went in without giving her an answer disgusting abominable in my house horrid girl hussy only sorry for her father thought she trying to restrain her wrath hard as it may be tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the count she entered the room with resolute steps natasha lying on the sofa her head hidden in her hands and she did not stir she was in just the same position in which marya dmitrievna had left her 
 a nice girl very nice said marya dmitrievna arranging meetings with lovers in my house no use pretending you listen when i speak to you and marya dmitrievna touched her arm listen when when i speak disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies treat you differently but sorry for your father so i will conceal it 
 natasha did not change her position but her whole body heaved with noiseless convulsive sobs which choked her marya dmitrievna glanced round at sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside natasha 
 lucky for him that he escaped me but find him she said in her rough voice do you hear what i am saying or not she added 
 she put her large hand under face and turned it toward her both marya dmitrievna and sonya were amazed when they saw how natasha looked her eyes were dry and glistening her lips compressed her cheeks sunken 
 let me be what is it to me i shall die she muttered wrenching herself from marya hands with a vicious effort and sinking down again into her former position 
 natalie said marya dmitrievna i wish for your good lie still stay like that then i touch you but listen i tell you how guilty you are you know that yourself but when your father comes back tomorrow what am i to tell him eh 
 again body shook with sobs 
 suppose he finds out and your brother and your betrothed 
 i have no betrothed i have refused him cried natasha 
 all the same continued dmitrievna if they hear of this will they let it pass he your father i know him if he challenges him to a duel will that be all right eh 
 oh let me be why have you interfered at all why why who asked you to shouted natasha raising herself on the sofa and looking malignantly at marya dmitrievna 
 but what did you want cried marya dmitrievna growing angry again were you kept under lock and key who hindered his coming to the house why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl well if he had carried you off do you think they have found him your father or brother or your betrothed and a scoundrel a wretch a fact 
 he is better than any of you exclaimed natasha getting up if you interfered oh my god what is it all what is it sonya why go away 
 and she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned marya dmitrievna was to speak again but natasha cried out 
 go away go away you all hate and despise me and she threw herself back on the sofa 
 marya dmitrievna went on admonishing her for some time enjoining on her that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody would know anything about it if only natasha herself would undertake to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened natasha did not reply nor did she sob any longer but she grew cold and had a shivering fit marya dmitrievna put a pillow under her head covered her with two quilts and herself brought her some water but natasha did not respond to her 
 well let her sleep said marya dmitrievna as she went of the room supposing natasha to be asleep 
 but natasha was not asleep with pale face and fixed eyes she looked straight before her all that night she did not sleep or weep and did not speak to sonya who got up and went to her several times 
 next day count rostov returned from his estate near moscow in time for lunch as he had promised he was in very good spirits the affair with the purchaser was going on satisfactorily and there was nothing to keep him any longer in moscow away from the countess whom he missed marya dmitrievna met him and told him that natasha had been very unwell the day before and that they had sent for the doctor but that she was better now natasha had not left her room that morning with compressed and parched lips and dry fixed eyes she sat at the window uneasily watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at anyone who entered the room she was evidently expecting news of him and that he would come or would write to her 
 when the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound of a footstep and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent expression she did not even get up to greet him what is the matter with you my angel are you ill asked the count 
 after a silence natasha answered yes ill 
 in reply to the anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed she assured him that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry marya dmitrievna confirmed assurances that nothing had happened from the pretense of illness from his distress and by the embarrassed faces of sonya and marya dmitrievna the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during his absence but it was so terrible for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved daughter and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity that he avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly had happened and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their return to the country

 at the age of sixteen one evening at the opera he had had the honor to be stared at through by two beauties at the same and celebrated beauties then and sung by voltaire the camargo and the salle 
 caught between two fires he had beaten a heroic retreat towards a little dancer a young girl named nahenry who was sixteen like himself obscure as a cat and with whom he was in love 
 he abounded in memories 
 he was accustomed to exclaim how pretty she the last time i saw her at longchamps her hair curled in sustained sentiments with her of turquoises her gown of the color of persons newly arrived and her little agitation muff he had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat of which he was fond of talking about effusively 
 i was dressed like a turk of the levant levantin said he 
 madame de boufflers having seen him by chance when he was twenty had described him as a charming fool 
 he was horrified by all the names which he saw in politics and in power regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois he read the journals the newspapers the gazettes as he said stifling outbursts of laughter the while 
 oh he said what people these are 
 corbiere 
 humann 
 casimir perier a minister for you 
 i can imagine this in a journal m gillenorman minister that would be a farce 
 well 
 they are so stupid that it would pass he merrily called everything by its name whether decent or indecent and did not restrain himself in the least before ladies 
 he uttered coarse speeches obscenities and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant it was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of his century it is to be noted that the age of periphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose 
 his had predicted that he would turn out a man of genius and had bestowed on him these two significant names

 from the day his wife arrived in moscow pierre had been intending to go away somewhere so as not to be near her soon after the rostovs came to moscow the effect natasha had on him made him hasten to carry out his intention he went to tver to see joseph widow who had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased 
 when he returned to moscow pierre was handed a letter from marya dmitrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great importance relating to andrew bolkonski and his betrothed pierre had been avoiding natasha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her was stronger than a married should be for his fiancee yet some fate constantly threw them together 
 what can have happened and what can they want with me thought he as he dressed to go to marya if only prince andrew would hurry up and come and marry her thought he on his way to the house 
 on the tverskoy boulevard a familiar voice called to him 
 pierre been back long someone shouted pierre raised his head in a sleigh drawn by two gray that were bespattering the dashboard with snow anatole and his constant companion makarin dashed past anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military dandies the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his head slightly bent his face was fresh and rosy his hat tilted to one side disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled with powdery snow 
 yes indeed a true sage thought pierre he sees nothing beyond the pleasure of the moment nothing troubles him and so he is always cheerful satisfied and serene what i give to be like him he thought enviously 
 in marya anteroom the footman who helped him off with his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom 
 when he opened the ballroom door pierre saw natasha sitting at the window with a thin pale and spiteful face she glanced round at him frowned and left the room with an expression of cold dignity 
 what has happened asked pierre entering marya room 
 fine doings answered dmitrievna for years have i lived in this world and never known anything so disgraceful 
 and having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him marya dmitrievna informed him that natasha had refused prince andrew without her parents knowledge and that the cause of this was anatole kuragin into whose society wife had thrown her and with whom natasha had tried to elope during her absence in order to be married secretly 
 pierre raised his shoulders and listened to what was told him scarcely able to believe his own ears that prince deeply loved affianced wife the same natasha rostova who used to be so charming should give up bolkonski for that fool anatole who was already secretly married as pierre knew and should be so in love with him as to agree to run away with him was something pierre could not conceive and could not imagine 
 he could not reconcile the charming impression he had of natasha whom he had known from a child with this new conception of her baseness folly and cruelty he thought of his wife they are all alike he said to himself reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman but still he pitied prince andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with disgust of that natasha who had just passed him in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity he did not know that soul was overflowing with despair shame and humiliation and that it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity and severity 
 but how get married said pierre in answer to marya dmitrievna he could not marry he is married 
 things get worse from hour to hour ejaculated marya dmitrievna a nice youth what a scoundrel and expecting him expecting him since yesterday she must be told then at least she go on expecting him 
 after hearing the details of marriage from pierre and giving vent to her anger against anatole in words of abuse marya dmitrievna told pierre why she had sent for him she was afraid that the count or bolkonski who might arrive at any moment if they knew of this affair which she hoped to hide from them might challenge anatole to a duel and she therefore asked pierre to tell his in her name to leave moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again pierre only now realizing the danger to the old count nicholas and prince andrew promised to do as she wished having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him she let him go to the drawing room 
 mind the count knows nothing behave as if you know nothing either she said and i will go and tell her it is no use expecting him and stay to dinner if you care to she called after pierre 
 pierre met the old count who seemed nervous and upset that morning natasha had told him that she had rejected bolkonski 
 troubles troubles my dear fellow he said to pierre what troubles one has with these girls without their mother i do so regret having come here i will be frank with you have you heard she has broken off her engagement without consulting anybody true this engagement never was much to my liking of course he is an excellent man but still with his disapproval they have been happy and natasha lack suitors still it has been going on so long and to take such a step without or consent and now ill and god knows what hard count hard to manage daughters in their absence 
 pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the subject but the count returned to his troubles 
 sonya entered the room with an agitated face 
 natasha is not quite well in her room and would like to see you marya dmitrievna is with her and she too asks you to come 
 yes you are a great friend of no doubt she wants to send him a message said the count oh dear oh dear how happy it all was 
 and clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the room 
 when marya dmitrievna told natasha that anatole was married natasha did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by pierre himself sonya told pierre this as she led him along the corridor to room 
 natasha pale and stern was sitting beside marya dmitrievna and her eyes glittering feverishly met pierre with a questioning look the moment he entered she did not smile or nod but only gazed fixedly at him and her look asked only one thing was he a friend or 
 like the others an enemy in regard to anatole as for pierre he evidently did not exist for her 
 he knows all about it said marya dmitrievna pointing to pierre and addressing natasha let him tell you whether i have told the truth 
 natasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen 
 natalya ilynichna pierre began dropping his eyes with a feeling of pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do whether it is true or not should make no difference to you because 
 then it is not true that married 
 yes it is true 
 has he been married long she asked on your honor 
 pierre gave his word of honor 
 is he still here she asked quickly 
 yes i have just seen him 
 she was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that they should leave her alone

 a centenarian aspirant 
 he had taken prizes in his boyhood at the college of moulins where he was born and he had been crowned by the hand of the duc de nivernais whom he called the duc de nevers 
 neither the convention nor the death of louis xvi nor the napoleon nor the return of the bourbons nor anything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning the duc de nevers was in his eyes the great figure of the century what a charming grand seigneur he said and what a fine air he had with his blue ribbon 
 in the eyes of m gillenormand catherine the second had made reparation for the crime of the partition of poland by purchasing for three thousand roubles the secret of the elixir of gold from bestucheff he grew animated on this subject 
 the elixir of gold he exclaimed the yellow dye of bestucheff general drops in the eighteenth was the great remedy for the catastrophes of love the panacea against venus at one louis the phial louis xv 
 sent two hundred phials of it to the pope 
 he would have been greatly irritated and thrown off his balance had any one told him that the elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron m gillenormand adored the bourbons and had a horror of he was forever narrating in what manner he had saved himself during the terror and how he had been obliged to display a vast deal of gayety and cleverness ins order to escape having his head cut off if any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the republic in his presence he turned purple and grew so angry that he was on the point of swooning

 pierre did not stay for dinner but left the room and went away at once he drove through the town seeking anatole kuragin at the thought of whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in breathing he was not at the ice hills nor at the gypsies nor at pierre drove to the club in the club all was going on as usual the members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about in groups they greeted pierre and spoke of the town news the footman having greeted him knowing his habits and his acquaintances told him there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that prince michael zakharych was in the library but paul timofeevich had not yet arrived one of acquaintances while they were talking about the weather asked if he had heard of abduction of rostova which was talked of in the town and was it true pierre laughed and said it was nonsense for he had just come from the rostovs he asked everyone about anatole one man told him he had not come yet and another that he was coming to dinner pierre felt it strange to see this calm indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his soul he paced through the ballroom waited till everyone had come and as anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home 
 anatole for whom pierre was looking dined that day with dolokhov consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair it seemed to him essential to see natasha in the evening he drove to his to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting when pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over moscow his valet informed him that prince anatole was with the countess the countess drawing room was full of guests 
 pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever entered the drawing room and seeing anatole went up to him 
 ah pierre said the countess going up to her husband you know what a plight our anatole 
 she stopped seeing in the forward thrust of her head in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with dolokhov 
 where you are there is vice and evil said pierre to his wife anatole come with me i must speak to you he added in french 
 anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively ready to follow pierre pierre taking him by the arm pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room 
 if you allow yourself in my drawing room whispered helene but pierre did not reply and went out of the room 
 anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety 
 having entered his study pierre closed the door and addressed anatole without looking at him 
 you promised countess rostova to marry her and were about to elope with her is that so 
 mon cher answered anatole their whole conversation was in french i consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone 
 face already pale became distorted by fury he seized anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side to side till face showed a sufficient degree of terror 
 when i tell you that i must talk to you repeated pierre 
 come now this is stupid what said anatole fingering a button of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth 
 a scoundrel and a blackguard and i know what deprives me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this said pierre expressing himself so artificially because he was talking french 
 he took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly but at once put it back in its place 
 did you promise to marry her 
 i i think of it i never promised because 
 pierre interrupted him 
 have you any letters of hers any letters he said moving toward anatole 
 anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out his pocketbook 
 pierre took the letter anatole handed him and pushing aside a table that stood in his way threw himself on the sofa 
 i be violent be afraid said pierre in answer to a frightened gesture of first the letters said he as if repeating a lesson to himself secondly he continued after a short pause again rising and again pacing the room tomorrow you must get out of moscow 
 but how can i 
 thirdly pierre continued without listening to him you must never breathe a word of what has passed between you and countess rostova i know i prevent your doing so but if you have a spark of conscience pierre paced the room several times in silence 
 anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips 
 after all you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such a thing as other happiness and peace and that you are ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself amuse yourself with women like my wife with them you are within your rights for they know what you want of them they are armed against you by the same experience of debauchery but to promise a maid to marry her to deceive to kidnap you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man or a child 
 pierre paused and looked at anatole no longer with an angry but with a questioning look 
 i know about that eh said anatole growing more confident as pierre mastered his wrath i know that and want to he said not looking at pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw but you have used such words to me mean and so on which as a man of honor i allow anyone to use 
 pierre glanced at him with amazement unable to understand what he wanted 
 though it was anatole continued still i 
 is it satisfaction you want said pierre ironically 
 you could at least take back your words what if you want me to do as you wish eh 
 i take them back i take them back said pierre and i ask you to forgive me pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button and if you require money for your journey 
 anatole smiled the expression of that base and cringing smile which pierre knew so well in his wife revolted him 
 oh vile and heartless brood he exclaimed and left the room 
 next day anatole left for petersburg

 basque and nicolette 
 he had theories 
 here is one of them 
 when a man is passionately fond of women and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little who is homely cross legitimate with plenty of rights perched on the code and jealous at need there is but one way of extricating himself from the quandry and of procuring peace and that is to let his wife control the this abdication sets him free 
 then his wife busies herself grows passionately fond of handling coin gets her fingers covered with verdigris in the process undertakes the education of tenants and the training of farmers convokes lawyers presides over notaries harangues scriveners visits limbs of the law follows lawsuits draws up leases dictates contracts feels herself the sovereign sells buys regulates promises and compromises binds fast and annuls yields concedes and retrocedes arranges disarranges hoards lavishes she commits follies a supreme and personal delight and that consoles her 
 while her husband disdains her she has the satisfaction of ruining her husband this theory m gillenormand had himself applied and it had become his history 
 his second administered his fortune in such a manner that one fine day when m gillenormand found himself a widower there remained to him just sufficient to live on by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity of fifteen thousand francs of which would expire with him he had not hesitated on this point not being anxious to leave a property behind him 
 besides he had noticed that patrimonies are subject to adventures and for instance become national property he had been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents and he had no great faith in the great book of the public debt all the rue quincampois he said 
 his house in the rue belonged to him as we have already stated he had two servants a male and a female 
 when a servant entered his establishment m gillenormand him 
 he bestowed on the men the name of their province 
 nimois comtois poitevin picard his last valet was a big foundered fellow of who was incapable of running twenty paces but as he had been born at bayonne m gillenormand called him basque 
 all the female servants in his house were called nicolette even the magnon of whom we shall hear more farther on one day a haughty cook a cordon bleu of the lofty race of porters presented herself how much wages do you want a month asked m gillenormand thirty francs 
 what is your name

 you shall have fifty francs and you shall be called nicolette

 pierre drove to marya to tell her of the fulfillment of her wish that kuragin should be banished from moscow the whole house was in a state of alarm and commotion natasha was very ill having as marya dmitrievna told him in secret poisoned herself the night after she had been told that anatole was married with some arsenic she had stealthily procured after swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she woke sonya and told her what she had done the necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was now out of danger though still so weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country and so the countess had been sent for pierre saw the distracted count and sonya who had a face but he could not see natasha 
 pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about the attempted abduction of rostova he resolutely denied these rumors assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his had proposed to her and been refused it seemed to pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and reputation 
 he was awaiting prince return with dread and went every day to the old for news of him 
 old prince bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town from mademoiselle bourienne and had read the note to princess mary in which natasha had broken off her engagement he seemed in better spirits than usual and awaited his son with great impatience 
 some days after departure pierre received a note from prince andrew informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him 
 as soon as he reached moscow prince andrew had received from his father note to princess mary breaking off her engagement mademoiselle bourienne had purloined it from princess mary and given it to the old prince and he heard from him the story of elopement with additions 
 prince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre came to see him next morning pierre expected to find prince andrew in almost the same state as natasha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some intrigue going on in petersburg the old voice and another now and then interrupted him princess mary came out to meet pierre she sighed looking toward the door of the room where prince andrew was evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow but pierre saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news of faithlessness 
 he says he expected it she remarked i know his pride will not let him express his feelings but still he has taken it better far better than i expected evidently it had to be 
 but is it possible that all is really ended asked pierre 
 princess mary looked at him with astonishment she did not understand how he could ask such a question pierre went into the study prince andrew greatly changed and plainly in better health but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows stood in civilian dress facing his father and prince meshcherski warmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating the conversation was about speranski the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached moscow 
 now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a month ago prince andrew was saying and by those who were unable to understand his aims to judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of other mistakes is very easy but i maintain that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him by him alone 
 he paused at the sight of pierre his face quivered and immediately assumed a vindictive expression 
 posterity will do him justice he concluded and at once turned to pierre 
 well how are you still getting stouter he said with animation but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened yes i am well he said in answer to question and smiled 
 to pierre that smile said plainly i am well but my health is now of no use to anyone 
 after a few words to pierre about the awful roads from the polish frontier about people he had met in switzerland who knew pierre and about m dessalles whom he had brought from abroad to be his tutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about speranski which was still going on between the two old men 
 if there were treason or proofs of secret relations with napoleon they would have been made public he said with warmth and haste i do not and never did like speranski personally but i like justice 
 pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too familiar to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate when prince meshcherski had left prince andrew took arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him a bed had been made up there and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about prince andrew went to one and took out a small casket from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper he did it all silently and very quickly he stood up and coughed his face was gloomy and his lips compressed 
 forgive me for troubling you 
 pierre saw that prince andrew was going to speak of natasha and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy this expression irritated prince andrew and in a determined ringing and unpleasant tone he continued 
 i have received a refusal from countess rostova and have heard reports of your having sought her hand or something of that kind is that true 
 both true and untrue pierre began but prince andrew interrupted him 
 here are her letters and her portrait said he 
 he took the packet from the table and handed it to pierre 
 give this to the countess if you see her 
 she is very ill said pierre 
 then she is here still said prince andrew and prince kuragin he added quickly 
 he left long ago she has been at door 
 i much regret her illness said prince andrew and he smiled like his father coldly maliciously and unpleasantly 
 so monsieur kuragin has not honored countess rostova with his hand said prince andrew and he snorted several times 
 he could not marry for he was married already said pierre 
 prince andrew laughed disagreeably again reminding one of his father 
 and where is your now if i may ask he said 
 he has gone to peters but i know said pierre 
 well it matter said prince andrew tell countess rostova that she was and is perfectly free and that i wish her all that is good 
 pierre took the packet prince andrew as if trying to remember whether he had something more to say or waiting to see if pierre would say anything looked fixedly at him 
 i say do you remember our discussion in petersburg asked pierre about 
 yes returned prince andrew hastily i said that a fallen woman should be forgiven but i say i could forgive her i 
 but can this be compared said pierre 
 prince andrew interrupted him and cried sharply yes ask her hand again be magnanimous and so on yes that would be very noble but i am unable to follow in that footsteps if you wish to be my friend never speak to me of that of all that well so give her the packet 
 pierre left the room and went to the old prince and princess mary 
 the old man seemed livelier than usual princess mary was the same as always but beneath her sympathy for her brother pierre noticed her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off looking at them pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the rostovs and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of her who could give up prince andrew for anyone else 
 at dinner the talk turned on the war the approach of which was becoming evident prince andrew talked incessantly arguing now with his father now with the swiss tutor dessalles and showing an unnatural animation the cause of which pierre so well understood

 indignation and uproar in the establishment and whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that what audacity 
 what an abominable calumny 
 m gillenormand himself was not at all enraged 
 he gazed at the brat with the amiable smile of a good man who is flattered by the calumny and said in an aside well what now 
 the matter 
 you are finely taken aback and really you are excessively ignorant

 he sent the two brats back to their mother promising to pay eighty francs a month for their maintenance on the condition that the said mother would not do so any more

 that same evening pierre went to the rostovs to fulfill the commission entrusted to him natasha was in bed the count at the club and pierre after giving the letters to sonya went to marya dmitrievna who was interested to know how prince andrew had taken the news ten minutes later sonya came to marya dmitrievna 
 natasha insists on seeing count peter kirilovich said she 
 but how are we to take him up to her the room there has not been tidied up 
 no she has dressed and gone into the drawing room said sonya 
 marya dmitrievna only shrugged her shoulders 
 when will her mother come she has worried me to death now mind tell her everything said she to pierre one the heart to scold her she is so much to be pitied so much to be pitied 
 natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room emaciated with a pale set face but not at all shamefaced as pierre expected to find her when he appeared at the door she grew flurried evidently undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up 
 pierre hastened to her he thought she would give him her hand as usual but she stepping up to him stopped breathing heavily her arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing but with quite a different expression of face 
 peter kirilovich she began rapidly prince bolkonski was your friend is your friend she corrected herself it seemed to her that everything that had once been must now be different he told me once to apply to you 
 pierre sniffed as he looked at her but did not speak till then he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her but he now felt so sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach 
 he is here now tell him to for forgive me she stopped and breathed still more quickly but did not shed tears 
 yes i will tell him answered pierre but 
 he did not know what to say 
 natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she had meant 
 no i know all is over she said hurriedly no that can never be only tormented by the wrong i have done him tell him only that i beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything 
 she trembled all over and sat down on a chair 
 a sense of pity he had never before known overflowed heart 
 i will tell him i will tell him everything once more said pierre but i should like to know one thing 
 know what eyes asked 
 i should like to know did you love pierre did not know how to refer to anatole and flushed at the thought of him did you love that bad man 
 call him bad said natasha but i know know at all 
 she began to cry and a still greater sense of pity tenderness and love welled up in pierre he felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed 
 we speak of it any more my dear said pierre and his gentle cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to natasha 
 we speak of it my dear tell him everything but one thing i beg of you consider me your friend and if you want help advice or simply to open your heart to someone not now but when your mind is clearer think of me he took her hand and kissed it i shall be happy if in my power 
 pierre grew confused 
 speak to me like that i am not worth it exclaimed natasha and turned to leave the room but pierre held her hand 
 he knew he had something more to say to her but when he said it he was amazed at his own words 
 stop stop you have your whole life before you said he to her 
 before me no all is over for me she replied with shame and 
 all over he repeated if i were not myself but the handsomest cleverest and best man in the world and were free i would this moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love 
 for the first time for many days natasha wept tears of gratitude and tenderness and glancing at pierre she went out of the room 
 pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him and without finding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh 
 where to now your excellency asked the coachman 
 where to pierre asked himself where can i go now surely not to the club or to pay calls all men seemed so pitiful so poor in comparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in comparison with that softened grateful last look she had given him through her tears 
 home said pierre and despite degrees of frost fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the air with joy 
 it was clear and frosty above the dirty streets above the black roofs stretched the dark starry sky only looking up at the sky did pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised at the entrance to the arbat square an immense expanse of dark starry sky presented itself to his eyes almost in the center of it above the prechistenka boulevard surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth its white light and its long uplifted tail shone the enormous and brilliant comet of l the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of the world in pierre however that comet with its long luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear on the contrary he gazed joyfully his eyes moist with tears at this bright comet which having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space seemed suddenly like an arrow piercing the earth to remain fixed in a chosen spot vigorously holding its tail erect shining and displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars it seemed to pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted soul now blossoming into a new life

 receive no one except in the evening 
 such was m gillenormand who had not lost his hair which was gray rather than which was always dressed in ears 
 to sum up he was venerable in spite of all this 
 he had something of the eighteenth century about him frivolous and great 
 in and during the early years of the restoration m gillenormand who was still was only in the faubourg saint germain rue servandoni near he had only retired to the marais when he quitted society long after attaining the age of eighty 
 and on abandoning society he had immured himself in his habits the principal one and that which was invariable was to keep his door absolutely closed during the day and never to receive any one whatever except in the evening 
 he dined at five and after that his door was open 
 that had been the fashion of his century and he would not swerve from it 
 the day is vulgar said he and deserves only a closed shutter 
 fashionable people only light up their minds when the zenith lights up its stars 
 and he barricaded himself against every one even had it been the king himself this was the antiquated elegance of his day

 from the close of the year intensified arming and concentrating of the forces of western europe began and in these forces millions of men reckoning those transporting and feeding the army moved from the west eastwards to the russian frontier toward which since russian forces had been similarly drawn on the twelfth of june the forces of western europe crossed the russian frontier and war began that is an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes frauds treacheries thefts forgeries issues of false money burglaries incendiarisms and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world but which those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes 
 what produced this extraordinary occurrence what were its causes the historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the wrongs inflicted on the duke of oldenburg the nonobservance of the continental system the ambition of napoleon the firmness of alexander the mistakes of the diplomatists and so on 
 consequently it would only have been necessary for metternich rumyantsev or talleyrand between a levee and an evening party to have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note or for napoleon to have written to alexander my respected brother i consent to restore the duchy to the duke of oldenburg and there would have been no war 
 we can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries it naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by intrigues as in fact he said on the island of st helena it naturally seemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the war was ambition to the duke of oldenburg that the cause of the war was the violence done to him to businessmen that the cause of the way was the continental system which was ruining europe to the generals and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of les bons principes and to the diplomatists of that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between russia and austria in had not been sufficiently well concealed from napoleon and from the awkward wording of memorandum no it is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other reasons the number depending on the endless diversity of points of view presented themselves to the men of that day but to us to posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning these causes seem insufficient to us it is incomprehensible that millions of christian men killed and tortured each other either because napoleon was ambitious or alexander was firm or because policy was astute or the duke of oldenburg wronged we cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence why because the duke was wronged thousands of men from the other side of europe killed and ruined the people of smolensk and moscow and were killed by them 
 to us their descendants who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense an incalculable number of causes present themselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events and by its impotence apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes to occasion the event to us the wish or objection of this or that french corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the vistula and to restore the duchy of oldenburg for had he not wished to serve and had a second a third and a thousandth corporal and private also refused there would have been so many less men in army and the war could not have occurred 
 had napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the vistula and not ordered his troops to advance there would have been no war but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war nor could there have been a war had there been no english intrigues and no duke of oldenburg and had alexander not felt insulted and had there not been an autocratic government in russia or a revolution in france and a subsequent dictatorship and empire or all the things that produced the french revolution and so on without each of these causes nothing could have happened so all these causes myriads of causes coincided to bring it about and so there was no one cause for that occurrence but it had to occur because it had to millions of men renouncing their human feelings and reason had to go from west to east to slay their fellows just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west slaying their fellows 
 the actions of napoleon and alexander on whose words the event seemed to hang were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription this could not be otherwise for in order that the will of napoleon and alexander on whom the event seemed to depend should be carried out the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the event could not have taken place it was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power the soldiers who fired or transported provisions and guns should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes 
 we are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational events that is to say events the reasonableness of which we do not understand the more we try to explain such events in history reasonably the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to us 
 each man lives for himself using his freedom to attain his personal aims and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from doing this or that action but as soon as he has done it that action performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to history in which it has not a free but a predestined significance 
 there are two sides to the life of every man his individual life which is the more free the more abstract its interests and his elemental hive life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him 
 man lives consciously for himself but is an unconscious instrument in the attainment of the historic universal aims of humanity a deed done is irrevocable and its result coinciding in time with the actions of millions of other men assumes an historic significance the higher a man stands on the social ladder the more people he is connected with and the more power he has over others the more evident is the predestination and inevitability of his every action 
 the heart is in the hands of the lord 
 a king is slave 
 history that is the unconscious general hive life of mankind uses every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes 
 though napoleon at that time in was more convinced than ever that it depended on him verser ou ne pas verser le sang de ses peuples as alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him he had never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws which compelled him while thinking that he was acting on his own volition to perform for the hive life that is to say for history whatever had to be performed 
 to shed or not to shed the blood of his peoples 
 the people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men and by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and to produce that movement and war reproaches for the nonobservance of the continental system the duke of wrongs the movement of troops into prussia undertaken as it seemed to napoleon only for the purpose of securing an armed peace the french love and habit of war coinciding with his inclinations allurement by the grandeur of the preparations and the expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages to compensate for that expenditure the intoxicating honors he received in dresden the diplomatic negotiations which in the opinion of contemporaries were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace but which only wounded the of both sides and millions and millions of other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or coincided with it 
 when an apple has ripened and falls why does it fall because of its attraction to the earth because its stalk withers because it is dried by the sun because it grows heavier because the wind shakes it or because the boy standing below wants to eat it 
 nothing is the cause all this is only the coincidence of conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur and the botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it equally right or wrong is he who says that napoleon went to moscow because he wanted to and perished because alexander desired his destruction and he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock in historic events the great men are labels giving names to events and like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself 
 every act of theirs which appears to them an act of their own will is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity

 book great bourgeois 
 chapter viii 
 
 two do not make a pair 
 we have just spoken of m two daughters 
 they had come into the world ten years apart 
 in their youth they had borne very little resemblance to each other either in character or countenance and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible 
 the youngest had a charming soul which turned towards all that belongs to the light was occupied with flowers with verses with music which fluttered away into glorious space enthusiastic ethereal and was wedded from her very youth in ideal to a vague and heroic figure 
 the elder had also her chimera she espied in the azure some very wealthy purveyor a contractor a splendidly stupid husband a million made man or even a prefect the receptions of the prefecture an usher in the antechamber with a chain on his neck official balls the harangues of the to be madame la this had created a whirlwind in her imagination 
 thus the two sisters strayed each in her own dream at the epoch when they were young girls both had wings the one like an angel the other like a goose 
 no ambition is ever fully realized here below at least no paradise becomes terrestrial in our day 
 the younger wedded the man of her dreams but she died 
 the elder did not marry at all 
 at the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are relating she was an antique virtue an incombustible prude with one of the sharpest noses and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possible to see 
 a characteristic detail outside of her immediate family no one had ever known her first name she was called mademoiselle gillenormand the elder 
 in the matter of cant mademoiselle gillenormand could have given points to a miss 
 her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness 
 she cherished a frightful memory of her life one day a man had beheld her garter 
 age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty 
 her guimpe was never sufficiently opaque and never ascended sufficiently high she multiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking 
 the peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in proportion as the fortress is the less menaced 
 nevertheless let him who can explain these antique mysteries of innocence she allowed an officer of the lancers her grand nephew named theodule to embrace her without displeasure 
 in spite of this favored lancer the label 
 prude under which we have classed her suited her to absolute perfection 
 mademoiselle gillenormand was a sort of twilight soul 
 prudery is a and a 
 to prudery she added bigotry a lining 
 she belonged to the society of the virgin wore a white veil on certain festivals mumbled special orisons revered the holy blood venerated the sacred heart remained for hours in contemplation before a altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble and through great rays of gilded wood 
 she had a chapel friend an ancient virgin like herself named mademoiselle vaubois who was a positive blockhead and beside whom mademoiselle gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle 
 beyond the agnus dei and ave maria mademoiselle vaubois had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of making preserves 
 mademoiselle vaubois perfect in her style was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence 
 let us say it plainly mademoiselle gillenormand had gained rather than lost as she grew older 
 this is the case with passive natures she had never been malicious which is relative kindness and then years wear away the angles and the softening which comes with time had come to her 
 she was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herself know the secret 
 there breathed from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished and which had never had a beginning 
 she kept house for her father 
 m gillenormand had his daughter near him as we have seen that monseigneur bienvenu had his sister with him 
 these households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are not rare and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on each other for support 
 there was also in this house between this elderly spinster and this old man a child a little boy who was always trembling and mute in the presence of m gillenormand 
 m gillenormand never addressed this child except in a severe voice and sometimes with uplifted cane 
 here sir rascal scoundrel come here answer me you scamp 
 just let me see you you etc etc 
 he idolized him 
 this was his grandson 
 we shall meet with this child again later on

 chapter ii 
 
 on the of may napoleon left dresden where he had spent three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes dukes kings and even an emperor before leaving napoleon showed favor to the emperor kings and princes who had deserved it reprimanded the kings and princes with whom he was dissatisfied presented pearls and diamonds of his own that is which he had taken from other kings to the empress of austria and having as his historian tells us tenderly embraced the empress marie louise who regarded him as her husband though he had left another wife in paris left her grieved by the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear though the diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end and though the emperor napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexander calling him monsieur mon frere and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always love and honor him yet he set off to join his army and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops from west to east he went in a traveling coach with six horses surrounded by pages and an escort along the road to posen thorn danzig and konigsberg at each of these towns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm 
 the army was moving from west to east and relays of six horses carried him in the same direction on the tenth of june coming up with the army he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on 
 the estate of a polish count in the vilkavisski forest 
 old style 
 next day overtaking the army he went in a carriage to the niemen and changing into a polish uniform he drove to the riverbank in order to select a place for the crossing 
 seeing on the other side some cossacks les cosaques and the steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscow moscou la ville sainte the capital of a realm such as the scythia into which alexander the great had marched napoleon unexpectedly and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations ordered an advance and the next day his army began to cross the niemen 
 early in the morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tent which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen and looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of the vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across the river the troops knowing of the presence were on the lookout for him and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill they threw up their caps and shouted vive and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest that had concealed them and separating flowed on and on by the three bridges to the other side 
 now go into action oh when he takes it in hand himself things get hot by heaven there he is vive so these are the steppes of asia a nasty country all the same au revoir beauche keep the best palace in moscow for you au revoir good luck did you see the emperor vive preur if they make me governor of india gerard make you minister of kashmir settled vive hurrah hurrah hurrah the cossacks those rascals see how they run vive there he is do you see him seen him twice as i see you now the little corporal i saw him give the cross to one of the veterans vive came the voices of men old and young of most diverse characters and social positions on the faces of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on the hill 
 on the thirteenth of june a rather small thoroughbred arab horse was brought to napoleon he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the bridges over the niemen deafened continually by incessant and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the time he joined the army he rode across one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther side turned sharply to the left and galloped in the direction of kovno preceded by enraptured mounted chasseurs of the guard who breathless with delight galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops on reaching the broad river viliya he stopped near a regiment of polish uhlans stationed by the river 
 vivat shouted the poles ecstatically breaking their ranks and pressing against one another to see him 
 napoleon looked up and down the river dismounted and sat down on a log that lay on the bank at a mute sign from him a telescope was handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him and he gazed at the opposite bank then he became absorbed in a map laid out on the logs without lifting his head he said something and two of his galloped off to the polish uhlans 
 what what did he say was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans when one of the rode up to them 
 the order was to find a ford and to cross the river the colonel of the polish uhlans a handsome old man flushed and fumbling in his speech from excitement asked the whether he would be permitted to swim the river with his uhlans instead of seeking a ford in evident fear of refusal like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the eyes the replied that probably the emperor would not be displeased at this excess of zeal 
 as soon as the had said this the old mustached officer with happy face and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted vivat and commanding the uhlans to follow him spurred his horse and galloped into the river he gave an angry thrust to his horse which had grown restive under him and plunged into the water heading for the deepest part where the current was swift hundreds of uhlans galloped in after him it was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the stream and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their horses some of the horses were drowned and some of the men the others tried to swim on some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses manes they tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and though there was a ford one third of a mile away were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing when the having returned and choosing an opportune moment ventured to draw the attention to the devotion of the poles to his person the little man in the gray overcoat got up and having summoned berthier began pacing up and down the bank with him giving him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the drowning uhlans who distracted his attention 
 for him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the world from africa to the steppes of muscovy alike was enough to dumfound people and impel them to insane he called for his horse and rode to his quarters 
 some forty uhlans were drowned in the river though boats were sent to their assistance the majority struggled back to the bank from which they had started the colonel and some of his men got across and with difficulty clambered out on the further bank and as soon as they had got out in their soaked and streaming clothes they shouted vivat and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy 
 that evening between issuing one order that the forged russian paper money prepared for use in russia should be delivered as quickly as possible and another that a saxon should be shot on whom a letter containing information about the orders to the french army had been found napoleon also gave instructions that the polish colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the legion of which napoleon was himself the head

 of atheism 
 i had rather believe all the fables in the legend and the talmud and the alcoran than that this universal frame is without a mind and therefore god never wrought miracle to convince atheism because his ordinary works convince it it is true that a little philosophy inclineth mind to atheism but depth in philosophy bringelh 
 minds about to religion for while the mind of man looketh upon second causes scattered it may sometimes rest in them and go no further but when it beholdeth the chain of them confederate and linked together it must needs fly to providence and deity nay even mat school which is most accused of atheism doth most demonstrate 
 religion that is the school of leucippus and democritus and epicurus 
 for it is a thousand times more credible that four mutable elements and one immutable fifth essence duly and eternally placed needs no god than mat an army of infinite small proportions or seeds unplaced should have produced this order and beauty without 
 a divine marshal 
 the scripture saith the fool hath said in his heart mere is no 
 god it is not said the fool hath thought in his heart so as he rather saith it by rote to himself as that he would have than hat he can thoroughly believe it or be persuaded of it for none deny there is a god but those for whom it maketh that there were no god it appeareth in nothing more mat atheism is radher in die 
 lip man in die heart of man man by this dial atheists will ever be talking of that their opinion as if they fainted in it within themselves and would be glad to be strengthened by me consent of others nay more you shall have atheists strive to get disciples as it faredh with other sects and which is most of all you shall have of mem mat will suffer for adieism and not recant whereas if they did truly 
 think mat mere were no such dung as god why should diey trouble themselves epicurus is charged that he did but dissemble for his sake when he affirmed there were blessed natures but such as enjoyed themselves without having respect to the 
 government of the world 
 wherein they say he did temporise though in secret he 
 thought there was no god but certainly he is traduced for his words are noble and divine non deos vulgi negare profanum sed vulgi opines diis applicare prcfanum 
 plato could have said no more and although he had the confidence to deny the administration he had not the power to deny the nature the indians of the west have names for their particular gods though they have no name for god as if the heathens should have had the names jupiter apollo mars c but not the word deus which shows that even those barbarous people have the notion though they 
 have not the latitude and extent of it so that against atheists the very savages take part with the very subtlest philosophers the contemplative atheist is rare a diagoras a bion a lucian perhaps and some others and yet they seem to be more than they are for that all that impugn a received religion or superstition are by the adverse part branded with the name of atheists 
 but me great atheists indeed are hypocrites which are ever handling holy things but without feeling so as they must needs be cauterised in the end the causes of atheism are divisions in religion if they be many for any one main division addeth zeal to both sides but many divisions introduce atheism 
 another is scandal of priests when it is come to that which st bernard saith mon est ian dicere ut populus sic nes sacerdos a third is custom of profane scoffing in holy 
 matters which doth by little and little deface the reverence of religion and lastly learned times specially with peace and prosperity for troubles and adversities do more bow minds to religion 
 they that deny a god destroy nobility for certainly man is of kin to the beasts by his body and if he be not of kin to god by his spirit he is a base and ignoble creature it destroys likewise magnanimity and the raising of human nature for take an example of a dog and mark what a generosity and courage he will put on when he finds himself maintained by a man who to him is in stead of a god or melior natura which courage is manifestly such as that creature without that confidence of a better nature than his own could never attain 
 so man when he resteth and assureth himself upon divine protection and favour gathereth a force and faith which human nature in itself could not obtain 
 therefore as atheism is in all respects hateful so in this that it depriveth human nature of the means to exalt itself above human frailty as it is in particular persons so it is in nations never was there such a state for magnanimity as rome of this state hear what cicero saith quam volumus licet patres conscripti nos amemus tamen nec numero hispans nec robore gallos mec calliditate poems nec 
 artibus denique hoc ipso huius gentis et terrae domestico nativoque sensu itlos ipsos et latinos sed pietate ac religione atque hac una sapientia quod deorum imortalium numine omnia regi gubernarique perspeximus ormes gentes nationesque superavimus

 chapter i 
 
 the evening of a day of walking 
 early in the month of october about an hour before sunset a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of d the few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness it was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance he was a man of medium stature thickset and robust in the prime of life 
 he might have been or years old a cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face burned and tanned by sun and wind and dripping with perspiration his shirt of coarse yellow linen fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor permitted a view of his hairy breast 
 he had a cravat twisted into a string trousers of blue drilling worn and threadbare white on one knee and torn on the other an old gray tattered blouse patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine a tightly packed soldier knapsack well buckled and perfectly new on his back an enormous knotty stick in his hand shoes on his stockingless feet a shaved head and a long beard 
 the sweat the heat the journey on foot the dust added i know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole 
 his hair was closely cut yet bristling for it had begun to grow a little and did not seem to have been cut for some time 
 no one knew him 
 he was evidently only a chance whence came he 
 from the south from the seashore perhaps for he made his entrance into d by the same street which seven months previously had witnessed the passage of the emperor napoleon on his way from cannes to paris 
 this man must have been walking all day he seemed very much fatigued 
 some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard gassendi and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade 
 he must have been very thirsty for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink two hundred paces further on at the fountain in the 
 on arriving at the corner of the rue poichevert he turned to the left and directed his steps toward the he entered then came out a quarter of an hour later 
 a gendarme was seated near the door on the stone bench which general drouot had mounted on the th of march to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of d the proclamation of the gulf juan 
 the man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme 
 the gendarme without replying to his salute stared attentively at him followed him for a while with his eyes and then entered the 
 there then existed at d a fine inn at the sign of the cross of colbas 
 this inn had for a landlord a certain jacquin labarre a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another labarre who kept the inn of the three dauphins in grenoble and had served in the guides 
 at the time of the landing many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the three dauphins 
 it was said that general bertrand disguised as a carter had made frequent trips thither in the month of january and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of gold to the citizens 
 the truth is that when the emperor entered grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture he had thanked the mayor saying i am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance and he had betaken himself to the three dauphins 
 this glory of the labarre of the three dauphins was reflected upon the labarre of the cross of colbas at a distance of five and twenty leagues it was said of him in the town that is the cousin of the man of grenoble 
 the man bent his steps towards this inn which was the best in the he entered the kitchen which opened on a level with the street 
 all the stoves were lighted a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace 
 the host who was also the chief cook was going from one to another very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners whose loud talking conversation and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment any one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners 
 a fat marmot flanked by white partridges and was turning on a long spit before the fire on the stove two huge carps from lake lauzet and a trout from lake alloz were cooking 
 the host hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter said without raising his eyes from his stoves 
 what do you wish sir 
 food and lodging said the man 
 nothing easier replied the host 
 at that moment he turned his head took in the appearance with a single glance and added by paying for it 
 the man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse and answered i have money 
 in that case we are at your service said the host 
 the man put his purse back in his pocket removed his knapsack from his back put it on the ground near the door retained his stick in his hand and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire d is in the mountains 
 the evenings are cold there in october 
 but as the host went back and forth he scrutinized the traveller 
 will dinner be ready soon said the man 
 immediately replied the landlord 
 while the newcomer was warming himself before the fire with his back turned the worthy host jacquin labarre drew a pencil from his pocket then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window 
 on the white margin he wrote a line or two folded it without sealing and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey 
 the landlord whispered a word in the ear and the child set off on a run in the direction of the 
 the traveller saw nothing of all this 
 once more he inquired will dinner be ready soon 
 immediately responded the host 
 the child returned 
 he brought back the paper 
 the host unfolded it eagerly like a person who is expecting a reply 
 he seemed to read it attentively then tossed his head and remained thoughtful for a moment 
 then he took a step in the direction of the traveller who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene 
 i cannot receive you sir said he 
 the man half rose 
 what 
 are you afraid that i will not pay you 
 do you want me to pay you in advance 
 i have money i tell you 
 it is not that 
 what then 
 you have money 
 yes said the man 
 and i said the host have no room 
 the man resumed tranquilly put me in the stable 
 i cannot 
 why 
 the horses take up all the space 
 very well retorted the man a corner of the loft then a truss of straw 
 we will see about that after dinner 
 i cannot give you any dinner 
 this declaration made in a measured but firm tone struck the stranger as grave 
 he rose 
 ah bah 
 but i am dying of hunger 
 i have been walking since sunrise i have travelled twelve leagues 
 i pay 
 i wish to eat 
 i have nothing said the landlord 
 the man burst out laughing and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves 
 nothing and all that 
 all that is engaged 
 by whom 
 by messieurs the wagoners 
 how many are there of them 
 twelve 
 there is enough food there for twenty 
 they have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance 
 the man seated himself again and said without raising his voice i am at an inn i am hungry and i shall remain 
 then the host bent down to his ear and said in a tone which made him start go away 
 at that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the tip of his staff he turned quickly round and as he opened his mouth to reply the host gazed steadily at him and added still in a low voice stop enough of that sort of talk 
 do you want me to tell you your name 
 your name is jean valjean 
 now do you want me to tell you who you are 
 when i saw you come in i suspected something i sent to the and this was the reply that was sent to me can you read 
 so saying he held out to the stranger fully unfolded the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the and from the to the inn 
 the man cast a glance upon it the landlord resumed after a pause 
 i am in the habit of being polite to every one 
 go away 
 the man dropped his head picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground and took his departure 
 he chose the principal street 
 he walked straight on at a venture keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man he did not turn round a single time 
 had he done so he would have seen the host of the cross of colbas standing on his threshold surrounded by all the guests of his inn and all the in the street talking vivaciously and pointing him out with his finger and from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town 
 he saw nothing of all this 
 people who are crushed do not look behind them 
 they know but too well the evil fate which follows them 
 thus he proceeded for some time walking on without ceasing traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing forgetful of his fatigue as is often the case when a man is sad 
 all at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply 
 night was drawing near he glanced about him to see whether he could not discover some shelter 
 the fine hostelry was closed to him he was seeking some very humble public house some hovel however lowly 
 just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets a pine branch suspended from a of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight 
 he proceeded thither 
 it proved to be in fact a public house 
 the public house which is in the rue de chaffaut 
 the wayfarer halted for a moment and peeped through the window into the interior of the room of the public house illuminated by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth 
 some men were engaged in drinking there 
 the landlord was warming himself an iron pot suspended from a crane bubbled over the flame 
 the entrance to this public house which is also a sort of an inn is by two doors 
 one opens on the street the other upon a small yard filled with manure 
 the traveller dare not enter by the street door he slipped into the yard halted again then raised the latch timidly and opened the door 
 who goes there said the master 
 some one who wants supper and bed 
 good 
 we furnish supper and bed here 
 he entered 
 all the men who were drinking turned round the lamp illuminated him on one side the firelight on the other they examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack 
 the host said to him there is the fire 
 the supper is cooking in the pot 
 come and warm yourself comrade 
 he approached and seated himself near the hearth 
 he stretched out his feet which were exhausted with fatigue to the fire a fine odor was emitted by the pot 
 all that could be distinguished of his face beneath his cap which was well pulled down assumed a vague appearance of comfort mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows 
 it was moreover a firm energetic and melancholy profile this physiognomy was strangely composed it began by seeming humble and ended by seeming severe 
 the eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire beneath brushwood 
 one of the men seated at the table however was a fishmonger who before entering the public house of the rue de chaffaut had been to stable his horse at it chanced that he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between bras have forgotten the name i think it was escoublon 
 now when he met him the man who then seemed already extremely weary had requested him to take him on his crupper to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait 
 this fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded jacquin labarre and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the cross of colbas 
 from where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to the the went to him 
 they exchanged a few words in a low tone 
 the man had again become absorbed in his reflections 
 the returned to the fireplace laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man and said to him 
 you are going to get out of here 
 the stranger turned round and replied gently ah 
 you know 
 yes 
 i was sent away from the other inn 
 and you are to be turned out of this one 
 where would you have me go 
 elsewhere 
 the man took his stick and his knapsack and departed 
 as he went out some children who had followed him from the cross of colbas and who seemed to be lying in wait for him threw stones at him 
 he retraced his steps in anger and threatened them with his stick 
 the children dispersed like a flock of birds 
 he passed before the prison 
 at the door hung an iron chain attached to a bell 
 he rang 
 the wicket opened 
 turnkey said he removing his cap politely will you have the kindness to admit me and give me a lodging for the night 
 a voice replied 
 the prison is not an inn 
 get yourself arrested and you will be admitted 
 the wicket closed again 
 he entered a little street in which there were many gardens some of them are enclosed only by hedges which lends a cheerful aspect to the street 
 in the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small house of a single story the window of which was lighted up 
 he peered through the pane as he had done at the public house 
 within was a large whitewashed room with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff and a cradle in one corner a few wooden chairs and a gun hanging on the wall a table was spread in the centre of the room 
 a copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen the pewter jug shining like silver and filled with wine and the brown smoking at this table sat a man of about forty with a merry and open countenance who was dandling a little child on his knees 
 close by a very young woman was nursing another child the father was laughing the child was laughing the mother was smiling 
 the stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender and calming spectacle 
 what was taking place within him he alone could have told 
 it is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable and that in a place where he beheld so much happiness he would find perhaps a little pity 
 he tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock 
 they did not hear him 
 he tapped again 
 he heard the woman say it seems to me husband that some one is knocking 
 no replied the husband 
 he tapped a third time 
 the husband rose took the lamp and went to the door which he opened 
 he was a man of lofty stature half peasant half artisan he wore a huge leather apron which reached to his left shoulder and which a hammer a red handkerchief a and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle as in a pocket caused to bulge out 
 he carried his head thrown backwards his shirt widely opened and turned back displayed his bull neck white and bare 
 he had thick eyelashes enormous black whiskers prominent eyes the lower part of his face like a snout and besides all this that air of being on his own ground which is indescribable 
 pardon me sir said the wayfarer could you in consideration of payment give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in the garden in which to sleep 
 tell me can you for money 
 who are you demanded the master of the house 
 the man replied 
 i have just come from i have walked all day long 
 i have travelled twelve leagues 
 can you if i pay 
 i would not refuse said the peasant to lodge any respectable man who would pay me 
 but why do you not go to the inn 
 there is no room 
 bah 
 impossible 
 this is neither a fair nor a market day have you been to labarre 
 yes 
 well 
 the traveller replied with embarrassment 
 i do not know he did not receive me 
 have you been to in the rue chaffaut 
 the embarrassment increased he stammered he did not receive me either 
 the countenance assumed an expression of distrust he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet and suddenly exclaimed with a sort of shudder 
 are you the man 
 he cast a fresh glance upon the stranger took three steps backwards placed the lamp on the table and took his gun down from the wall 
 meanwhile at the words are you the man the woman had risen had clasped her two children in her arms and had taken refuge precipitately behind her husband staring in terror at the stranger with her bosom uncovered and with frightened eyes as she murmured in a low tone 
 patois of the french alps 
 chat de maraude rascally marauder 
 all this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to self 
 after having scrutinized the man for several moments as one scrutinizes a viper the master of the house returned to the door and said 
 clear out 
 for sake a glass of water said the man 
 a shot from my gun said the peasant 
 then he closed the door violently and the man heard him shoot two large bolts 
 a moment later the was closed and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside 
 night continued to fall 
 a cold wind from the alps was blowing by the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived in one of the gardens which bordered the street a sort of hut which seemed to him to be built of sods 
 he climbed over the wooden fence resolutely and found himself in the garden 
 he approached the hut its door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture and it resembled those buildings which construct for themselves along the roads 
 he thought without doubt that it was in fact the dwelling of a he was suffering from cold and hunger but this was at least a shelter from the cold this sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night 
 he threw himself flat on his face and crawled into the hut 
 it was warm there and he found a tolerably good bed of straw 
 he lay for a moment stretched out on this bed without the power to make a movement so fatigued was he 
 then as the knapsack on his back was in his way and as it furnished moreover a pillow ready to his hand he set about unbuckling one of the straps 
 at that moment a ferocious growl became audible 
 he raised his eyes 
 the head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut 
 it was a kennel 
 he was himself vigorous and formidable he armed himself with his staff made a shield of his knapsack and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could not without enlarging the rents in his rags 
 he left the garden in the same manner but backwards being obliged in order to keep the dog respectful to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as la rose couverte 
 when he had not without difficulty repassed the fence and found himself once more in the street alone without refuge without shelter without a roof over his head chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone and it appears that a heard him exclaim i am not even a dog 
 he soon rose again and resumed his march 
 he went out of the town hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter 
 he walked thus for some time with his head still drooping when he felt himself far from every human habitation he raised his eyes and gazed searchingly about him 
 he was in a field before him was one of those low hills covered with stubble which after the harvest resemble shaved heads 
 the horizon was perfectly black 
 this was not alone the obscurity of night it was caused by very clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself and which were mounting and filling the whole sky 
 meanwhile as the moon was about to rise and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth 
 the earth was thus better lighted than the sky which produces a particularly sinister effect and the hill whose contour was poor and mean was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon the whole effect was hideous petty lugubrious and narrow 
 there was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer 
 this man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things nevertheless there was something in that sky in that hill in that plain in that tree which was so profoundly desolate that after a moment of immobility and revery he turned back abruptly 
 there are instants when nature seems hostile 
 he retraced his steps the gates of d were closed 
 d which had sustained sieges during the wars of religion was still surrounded in by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been demolished since 
 he passed through a breach and entered the town again 
 it might have been eight in the evening 
 as he was not acquainted with the streets he recommenced his walk at random 
 in this way he came to the prefecture then to the seminary as he passed through the cathedral square he shook his fist at the church 
 at the corner of this square there is a printing establishment it is there that the proclamations of the emperor and of the imperial guard to the army brought from the island of elba and dictated by napoleon himself were printed for the first time 
 worn out with fatigue and no longer entertaining any hope he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office 
 at that moment an old woman came out of the church 
 she saw the man stretched out in the shadow 
 what are you doing there my friend said she 
 he answered harshly and angrily 
 as you see my good woman i am sleeping 
 the good woman who was well worthy the name in fact was the marquise de r 
 on this bench she went on 
 i have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years said the man i have a mattress of stone 
 you have been a soldier 
 yes my good woman a soldier 
 why do you not go to the inn 
 because i have no money 
 alas said madame de r i have only four sous in my purse 
 give it to me all the same 
 the man took the four sous 
 madame de r continued 
 you cannot obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum 
 but have you tried it is impossible for you to pass the night thus 
 you are cold and hungry no doubt 
 some one might have given you a lodging out of charity 
 i have knocked at all doors 
 well 
 i have been driven away everywhere 
 the good woman touched the arm and pointed out to him on the other side of the street a small low house which stood beside the palace 
 you have knocked at all doors 
 yes 
 have you knocked at that one 
 no 
 knock there

 the empire strikes back 
 ii 
 
 the temperature on the surface of hoth had dropped but despite the frigid imperial probe droid continued its leisurely drift above the fields andhills its extended sensors still reaching in all directions for life signs 
 the heat sensors suddenly reacted it had found a heat source in thevicinity and warmth was a good indication of life the head swiveled on its sensitive eyelike blisters noting the direction from which the heat sourceoriginated automatically the probe robot adjusted its speed and began to move atmaximum velocity over the icy fields 
 the insectlike machine slowed only when it neared a mound of snow bigger thanthe probe droid itself the scanners made note of the meters in height and an enormous six meters long but the was of only secondary importance what was truly astounding if a surveillancemachine could ever be astounded was the amount of heat radiating from beneath themound the creature under that snowy hill must surely be well protected against thecold 
 a thin beam of light shot from one of the probe intense heat boring into the white mound and scattering gleaming snow flecks inall directions 
 the mound began to shiver then to quake whatever existed beneath it wasdeeply irritated by the probing laser beam snow began to fall away from themound in sizable clumps when at one end two eyes showed through the mass ofwhite 
 huge yellow eyes peered like twin points of fire at the mechanical creature thatcontinued to blast away with its painful beams the eyes burned with primevalhatred for the thing that had interrupted its slumber 
 the mound shook again with a roar that nearly destroyed the probe sensors it zoomed back several meters widening the space between it andthe creature the droid had never before encountered a wampa ice creature itscomputers advised that the beast be dealt with expeditiously 
 the droid made an internal adjustment to regulate the potency of its laser than a moment later the beam was at maximum intensity the machine aimedthe laser at the creature enveloping it in a great flaming and smoking later the few remaining particles of the wampa were swept away by the icywinds 
 the smoke disappeared leaving behind no physical for a largedepression in the an ice creature had ever been there 
 but its existence had been properly recorded in the memory of the probe was already continued on its programmed mission 
 the roars of another wampa ice creature finally awakened the battered youngrebel commander head was spinning aching perhaps exploding for all hecould tell with painstaking effort he brought his vision into focus discerning thathe was in an ice gorge its jagged walls reflecting the fading twilight 
 he suddenly realized he was hanging upside down arms dangling and fingertipssome thirty centimeters from the snowy floor his ankles were numb he cranedhis neck and saw that his feet were frozen in ice hanging from the ceiling and that theice was forming on his legs like stalactites he could feel the frozen mask of hisown blood caked on his face where the wampa ice creature had viciously slashedhim 
 again luke heard the bestial moans louder now as they resounded through thedeep and narrow passageway of ice the roars of the monster were deafening hewondered which would kill him first the cold or the fangs and claws of the thing thatinhabited the gorge 
 got to free myself he thought get free of this ice his strength had not yetreturned fully but with a determined effort he pulled himself up and reached for theconfining bonds still too weak luke could not break the ice and fell back into hishanging position the white floor rushing up at him 
 relax he said to himself relax 
 the ice walls creaked with the bellows of the approaching feet crunched on the frigid ground coming frightening nearer it would not belong before the shaggy white horror would be back and possibly warming the coldyoung warrior in the darkness of its belly 
 eyes darted about the gorge finally spotting the pile of gear he hadbrought with him on his mission now lying in a useless crumpled heap on the equipment was nearly a full unattainable meter beyond his grasp and with thatgear was a device that entirely captured his stout handgrip unit with apair of small switches and a surmounting metal disk the object had once belongedto his father a former jedi knight who had been betrayed and murdered by the youngdarth vader but now it was given him by ben kenobi to be wielded withhonor against imperial tyranny 
 in desperation luke tried twisting his aching body just enough to reach thediscarded lightsaber but the freezing cold coursing through his body slowed himdown and weakened him luke was beginning to resign himself to his fate as heheard the snarling wampa ice creature approaching his last feelings of hope werenearly gone when he sensed the presence 
 but it was not the presence of the white giant that dominated this gorge 
 rather it was that soothing spiritual presence which occasionally visited luke inmoments of stress or danger the presence that had first come to him only after oldben once again in his jedi role of kenobi vanished into a crumple of hisown dark robes after being cut down by darth lightsaber the presence thatwas sometimes like a familiar voice an almost silent whisper that spoke directly mind 
 luke the whisper was there again hauntingly think of the lightsaber inyour hand 
 the words made already aching head throb then he felt a suddenresurgence of strength a feeling of confidence that urged him to continue fightingdespite his apparently hopeless situation his eyes fixed upon the lightsaber hishand reached out painfully the freezing in his limbs already taking its toll hesqueezed his eyes shut in concentration but the weapon was still beyond his knew that the lightsaber would require more than just struggling to reach 
 gotta relax luke told himself relax his disembodied guardian let theforce flow luke 
 the force 
 luke saw the inverted gorillalike image of the wampa ice creature looming itsraised arms ending in enormous gleaming claws he could see the apish face for thefirst time now and shivered at the sight of the ramlike horns the quiveringlower jaw with its protruding fangs 
 but then the warrior divorced the creature from his thoughts he stoppedstruggling for his weapon his body relaxed and went limp allowing his spirit to bereceptive to his suggestion already he could feel coursing through himthat energy field generated by all living beings that bound the very universe together 
 as kenobi had taught him the force was within luke to use as he saw fit 
 the wampa ice creature spread its black hooked claws and lumbered towardthe hanging youth suddenly the lightsaber as if by magic sprang to he depressed a colored button on the weapon releasing a beamthat quickly severed his icy bonds 
 as luke weapon in hand dropped to the floor the monstrous figure toweringover him took a cautious step backward the sulfurous eyes blinkedincredulously at the humming lightshaft a sight baffling to its primitive brain 
 though it was difficult to move luke jumped to his feet and waved hislightsaber at the mass of muscle and hair forcing it back a step anotherstep brining the weapon down luke cut through the hide with the bladeof light the wampa ice creature shrieked its hideous roar of agony shaking thegorge walls it turned and hastily lumbered out of the gorge its white bulk blendingwith the distant terrain 
 the sky was already noticeably darker and with the encroaching darkness camethe colder winds the force was with luke but even that mysterious power couldnot warm him now every step he took as he stumbled out of the gorge was moredifficult than the last finally his vision dimming as rapidly as the daylight lukestumbled down an embankment of snow and was unconscious before he even reachedthe bottom 
 in the subsurface main hangar dock chewie was getting the millennium falconready for takeoff he looked up from his work to see a rather curious pair of figuresthat had just appeared from around a nearby corner to mingle with the usual rebelactivity in the hangar 
 neither of these figures was human although one of them had a humanoid shapeand gave the impression of a man in knightly golden armor his movement wereprecise almost too precise to be human as he clanked stiffly through the companion required no manlike legs for locomotion for he was doing quite wellrolling his shorter barrellike body along on miniature wheels 
 the shorter of the two droids was beeping and whistling excitedly 
 not my fault you malfunctioning tin can the tall anthropomorphic droidstated gesturing with a metallic hand i did not ask you to turn on the thermalheater i merely commented that it was freezing in her chamber but supposedto be freezing how are we going to get all her things dried out ah here weare 
 the golden droid in human shape paused to focus his opticalsensors on the docked millennium falcon 
 the other robot retracted his wheels and frontal leg and rested hisstout metal body on the ground the smaller sensors were reading thefamiliar figures of han solo and his wookiee companion as those two continued thework of replacing the central lifters 
 master solo sir threepio called the only one of the robotic twosomeequipped with an imitation human voice might i have a word with you 
 han was not particularly in a mood to be disturbed especially by this fastidiousdroid what is it 
 mistress leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator threepioinformed him it must be malfunctioning 
 but han knew that it was not i shut it off he said sharply as he continued towork on his ship what does her royal holiness want 
 auditory sensors identified the disdain in voice but did notunderstand it the robot mimicked a human gesture as he added she is looking formaster luke and assumed he would be here with you no one seems to know 
 not back yet immediately han became concerned he could seethat the sky beyond the ice cavern entrance had grown considerably darker since heand chewbacca had begun to repair the millennium falcon han knew just howseverely the temperatures dropped on the surface after nightfall and how deadly thewinds could be 
 in a flash he jumped off the lift not even looking back toward thewookiee bolt it down chewie officer of the deck han yelled then broughthis comlink to his mouth and asked security control has commander skywalkerreported in yet a negative reply brought a scowl to face 
 the deck sergeant and his aide hurried up to solo in response to his summons 
 is commander skywalker back yet han asked tension in his voice 
 i seen him the deck sergeant replied possible he came inthrough the south entrance 
 check on it solo snapped though he was not in an official position to givecommands urgent 
 as the deck sergeant and his aide turned and rushed down the corridor artooemitted a concerned whistle that rose inquiringly in pitch 
 i know artoo threepio answered stiffly turning his upper torso andhead in direction sir might i inquire going on 
 anger welled up inside han as he grunted back at the robot go tell yourprecious princess that luke is dead unless he shows up soon 
 artoo began to whistle hysterically at grim prediction and golden partner exclaimed oh no 
 the main tunnel was filled with activity when han solo rushed in he saw apair of rebel troopers employing all their physical strength to restrain a nervoustauntaun that was trying to break free 
 from the opposite end the deck officer rushed into the corridor his eyes dartingaround the chamber until he had spotted han sir he said skywalker come through the south entrance he might haveforgotten to check in 
 not likely han snapped are the speeders ready 
 not yet the deck officer answered adapting them to the cold is provingdifficult maybe by morning 
 han cut him off there any time to waste on machines that could andprobably would break down have to go out on tauntauns take sectorfour 
 the temperature is falling too rapidly 
 you bet it is han growled and out in it 
 the other officer volunteered cover sector twelve have control set screenalpha 
 but han knew there was no time for control to get its surveillance camerasoperating not with luke probably dying somewhere on the desolate plains pushed his way through the assemblage of rebel troops and took the reins of oneof the trained tauntauns leaping onto the back 
 the night storms will start before any of you can reach the first marker thedeck officer warned 
 then see you in hell grunted han tugging the reins of his mount andmaneuvering the animal out of the cave 
 snow was falling heavily as han solo raced his tauntaun through the was near and the winds were howling fiercely piercing his heavy clothes heknew that he would be as useless as an icicle to luke unless he found the youngwarrior soon 
 the tauntaun was already feeling the effects of the temperature drop not evenits layers of insulating fat or the matted gray fur could protect it from the elementsafter nightfall already the beast was wheezing its breathing becoming increasinglylabored 
 han prayed that the drop at least not until he had locatedluke 
 he drove his mount harder forcing it on across the icy plains 
 another figure was moving across the snow its metal body hovering above thefrozen ground 
 the imperial probe droid paused briefly in its sensors twitching 
 then satisfied with its findings the robot gently lowered itself coming to reston the ground like spider legs several probes separated from the metal some of the snow that had settled there 
 something began to take shape around the robot a pulsating glow that graduallycovered the machine as if with a transparent dome quickly this force fieldsolidified repelling the blowing snow that brushed over the hull 
 after a moment the glow faded and the blowing snow soon formed a perfectdome of white completely concealing the droid and its protective force field 
 the tauntaun was racing at maximum speed certainly too fast considering thedistance it had traveled and the unbearable frigid air no longer wheezing it hadbegun moaning pitifully and its legs were becoming more and more unsteady hanfelt sorry about the pain but at present the life was onlysecondary to that of his friend luke 
 it was becoming difficult for han to see through the thickening he searched for some interruption in the eternal plains some distant spotthat might actually be luke but there was nothing to see other than the darkeningexpanses of snow and ice 
 yet there was a sound 
 han drew the reins in bringing the tauntaun to an abrupt halt on the could not be certain but there seemed to be some sound other than the howlingof the winds that whipped past him he strained to look in the direction of thesound 
 then he spurred his tauntaun forcing it to gallop across the field 
 luke could have been a corpse food for the scavengers by the time the light ofdawn returned but somehow he was still alive though barely and struggling to staythat way even with the night storms violently assaulting him luke painfully pulledhimself upright from the snow only to be blasted back down by the freezing he fell he considered the irony of it farm boy from tatooine maturing tobattle the death star now perishing alone in a frozen alien wasteland 
 it took all of remaining strength to drag himself a half meter beforefinally collapsing sinking into the drifts i he said thoughno one could hear his words 
 but someone though still unseen had heard 
 you must the words vibrated in mind luke look at me 
 luke could not ignore that command the power of those softly spoken wordswas too great 
 with a great effort luke lifted his head and saw what he thought was ahallucination in front of him apparently unaffected by the cold and still clad onlyin the shabby robes he had worn in the hot desert of tatooine stood ben kenobi 
 luke wanted to call out to him but he was speechless 
 the apparition spoke with the same gentle authority ben had always used withthe young man you must survive luke 
 the young commander found the strength to move his lips again cold 
 you must go to the dagobah system the spectral figure of ben kenobiinstructed you will learn from yoda the jedi master the one who taught me 
 luke listened then reached to touch the ghostly figure benben hegroaned 
 the figure remained unmoved by efforts to reach it luke it spokeagain our only hope 
 our only hope 
 luke was confused yet before he could gather the strength to ask for anexplanation the figure began to fade and when every trace of the apparition hadpassed from his sight luke thought he saw the approach of a tauntaun with a humanrider on its back the was approaching its gait unsteady the riderwas still too far away too obscured by the storm for identification 
 in desperation the young rebel commander called out ben before againdropping off into unconsciousness 
 the was barely able to stand on its saurian hind legs when han soloreined it to a stop and dismounted 
 han looked with horror at the almost frozen form lying as if deadat his feet 
 come on buddy he appealed to inert figure immediately forgetting hisown nearly frozen body you dead yet give me a signal here 
 han could detect no sign of life and noticed that face nearly coveredwith snow was savagely torn he rubbed at the face being careful not totouch the drying wounds do this luke not your time 
 finally a slight response a low moan barely audible over the winds wasstrong enough to send a warm glow through own shivering body he grinnedwith relief i knew you leave me out here all alone got to getyou out of here 
 knowing that his in the speed of the moved toward the beast carrying the young warrior limply in his arms butbefore he could drape the unconscious form over the back the an agonized roar then fell into a shaggy gray heap on the snow laying hiscompanion down han rushed to the side of the fallen creature the tauntaun madeone final sound not a roar or bellow but only a sickly rasp then the beast wassilent 
 solo gripped the hide his numbed fingers searching for even theslightest indication of life deader than a triton moon he said knowing that lukedid not hear a word we got much time 
 resting motionless form against the belly of the dead hanproceeded to work it might be something of a sacrilege he mused using a favorite weapon like this but right now lightsaber was the mostefficient and precise tool to cut through the thick skin of a tauntaun 
 at first the weapon felt strange in his hand but momentarily he was cutting carcass from hairy head to scaly hind paws han winced at the foul odorthat rose from the steaming incision there were few things he could remember thatstank like a innards without deliberation he tossed the slipperyentrails into the snow 
 when the corpse had been entirely eviscerated han shoved his friendinside the warm skin i know this smell so good luke keep you from freezing sure this tauntaun hesitate if it were theother way around 
 from the body of the another blast of rose out of thedisemboweled cavity whew han almost gagged just as well outcold pal 
 there much time left to do what had to be done freezing handswent to the supply pack strapped to the back and rummaged through items until he located the shelter container 
 before unpacking it he spoke into his comlink echo base do you copy 
 no response 
 this comlink is useless 
 the sky had darkened ominously and the winds blew violently making evenbreathing close to impossible han fought to open the shelter container and stifflybegan to construct the one piece of rebel equipment that might protect them for a short while longer 
 if i get this shelter up fast he grumbled to himself jabba needthose bounty hunters

 chapter xvi 
 
 pierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself in petersburg and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to moscow the story told about him at count was true pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear he had now been for some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his house though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in moscow and that the ladies about his father who were never favorably disposed toward him would have used it to turn the count against him he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his part of the house entering the drawing room where the princesses spent most of their time he greeted the ladies two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud it was the eldest who was reading the one who had met anna mikhaylovna the two younger ones were embroidering both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper the eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes the second assumed precisely the same expression while the youngest the one with the mole who was of a cheerful and lively disposition bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw she drew her wool down through the canvas and scarcely able to refrain from laughing stooped as if trying to make out the pattern 
 how do you do cousin said pierre you recognize me 
 i recognize you only too well too well 
 how is the count can i see him asked pierre awkwardly as usual but unabashed 
 the count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings 
 can i see the count pierre again asked 
 hm if you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can see him olga go and see whether beef tea is ready it is almost time she added giving pierre to understand that they were busy and busy making his father comfortable while evidently he pierre was only busy causing him annoyance 
 olga went out pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed and said then i will go to my rooms you will let me know when i can see him 
 and he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole 
 next day prince vasili had arrived and settled in the house he sent for pierre and said to him my dear fellow if you are going to behave here as you did in petersburg you will end very badly that is all i have to say to you the count is very very ill and you must not see him at all 
 since then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs 
 when boris appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his room stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall as if running a sword through an invisible foe and glaring savagely over his spectacles and then again resuming his walk muttering indistinct words shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating 
 england is done for said he scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen mr pitt as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man is sentenced to but before pierre who at that moment imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured london could pronounce sentence he saw a and handsome young officer entering his room pierre paused he had left moscow when boris was a boy of fourteen and had quite forgotten him but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took boris by the hand with a friendly smile 
 do you remember me asked boris quietly with a pleasant smile i have come with my mother to see the count but it seems he is not well 
 yes it seems he is ill people are always disturbing him answered pierre trying to remember who this young man was 
 boris felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked pierre straight in the face 
 count rostov asks you to come to dinner today said he after a considerable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortable 
 ah count rostov exclaimed pierre joyfully then you are his son ilya only fancy i know you at first do you remember how we went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot such an age 
 you are mistaken said boris deliberately with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile i am boris son of princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya rostov the father is ilya and his son is nicholas i never knew any madame jacquot 
 pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees 
 oh dear what am i thinking about mixed everything up one has so many relatives in moscow so you are boris of course well now we know where we are and what do you think of the boulogne expedition the english will come off badly you know if napoleon gets across the channel i think the expedition is quite feasible if only villeneuve make a mess of things 
 boris knew nothing about the boulogne expedition he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard name 
 we here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone i know nothing about it and have not thought about it moscow is chiefly busy with gossip he continued just now they are talking about you and your father 
 pierre smiled in his way as if afraid for his sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret but boris spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight into eyes 
 moscow has nothing else to do but gossip boris went on everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune though he may perhaps outlive us all as i sincerely hope he will 
 yes it is all very horrid interrupted pierre very horrid 
 pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself 
 and it must seem to you said boris flushing slightly but not changing his tone or attitude it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man 
 so it does thought pierre 
 but i just wish to say to avoid misunderstandings that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people we are very poor but for my own part at any rate for the very reason that your father is rich i regard myself as a relation of his and neither i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him 
 for a long time pierre could not understand but when he did he jumped up from the sofa seized boris under the elbow in his quick clumsy way and blushing far more than boris began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation 
 well this is strange do you suppose i who could think i know very well 
 but boris again interrupted him 
 i am glad i have spoken out fully perhaps you did not like it you must excuse me said he putting pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him but i hope i have not offended you i always make it a rule to speak out well what answer am i to take will you come to dinner at the rostovs 
 and boris having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it became quite pleasant again 
 no but i say said pierre calming down you are a wonderful fellow what you have just said is good very good of course you know me we have not met for such a long time not since we were children you might think that i i understand quite understand i could not have done it myself i should not have had the courage but splendid i am very glad to have made your acquaintance queer he added after a pause that you should have suspected me he began to laugh well what of it i hope get better acquainted and he pressed boris hand do you know i have not once been in to see the count he has not sent for me i am sorry for him as a man but what can one do 
 and so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across asked boris with a smile 
 pierre saw that boris wished to change the subject and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the boulogne expedition 
 a footman came in to summon boris the princess was going pierre in order to make boris better acquaintance promised to come to dinner and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into boris eyes after he had gone pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant intelligent and resolute young man 
 as often happens in early youth especially to one who leads a lonely life he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends 
 prince vasili saw the princess off she held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful 
 it is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what it may i shall do my duty i will come and spend the night he must not be left like this every moment is precious i think why his nieces put it off perhaps god will help me to find a way to prepare him adieu prince may god support you 
 adieu ma bonne answered prince vasili turning away from her 
 oh he is in a dreadful state said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage he hardly recognizes anybody 
 i understand mamma what is his attitude to pierre asked the son 
 the will will show that my dear our fate also depends on it 
 but why do you expect that he will leave us anything 
 ah my dear he is so rich and we are so poor 
 well that is hardly a sufficient reason mamma 
 oh heaven how ill he is exclaimed the mother

 chapter 
 
 about twelve that night was born the catherine you saw at wuthering heights a puny seven months child and two hours after the mother died having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss heathcliff or know edgar the distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be dwelt on its after effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk a great addition in my eyes was his being left without an heir i bemoaned that as i gazed on the feeble orphan and i mentally abused old linton for what was only natural partiality the securing his estate to his own daughter instead of his an unwelcomed infant it was poor thing it might have wailed out of life and nobody cared a morsel during those first hours of existence we redeemed the neglect afterwards but its beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be 
 next and cheerful out of softened in through the blinds of the silent room and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow tender glow edgar linton had his head laid on the pillow and his eyes shut his young and fair features were almost as deathlike as those of the form beside him and almost as fixed but his was the hush of exhausted anguish and hers of perfect peace her brow smooth her lids closed her lips wearing the expression of a smile no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared and i partook of the infinite calm in which she lay my mind was never in a holier frame than while i gazed on that untroubled image of divine rest i instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours before incomparably beyond and above us all whether still on earth or now in heaven her spirit is at home with god 
 i know if it be a peculiarity in me but i am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me i see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break and i feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless eternity they have life is boundless in its duration and love in its sympathy and joy in its fulness i noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even in a love like mr when he so regretted blessed release to be sure one might have doubted after the wayward and impatient existence she had led whether she merited a haven of peace at last one might doubt in seasons of cold reflection but not then in the presence of her corpse it asserted its own tranquillity which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant 
 do you believe such people are happy in the other world sir give a great deal to know 
 i declined answering mrs question which struck me as something heterodox she proceeded 
 retracing the course of catherine linton i fear we have no right to think she is but leave her with her maker 
 the master looked asleep and i ventured soon after sunrise to quit the room and steal out to the pure refreshing air the servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch in reality my chief motive was seeing mr heathcliff if he had remained among the larches all night he would have heard nothing of the stir at the grange unless perhaps he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to gimmerton if he had come nearer he would probably be aware from the lights flitting to and fro and the opening and shutting of the outer doors that all was not right within i wished yet feared to find him i felt the terrible news must be told and i longed to get it over but how to do it i did not know he was least a few yards farther in the park leant against an old ash tree his hat off and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches and fell pattering round him he had been standing a long time in that position for i saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him busy in building their nest and regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber they flew off at my approach and he raised his eyes and spoke 
 dead he said not waited for you to learn that put your handkerchief snivel before me damn you all she wants none of your tears 
 i was weeping as much for him as her we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others and when i first looked into his face i perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled and he prayed because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the ground 
 yes dead i answered checking my sobs and drying my cheeks gone to heaven i hope where we may everyone join her if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good 
 did she take due asked heathcliff attempting a sneer did she die like a saint come give me a true history of the event how did 
 he endeavoured to pronounce the name but could not manage it and compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony defying meanwhile my sympathy with an unflinching ferocious stare how did she die he resumed at notwithstanding his hardihood to have a support behind him for after the struggle he trembled in spite of himself to his very 
 poor wretch i thought you have a heart and nerves the same as your brother men why should you be anxious to conceal them your pride cannot blind god you tempt him to wring them till he forces a cry of humiliation 
 quietly as a lamb i answered aloud she drew a sigh and stretched herself like a child reviving and sinking again to sleep and five minutes after i felt one little pulse at her heart and nothing more 
 she ever mention me he asked hesitating as if he dreaded the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear 
 her senses never returned she recognized nobody from the time you left her i said she lies with a sweet smile on her face and her latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days her life closed in a gentle she wake as kindly in the other world 
 may she wake in torment he cried with frightful vehemence stamping his foot and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion why a liar to the end where is she not in oh you said you cared nothing for my sufferings and i pray one repeat it till my tongue earnshaw may you not rest as long as i am living you said i killed me then the murdered do haunt their murderers i believe i know that ghosts have wandered on earth be with me any me mad only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you oh god it is unutterable i cannot live without my life i cannot live without my soul 
 he dashed his head against the knotted trunk and lifting up his eyes howled not like a man but like a savage beast getting goaded to death with knives and spears i observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree and his hand and forehead were both stained probably the scene i witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night it hardly moved my appalled me still i felt reluctant to quit him so but the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me watching he thundered a command for me to go and i obeyed he was beyond my skill to quiet or console 
 mrs funeral was appointed to take place on the friday following her decease and till then her coffin remained uncovered and strewn with flowers and scented leaves in the great linton spent his days and nights there a sleepless guardian circumstance concealed from all but spent his nights at least outside equally a stranger to repose i held no communication with him still i was conscious of his design to enter if he could and on the tuesday a little after dark when my master from sheer fatigue had been compelled to retire a couple of hours i went and opened one of the windows moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu he did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity cautiously and briefly too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise indeed i have discovered that he had been there except for the disarrangement of the drapery about the face and for observing on the floor a curl of light hair fastened with a silver thread which on examination i ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round neck heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents replacing them by a black lock of his own i twisted the two and enclosed them together 
 mr earnshaw was of course invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave and he sent no excuse but he never came so that besides her husband the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants isabella was not asked 
 the place of interment to the surprise of the villagers was neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the lintons nor yet by the tombs of her own relations outside it was dug on a green slope in a corner of the kirkyard where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor and peat mould almost buries it her husband lies in the same spot now and they have each a simple headstone above and a plain grey block at their feet to mark the graves

 chapter sixteen 
 
 in the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before for now the shadow of a real trouble had come the little books were full of help and comfort and as they dressed they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them everything seemed very strange when they went down so dim and still outside so full of light and bustle within breakfast at that early hour seemed odd and even familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on the big trunk stood ready in the hall cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa and mother herself sat trying to eat but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution eyes kept filling in spite of herself jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen rollermore than once ant the little girls wore a grave troubled expression as if sorrow was a new experience to them 
 nobody talked much but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage mrs march said to the girls who were all busied about her one folding her shawl another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet a third putting on her overshoes and a forth fastening up her travelling bag 
 children i leave you to care and mr protection hannah is faithfulness itself and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own i have no fears for you yet i am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly grieve and fret when i am gone or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget go on with your work as usual for work is a blessed solace hope and keep busy and whatever happens remember that you never can be fatherless 
 yes mother 
 meg dear be prudent watch over your sisters consult hannah and in any perplexity go to mr laurence be patient jo get despondent or do rash things write to me often and be my brave girl ready to help and cheer all beth comfort yourself with your music and be faithful to the little home duties and you amy help all you can be obedient and keep happy safe at home 
 we will mother we will 
 the rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen that was the hard minute but the girls stood it well no one cried no one ran away or uttered a lamentation though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to father remembering as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them they kissed their mother quietly clung about her tenderly and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away 
 laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off and mr brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him mr greatheart on the spot 
 goodby my darlings god bless and keep us all whispered mrs march as she kissed one dear little face after the other and hurried into the carriage 
 as she rolled away the sun came out and looking back she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen they saw it also and smiled and waved their hands and the last thing she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces and behind them like a bodyguard old mr laurence faithful hannah and devoted laurie 
 how kind everyone is to us she said turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young face 
 i see how they can help it returned mr brooke laughing so infectiously that mrs march could not help smiling and so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine smiles and cheerful words 
 i feel as if there had been an earthquake said jo as their neighbors went home to breakfast leaving them to rest and refresh themselves 
 it seems as if half the house was gone added meg forlornly 
 beth opened her lips to say something but could only point to the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on table showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them it was a little thing but it went straight to their hearts and in spite of their brave resolutions they all broke down and cried bitterly 
 hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings and when the shower showed signs of clearing up she came to the rescue armed with a coffeepot 
 now ny dear young ladies remember what your ma said and fret come and have a cup of coffee all round and then fall to work and be a credit to the family 
 coffee was a treat and hannah showed great tact in making it that morning no one could resist her persuasive nods or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot they drew up to the table exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins and in ten minutes were all right again 
 hope and keep busy the motto for us so see who will remember it best i shall go to aunt march as usual oh she lecture though said jo as she sipped with returning spirit 
 i shall go to my kings though much rather stay at home and attend to things here said meg wishing she made her eyes so red 
 no need of that beth and i can keep house perfectly well 
 put in amy with an important air 
 hannah will tell us what to do and have everything nice when you come home added beth getting out her mop and dish tub without delay 
 i think anxiety is very interesting observed amy eating sugar pensively 
 the girls help laughing and felt better for it though meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar bowl 
 the sight of the turnovers made jo sober again and when the two went out to their daily tasks they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their face it was gone but beth had remembered the little household ceremony and there she was nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin 
 so like my beth said jo waving her hat with a grateful face goodbye meggy i hope the kings strain today fret about father dear she added as they parted 
 and i hope aunt march croak your hair is becoming and it looks very boyish and nice returned meg trying not to smile at the curly head which looked comically small on her tall shoulders 
 my only comfort and touching her hat a la laurie away went jo feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day 
 news from their father comforted the girls very much for though dangerously ill the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good mr brooke sent a bulletin every day and as the head of the family meg insisted on reading the dispatches which grew more cheerful as the week passed at first everyone was eager to write and plump envelopes were carefully 
 poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters who felt rather important with their washington correspondence as one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party we will rob an imaginary mail and read them 
 
 my dearest mother 
 it is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us for the news was so good we help laughing and crying over it how very kind mr brooke is and how fortunate that mr business detains him near you so long since he is so useful to you and father the girls are all as good as gold jo helps me with the sewing and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs i should be afraid she might overdo if i know her moral fit last long beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock and never forgets what you told her she grieves about father and looks sober except when she is at her little piano amy minds me nicely and i take great care of her she does her ownhair and i am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings 
 she tries very hard and i know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come mr laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen as jo says and laurie is very kind and neighborly he and jo keep us merry for we get pretty blue sometimes and feel like orphans with you so far away hannah is a perfect saint she does not scold at all and always calls me miss margaret which is quite proper you know and treats me with respect we are all well and busy but we long day and night to have you back give my dearest love to father and believe me ever your own 
 
 meg 
 
 this note prettily written on scented paper was a great contrast to the next which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and letters 
 
 my precious marmee 
 three cheers for dear father brooke was a trump to telegraph right off and let us know the minute he was better i rushed up garret when the letter came and tried to thank god for being so good to us but i could only cry and say glad glad that do as well as a regular prayer for i felt a great many in my heart we have such funny times and now i can enjoy them for everyone is so desperately good like living in a nest of turtledoves laugh to see meg head the table and try to be motherish she gets prettier every day and in love with her sometimes the children are regular archangels and i well jo and never shall be anything else oh i must tell you that i came near having a quarrel with laurie i freed my mind about a silly little thing and he was offended i was right but speak as i ought and he marched home saying he come again till i begged pardon i declared i and got mad 
 it lasted all day i felt bad and wanted you very much laurie and i are both so proud hard to beg pardon but i thought come to it for i was in the right he come and just at night i remembered what you said when amy fell into the river i read my little book felt better resolved not to let the sun set on my anger and ran over to tell laurie i was sorry i met him at the gate coming for the same thing we both laughed begged each pardon and felt all good and comfortable again 
 i made a pome yesterday when i was helping hannah wash and as father likes my silly little things i put it in to amuse him give him my lovingest hug that ever was and kiss yourself a dozen times for your 
 
 
 jo 
 a song from the suds 
 queen of my tub i merrily sing 
 while the white foam rises high 
 and sturdily wash and rinse and wring 
 and fasten the clothes to dry 
 then out in the free fresh air they swing 
 under the sunny sky 
 i wish we could wash from out hearts and souls 
 the stains of the week away 
 and let water and air by their magic make 
 ourselves as pure as they 
 then on the earth there would be indeed 
 a glorious washing day 
 along the path of a useful life 
 will heartsease ever bloom 
 the busy mind has no time to think 
 of sorrow or care or gloom 
 and anxious thoughts may be swept away 
 as we bravely wield a broom 
 i am glad a task to me is given 
 to labor at day by day 
 for it brings me health and strength and hope 
 and i cheerfully learn to say 
 head you may think heart you may feel 
 but hand you shall work alway 
 
 dear mother 
 there is only room for me to send my love and some pressed pansies from the root i have been keeping safe in the house for father to see i read every morning try to be good all day and sing myself to sleep with tune i sing land of the leal now it makes me cry everyone is very kind and we are as happy as we can be without you amy wants the rest of the page so i must stop i forget to cover the holders and i wind the clock and air the rooms every day

lionfish nov chapter fifteen aragogcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses but with no hagrid visible from the castle windows striding the grounds with fang at his heels the scene look right to harry no better in fact than the inside of the castle where things were so horribly wrong 
 
 harry and ron had tried to visit hermione but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing 
 
 taking no more chances madam pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door no sorry every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off 
 
 with dumbledore gone fear had spread as never before so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows there was barely a face to be seen in the school that look worried and tense and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled 
 
 harry constantly repeated final words to himself i will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it but what good were these words who exactly were they supposed to ask for help when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were 
 
 hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was there seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow harry looked everywhere he went helped rather reluctantly by ron they were hampered of course by the fact that they allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other gryffindors most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers but harry found it very irksome 
 
 one person however seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion draco malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed head boy harry realize what he was so pleased about until the potions lesson about two weeks after dumbledore and hagrid had left when sitting right behind malfoy harry overheard him gloating to crabbe and goyle 
 
 i always thought father might be the one who got rid of dumbledore he said not troubling to keep his voice down i told you he thinks the worst headmaster the ever had maybe get a decent headmaster now someone who want the chamber of secrets closed mcgonagall last long only filling in 
 
 snape swept past harry making no comment about empty seat and cauldron 
 
 sir said malfoy loudly sir why you apply for the job 
 
 now now malfoy said snape though he suppress a smile professor dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors i daresay be back with us soon enough 
 
 yeah right said malfoy smirking i expect have vote sir if you wanted to apply for the job tell father the best teacher here sir 
 
 snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon fortunately not spotting seamus finnigan who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron 
 
 quite surprised the mudbloods all packed their bags by now malfoy went on bet you five galleons the next one dies pity it granger 
 
 the bell rang at that moment which was lucky at last words ron had leapt off his stool and in the scramble to collect bags and books his attempts to reach malfoy went unnoticed 
 
 let me at him ron growled as harry and dean hung onto his arms i care i need my wand going to kill him with my bare hands 
 
 hurry up got to take you all to herbology barked snape over the heads and off they marched with harry ron and dean bringing up the rear ron still trying to get loose it was only safe to let go of him when snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses 
 
 the herbology class was very subdued there were now two missing from their number justin and hermione 
 
 professor sprout set them all to work pruning the abyssinian shrivelfigs harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself with ernie macmillan ernie took a deep breath and said very formally i just want to say harry that sorry i ever suspected you i know never attack hermione granger and i apologize for all the stuff i said all in the same boat now and well 
 
 he held out a pudgy hand and harry shook it 
 
 ernie and his friend hannah came to work at the same shrivelfig as harry and ron 
 
 that draco malfoy character said ernie breaking off dead twigs he seems very pleased about all this he know i think he might be heir 
 
 clever of you said ron who seem to have forgiven ernie as readily as harry 
 
 do you think malfoy harry ernie asked 
 
 no said harry so firmly that ernie and hannah stared 
 
 a second later harry spotted something 
 
 several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting harry hit ron over the hand with his pruning shears 
 
 ouch you 
 
 harry pointed out the spiders following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun 
 
 oh yeah said ron trying and failing to look pleased but we follow them now 
 
 ernie and hannah were listening curiously 
 
 eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders if they pursued their fixed course there could be no doubt about where they would end up 
 
 looks like heading for the forbidden forest 
 
 and ron looked even unhappier about that 
 
 at the end of the lesson professor sprout escorted the class to their defense against the dark arts lesson harry and ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot 
 
 have to use the invisibility cloak again harry told ron we can take fang with us used to going into the forest with hagrid he might be some help 
 
 right said ron who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers er there there supposed to be werewolves in the forest he added as they took their usual places at the back of classroom 
 
 preferring not to answer that question harry said there are good things in there too the centaurs are all right and the unicorns 
 
 ron had never been into the forbidden forest before harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again 
 
 lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual but lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant 
 
 come now he cried beaming around him why all these long faces 
 
 people swapped exasperated looks but nobody answered 
 
 you people realize said lockhart speaking slowly as though they were all a bit dim the danger has passed the culprit has been taken away 
 
 says who said dean thomas loudly 
 
 my dear young man the minister of magic have taken hagrid if he been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty said lockhart in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two 
 
 oh yes he would said ron even more loudly than dean 
 
 i flatter myself i know a touch more about arrest than you do mr weasley said lockhart in a tone 
 
 ron started to say that he think so somehow but stopped in midsentence when harry kicked him hard under the desk 
 
 we there remember harry muttered 
 
 but disgusting cheeriness his hints that he had always thought hagrid was no good his confidence that the whole business was now at an end irritated harry so much that he yearned to throw gadding with ghouls right in stupid face instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to ron do it tonight 
 
 ron read the message swallowed hard and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by hermione the sight seemed to stiffen his resolve and he nodded 
 
 the gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days because from six onward the gryffindors had nowhere else to go they also had plenty to talk about with the result that the common room often empty until past midnight 
 
 harry went to get the invisibility cloak out of his trunk right after dinner and spent the evening sitting on it waiting for the room to clear fred and george challenged harry and ron to a few games of exploding snap and ginny sat watching them very subdued in usual chair harry and ron kept losing on purpose trying to finish the games quickly but even so it was well past midnight when fred george and ginny finally went to bed 
 
 harry and ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak throwing it over themselves and climbing through the portrait hole 
 
 it was another difficult journey through the castle dodging all the teachers at last they reached the entrance hall slid back the lock on the oak front doors squeezed between them trying to stop any creaking and stepped out into the moonlit grounds 
 
 course said ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass we might get to the forest and find nothing to follow those spiders might been going there at all i know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction but 
 
 his voice trailed away hopefully 
 
 they reached house sad and with its blank windows when harry pushed the door open fang went mad with joy at the sight of them worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep booming barks they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece which glued his teeth together 
 
 harry left the invisibility cloak on table there would be no need for it in the forest 
 
 fang going for a walk said harry patting his leg and fang bounded happily out of the house behind them dashed to the edge of the forest and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree 
 
 harry took out his wand murmured lumos and a tiny light appeared at the end of it just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders 
 
 good thinking said ron light mine too but you know probably blow up or something 
 
 harry tapped ron on the shoulder pointing at the grass two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees 
 
 okay ron sighed as though resigned to the worst ready go 
 
 so with fang scampering around them sniffing tree roots and leaves they entered the forest by the glow of wand they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path they walked behind them for about twenty minutes not speaking listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves then when the trees had become thicker than ever so that the stars overhead were no longer visible and wand shone alone in the sea of dark they saw their spider guides leaving the path 
 
 harry paused trying to see where the spiders were going but everything outside his little sphere of light was he had never been this deep into the forest before he could vividly remember hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time been in here but hagrid was miles away now probably sitting in a cell in azkaban and he had also said to follow the spiders 
 
 something wet touched hand and he jumped backward crushing foot but it was only nose 
 
 what reckon harry said to ron whose eyes he could just make out reflecting the light from his wand 
 
 come this far said ron 
 
 so they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees they move very quickly now there were tree roots and stumps in their way barely visible in the near blackness harry could feel hot breath on his hand more than once they had to stop so that harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight 
 
 they walked for what seemed like at least half an hour their robes snagging on branches and brambles after a while they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward though the trees were as thick as ever 
 
 then fang suddenly let loose a great echoing bark making both harry and ron jump out of their skins 
 
 what said ron loudly looking around into the and gripping elbow very hard 
 
 something moving over there harry breathed listen sounds like something big 
 
 they listened some distance to their right the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees 
 
 oh no said ron oh no oh no oh 
 
 shut up said harry frantically hear you 
 
 hear me said ron in an unnaturally high voice already heard fang 
 
 the darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood terrified waiting there was a strange rumbling noise and then silence 
 
 what think doing said harry 
 
 probably getting ready to pounce said ron 
 
 they waited shivering hardly daring to move 
 
 think gone harry whispered 
 
 dunno 
 
 then to their right came a sudden blaze of light so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes fang yelped and tried to run but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder 
 
 harry ron shouted his voice breaking with relief harry our car 
 
 what 
 
 come on 
 
 harry blundered after ron toward the light stumbling and tripping and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing 
 
 mr car was standing empty in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches its headlights ablaze as ron walked toward it it moved slowly toward him exactly like a large turquoise dog greeting its owner 
 
 been here all the time said ron delightedly walking around the car look at it the turned it wild 
 
 the sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own fang seem at all keen on it he kept close to harry who could feel him quivering his breathing slowing down again harry stuffed his wand back into his robes 
 
 and we thought it was going to attack us said ron leaning against the car and patting it i wondered where it had gone 
 
 harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights 
 
 lost the trail he said go and find them 
 
 ron speak he move his eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor right behind harry his face was livid with terror 
 
 harry even have time to turn around there was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground so that he was hanging facedown struggling terrified he heard more clicking and saw legs leave the ground too heard fang whimpering and howling next moment he was being swept away into the dark trees 
 
 head hanging harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long hairy legs the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers behind him he could hear another of the creatures no doubt carrying ron they were moving into the very heart of the forest harry could hear fang fighting to free himself from a third monster whining loudly but harry have yelled even if he had wanted to he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing 
 
 he never knew how long he was in the clutches he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the ground was now swarming with spiders craning his neck sideways he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow a hollow that had been cleared of trees so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on 
 
 spiders not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below spiders the size of carthorses black hairy gigantic the massive specimen that was carrying harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty domed web in the very center of the hollow while its fellows closed in all around it clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load 
 
 harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him ron and fang thudded down next to him fang howling anymore but cowering silently on the spot ron looked exactly like harry felt his mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping 
 
 harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something it had been hard to tell because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke 
 
 aragog it called aragog 
 
 and from the middle of the misty domed web a spider the size of a small elephant emerged very slowly there was gray in the black of his body and legs and each of the eyes on his ugly pincered head was milky white he was blind 
 
 what is it he said clicking his pincers rapidly 
 
 men clicked the spider who had caught harry 
 
 is it hagrid said aragog moving closer his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely 
 
 strangers clicked the spider who had brought ron 
 
 kill them clicked aragog fretfully i was sleeping 
 
 friends of harry shouted his heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat 
 
 click click click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow 
 
 aragog paused 
 
 hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he said slowly 
 
 in trouble said harry breathing very fast why come 
 
 in trouble said the aged spider and harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers but why has he sent you 
 
 harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it he think his legs would support him so he spoke from the ground as calmly as he could 
 
 they think up at the school that been setting a a something on students taken him to azkaban 
 
 aragog clicked his pincers furiously and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders it was like applause except applause usually make harry feel sick with fear 
 
 but that was years ago said aragog fretfully years and years ago i remember it well why they made him leave the school they believed that i was the monster that dwells in what they call the chamber of secrets they thought that hagrid had opened the chamber and set me free 
 
 and you you come from the chamber of secrets said harry who could feel cold sweat on his forehead 
 
 i said aragog clicking angrily i was not born in the castle i come from a distant land a traveler gave me to hagrid when i was an egg hagrid was only a boy but he cared for me hidden in a cupboard in the castle feeding me on scraps from the table hagrid is my good friend and a good man when i was discovered and blamed for the death of a girl he protected me i have lived here in the forest ever since where hagrid still visits me he even found me a wife mosag and you see how our family has grown all through goodness 
 
 harry summoned what remained of his courage 
 
 so you never never attacked anyone 
 
 never croaked the old spider it would have been my instinct but out of respect for hagrid i never harmed a human the body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom i never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which i grew up our kind like the dark and the quiet 
 
 but then do you know what did kill that girl said harry because whatever it is back and attacking people again 
 
 his words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily large black shapes shifted all around him 
 
 the thing that lives in the castle said aragog is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others well do i remember how i pleaded with hagrid to let me go when i sensed the beast moving about the school 
 
 what is it said harry urgently 
 
 more loud clicking more rustling the spiders seemed to be closing in 
 
 we do not speak of it said aragog fiercely we do not name it i never even told hagrid the name of that dread creature though he asked me many times 
 
 harry want to press the subject not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides aragog seemed to be tired of talking he was backing slowly into his domed web but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward harry and ron 
 
 just go then harry called desperately to aragog hearing leaves rustling behind him 
 
 go said aragog slowly i think not 
 
 but but 
 
 my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid on my command but i cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst friend of hagrid 
 
 harry spun around feet away towering above him was a solid wall of spiders clicking their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads 
 
 even as he reached for his wand harry knew it was no good there were too many of them but as he tried to stand ready to die fighting a loud long note sounded and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow 
 
 mr car was thundering down the slope headlights glaring its horn screeching knocking spiders aside several were thrown onto their backs their endless legs waving in the air the car screeched to a halt in front of harry and ron and the doors flew open 
 
 get fang harry yelled diving into the front seat ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him yelping into the back of the car the doors slammed shut ron touch the accelerator but the car need him the engine roared and they were off hitting more spiders they sped up the slope out of the hollow and they were soon crashing through the forest branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps following a path it obviously knew 
 
 harry looked sideways at ron his mouth was still open in the silent scream but his eyes popping anymore 
 
 are you okay 
 
 ron stared straight ahead unable to speak 
 
 they smashed their way through the undergrowth fang howling loudly in the back seat and harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak after ten noisy rocky minutes the trees thinned and harry could again see patches of sky 
 
 the car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield they had reached the edge of the forest fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out and when harry opened the door he shot off through the trees to house tail between his legs harry got out too and after a minute or so ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed still and staring harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view 
 
 harry went back into cabin to get the invisibility cloak fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket when harry got outside again he found ron being violent sick in the pumpkin patch 
 
 follow the spiders said ron weakly wiping his mouth on his sleeve never forgive hagrid lucky to be alive 
 
 i bet he thought aragog hurt friends of his said harry 
 
 exactly problem said ron thumping the wall of the cabin he always thinks monsters as bad as made out and look where got him a cell in azkaban he was shivering uncontrollably now what was the point of sending us in there what have we found out like to know 
 
 that hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets said harry throwing the cloak over ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk he was innocent 
 
 ron gave a loud snort evidently hatching aragog in a cupboard his idea of being innocent 
 
 as the castle loomed nearer harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden then pushed the creaking front doors ajar they walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking at last they reached the safety of the gryffindor common room where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash they took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory 
 
 ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed harry however feel very sleepy he sat on the edge of his fourposter thinking hard about everything aragog had said 
 
 the creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle he thought sounded like a sort of monster voldemort even other monsters want to name it but he and ron were no closer to finding out what it was or how it petrified its victims even hagrid had never known what was in the chamber of secrets 
 
 harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window 
 
 he see what else they could do they had hit dead ends everywhere riddle had caught the wrong person the heir of slytherin had got off and no one could tell whether it was the same person or a different one who had opened the chamber this time there was nobody else to ask harry lay down still thinking about what aragog had said 
 
 he was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him and he suddenly sat bolt upright 
 
 ron he hissed through the dark ron 
 
 ron woke with a yelp like stared wildly around and saw harry 
 
 ron that girl who died aragog said she was found in a bathroom said harry ignoring snuffling snores from the corner what if she never left the bathroom what if still there 
 
 ron rubbed his eyes frowning through the moonlight and then he understood too 
 
 you think not moaning myrtle 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter sixteen professor predictioncontents prev chapter next chapter 
 euphoria at finally winning the quidditch cup lasted at least a week even the weather seemed to be celebrating as june approached the days became cloudless and sultry and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice perhaps playing a casual game of gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake 
 
 but they exams were nearly upon them and instead of lazing around outside the students were forced to remain inside the castle trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows even fred and george weasley had been spotted working they were about to take their ordinary wizarding levels percy was getting ready to take his nastily exhausting wizarding tests the highest qualification hogwarts offered as percy hoped to enter the ministry of magic he needed top grades he was becoming increasingly edgy and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings in fact the only person who seemed more anxious than percy was hermione 
 
 harry and ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once but they restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself the first column read 
 
 monday 
 
 arithmancy 
 
 transfiguration 
 
 lunch 
 
 charms 
 
 ancient runes 
 
 hermione ron said cautiously because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days er are you sure copied down these times right 
 
 what snapped hermione picking up the exam schedule and examining it yes of course i have 
 
 is there any point asking how going to sit for two exams at once said harry 
 
 no said hermione shortly have either of you seen my copy of numerology and gramatica 
 
 oh yeah i borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading said ron but very quietly hermione started shifting heaps of parchment harry ron and hermione had plenty of opportunity to speak to hagrid 
 
 gettin a bit depressed hagrid told them bending low on the pretense of checking that flobberworm was still alive bin cooped up too long but know day after tomorrow one way or the other 
 
 they had potions that afternoon which was an unqualified disaster try as harry might he get his confusing concoction to thicken and snape standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away 
 
 then came astronomy at midnight up on the tallest tower history of magic on wednesday morning in which harry scribbled everything florean fortescue had ever told him about medieval while wishing he could have had one of sundaes with him in the stifling classroom wednesday afternoon meant herbology in the greenhouses under a sun then back to the common room once more with sunburnt necks thinking longingly of this time next day when it would all be over 
 
 their second to last exam on thursday morning was defense against the dark arts professor lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow cross a series of potholes full of red caps squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart 
 
 excellent harry lupin muttered as harry climbed out of the trunk grinning full marks 
 
 flushed with his success harry hung around to watch ron and hermione ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk which successfully confused him into sinking into the quagmire hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it after about a minute inside it she burst out again screaming 
 
 hermione said lupin startled the matter 
 
 mcgonagall hermione gasped pointing into the trunk said failed everything 
 
 it took a little while to calm hermione down when at last she had regained a grip on herself she harry and ron went back to the castle ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at boggart but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps 
 
 cornelius fudge sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak was standing there staring out at the grounds he started at the sight of harry 
 
 hello there harry he said just had an exam i expect nearly finished 
 
 yes said harry hermione and ron not being on speaking terms with the minister of magic hovered awkwardly in the background 
 
 lovely day said fudge casting an eye over the lake 
 
 pitypity 
 
 he sighed deeply and looked down at harry 
 
 here on an unpleasant mission harry the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff as i needed to visit hogwarts to check on the black situation i was asked to step in 
 
 does that mean the already happened ron interrupted stepping forward 
 
 no no scheduled for this afternoon said fudge looking curiously at ron 
 
 then you might not have to witness an execution at all said ron stoutly the hippogriff might get off 
 
 before fudge could answer two wizards came through the castle doors behind him one was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes the other was tall and strapping with a thin back mustache harry gathered that they were representatives of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures because the very old wizard squinted toward cabin and said in a feeble voice dear dear getting too old for it fudge 
 
 the man was fingering something in his belt harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe ron opened his mouth to say something but hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall 
 
 you stop me said ron angrily as they entered the great hall for lunch did you see them even got the axe ready this justice 
 
 ron your dad works for the ministry you go saying things like that to his boss said hermione but she too looked very upset as long as hagrid keeps his head this time and argues his case properly they possibly execute buckbeak 
 
 but harry could tell hermione really believe what she was saying all around them people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon but harry ron and hermione lost in worry about hagrid and buckbeak join in 
 
 and last exam was divination muggle studies they walked up the marble staircase together hermione left them on the first floor and harry and ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to professor classroom trying to cram in a bit of studying 
 
 seeing us all separately neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him he had his copy of unfogging the future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball he asked them unhappily 
 
 nope said ron in an offhand voice he kept checking his watch harry knew that he was counting down the time until appeal started 
 
 the line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly as each person climbed back down the silver ladder the rest of the class hissed what did she ask was it okay 
 
 but they all refused to say 
 
 she says the crystal told her that if i tell you have a horrible accident squeaked neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward harry and ron who had now reached the landing 
 
 convenient snorted ron you know starting to think hermione was right about her he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead a right old fraud 
 
 yeah said harry looking at his own watch it was now two wish hurry up 
 
 parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride 
 
 she says got all the makings of a true seer she informed harry and ron i saw loads of stuffwell good luck 
 
 she hurried off down the spiral staircase toward lavender 
 
 ronald weasley said the familiar misty voice from over their heads ron grimaced at harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight harry was now the only person left to be tested he settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window his mind across the grounds with hagrid 
 
 finally after about twenty minutes large feet reappeared on the ladder 
 
 it go harry asked him standing up 
 
 rubbish said ron see a thing so i made some stuff up think she was convinced though 
 
 meet you in the common room harry muttered as professor voice called harry potter 
 
 the tower room was hotter than ever before the curtains were closed the fire was alight and the usual sickly scent made harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where professor trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball 
 
 good day my dear she said softly if you would kindly gaze into the orbtake your time nowthen tell me what you see within it 
 
 harry bent over the crystal ball and stared stared as hard as he could willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog but nothing happened 
 
 well professor trelawney prompted delicately what do you see 
 
 the heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them he thought of what ron had just said and decided to pretend 
 
 er said harry a dark shapeum 
 
 what does it resemble whispered professor trelawney think now 
 
 harry cast his mind around and it landed on buckbeak 
 
 a hippogriff he said firmly 
 
 indeed whispered professor trelawney scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees my boy you may well be seeing the outcome of poor trouble with the ministry of magic look closerdoes the hippogriff appear tohave its head 
 
 yes said harry firmly 
 
 are you sure professor trelawney urged him are you quite sure dear you see it writhing on the ground perhaps and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it 
 
 no said harry starting to feel slightly sick 
 
 no blood no weeping hagrid 
 
 no said harry again wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat it looks fine flying away 
 
 professor trelawney sighed 
 
 well dear i think leave it therea little disappointingbut sure you did your best 
 
 relieved harry got up picked up his bag and turned to go but then a loud harsh voice spoke behind him 
 
 it will happen tonight 
 
 harry wheeled around professor trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging 
 
 s sorry said harry 
 
 but professor trelawney seem to hear him her eyes started to roll harry sat there in a panic she looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure he hesitated thinking of running to the hospital wing and then professor trelawney spoke again in the same harsh voice quite unlike her own 
 
 the dark lord lies alone and friendless abandoned by his followers his servant has been chained these twelve years tonight before midnightthe servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master the dark lord will rise again with his aid greater and more terrible than ever he was tonightbefore midnightthe servantwill set outto rejoinhis master 
 
 professor head fell forward onto her chest she made a grunting sort of noise harry sat there staring at her then quite suddenly professor head snapped up again 
 
 so sorry dear boy she said dreamily the heat of the day you knowi drifted off for a moment 
 
 harry sat there staring at her 
 
 is there anything wrong my dear 
 
 you you just told me that the the dark going to rise againthat his going to go back to him 
 
 professor trelawney looked thoroughly startled 
 
 the dark lord my dear boy hardly something to joke aboutrise again indeed 
 
 but you just said it you said the dark lord 
 
 i think you must have dozed off too dear said professor trelawney i would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as as that 
 
 harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase wonderinghad he just heard professor trelawney make a real prediction or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test 
 
 five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to gryffindor tower professor words still resounding in his head people were striding past him in the opposite direction laughing and joking heading for the grounds and a bit of freedom by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room it was almost deserted over in the corner however sat ron and hermione 
 
 professor trelawney harry panted just told me 
 
 but he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces 
 
 buckbeak lost said ron weakly just sent this 
 
 note was dry this time no tears had splattered it yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible 
 
 lost appeal going to execute at sunset nothing you can do come down i want you to see it 
 hagrid 
 got to go said harry at once he just sit there on his own waiting for the executioner 
 
 sunset though said ron who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way never be allowed specially you harry 
 
 harry sank his head into his hands thinking 
 
 if we only had the invisibility cloak 
 
 where is it said hermione 
 
 harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the witch 
 
 if snape sees me anywhere near there again in serious trouble he finished 
 
 true said hermione getting to her feet if he sees youhow do you open the hump again 
 
 you you tap it and say dissendium said harry but 
 
 hermione wait for the rest of his sentence she strode across the room pushed open the fat portrait and vanished from sight 
 
 she gone to get it ron said staring after her 
 
 she had hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes 
 
 hermione i know gotten into you lately said ron astounded first you hit malfoy then you walk out on professor trelawney 
 
 hermione looked rather flattered 
 
 they went down to dinner with everybody else but did not return to gryffindor tower afterward harry had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump they skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall listening until they were sure it was deserted they heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming hermione poked her head around the door 
 
 okay she whispered no one there cloak on 
 
 walking very close together so that nobody would see them they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds the sun was already sinking behind the forbidden forest gilding the top branches of the trees 
 
 they reached cabin and knocked he was a minute in answering and when he did he looked all around for his visitor and trembling 
 
 us harry hissed wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it off 
 
 yeh come hagrid whispered but he stood back and they stepped inside hagrid shut the door quickly and harry pulled off the cloak 
 
 hagrid was not crying nor did he throw himself upon their necks he looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do this helplessness was worse to watch than tears 
 
 wan some tea he said his great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle 
 
 buckbeak hagrid said hermione hesitantly 
 
 i i took him outside said hagrid spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug tethered in me pumpkin patch thought he oughta see the trees an an smell fresh air before 
 
 hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor 
 
 do it hagrid said hermione quickly hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess 
 
 another one in the cupboard hagrid said sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve harry glanced at ron who looked back hopelessly 
 
 there anything anyone can do hagrid harry asked fiercely sitting down next to him dumbledore 
 
 tried said hagrid got no power ter overrule the committee he told em all right but scaredyeh know what lucius likethreatened em i expectan the executioner macnair an old pal o be quick an cleanan be beside him 
 
 hagrid swallowed his eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort 
 
 gonna come down while it while it happens wrote me this mornin said he wants ter ter be with me great man dumbledore 
 
 hermione who had been rummaging in cupboard for another milk jug let out a small quickly stifled sob she straightened up with the new jug in her hands fighting back tears 
 
 stay with you too hagrid she began but hagrid shook his shaggy head 
 
 ter go back up ter the castle i told yeh i don wan yeh watchin an yeh shouldn be down here anywayif fudge an dumbledore catch yeh out without permission harry be in big trouble 
 
 silent tears were now streaming down face but she hid them from hagrid bustling around making tea then as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug she let out a shriek 
 
 ron i believe it scabbers 
 
 ron gaped at her 
 
 what are you talking about 
 
 hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down with a frantic squeak and much scrambling to get back inside scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table 
 
 scabbers said ron blankly scabbers what are you doing here 
 
 he grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light scabbers looked dreadful he was thinner than ever large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches and he writhed in hands as though desperate to free himself 
 
 okay scabbers said ron no cats nothing here to hurt you 
 
 hagrid suddenly stood up his eyes fixed on the window his normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment 
 
 comin 
 
 harry ron and hermione whipped around a group of men was walking down the distant castle steps in front was albus dumbledore his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun next to him trotted cornelius fudge behind them came the feeble old committee member and the executioner macnair 
 
 yeh gotta go said hagrid every inch of him was trembling they mustn find yeh herego now 
 
 ron stuffed scabbers into his pocket and hermione picked up the cloak let yeh out the back way said hagrid 
 
 they followed him to the door into his back garden harry felt strangely unreal and even more so when he saw buckbeak a few yards away tethered to a tree behind pumpkin patch buckbeak seemed to know something was happening he turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously 
 
 okay beaky said hagrid softly okay he turned to harry ron and hermione go on he said get goin 
 
 but they move 
 
 hagrid we 
 
 tell them what really happened 
 
 they kill him 
 
 go said hagrid fiercely bad enough without you lot in trouble an all 
 
 they had no choice as hermione threw the cloak over harry and ron they heard voices at the front of the cabin hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight 
 
 go quick he said hoarsely don listen 
 
 and he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door 
 
 slowly in a kind of horrified trance harry ron and hermione set off silently around house as they reached the other side the front door closed with a sharp snap 
 
 please hurry hermione whispered i stand it i bear it 
 
 they started up the sloping lawn toward the castle the sun was sinking fast now the sky had turned to a clear gray but to the west there was a glow 
 
 ron stopped dead 
 
 oh please ron hermione began 
 
 scabbers he stay put 
 
 ron was bent over trying to keep scabbers in his pocket but the rat was going berserk squeaking madly twisting and flailing trying to sink his teeth into hand 
 
 scabbers me you idiot ron ron hissed 
 
 they heard a door open behind them and voices 
 
 oh ron please move going to do it hermione breathed 
 
 okay scabbers stay put 
 
 they walked forward harry like hermione was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them ron stopped again 
 
 i hold him scabbers shut up hear us 
 
 the rat was squealing wildly but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from garden there was a jumble of indistinct male voices a silence and then without warning the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe 
 
 hermione swayed on the spot 
 
 they did it she whispered to harry believe it they did it 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban
