 ext el train 
 an el train rages against its metal rails 
 
 int train 
 it is three and the train carries the usual urban 
 night crawlers neo sits alone eyes shifting watching 
 everything nervously 
 there is a metal bang and train clatter fills the car as 
 the door is opened 
 neo turns and sees a large man enter he is wearing 
 sunglasses and a black leather jacket his name is apoc 
 and he walks straight at neo 
 apoc 
 come with me 
 neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and 
 two police officers rush in drawing their guns 
 apoc grabs neo muscling him to the nearest exit there 
 is no upcoming station 
 apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles 
 against its own speed the cops are thrown back neo 
 slams against the metal rail 
 the doors open onto nothing and just when neo regains his 
 balance apoc shoves him backwards 
 he flies out from the train arms windrilling as he falls 
 from the raised tracks 
 hurtling towards a busy city street when out of nowhere 
 a truck races under him and 
 he crashes into a large filled with empty 
 boxes 
 
 int truck bed 
 still shaking his head neo realizes he is not alone a 
 man named cabie is aiming a big gun at him trinity is 
 next to him talking into a cellular phone 
 trinity 
 we got him call the 
 she hangs up 
 trinity 
 listen to me neo you have to 
 trust us 
 she tears off a long strip of black and reaches 
 for his face 
 neo 
 what are you doing 
 trinity 
 this has to be done for your protection and ours 
 she seals his eyes shut with the tape 
 trinity 
 you understand right now but if not one of us 
 one of them 
 
 ext lower wacker 
 a featureless black van glides up to a staircase that 
 curls down from the surface 
 trinity guides the blind neo down the steps the back of 
 the van slaps open revealing a young skinny man who 
 looks to be still in his teens wearing an outfit that is 
 a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man 
 his name is gizmo and he smiles lewdly at trinity 
 exposing his teeth that are wired with 
 braces 
 gizmo 
 va va va voom still the hottest software around 
 trinity 
 hello gizmo 
 neo hears the voices around him 
 gizmo 
 this is really the guy the guy that morpheus thinks 
 trinity 
 yeah 
 gizmo 
 but so old 
 trinity 
 are you going to help us or you 
 gizmo 
 hacksaw load up the and get the hell outta here 
 hacksaw is a huge man in a leather apron he 
 shoulders neo and hauls him into the van 
 a moment later the green lights of lower wacker curve 
 over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the 
 underworld 
 
 int van 
 the is filled with electronic gadgets wired to 
 meters and monitors there are shelves lined with 
 medical supplies and rows of hanging tools knives 
 cleavers and stainless steel clamps 
 neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart listening 
 nervously as gizmo gets to work 
 gizmo 
 okay first we take a little look under the hood 
 he pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they 
 blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising 
 to varying levels of magnification 
 gizmo 
 going to feel a little prick 
 he inserts needles into lower 
 abdomen the needles are wired to video monitors 
 hacksaw pilots the lens 
 neo 
 what are you doing 
 trinity 
 we think bugged we take you to morpheus 
 until clean 
 gizmo 
 there it is 
 on a monitor we see the bug nestled in among neols large 
 intestines 
 gizmo 
 hit him with ccs of local 
 hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic 
 around neols navel 
 using a device that looks like a miniature speculum 
 gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick typing into a 
 calculator keypad wired to the pick he automates the 
 tip 
 on the monitor we watch it telescope out and the end 
 separate into a tiny hooked metal claw 
 gizmo 
 here kitty kitty kitty 
 the claw snags hold of the bug 
 gizmo 
 gotcha 
 but the bug reacts violently neo screams as it wraps 
 itself around the soft tissue web of intestine 
 gizmo 
 shit 
 trinity 
 happening 
 gizmo 
 i know never done that before 
 neo writhes in pain 
 gizmo 
 hold him down 
 neo 
 jesus god 
 trinity 
 do something 
 gizmo 
 i got it maybe we can stun it 
 trinity 
 are you crazy that will kill him 
 we watch neo who see what they are talking about 
 gizmo 
 work come on do it or hacksaw will 
 neo 
 do what 
 the instant he hears the word he knows 
 trinity 
 clear 
 neo 
 oh shit 
 the cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his 
 chest gizmo wrestles with the bug 
 gizmo 
 hit him again 
 again the electricity convulses through him as gizmo 
 yanks the speculum out 
 gizmo 
 got it 
 trinity touches neo who is just beginning to breathe 
 she eases the tape off his eyes 
 trinity 
 neo are you okay 
 he nods 
 trinity 
 over we got it 
 hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire 
 tap 
 gizmo 
 nasty little bugger it 
 
 int hotel lafayette 
 the van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten 
 hotel the doors open and trinity helps neo get out 
 trinity 
 thanks for your help gizmo 
 gizmo 
 i just hope the man knows what 
 doing 
 she nods then climbs out of the van gizmo ogles the 
 tight leather pants 
 gizmo 
 goddamn what i give for 
 a copy of that software 
 trinity turns around 
 trinity 
 gizmo you have the hardware 
 to handle this software 
 he howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away 
 trinity turns to neo 
 trinity 
 go waiting 
 
 int hotel lafayette 
 it is a place of putrefying elegance a rotting host of 
 urban maggotry 
 trinity leads neo from the stairwell down the hall of the 
 thirteenth floor they stop outside room 
 trinity 
 this is it 
 neo can hear his own heart pounding 
 trinity 
 let me give one piece of advice be honest he knows more than you can possibly imagine

lionfish nov chapter seven mudbloods and murmurscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw gilderoy lockhart coming down a corridor harder to avoid was colin creevey who seemed to have memorized schedule nothing seemed to give colin a bigger thrill than to say all right harry six or seven times a day and hear hello colin back however exasperated harry sounded when he said it 
 
 hedwig was still angry with harry about the disastrous car journey and wand was still malfunctioning surpassing itself on friday morning by shooting out of hand in charms and hitting tiny old professor flitwick squarely between the eyes creating a large throbbing green boil where it had struck so with one thing and another harry was quite glad to reach the weekend he ron and hermione were planning to visit hagrid on saturday morning harry however was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by oliver wood captain of the gryffindor quidditch team 
 
 whassamatter said harry groggily 
 
 quidditch practice said wood come on 
 
 harry squinted at the window there was a thin mist hanging across the sky now that he was awake he understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making 
 
 oliver harry croaked the crack of dawn 
 
 exactly said wood he was a tall and burly sixth year and at the moment his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm part of our new training program come on grab your broom and go said wood heartily none of the other teams have started training yet going to be first off the mark this year 
 
 yawning and shivering slightly harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his quidditch robes 
 
 good man said wood meet you on the field in fifteen minutes 
 
 when found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth harry scribbled a note to ron explaining where gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room his nimbus two thousand on his shoulder he had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and colin creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand 
 
 i heard someone saying your name on the stairs harry look what got here had it developed i wanted to show you 
 
 harry looked bemusedly at the photograph colin was brandishing under his nose 
 
 a moving lockhart was tugging hard on an arm harry recognized as his own he was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view as harry watched lockhart gave up and slumped panting against the white edge of the picture 
 
 will you sign it said colin eagerly 
 
 no said harry flatly glancing around to check that the room was really deserted sorry colin in a hurry quidditch practice 
 
 he climbed through the portrait hole 
 
 oh wow wait for me never watched a quidditch game before 
 
 colin scrambled through the hole after him 
 
 be really boring harry said quickly but colin ignored him his face shining with excitement 
 
 you were the youngest house player in a hundred years you harry you said colin trotting alongside him you must be brilliant never flown is it easy is that your own broom is that the best one there is 
 
 harry know how to get rid of him it was like having an extremely talkative shadow 
 
 i really understand quidditch said colin breathlessly is it true there are four balls and two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms 
 
 yes said harry heavily resigned to explaining the complicated rules of quidditch called bludgers there are two beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the bludgers away from their side fred and george weasley are the gryffindor beaters 
 
 and what are the other balls for colin asked tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing at harry 
 
 well the quaffle the biggish red one is the one that scores goals three chasers on each team throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch three long poles with hoops on the end 
 
 and the fourth ball 
 
 is the golden snitch said harry and very small very fast and difficult to catch but what the got to do because a game of quidditch end until the snitch has been caught and whichever seeker gets the snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points 
 
 and the gryffindor seeker you said colin in awe 
 
 yes said harry as they left the castle and started across the grass and the keeper too he guards the goal posts it really 
 
 but colin stop questioning harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the quidditch field and harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms colin called after him in a piping voice go and get a good seat harry and hurried off to the stands 
 
 the rest of the gryffindor team were already in the changing room wood was the only person who looked truly awake fred and george weasley were sitting and touslehaired next to fourth year alicia spinnet who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her her fellow chasers katie bell and angelina johnson were yawning side by side opposite them 
 
 there you are harry what kept you said wood briskly now i wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field because i spent the summer devising a whole new training program which i really think will make all the difference 
 
 wood was holding up a large diagram of a quidditch field on which were drawn many lines arrows and crosses in different colored inks he took out his wand tapped the board and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars as wood launched into a speech about his new tactics fred head drooped right onto alicia shoulder and he began to snore 
 
 the first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain but there was another board under that and a third under that one harry sank into a stupor as wood droned on and on 
 
 so said wood at long last jerking harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle is that clear any questions 
 
 got a question oliver said george who had woken with a start why you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake 
 
 wood pleased 
 
 now listen here you lot he said glowering at them all we should have won the quidditch cup last year easily the best team but unfortunately owing to circumstances beyond our control 
 
 harry shifted guiltily in his seat he had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year meaning that gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years 
 
 wood took a moment to regain control of himself their last defeat was clearly still torturing him 
 
 so this year we train harder than ever before okay go and put our new theories into practice wood shouted seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms and still yawning his team followed 
 
 they had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium as harry walked onto the field he saw ron and hermione sitting in the stands 
 
 you finished yet called ron incredulously 
 
 even started said harry looking jealously at the toast and marmalade ron and hermione had brought out of the great hall been teaching us new moves 
 
 he mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground soaring up into the air the cool morning air whipped his face waking him far more effectively than long talk it felt wonderful to be back on the quidditch field he soared right around the stadium at full speed racing fred and george 
 
 that funny clicking noise called fred as they hurtled around the corner 
 
 harry looked into the stands colin was sitting in one of the highest seats his camera raised taking picture after picture the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium 
 
 look this way harry this way he cried shrilly 
 
 that said fred 
 
 no idea harry lied putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from colin 
 
 going on said wood frowning as he skimmed through the air toward them that first year taking pictures i like it he could be a slytherin spy trying to find out about our new training program 
 
 in gryffindor said harry quickly 
 
 and the slytherins need a spy oliver said george 
 
 what makes you say that said wood testily 
 
 because here in person said george pointing 
 
 several people in green robes were walking onto the field broomsticks in their hands 
 
 i believe it wood hissed in outrage i booked the field for today see about this 
 
 wood shot toward the ground landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger staggering slightly as he dismounted harry fred and george followed 
 
 flint wood bellowed at the slytherin captain this is our practice time we got up specially you can clear off now 
 
 marcus flint was even larger than wood he had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied plenty of room for all of us wood 
 
 angelina alicia and katie had come over too there were no girls on the slytherin team who stood shoulder to shoulder facing the gryffindors leering to a man 
 
 but i booked the field said wood positively spitting with rage i booked it 
 
 ah said flint but got a specially signed note here from professor snape i professor s snape give the slytherin team permission to practice today on the quidditch field owing to the need to train their new seeker 
 
 got a new seeker said wood distracted where 
 
 and from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh smaller boy smirking all over his pale pointed face it was draco malfoy 
 
 you lucius son said fred looking at malfoy with dislike 
 
 funny you should mention father said flint as the whole slytherin team smiled still more broadly let me show you the generous gift made to the slytherin team 
 
 all seven of them held out their broomsticks seven highly polished handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words nimbus two thousand and one gleamed under the in the early morning sun 
 
 very latest model only came out last month said flint carelessly flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own i believe it outstrips the old two thousand series by a considerable amount as for the old cleansweeps he smiled nastily at fred and george who were both clutching cleansweep fives sweeps the board with them 
 
 none of the gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits 
 
 oh look said flint a field invasion 
 
 ron and hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on 
 
 happening ron asked harry why you playing and he doing here 
 
 he was looking at malfoy taking in his slytherin quidditch robes 
 
 the new slytherin seeker weasley said malfoy smugly just been admiring the brooms my bought our team 
 
 ron gaped at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him 
 
 good they said malfoy smoothly but perhaps the gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms too you could raffle off those cleansweep fives i expect a museum would bid for them 
 
 the slytherin team howled with laughter 
 
 at least no one on the gryffindor team had to buy their way in said hermione sharply they got in on pure talent 
 
 the smug look on face flickered 
 
 no one asked your opinion you filthy little mudblood he spat 
 
 harry knew at once that malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words flint had to dive in front of malfoy to stop fred and george jumping on him alicia shrieked how dare you and ron plunged his hand into his robes pulled out his wand yelling pay for that one malfoy and pointed it furiously under arm at malfoys face 
 
 a loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of wand hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass 
 
 ron ron are you all right squealed hermione 
 
 ron opened his mouth to speak but no words came out instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap 
 
 the slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter flint was doubled up hanging onto his new broomstick for support malfoy was on all fours banging the ground with his fist the gryffindors were gathered around ron who kept belching large glistening slugs nobody seemed to want to touch him 
 
 better get him to nearest said harry to hermione who nodded bravely and the pair of them pulled ron up by the arms 
 
 what happened harry what happened is he ill but you can cure him you colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front 
 
 oooh said colin fascinated and raising his camera can you hold him still harry 
 
 get out of the way colin said harry angrily he and hermione supported ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest 
 
 nearly there ron said hermione as the cabin came into view be all right in a minute almost there 
 
 they were within twenty feet of house when the front door opened but it hagrid who emerged gilderoy lockhart wearing robes of palest mauve today came striding out 
 
 quick behind here harry hissed dragging ron behind a nearby bush hermione followed somewhat reluctantly 
 
 a simple matter if you know what doing lockhart was saying loudly to hagrid if you need help you know where i am let you have a copy of my book surprised you already got one sign one tonight and send it over well and he strode away toward the castle 
 
 harry waited until lockhart was out of sight then pulled ron out of the bush and up to front door they knocked urgently 
 
 hagrid appeared at once looking very grumpy but his expression brightened when he saw who it was 
 
 bin come ter see me come in come in thought you mighta bin professor lockhart back again 
 
 harry and hermione supported ron over the threshold into the cabin which had an enormous bed in one corner a fire crackling merrily in the other hagrid seem perturbed by slug problem which harry hastily explained as he lowered ron into a chair 
 
 better out than in he said cheerfully plunking a large copper basin in front of him get em all up ron 
 
 i think anything to do except wait for it to stop said hermione anxiously watching ron bend over the basin a difficult curse to work at the best of times but with a broken wand 
 
 hagrid was bustling around making them tea his boarhound fang was slobbering over harry 
 
 what did lockhart want with you hagrid harry asked scratching ears 
 
 advice on out of a well growled hagrid moving a rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot like i about some banshee he banished if one word of it was true eat my kettle 
 
 it was most unlike hagrid to criticize a and harry looked at him in surprise hermione however said in a voice somewhat higher than usual i think being a bit unfair professor dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job 
 
 he was the man for the job said hagrid offering them a plate of treacle fudge while ron coughed squelchily into his basin mean the one difficult ter find anyone fer the dark arts job people too keen ter take it on see think jinxed no lasted long fer a while now so tell me said hagrid jerking his head at ron who was he curse 
 
 malfoy called hermione something it been really bad because everyone went wild 
 
 it was bad said ron hoarsely emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty malfoy called her 
 
 ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance hagrid looked outraged 
 
 he didn he growled at hermione 
 
 he did she said but i know what it means i could tell it was really rude of course 
 
 about the most insulting thing he could think of gasped ron coming back up a really foul name for someone who is you know parents there are some wizards like family who think better than everyone else because what people call he gave a small burp and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand he threw it into the basin and continued i mean the rest of us know it make any difference at all look at neville longbottom and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up 
 
 invented a spell our hermione said hagrid proudly making hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta 
 
 a disgusting thing to call someone said ron wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand dirty blood see common blood ridiculous most wizards these days are anyway if we married muggles died out 
 
 he retched and ducked out of sight again 
 
 well i yeh fer curse him ron said hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin it was a good thing yer wand backfired spect lucius malfoy come ter school if cursed his son least yer not in trouble 
 
 harry would have pointed out that trouble come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth but he treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together 
 
 harry said hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought gotta bone ter pick with yeh heard bin signed photos how come i got one 
 
 furious harry wrenched his teeth apart 
 
 i have not been giving out signed photos he said hotly if still spreading that around 
 
 but then he saw that hagrid was laughing 
 
 jokin he said patting harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table i knew yeh really i told lockhart yeh teh yer more famous than him without tryin 
 
 bet he like that said harry sitting up and rubbing his chin 
 
 he did said hagrid his eyes twinkling i told him never read one books decided ter go treacle fudge ron he added as ron reappeared 
 
 no thanks said ron weakly better not risk it 
 
 come what bin growin said hagrid as harry and hermione finished the last of their tea 
 
 in the small vegetable patch behind house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins harry had ever seen each was the size of a large boulder 
 
 well they said hagrid happily fer the halloween feast should be big enough by then 
 
 you been feeding them said harry 
 
 hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone 
 
 well bin you know a bit 
 
 harry noticed flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked in fact he had the strong impression that old school wand was concealed inside it hagrid supposed to use magic he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third year but harry had never found out why any mention of the matter and hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed 
 
 an engorgement charm i suppose said hermione halfway between disapproval and amusement well done a good job on them 
 
 what yer little sister said said hagrid nodding at ron met her hagrid looked sideways at harry his beard twitching said she was the grounds but i reckon she was might run inter someone else at my house he winked at harry if yeh ask me she no ter a signed 
 
 oh shut up said harry ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs 
 
 watch it hagrid roared pulling ron away from his precious pumpkins 
 
 it was nearly lunchtime and as harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn he was keen to go back to school to eat they said to hagrid and walked back up to the castle ron hiccoughing occasionally but only bringing up two very small slugs 
 
 they had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out there you are potter weasley professor mcgonagall was walking toward them looking stern you will both do your detentions this evening 
 
 we doing professor said ron nervously suppressing a burp 
 
 you will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with mr filch said professor mcgonagall and no magic weasley elbow grease 
 
 ron gulped argus filch the caretaker was loathed by every student in the school 
 
 and you potter will be helping professor lockhart answer his fan mail said professor mcgonagall 
 
 oh n professor i go and do the trophy room too said harry desperately 
 
 certainly not said professor mcgonagall raising her eyebrows professor lockhart requested you particularly eight sharp both of you 
 
 harry and ron slouched into the great hall in states of deepest gloom hermione behind them wearing a sort of expression harry enjoy his pie as much as thought both he and ron felt got the worse deal 
 
 have me there all night said ron heavily no magic there must be about a hundred cups in that room no good at muggle cleaning 
 
 swap anytime said harry hollowly had loads of practice with the dursleys answering fan mail be a nightmare 
 
 saturday afternoon seemed to melt away and in what seemed like no time it was five minutes to eight and harry was dragging his feet along the corridor to office he gritted his teeth and knocked 
 
 the door flew open at once lockhart beamed down at him 
 
 ah the scalawag he said come in harry come in 
 
 shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of lockhart he had even signed a few of them another large pile lay on his desk 
 
 you can address the envelopes lockhart told harry as though this was a huge treat 
 
 this first to gladys gudgeon bless her huge fan of mine 
 
 the minutes snailed by harry let voice wash over him occasionally saying mmm and right and yeah now and then he caught a phrase like a fickle friend harry or celebrity is as celebrity does remember that 
 
 the candles burned lower and lower making the light dance over the many moving faces of lockhart watching him harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope writing out veronica address it must be nearly time to leave harry thought miserably please let it be nearly time 
 
 and then he heard something something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and prattle about his fans 
 
 it was a voice a voice to chill the bone marrow a voice of breathtaking venom 
 
 come come to me let me rip you let me tear you let me kill you 
 
 harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on veronica street 
 
 what he said loudly 
 
 i know said lockhart six solid months at the top of the list broke all records 
 
 no said harry frantically that voice 
 
 sorry said lockhart looking puzzled what voice 
 
 that that voice that said you hear it 
 
 lockhart was looking at harry in high astonishment 
 
 what are you talking about harry perhaps getting a little drowsy great scott look at the time been here nearly four hours never have believed it the flown it 
 
 harry answer he was straining his ears to hear the voice again but there was no sound now except for lockhart telling him he expect a treat like this every time he got detention feeling dazed harry left 
 
 it was so late that the gryffindor common room was almost empty harry went straight up to the dormitory ron back yet harry pulled on his pajamas got into bed and waited half an hour later ron arrived nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room 
 
 my muscles have all seized up he groaned sinking on his bed fourteen times he made me buff up that quidditch cup before he was satisfied and then i had another slug attack all over a special award for services to the school took ages to get the slime off how was it with lockhart 
 
 keeping his voice low so as not to wake neville dean and seamus harry told ron exactly what he had heard 
 
 and lockhart said he hear it said ron harry could see him frowning in the moonlight think he was lying but i get it even someone invisible had to open the door 
 
 i know said harry lying back in his and staring at the canopy above him i get it either 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven the boggart in the wardrobecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 malfoy reappear in classes until late on thursday morning when the slytherins and gryffindors were halfway through double potions he swaggered into the dungeon his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling acting in opinion as though he were the heroic survivor of some dreadful battle 
 
 how is it draco simpered pansy parkinson does it hurt much 
 
 yeah said malfoy putting on a brave sort of grimace but harry saw him wink at crabbe and goyle when pansy had looked away 
 
 settle down settle down said professor snape idly 
 
 harry and ron scowled at each other snape have said settle down if walked in late have given them detention but malfoy had always been able to get away with anything in classes snape was head of slytherin house and generally favored his own students above all others 
 
 they were making a new potion today a shrinking solution malfoy set up his cauldron right next to harry and ron so that they were preparing their ingredients on the same table 
 
 sir malfoy called sir need help cutting up these daisy roots because of my arm 
 
 weasley cut up roots for him said snape without looking up 
 
 ron went brick red 
 
 nothing wrong with your arm he hissed at malfoy 
 
 malfoy smirked across the table 
 
 weasley you heard professor snape cut up these roots 
 
 ron seized his knife pulled roots toward him and began to chop them roughly so that they were all different sizes 
 
 professor drawled malfoy mutilating my roots sir 
 
 snape approached their table stared down his hooked nose at the roots then gave ron an unpleasant smile from beneath his long greasy black hair 
 
 change roots with malfoy weasley 
 
 but sir 
 
 ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his own roots into exactly equal pieces 
 
 now said snape in his most dangerous voice 
 
 ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at malfoy then took up the knife again 
 
 and sir need this shrivelfig skinned said malfoy his voice full of malicious laughter 
 
 potter you can skin shrivelfig said snape giving harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him 
 
 harry took shrivelfig as ron began trying to repair the damage to the roots he now had to use harry skinned the shrivelfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at malfoy without speaking malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever 
 
 seen your pal hagrid lately he asked them quietly 
 
 none of your business said ron jerkily without looking up 
 
 afraid he be a teacher much longer said malfoy in a tone of mock sorrow not very happy about my injury 
 
 keep talking malfoy and give you a real injury snarled ron 
 
 c complained to the school governors and to the ministry of magic got a lot of influence you know and a lasting injury like this he gave a huge fake sigh who knows if my ever be the same again 
 
 so why putting it on said harry accidentally beheading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger to try to get hagrid fired 
 
 well said malfoy lowering his voice to a whisper partly potter but there are other benefits too weasley slice my caterpillars for me 
 
 a few cauldrons away neville was in trouble neville regularly went to pieces in potions lessons it was his worst subject and his great fear of professor snape made things ten times worse his potion which was supposed to be a bright acid green had turned 
 
 orange longbottom said snape ladling some up and allowing to splash back into the cauldron so that everyone could see 
 
 orange tell me boy does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours you hear me say quite clearly that only one cat spleen was needed i state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice what do i have to do to make you understand longbottom 
 
 neville was pink and trembling he looked as though he was on the verge of tears 
 
 please sir said hermione please i could help neville put it right 
 
 i remember asking you to show off miss granger said snape coldly and hermione went as pink as neville longbottom at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly 
 
 snape moved away leaving neville breathless with fear 
 
 help me he moaned to hermione 
 
 hey harry said seamus finnigan leaning over to borrow brass scales have you heard daily prophet this morning they reckon sirius been sighted 
 
 where said harry and ron quickly on the other side of the table malfoy looked up listening closely 
 
 not too far from here said seamus who looked excited it was a muggle who saw him course she really understand the muggles think just an ordinary criminal they so she phoned the telephone hot line by the time the ministry of magic got there he was gone 
 
 not too far from here ron repeated looking significantly at harry he turned around and saw malfoy watching closely what malfoy need something else skinned 
 
 but eyes were shining malevolently and they were fixed harry he leaned across the table 
 
 thinking of trying to catch black potter 
 
 yeah right said harry offhandedly 
 
 thin mouth was curving in a mean smile 
 
 of course if it was me he said quietly have done something before now i be staying in school like a good boy be out there looking for him 
 
 what are you talking about malfoy said ron roughly 
 
 you know potter breathed malfoy his pale eyes narrowed 
 
 know what 
 
 malfoy let out a low sneering laugh 
 
 maybe rather not risk your neck he said want to leave it to the dementors do you but if it was me want revenge hunt him down myself 
 
 what are you talking about said harry angrily but at that moment snape called you should have finished adding your ingredients by now this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk so clear away while it simmers and then test 
 
 crabbe and goyle laughed openly watching neville sweat as he stirred his potion feverishly hermione was muttering instructions to him out of the corner of her mouth so that snape see harry and ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner 
 
 what did malfoy mean harry muttered to ron as he stuck his hands under the icy jet that poured from the mouth why would i want revenge on black he done anything to me yet 
 
 making it up said ron savagely trying to make you do something stupid 
 
 the end of the lesson in sight snape strode over to neville who was cowering by his cauldron 
 
 everyone gather round said snape his black eyes glittering and watch what happens to toad if he has managed to produce a shrinking solution it will shrink to a tadpole if as i doubt he has done it wrong his toad is likely to be poisoned 
 
 the gryffindors watched fearfully the slytherins looked excited snape picked up trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped a small spoon into potion which was now green he trickled a few drops down throat 
 
 there was a moment of hushed silence in which trevor gulped then there was a small pop and trevor the tadpole was wriggling in palm 
 
 the gryffindors burst into applause snape looking sour pulled a small bottle from the pocket of his robe poured a few drops on top of trevor and he reappeared suddenly fully grown 
 
 five points from gryffindor said snape which wiped the smiles from every face i told you not to help him miss granger class dismissed 
 
 harry ron and hermione climbed the steps to the entrance hall harry was still thinking about what malfoy had said while ron was seething about snape 
 
 five points from gryffindor because the potion was all right why you lie hermione you said neville did it all by himself 
 
 hermione answer ron looked around 
 
 where is she 
 
 harry turned too they were at the top of the steps now watching the rest of the class pass them heading for the great hall and lunch 
 
 she was right behind us said ron frowning 
 
 malfoy passed them walking between crabbe and goyle he smirked at harry and disappeared 
 
 there she is said harry 
 
 hermione was panting slightly hurrying up the stairs one hand clutched her bag the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robes 
 
 how did you do that said ron 
 
 what said hermione joining them 
 
 one minute you were right behind us the next moment you were back at the bottom of the stairs again 
 
 what hermione looked slightly confused oh i had to go back for something oh no 
 
 a seam had split on bag harry surprised he could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy books 
 
 why are you carrying all these around with you ron asked her 
 
 you know how many subjects taking said hermione breathlessly hold these for me could you 
 
 but ron was turning over the books she had handed him looking at the covers you got any of these subjects today only defense against the dark arts this afternoon 
 
 oh yes said hermione vaguely but she packed all the books back into her bag just the same i hope something good for lunch starving she added and she marched off toward the great hall 
 
 get the feeling not telling us something ron asked harry 
 
 
 
 professor lupin there when they arrived at his first defense against the dark arts lesson they all sat down took out their books quills and parchment and were talking when he finally entered the room lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the desk he was as shabby as ever but looked healthier than he had on the train as though he had had a few square meals 
 
 good afternoon he said would you please put all your books back in your bags will be a practical lesson you will need only your wands 
 
 a few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their books they had never had a practical defense against the dark arts class before unless you counted the memorable class last year when their old teacher had brought a cageful of pixies to class and set them loose 
 
 right then said professor lupin when everyone was ready if follow me 
 
 puzzled but interested the class got to its feet and followed professor lupin out of the classroom he led them along the deserted corridor and around a corner where the first thing they saw was peeves the poltergeist who was floating upside down in midair and stuffing the nearest keyhole with chewing gum 
 
 peeves look up until professor lupin was two feet away then he wiggled his feet and broke into song 
 
 loony loopy lupin peeves sang loony loopy lupin loony loopy lupin 
 
 rude and unmanageable as he almost always was peeves usually showed some respect toward the teachers everyone looked quickly at professor lupin to see how he would take this to their surprise he was still smiling 
 
 take that gum out of the keyhole if i were you peeves he said pleasantly mr filch be able to get in to his brooms 
 
 filch was the hogwarts caretaker a failed wizard who waged a constant war against the students and indeed peeves however peeves paid no attention to professor words except to blow a loud wet raspberry 
 
 professor lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand 
 
 this is a useful little spell he told the class over his shoulder please watch closely 
 
 he raised the wand to shoulder height said waddiwasi and pointed it at peeves 
 
 with the force of a bullet the wad of chewing gum shot out of the keyhole and straight down left nostril he whirled upright and zoomed away cursing 
 
 cool sir said dean thomas in amazement 
 
 thank you dean said professor lupin putting his wand away again shall we proceed 
 
 they set off again the class looking at shabby professor lupin with increased respect he led them down a second corridor and stopped right outside the staffroom door 
 
 inside please said professor lupin opening it and standing back 
 
 the staffroom a long paneled room full of old mismatched chairs was empty except for one teacher professor snape was sitting in a low armchair and he looked around as the class filed in his eyes were glittering and there was a nasty sneer playing around his mouth as professor lupin came in and made to close the door behind him snape said leave it open lupin rather not witness this he got to his feet and strode past the class his black robes billowing behind him at the doorway he turned on his heel and said possibly no warned you lupin but this class contains neville longbottom i would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult not unless miss granger is hissing instructions in his ear 
 
 neville went scarlet harry glared at snape it was bad enough that he bullied neville in his own classes let alone doing it in front of other teachers 
 
 professor lupin had raised his eyebrows 
 
 i was hoping that neville would assist me with the first stage of the operation he said and i am sure he will perform it admirably 
 
 face went if possible even redder lip curled but he left shutting the door with a snap 
 
 now then said professor lupin beckoning the class toward the end of the room where there was nothing but an old wardrobe where the teachers kept their spare robes as professor lupin went to stand next to it the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble banging off the wall 
 
 nothing to worry about said professor lupin calmly because a few people had jumped backward in alarm a boggart in there 
 
 most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry about neville gave professor lupin a look of pure terror and seamus finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively 
 
 boggarts like dark enclosed spaces said professor lupin wardrobes the gap beneath beds the cupboards under sinks even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock this one moved in yesterday afternoon and i asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice 
 
 so the first question we must ask ourselves is what is a boggart 
 
 hermione put up her hand 
 
 a she said it can take the shape of whatever it thinks will frighten us most 
 
 have put it better myself said professor lupin and hermione glowed so the boggart sitting in the darkness within has not yet assumed a form he does not yet know what will frighten the person on the other side of the door nobody knows what a boggart looks like when he is alone but when i let him out he will immediately become whatever each of us most fears 
 
 this means said professor lupin choosing to ignore small sputter of terror that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin have you spotted it harry 
 
 trying to answer a question with hermione next to him bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the air was very but harry had a go 
 
 er because there are so many of us it know what shape it should be 
 
 precisely said professor lupin and hermione put her hand down looking a little disappointed always best to have company when dealing with a boggart he becomes confused which should he become a headless corpse or a slug i once saw a boggart make that very mistake tried to frighten two people at once and turned himself into half a slug not remotely frightening 
 
 the charm that repels a boggart is simple yet it requires force of mind you see the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter what you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find amusing 
 
 we will practice the charm without wands first after me pleaseriddikulus 
 
 riddikulus said the class together 
 
 good said professor lupin very good but that was the easy part afraid you see the word alone is not enough and this is where you come in neville 
 
 the wardrobe shook again though not as much as neville who walked forward as though he were heading for the gallows 
 
 right neville said professor lupin first things first what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world 
 
 lips moved but no noise came out 
 
 i catch that neville sorry said professor lupin cheerfully 
 
 neville looked around rather wildly as though begging someone to help him then said in barely more than a whisper professor snape 
 
 nearly everyone laughed even neville grinned apologetically professor lupin however looked thoughtful 
 
 professor snapehmmmneville i believe you live with your grandmother 
 
 er yes said neville nervously but i want the boggart to turn into her either 
 
 no no you misunderstand me said professor lupin now smiling i wonder could you tell us what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears 
 
 neville looked startled but said wellalways the same hat a tall one with a stuffed vulture on top and a long dressgreen normallyand sometimes a scarf 
 
 and a handbag prompted professor lupin 
 
 a big red one said neville 
 
 right then said professor lupin can you picture those clothes very clearly neville can you see them in your eye 
 
 yes said neville uncertainty plainly wondering what was coming next 
 
 when the boggart bursts out of this wardrobe neville and sees you it will assume the form of professor snape said lupin and you will raise your wand thus and cry riddikulus and concentrate hard on your clothes if all goes well professor boggart snape will be forced into that hat and that green dress with that big red handbag 
 
 there was a great shout of laughter the wardrobe wobbled more violently 
 
 if neville is successful the boggart is likely to shift his attention to each of us in turn said professor lupin i would like all of you to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most and imagine how you might force it to look comical 
 
 the room went quiet harry thoughtwhat scared him most in the world 
 
 his first thought was lord voldemort a voldemort returned to full strength but before he had even started to plan a possible counterattack on a a horrible image came floating to the surface of his mind 
 
 a rotting glistening hand slithering back beneath a black cloaka long rattling breath from an unseen mouththen a cold so penetrating it felt like drowning 
 
 harry shivered then looked around hoping no one had noticed many people had their eyes shut tight ron was muttering to himself take its legs off harry was sure he knew what that was about greatest fear was spiders 
 
 everyone ready said professor lupin 
 
 harry felt a lurch of fear he ready how could you make a dementor less frightening but he want to ask for more time everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves 
 
 neville going to back away said professor lupin let you have a clear field all right call the next person forwardeveryone back now so neville can get a clear shot 
 
 they all retreated backed against the walls leaving neville alone beside the wardrobe he looked pale and frightened but he had pushed up the sleeves of his robes and was holding his wand ready 
 
 on the count of three neville said professor lupin who was pointing his own wand at the handle of the wardrobe one two three now 
 
 a jet of sparks shot from the end of professor wand and hit the doorknob the wardrobe burst open and menacing professor snape stepped out his eyes flashing at neville 
 
 neville backed away his wand up mouthing wordlessly snape was bearing down upon him reaching inside his robes 
 
 r r riddikulus squeaked neville 
 
 there was a noise like a whip crack snape stumbled he was wearing a long dress and a towering hat topped with a vulture and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag 
 
 there was a roar of laughter the boggart paused confused and professor lupin shouted parvati forward 
 
 parvati walked forward her face set snape rounded on her there was another crack and where he had stood was a bloodstained bandaged mummy its sightless face was turned to parvati and it began to walk toward her very slowly dragging its feet its stiff arms rising 
 
 riddikulus cried parvati 
 
 a bandage unraveled at the feet it became entangled fell face forward and its head rolled off 
 
 seamus roared professor lupin 
 
 seamus darted past parvati 
 
 crack where the mummy had been was a woman with floorlength black hair and a skeletal face a banshee she opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the room a long wailing shriek that made the hair on head stand on end riddikulus shouted seamus 
 
 the banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat her voice was gone 
 
 crack the banshee turned into a rat which chased its tail in a circle then crack became a rattlesnake which slithered and writhed before crack becoming a single bloody eyeball 
 
 confused shouted lupin getting there dean 
 
 dean hurried forward 
 
 crack the eyeball became a severed hand which flipped over and began to creep along the floor like a crab 
 
 riddikulus yelled dean 
 
 there was a snap and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap 
 
 excellent ron you next 
 
 ron leapt forward 
 
 crack 
 
 quite a few people screamed a giant spider six feet tall and covered in hair was advancing on ron clicking its pincers menacingly for a moment harry thought ron had frozen then 
 
 riddikulus bellowed ron and the legs vanished it rolled over and over lavender brown squealed and ran out of its way and it came to a halt at feet he raised his wand ready but 
 
 here shouted professor lupin suddenly hurrying forward crack 
 
 the legless spider had vanished for a second everyone looked wildly around to see where it was then they saw a orb hanging in the air in front of lupin who said riddikulus almost lazily 
 
 crack 
 
 forward neville and finish him off said lupin as the boggart landed on the floor as a cockroach crack snape was back this time neville charged forward looking determined 
 
 riddikulus he shouted and they had a split view of snape in his lacy dress before neville let out a great ha of laughter and the boggart exploded burst into a thousand tiny wisps of smoke and was gone 
 
 excellent cried professor lupin as the class broke into applause excellent neville well done everyonelet me seefive points to gryffindor for every person to tackle the boggart ten for neville because he did it twiceand five each to hermione and harry 
 
 but i do anything said harry 
 
 you and hermione answered my questions correctly at the start of the class harry lupin said lightly very well everyone an excellent lesson homework kindly read the chapter on boggarts and summarize it for meto be handed in on monday that will be all 
 
 talking excitedly the class left the staffroom harry however feeling cheerful professor lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart why was it because seen harry collapse on the train and thought he up to much had he thought harry would pass out again 
 
 but no one else seemed to have noticed anything 
 
 did you see me take that banshee shouted seamus 
 
 and the hand said dean waving his own around 
 
 and snape in that hat 
 
 and my mummy 
 
 i wonder why professor frightened of crystal balls said lavender thoughtfully 
 
 that was the best defense against the dark arts lesson ever had it said ron excitedly as they made their way back to the classroom to get their bags 
 
 he seems like a very good teacher said hermione approvingly but i wish i could have had a turn with the boggart 
 
 what would it have been for you said ron sniggering a piece of homework that only got nine out of ten 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven bagman and crouchcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry disentangled himself from ron and got to his feet they had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor in front of them was a pair of tired and wizards one of whom was holding a large gold watch the other a thick roll of parchment and a quill both were dressed as muggles though very inexpertly the man with the watch wore a tweed suit with galoshes his colleague a kilt and a poncho 
 
 morning basil said mr weasley picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard who threw it into a large box of used portkeys beside him harry could see an old newspaper an empty drinks can and a punctured football 
 
 hello there arthur said basil wearily not on duty eh all right for been here all better get out of the way got a big party coming in from the black forest at five fifteen hang on find your he consulted his parchment list about a quarter of a walk over there first field you come to site called mr roberts diggorysecond fieldask for mr payne 
 
 thanks basil said mr weasley and he beckoned everyone to follow him 
 
 they set off across the deserted moor unable to make out much through the mist after about twenty minutes a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view beyond it harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon they said to the and approached the cottage door 
 
 a man was standing in the doorway looking out at the tents harry knew at a glance that this was the only real muggle for several acres when he heard their footsteps he turned his head to look at them 
 
 morning said mr weasley brightly 
 
 morning said the muggle 
 
 would you be mr roberts 
 
 aye i would said mr roberts and you 
 
 weasley two tents booked a couple of days ago 
 
 aye said mr roberts consulting a list tacked to the door got a space up by the wood there just the one night 
 
 it said mr weasley 
 
 be paying now then said mr roberts 
 
 ah right certainly said mr weasley he retreated a short distance from the cottage and beckoned harry toward him help me harry he muttered pulling a roll of muggle money from his pocket and starting to peel the notes apart this a a a ten ah yes i see the little number on it nowso this is a five 
 
 a twenty harry corrected him in an undertone uncomfortably aware of mr roberts trying to catch every word 
 
 ah yes so it know these little bits of paper 
 
 you foreign said mr roberts as mr weasley returned with the correct notes 
 
 foreign repeated mr weasley puzzled 
 
 not the first one had trouble with money said mr roberts scrutinizing mr weasley closely i had two try and pay me with great gold coins the size of hubcaps ten minutes ago 
 
 did you really said mr weasley nervously 
 
 mr roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change 
 
 never been this crowded he said suddenly looking out over the misty field again hundreds of people usually just turn up 
 
 is that right said mr weasley his hand held out for his change but mr roberts give it to him 
 
 aye he said thoughtfully people from all over loads of foreigners and not just foreigners weirdos you know a bloke walking round in a kilt and a poncho 
 
 he said mr weasley anxiously 
 
 like some sort ofi dunnolike some sort of rally said mr roberts they all seem to know each other like a big party 
 
 at that moment a wizard in appeared out of thin air next to mr front door 
 
 obliviate he said sharply pointing his wand at mr roberts 
 
 instantly mr eyes slid out of focus his brows unknitted and a took of dreamy unconcern fell over his face harry recognized the symptoms of one who had just had his memory modified 
 
 a map of the campsite for you mr roberts said placidly to mr weasley and your change 
 
 thanks very much said mr weasley 
 
 the wizard in accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite he looked exhausted his chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes once out of earshot of mr roberts he muttered to mr weasley been having a lot of trouble with him needs a memory charm ten times a day to keep him happy and ludo not helping trotting around talking about bludgers and quaffles at the top of his voice not a worry about security blimey be glad when this is over see you later arthur 
 
 he disapparated 
 
 i thought mr bagman was head of magical games and sports said ginny looking surprised he should know better than to talk about bludgers near muggles he 
 
 he should said mr weasley smiling and leading them through the gates into the campsite but always been a bitwelllax about security you wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though he played quidditch for england himself you know and he was the best beater the wimbourne wasps ever had 
 
 they trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents most looked almost ordinary their owners had clearly tried to make them as as possible but had slipped up by adding chimneys or bellpulls or weather vanes however here and there was a tent so obviously magical that harry could hardly be surprised that mr roberts was getting suspicious halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance a little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached complete with birdbath sundial and fountain 
 
 always the same said mr weasley smiling we resist showing off when we get together ah here we are look this is us 
 
 they had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the field and here was an empty space with a small sign hammered into the ground that read weezly 
 
 have a better spot said mr weasley happily the field is just on the other side of the wood there as close as we could be he hoisted his backpack from his shoulders right he said excitedly no magic allowed strictly speaking not when out in these numbers on muggle land be putting these tents up by hand be too do it all the harry where do you reckon we should start 
 
 harry had never been camping in his life the dursleys had never taken him on any kind of holiday preferring to leave him with mrs figg an old neighbor however he and hermione worked out where most of the poles and pegs should go and though mr weasley was more of a hindrance than a help because he got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby tents 
 
 all of them stood back to admire their handiwork nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards harry thought but the trouble was that once bill charlie and percy arrived they would be a party of ten hermione seemed to have spotted this problem too she gave harry a quizzical look as mr weasley dropped to his hands and knees and entered the first tent 
 
 be a bit cramped he called but i think all squeeze in come and have a look 
 
 harry bent down ducked under the tent flap and felt his jaw drop he had walked into what looked like an three room flat complete with bathroom and kitchen oddly enough it was furnished in exactly the same sort of style as mrs house there were crocheted covers on the mismatched chairs and a strong smell of cats 
 
 well not for long said mr weasley mopping his bald patch with a handkerchief and peering in at the four bunk beds that stood in the bedroom i borrowed this from perkins at the office camp much anymore poor fellow got lumbago 
 
 he picked up the dusty kettle and peered inside it need water 
 
 a tap marked on this map the muggle gave us said ron who had followed harry inside the tent and seemed completely unimpressed by its extraordinary inner proportions on the other side of the field 
 
 well why you harry and hermione go and get us some water then mr weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans and the rest of us will get some wood for a fire 
 
 but got an oven said ron why we just 
 
 ron security said mr weasley his face shining with anticipation when real muggles camp they cook on fires outdoors seen them at it 
 
 after a quick tour of the girls tent which was slightly smaller than the boys though without the smell of cats harry ron and hermione set off across the campsite with the kettle and saucepans 
 
 now with the sun newly risen and the mist lifting they could see the city of tents that stretched in every direction they made their way slowly through the rows staring eagerly around it was only just dawning on harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world he had never really thought much about those in other countries 
 
 their fellow campers were starting to wake up first to stir were the families with small children harry had never seen witches and wizards this young before a tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large tent holding a wand and poking happily at a slug in the grass which was swelling slowly to the size of a salami as they drew level with him his mother came hurrying out of the tent 
 
 how many times kevin you touch wand yecchh 
 
 she had trodden on the giant slug which burst her scolding carried after them on the still air mingling with the little yells you bust slug you bust slug 
 
 a short way farther on they saw two little witches barely older than kevin who were riding toy broomsticks that rose only high enough for the girls toes to skim the dewy grass a ministry wizard had already spotted them as he hurried past harry ron and hermione he muttered distractedly in broad daylight parents having a i suppose 
 
 here and there adult wizards and witches were emerging from their tents and starting to cook breakfast some with furtive looks around them conjured fires with their wands others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces as though sure this work three african wizards sat in serious conversation all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire while a group of american witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read the salem witches institute harry caught snatches of conversation in strange languages from the inside of tents they passed and though he understand a word the tone of every single voice was excited 
 
 er is it my eyes or has everything gone green said ron 
 
 it just eyes they had walked into a patch of tents that were all covered with a thick growth of shamrocks so that it looked as though small oddly shaped hillocks had sprouted out of the earth grinning faces could be seen under those that had their flaps open then from behind them they heard their names 
 
 harry ron hermione 
 
 it was seamus finnigan their fellow gryffindor fourth year he was sitting in front of his own tent with a woman who had to be his mother and his best friend dean thomas also of gryffindor 
 
 like the decorations said seamus grinning the not too happy 
 
 ah why we show our colors said mrs finnigan you should see what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents be supporting ireland of course she added eyeing harry ron and hermione beadily when they had assured her that they were indeed supporting ireland they set off again though as ron said like say anything else surrounded by that lot 
 
 i wonder what the bulgarians have got dangling all over their tents said hermione 
 
 go and have a look said harry pointing to a large patch of tents upfield where the bulgarian flag white green and red was fluttering in the breeze 
 
 the tents here had not been bedecked with plant life but each and every one of them had the same poster attached to it a poster of a very surly face with heavy black eyebrows the picture was of course moving but all it did was blink and scowl 
 
 krum said ron quietly 
 
 what said hermione 
 
 krum said ron viktor krum the bulgarian seeker 
 
 he looks really grumpy said hermione looking around at the many blinking and scowling at them 
 
 really grumpy ron raised his eyes to the heavens who cares what he looks like unbelievable really young too only just eighteen or something a genius you wait until tonight see 
 
 there was already a small queue for the tap in the corner of the field harry ron and hermione joined it right behind a pair of men who were having a heated argument one of them was a very old wizard who was wearing a long flowery nightgown the other was clearly a ministry wizard he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation 
 
 just put them on archie a good chap you walk around like that the muggle at the already getting suspicious 
 
 i bought this in a muggle shop said the old wizard stubbornly muggles wear them 
 
 muggle women wear them archie not the men they wear these said the ministry wizard and he brandished the pinstriped trousers 
 
 not putting them on said old archie in indignation i like a healthy breeze round my privates thanks 
 
 hermione was overcome with such a strong fit of the giggles at this point that she had to duck out of the queue and only returned when archie had collected his water and moved away 
 
 walking more slowly now because of the weight of the water they made their way back through the campsite here and there they saw more familiar faces other hogwarts students with their families oliver wood the old captain of house quidditch team who had just left hogwarts dragged harry over to his parents tent to introduce him and told him excitedly that he had just been signed to the puddlemere united reserve team next they were hailed by ernie macmillan a hufflepuff fourth year and a little farther on they saw cho chang a very pretty girl who played seeker on the ravenclaw team she waved and smiled at harry who slopped quite a lot of water down his front as he waved back more to stop ron from smirking than anything harry hurriedly pointed out a large group of teenagers whom he had never seen before 
 
 who reckon they are he said they go to hogwarts do they 
 
 spect they go to some foreign school said ron i know there are others never met anyone who went to one though bill had a penfriend at a school in brazilthis was years and years agoand he wanted to go on an exchange trip but mum and dad afford it his penfriend got all offended when he said he going and sent him a cursed hat it made his ears shrivel up 
 
 harry laughed but voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other wizarding schools he supposed now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite that he had been stupid never to realize that hogwarts be the only one he glanced at hermione who looked utterly unsurprised by the information no doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other 
 
 been ages said george when they finally got back to the weasleys tents 
 
 met a few people said ron setting the water down not got that fire started yet 
 
 having fun with the matches said fred 
 
 mr weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire but it for lack of trying splintered matches littered the ground around him but he looked as though he was having the time of his life 
 
 oops he said as he managed to light a match and promptly dropped it in surprise 
 
 come here mr weasley said hermione kindly taking the box from him and showing him how to do it properly 
 
 at last they got the fire lit though it was at least another hour before it was hot enough to cook anything there was plenty to watch while they waited however their tent seemed to be pitched right alongside a kind of thoroughfare to the field and ministry members kept hurrying up and down it greeting mr weasley cordially as they passed mr weasley kept up a running commentary mainly for and benefit his own children knew too much about the ministry to be greatly interested 
 
 that was cuthbert mockridge head of the goblin liaison comes gilbert wimple with the committee on experimental charms had those horns for a while nowhello arniearnold peasegood an obliviator member of the accidental magic reversal squad you knowand bode and unspeakables 
 
 what 
 
 from the department of mysteries top secret no idea what they get up to 
 
 at last the fire was ready and they had just started cooking eggs and sausages when bill charlie and percy came strolling out of the woods toward them 
 
 just apparated dad said percy loudly ah excellent lunch 
 
 they were halfway through their plates of eggs and sausages when mr weasley jumped to his feet waving and grinning at a man who was striding toward them aha he said the man of the moment ludo 
 
 ludo bagman was easily the most noticeable person harry had seen so far even including old archie in his flowered nightdress he was wearing long quidditch robes in thick horizontal stripes of bright yellow and black an enormous picture of a wasp was splashed across his chest he had the look of a powerfully built man gone slightly to seed the robes were stretched tightly across a large belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played quidditch for england his nose was squashed probably broken by a stray bludger harry thought but his round blue eyes short blond hair and rosy complexion made him look like a very overgrown schoolboy 
 
 ahoy there bagman called happily he was walking as though he had springs attached to the balls of his feet and was plainly in a state of wild excitement 
 
 arthur old man he puffed as he reached the campfire what a day eh what a day could we have asked for more perfect weather a cloudless night comingand hardly a hiccough in the much for me to do 
 
 behind him a group of ministry wizards rushed past pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a magical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air 
 
 percy hurried forward with his hand outstretched apparently his disapproval of the way ludo bagman ran his department did not prevent him from wanting to make a good impression 
 
 ah yes said mr weasley grinning this is my son percy just started at the ministry and this is fred no george sorry fred bill charlie ron my daughter ginny and friends hermione granger and harry potter 
 
 bagman did the smallest of double takes when he heard name and his eyes performed the familiar flick upward to the scar on forehead 
 
 everyone mr weasley continued this is ludo bagman you know who he is thanks to him got such good tickets 
 
 bagman beamed and waved his hand as if to say it had been nothing 
 
 fancy a flutter on the match arthur he said eagerly jingling what seemed to be a large amount of gold in the pockets of his robes already got roddy pontner betting me bulgaria will score first i offered him nice odds considering front three are the strongest seen in years and little agatha timms has put up half shares in her eel farm on a weeklong match 
 
 ohgo on then said mr weasley seea galleon on ireland to win 
 
 a galleon ludo bagman looked slightly disappointed but recovered himself very well very wellany other takers 
 
 a bit young to be gambling said mr weasley molly like 
 
 bet galleons fifteen sickles three knuts said fred as he and george quickly pooled all their money that ireland wins but viktor krum gets the snitch oh and throw in a fake wand 
 
 you want to go showing mr bagman rubbish like that percy hissed but bagman seem to think the wand was rubbish at all on the contrary his boyish face shone with excitement as he took it from fred and when the wand gave a loud squawk and turned into a rubber chicken bagman roared with laughter 
 
 excellent i seen one that convincing in years pay five galleons for that 
 
 percy froze in an attitude of stunned disapproval 
 
 boys said mr weasley under his breath i want you all your mother 
 
 be a spoilsport arthur boomed ludo bagman rattling his pockets excitedly old enough to know what they want you reckon ireland will win but get the snitch not a chance boys not a give you excellent odds on that add five galleons for the funny wand then shall we 
 
 mr weasley looked on helplessly as ludo bagman whipped out a notebook and quill and began jotting down the twins names 
 
 cheers said george taking the slip of parchment bagman handed him and tucking it away into the front of his robes bagman turned most cheerfully back to mr weasley 
 
 do me a brew i suppose keeping an eye out for barty crouch my bulgarian opposite making difficulties and i understand a word saying be able to sort it out he speaks about a hundred and fifty languages 
 
 mr crouch said percy suddenly abandoning his look of disapproval and positively writhing with excitement he speaks over two hundred mermish and gobbledegook and troll 
 
 anyone can speak troll said fred dismissively all you have to do is point and grunt 
 
 percy threw fred an extremely nasty look and stoked the fire vigorously to bring the kettle back to the boil 
 
 any news of bertha jorkins yet ludo mr weasley asked as bagman settled himself down on the grass beside them all 
 
 not a dicky bird said bagman comfortably but turn up poor old berthamemory like a leaky cauldron and no sense of direction lost you take my word for it wander back into the office sometime in october thinking still july 
 
 you think it might be time to send someone to look for her mr weasley suggested tentatively as percy handed bagman his tea 
 
 barty crouch keeps saying that said bagman his round eyes widening innocently but we really spare anyone at the moment oh talk of the devil barty 
 
 a wizard had just apparated at their fireside and he could not have made more of a contrast with ludo bagman sprawled on the grass in his old wasp robes barty crouch was a stiff upright elderly man dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie the parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule his shoes were very highly polished harry could see at once why percy idolized him percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules and mr crouch had complied with the rule about muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager harry doubted even uncle vernon would have spotted him for what he really was 
 
 pull up a bit of grass barry said ludo brightly patting the ground beside him 
 
 no thank you ludo said crouch and there was a bite of impatience in his voice been looking for you everywhere the bulgarians are insisting we add another twelve seats to the top box 
 
 oh is that what after said bagman i thought the chap was asking to borrow a pair of tweezers bit of a strong accent 
 
 mr crouch said percy breathlessly sunk into a kind of halfbow that made him look like a hunchback would you like a cup of tea 
 
 oh said mr crouch looking over at percy in mild surprise yes thank you weatherby 
 
 fred and george choked into their own cups percy very pink around the ears busied himself with the kettle 
 
 oh and been wanting a word with you too arthur said mr crouch his sharp eyes falling upon mr weasley ali on the warpath he wants a word with you about your embargo on flying carpets 
 
 mr weasley heaved a deep sigh 
 
 i sent him an owl about that just last week if told him once told him a hundred times carpets are defined as a muggle artifact by the registry of proscribed charmable objects but will he listen 
 
 i doubt it said mr crouch accepting a cup from percy desperate to export here 
 
 well never replace brooms in britain will they said bagman 
 
 ali thinks a niche in the market for a family vehicle said mr crouch i remember my grandfather had an axminster that could seat twelve but that was before carpets were banned of course 
 
 he spoke as though he wanted to leave nobody in any doubt that all his ancestors had abided strictly by the law 
 
 so been keeping busy barty said bagman breezily 
 
 fairly said mr crouch dryly organizing portkeys across five continents is no mean feat ludo 
 
 i expect both be glad when this is over said mr weasley 
 
 ludo bagman looked shocked 
 
 glad know when had more not as though we got anything to took forward to eh barty eh plenty left to organize eh 
 
 mr crouch raised his eyebrows at bagman 
 
 we agreed not to make the announcement until all the details 
 
 oh details said bagman waving the word away like a cloud of midges signed they agreed they i bet you anything these know soon enough anyway i mean happening at hogwarts 
 
 ludo we need to meet the bulgarians you know said mr crouch sharply cutting remarks short thank you for the tea weatherby 
 
 he pushed his undrunk tea back at percy and waited for ludo to rise bagman struggled to his feet swigging down the last of his tea the gold in his pockets chinking merrily 
 
 see you all later he said be up in the top box with me commentating he waved barty crouch nodded curtly and both of them disapparated 
 
 happening at hogwarts dad said fred at once what were they talking about 
 
 find out soon enough said smiling 
 
 classified information until such time as the ministry decides to release it said percy stiffly mr crouch was quite right not to disclose it 
 
 oh shut up weatherby said fred 
 
 a sense of excitement rose like a palpable cloud over the campsite as the afternoon wore on by dusk the still summer air itself seemed to be quivering with anticipation and as darkness spread like a curtain over the thousands of waiting wizards the last vestiges of pretence disappeared the ministry seemed to have bowed to the inevitable and stopped fighting the signs of blatant magic now breaking out everywhere 
 
 salesmen were apparating every few feet carrying trays and pushing carts full of extraordinary merchandise there were luminous rosettes green for ireland red for bulgaria which were squealing the names of the players pointed green hats bedecked with dancing shamrocks bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that really roared flags from both countries that played their national anthems as they were waved there were tiny models of firebolts that really flew and collectible figures of famous players which strolled across the palm of your hand preening themselves 
 
 been saving my pocket money all summer for this ron told harry as they and hermione strolled through the salesmen buying souvenirs though ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette he also bought a small figure of viktor krum the bulgarian seeker the miniature krum walked backward and forward over hand scowling up at the green rosette above him 
 
 wow look at these said harry hurrying over to a cart piled high with what looked like brass binoculars except that they were covered with all sorts of weird knobs and dials 
 
 omnioculars said the saleswizard eagerly you can replay actionslow everything downand they flash up a breakdown if you need it bargain ten galleons each 
 
 wish i bought this now said ron gesturing at his dancing shamrock hat and gazing longingly at the omnioculars 
 
 three pairs said harry firmly to the wizard 
 
 no bother said ron going red he was always touchy about the fact that harry who had inherited a small fortune from his parents had much more money than he did 
 
 you be getting anything for christmas harry told him thrusting omnioculars into his and hands for about ten years mind 
 
 fair enough said ron grinning 
 
 oooh thanks harry said hermione and get us some programs look 
 
 their money bags considerably lighter they went back to the tents bill charlie and ginny were all sporting green rosettes too and mr weasley was carrying an irish flag fred and george had no souvenirs as they had given bagman all their gold 
 
 and then a deep booming gong sounded somewhere beyond the woods and at once green and red lanterns blazed into life in the trees lighting a path to the field 
 
 time said mr weasley looking as excited as any of them come on go 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven the ministry of magiccontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry awoke at five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear for a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain then unable to bear it he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses mrs weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and at the foot of his bed harry scrambled into them the blank picture on the wall sniggered 
 
 ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open fast asleep he did not stir as harry crossed the room stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him trying not to think of the next time he would see ron when they might no longer be fellow students at hogwarts harry walked quietly down the stairs past the heads of ancestors and down into the kitchen 
 
 he had expected it to be empty but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side he pushed it open and saw mr and mrs weasley sirius lupin and tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him all were fully dressed except mrs weasley who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown she leapt to her feet the moment harry entered 
 
 breakfast she said as she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire 
 
 harry yawned tonks her hair was blonde and curly this morning sleep all right 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 up all night she said with another shuddering yawn come and sit down 
 
 she drew out a chair knocking over the one beside it in the process 
 
 what do you want harry mrs weasley called porridge muffins kippers bacon and eggs toast 
 
 justjust toast thanks said harry 
 
 lupin glanced at harry then said to tonks what were you saying about scrimgeour 
 
 oh yeah well we need to be a bit more careful been asking kingsley and me funny questions 
 
 harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation his insides were squirming mrs weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him he tried to eat but it was like chewing carpet mrs weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his tucking in the label and smoothing out the creases across his shoulders he wished she 
 
 and have to tell dumbledore i do night duty tomorrow just tired tonks finished yawning hugely again 
 
 cover for you said mr weasley ok got a report to finish anyway 
 
 mr weasley was not wearing wizards robes but a pair of pinstriped trousers and an old bomber jacket he turned from tonks to harry 
 
 how are you feeling 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 all be over soon mr weasley said bracingly in a few hours time be cleared 
 
 harry said nothing 
 
 the on my floor in amelia office head of the department of magical law enforcement and the one be questioning you 
 
 amelia bones is ok harry said tonks earnestly fair hear you out 
 
 harry nodded still unable to think of anything to say 
 
 lose your temper said sirius abruptly be polite and stick to the facts 
 
 harry nodded again 
 
 the on your side said lupin quietly even underage wizards are allowed to use magic in situations 
 
 something very cold trickled down the back of neck for a moment he thought someone was putting a disillusionment charm on him then he realised that mrs weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb she pressed hard on the top of his head 
 
 it ever lie flat she said desperately 
 
 harry shook his head 
 
 mr weasley checked his watch and looked up at harry i think go now he said a bit early but i think be better off at the ministry than hanging around here 
 
 ok said harry automatically dropping his toast and getting to his feet 
 
 be all right harry said tonks patting him on the arm 
 
 good luck said lupin sure it will be fine 
 
 and if not said sirius grimly see to amelia bones for you 
 
 harry smiled weakly mrs weasley hugged him 
 
 all got our fingers crossed she said 
 
 right said harry well see you later then 
 
 he followed mr weasley upstairs and along the hall he could hear mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtains mr weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold grey dawn 
 
 you normally walk to work do you harry asked him as they set off briskly around the square 
 
 no i usually apparate said mr weasley but obviously you and i think best we arrive in a thoroughly fashion makes a better impression given what being disciplined for 
 
 mr weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked harry knew it was clenched around his wand the streets were almost deserted but when they arrived at the miserable little underground station they found it already lull of commuters as ever when he found himself in close proximity to muggles going about their daily business mr weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm 
 
 simply fabulous he whispered indicating the automatic ticket machines wonderfully ingenious 
 
 out of order said harry pointing at the sign 
 
 yes but even so said mr weasley beaming at them fondly 
 
 they bought their tickets instead from a guard harry handled the transaction as mr weasley was not very good with muggle money and five minutes later they were boarding an underground train that rattled them off towards the centre of london mr weasley kept anxiously checking and the underground map above the windows 
 
 four stops harry three stops left now two stops to go harry 
 
 they got off at a station in the very heart of london and were swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases up the escalator they went through the ticket barrier mr weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket and emerged on to a broad street lined with buildings and already full of traffic 
 
 where are we said mr weasley blankly and for one moment harry thought they had got off at the wrong station despite mr continual references to the map but a second later he said ah yes this way harry and led him down a side road 
 
 sorry he said but i never come by train and it all looks rather different from a muggle perspective as a matter of fact never even used the visitors entrance before 
 
 the further they walked the smaller and less imposing the buildings became until finally they reached a street that contained several rather offices a pub and an overflowing skip harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the ministry of magic 
 
 here we are said mr weasley brightly pointing at an old red telephone box which was missing several panes of glass and stood before a heavily graffitied wall after you harry 
 
 he opened the door 
 
 harry stepped inside wondering what on earth this was about mr weasley folded himself in beside harry and closed the door it was a tight fit harry was jammed against the telephone apparatus which was hanging crookedly from the wall as though a vandal had tried to rip it off mr weasley reached past harry for the receiver 
 
 mr weasley i think this might be out of order too harry said 
 
 no no sure its fine said mr weasley holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial see six he dialled the number two four and another four and another two 
 
 as the dial whirred smoothly back into place a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box not from the receiver in mr hand but as loudly and plainly as though an invisible woman were standing right beside them 
 
 welcome to the ministry of magic please state your name and business 
 
 er said mr weasley clearly uncertain whether or not he should talk into the receiver he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear arthur weasley misuse of muggle artefacts office here to escort harry potter who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing 
 
 thank you said the cool female voice visitor please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robes 
 
 there was a click and a rattle and harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared he picked it up it was a square silver badge with harry potter disciplinary hearing on it he pinned it to the front of his as the female voice spoke again 
 
 visitor to the ministry you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk which is located at the far end of the atrium 
 
 the floor of the telephone box shuddered they were sinking slowly into the ground harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads then he could see nothing at all he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth after about a minute though it felt much longer to harry a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and widening rose up his body until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes watering 
 
 the ministry of magic wishes you a pleasant day said the voice 
 
 the door of the telephone box sprang open and mr weasley stepped out of it followed by harry whose mouth had fallen open 
 
 they were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished dark wood floor the peacock blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that kept moving and changing like some enormous heavenly noticeboard the on each side were panelled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the fireplaces with a soft whoosh on the side short queues were forming before each fireplace waiting to depart 
 
 halfway down the hall was a fountain a group of golden statues larger than stood in the middle of a circular pool tallest of them all was a wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air grouped around him were a beautiful witch a centaur a goblin and a the last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands the point of the arrow the tip of the hat and each of the ears so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of the apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards most of whom were wearing glum looks strode towards a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall 
 
 this way said mr weasley 
 
 they joined the throng wending their way between the ministry workers some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment others battered briefcases still others were reading the daily prophet while they walked as they passed the fountain harry saw silver sickles and bronze knuts glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool a small smudged sign beside it read 
 
 all proceeds from the fountain of magical brethren will be given to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries 
 
 if not expelled from hogwarts put in ten galleons harry found himself thinking desperately 
 
 over here harry said mr weasley and they stepped out of the stream of ministry employees heading for the golden gates seated at a desk to the left beneath a sign saying security a wizard in robes looked up as they approached and put down his daily prophet 
 
 escorting a visitor said mr weasley gesturing towards harry 
 
 step over here said the wizard in a bored voice 
 
 harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod thin and flexible as a car aerial and passed it up and down front and back 
 
 wand grunted the security wizard at harry putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand 
 
 harry produced his wand the wizard dropped it on to a strange brass instrument which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish it began to vibrate a narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base the wizard tore this off and read the writing on it 
 
 eleven inches core been in use four years that correct 
 
 yes said harry nervously 
 
 i keep this said the wizard impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike you get this back he added thrusting the wand at harry 
 
 thank you 
 
 hang on said the wizard slowly 
 
 his eyes had darted from the silver badge on chest to his forehead 
 
 thank you eric said mr weasley firmly and grasping harry by the shoulder he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizards and witches walking through the golden gates 
 
 jostled slightly by the crowd harry followed mr weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles harry and mr weasley joined the crowd around one of them nearby stood a big bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box which was emitting rasping noises 
 
 all right arthur said the wizard nodding at mr weasley 
 
 you got there bob asked mr weasley looking at the box 
 
 not sure said the wizard seriously we thought it was a chicken until it started breathing fire looks like a serious breach of the ban on experimental breeding to me 
 
 with a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them the golden grille slid back and harry and mr weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and harry found himself jammed against the back wall several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously he stared at his feet to avoid catching eye flattening his fringe as he did so the grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly chains rattling while the same cool female voice harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again 
 
 level seven department of magical games and sports incorporating the british and irish quidditch league headquarters official gobstones club and ludicrous patents office 
 
 the lift doors opened harry glimpsed an corridor with various posters of quidditch teams tacked lopsidedly on the walls one of the wizards in the lift who was carrying an armful of broomsticks extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor the doors closed the lift juddered upwards again and the voice announced 
 
 level six department of magical transportation incorporating the floo network authority broom regulatory control portkey office and apparation test centre 
 
 once again the lift doors opened and four or five witches and wizards got out at the same time several paper aeroplanes swooped into the lift harry stared up at them as they flapped idly around above his head they were a pale violet colour and he could see ministry of magic stamped along the edge of their wings 
 
 just memos mr weasley muttered to him we used to use owls but the mess was unbelievable droppings all over the desks 
 
 as they clattered upwards again the memos flapped around the lamp swaying from the ceiling 
 
 level five department of international magical cooperation incorporating the international magical trading standards body the international magical office of law and the international confederation of wizards british seats 
 
 when the doors opened two of the memos zoomed out with a few more of the witches and wizards but several more memos zoomed in so that the light from the lamp flickered and flashed overhead as they darted around it 
 
 level four department for the regulation and control of magical creatures incorporating beast being and spirit divisions goblin liaison office and pest advisory bureau 
 
 said the wizard carrying the chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memos the doors clanged shut yet again 
 
 level three department of magical accidents and catastrophes including the accidental magic reversal squad obliviator headquarters and excuse committee 
 
 everybody left the lift on this floor except mr weasley harry and a witch who was reading an extremely long piece of parchment that was trailing on the floor the remaining memos continued to soar around the lamp as the lift juddered upwards again then the doors opened and the voice made its announcement 
 
 level two department of magical law enforcement including the improper use of magic office auror headquarters and wizengamot administration services 
 
 this is us harry said mr weasley and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with doors my office is on the other side of the floor 
 
 mr weasley said harry as they passed a window through which sunlight was streaming we still underground 
 
 yes we are said mr weasley those are enchanted windows magical maintenance decide what weather get every day we had two months of hurricanes last time they were angling for a pay rise just round here harry 
 
 they turned a corner walked through a pair of heavy oak doors and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles which was buzzing with talk and laughter memos were zooming in and out of cubicles like miniature rockets a lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read auror headquarters 
 
 harry looked surreptitiously through the doorways as they passed the aurors had covered their cubicle walls with everything from pictures of wanted wizards and photographs of their families to posters of their favourite quidditch teams and articles from the daily prophet a man with a ponytail longer than was sitting with his boots up on his desk dictating a report to his quill a little further along a witch with a patch over one eye was talking over the top of her cubicle wall to kingsley shacklebolt 
 
 morning weasley said kingsley carelessly as they drew nearer been wanting a word with you have you got a second 
 
 yes if it really is a second said mr weasley in rather a hurry 
 
 they were talking as though they hardly knew each other and when harry opened his mouth to say hello to kingsley mr weasly stood on his foot they followed kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle 
 
 harry received a slight shock blinking down at him from every direction was face newspaper cuttings and old photographseven the one of sirius being best man at the potters weddingpapered the walls the only space was a map of the world in which little red pins were glowing like jewels 
 
 here said kingsley brusquely to mr weasley shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand i need as much information as possible on flying muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months received information that black might still be using his old motorcycle 
 
 kingsley tipped harry an enormous wink and added in a whisper give him the magazine he might find it interesting then he said in normal tones and take too long weasley the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month 
 
 if you had read my report you would know that the term is firearms said mr weasley coolly and afraid have to wait for information on motorcycles extremely busy at the moment he dropped his voice and said if you can get away before seven making meatballs 
 
 he beckoned to harry and led him out of cubicle through a second set of oak doors into another passage turned left marched along another corridor turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor and finally reached a dead end where a door on the left stood ajar revealing a broom cupboard and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artefacts 
 
 mr dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls on top of which were tottering piles of files the little wall space available bore witness to mr obsessions there were several posters of cars including one of a dismantled engine two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of muggle books and a diagram showing how to wire a plug 
 
 sitting on top of mr overflowing was an old toaster that was hiccoughing in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather gloves that were twiddling their thumbs a photograph of the weasley family stood beside the harry noticed that percy appeared to have walked out of it 
 
 we got a window said mr weasley apologetically taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair asked but they seem to think we need one have a seat harry look as if perkins is in yet 
 
 harry squeezed himself into the chair behind desk while mr weasley riffled through the sheaf of parchment kingsley shacklebolt had given him 
 
 ah he said grinning as he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled the quibbler from its midst yes he flicked through it yes right sure sirius will find that very amusingoh dear this now 
 
 a memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccoughing toaster mr weasley unfolded it and read aloud third regurgitating public toilet reported in bethnal green kindly investigate immediately this is getting ridiculous 
 
 a regurgitating toilet 
 
 pranksters said mr weasley frowning we had two last week one in wimbledon one in elephant and castle muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearingwell you can imagine the poor things keep calling in thosepumbles i think calledyou know the ones who mend pipes and things 
 
 plumbers 
 
 exactly yes but of course flummoxed i only hope we can catch doing it 
 
 will it be aurors who catch them 
 
 oh no this is too trivial for aurors be the ordinary magical law enforcement patrolah harry this is perkins 
 
 a stooped old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room panting 
 
 oh arthur he said desperately without looking at harry thank goodness i know what to do for the best whether to wait here for you or not just sent an owl to your home but obviously missed itan urgent message came ten minutes ago 
 
 i know about the regurgitating toilet said mr weasley 
 
 no no not the toilet the potter changed the time and venueit starts at eight now and down in old courtroom ten 
 
 down in old but they told beard 
 
 mr weasley looked at his watch let out a yelp and leapt from his chair 
 
 quick harry we should have been there five minutes ago 
 
 perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinets as mr weasley left the office at a run harry close on his heels 
 
 why have they changed the time harry said breathlessly as they hurtled past the auror cubicles people poked out their heads and stared as they streaked past harry felt as though he had left all his insides back at desk 
 
 no idea but thank goodness we got here so early if missed it it would have been catastrophic 
 
 mr weasley skidded to a halt beside the lifts and jabbed impatiently at the down button 
 
 come on 
 
 the lift clattered into view and they hurried inside every time it stopped mr weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button 
 
 those courtrooms been used in years said mr weasley angrily i think why doing it down thereunlessbut no 
 
 a plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment and mr weasley did not elaborate 
 
 the atrium said the cool female voice and the golden grilles slid open showing harry a distant glimpse of the golden statues in the fountain the plump witch got out and a wizard with a very mournful face got in 
 
 morning arthur he said in a sepulchral voice as the lift began to descend often see you down here 
 
 urgent business bode said mr weasley who was bouncing on the balls of his feet and throwing anxious looks over at harry 
 
 ah yes said bode surveying harry unblinkingly of course 
 
 harry barely had emotion to spare for bode but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable 
 
 department of mysteries said the cool female voice and left it at that 
 
 quick harry said mr weasley as the lift doors rattled open and they sped up a corridor that was quite different from those above the walls were bare there were no windows and no doors apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor harry expected them to go through it but instead mr weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left where there was an opening leading to a flight of steps 
 
 down here down here panted mr weasley taking two steps at a time the lift even come down this far why doing it down there 
 
 they reached the bottom of the steps and ran along yet another corridor which bore a great resemblance to the one that led to dungeon at hogwarts with rough stone walls and torches in brackets the doors they passed here were heavy wooden ones with iron bolts and keyholes 
 
 courtroom ten i think nearly yes 
 
 mr weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall clutching at a stitch in his chest 
 
 go on he panted pointing his thumb at the door get in there 
 
 you coming with 
 
 no no not allowed good luck 
 
 heart was beating a violent tattoo against his apple he swallowed hard turned the heavy iron door handle and stepped inside the courtroom 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter seven the slug clubcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays pondering the meaning of behavior in knockturn alley what disturbed him most was the satisfied look on face as he had left the shop nothing that made malfoy look that happy could be good news to his slight annoyance however neither ron nor hermione seemed quite as curious about activities as he was or at least they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days 
 
 yes already agreed it was fishy harry said hermione a little impatiently she was sitting on the windowsill in fred and room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of advanced rune translation but we agreed there could be a lot of explanations 
 
 maybe broken his hand of glory said ron vaguely as he attempted to straighten his bent tail twigs remember that arm malfoy had 
 
 but what about when he said forget to keep that one safe asked harry for the umpteenth time that sounded to me like got another one of the broken objects and malfoy wants both 
 
 you reckon said ron now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle 
 
 yeah i do said harry when neither ron nor hermione answered he said in azkaban you think like revenge 
 
 ron looked up blinking 
 
 malfoy revenge what can he do about it 
 
 my point i know said harry frustrated but up to something and i think we should take it seriously his a death eater and 
 
 harry broke off his eyes fixed on the window behind hermione his mouth open a startling thought had just occurred to him 
 
 harry said hermione in an anxious voice wrong 
 
 your not hurting again is it asked ron nervously 
 
 a death eater said harry slowly replaced his father as a death eater 
 
 there was a silence then ron erupted in laughter malfoy sixteen harry you think would let malfoy join 
 
 it seems very unlikely harry said hermione in a repressive sort of voice what makes you think 
 
 in madam she touch him but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve it was his left arm been branded with the dark mark 
 
 ron and hermione looked at each other 
 
 well said ron sounding thoroughly unconvinced 
 
 i think he just wanted to get out of there harry said hermione 
 
 he showed borgin something we see harry pressed on stubbornly something that seriously scared borgin it was the mark i know ithe was showing borgin who he was dealing with you saw how seriously borgin took him 
 
 ron and hermione exchanged another look 
 
 not sure harry 
 
 yeah i still reckon would let malfoy join 
 
 annoyed but absolutely convinced he was right harry snatched up a pile of filthy quidditch robes and left the room mrs weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment on the landing he bumped into ginny who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes 
 
 i go in the kitchen just now she warned him a lot of phlegm around 
 
 be careful not to slip in it harry smiled 
 
 sure enough when he entered the kitchen it was to find fleur sitting at the kitchen table in full flow about plans for her wedding to bill while mrs weasley kept watch over a pile of sprouts looking 
 
 bill and i ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids ginny and gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer i am theenking of dressing zem in pale goldpink would of course be orrible with air 
 
 ah harry said mrs weasley loudly cutting across monologue good i wanted to explain about the security arrangements for the journey to hogwarts tomorrow got ministry cars again and there will be aurors waiting at the station 
 
 is tonks going to be there asked harry handing over his quidditch things 
 
 no i think so been stationed somewhere else from what arthur said 
 
 she has let erself go zat tonks fleur mused examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon a big mistake if you ask 
 
 yes thank you said mrs weasley tartly cutting across fleur again better get on harry i want the trunks ready tonight if possible so we have the usual scramble 
 
 and in fact their departure the following morning was smoother than usual the ministry cars glided up to the front of the burrow to find them waiting trunks packed cat crookshanks safely enclosed in his traveling basket and hedwig owl pigwidgeon and new purple pygmy puff arnold in cages 
 
 au revoir arry said fleur throatily kissing him goodbye ron hurried forward looking hopeful but ginny stuck out her foot and ron fell sprawling in the dust at feet furious and he hurried into the car without saying goodbye 
 
 there was no cheerful hagrid waiting for them at cross station instead two bearded aurors in dark muggle suits moved forward the moment the cars stopped and flanking the party marched them into the station without speaking 
 
 quick quick through the barrier said mrs weasley who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency harry had better go first with 
 
 she looked inquiringly at one of the aurors who nodded briefly seized upper arm and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten 
 
 i can walk thanks said harry irritably jerking his arm out of the grip he pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier ignoring his silent companion and found himself a second later standing on platform nine and where the scarlet hogwarts express stood belching steam over the crowd 
 
 hermione and the weasleys joined him within seconds without waiting to consult his auror harry motioned to ron and hermione to follow him up the platform looking for an empty compartment 
 
 we harry said hermione looking apologetic ron and got to go to the prefects carriage first and then patrol the corridors for a bit 
 
 oh yeah i forgot said harry 
 
 better get straight on the train all of you only got a few minutes to go said mrs weasley consulting her watch well have a lovely term ron 
 
 mr weasley can i have a quick word said harry making up his mind on the spur of the moment 
 
 of course said mr weasley who looked slightly surprised but followed harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless 
 
 harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that if he was to tell anyone mr weasley was the right person firstly because he worked at the ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations and secondly because he thought that there was not too much risk of mr weasley exploding with anger 
 
 he could see mrs weasley and the auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away 
 
 when we were in diagon alley harry began but mr weasley forestalled him with a grimace 
 
 am i about to discover where you ron and hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of fred and shop 
 
 how did you 
 
 harry please talking to the man who raised fred and george 
 
 er yeah all right we in the back room 
 
 very well then hear the worst 
 
 well we followed draco malfoy we used my invisibility cloak 
 
 did you have any particular reason for doing so or was it a mere whim 
 
 because i thought malfoy was up to something said harry disregarding mr look of mingled exasperation and amusement given his mother the slip and i wanted to know why 
 
 of course you did said mr weasley sounding resigned well did you find out why 
 
 he went into borgin and burkes said harry and started bullying the bloke in there borgin to help him fix something and he said he wanted borgin to keep something else for him he made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing like they were a pair and 
 
 harry took a deep breath 
 
 something else we saw malfoy jump about a mile when madam malkin tried to touch his left arm i think been branded with the dark mark i think replaced his father as a death eater 
 
 mr weasley looked taken aback after a moment he said harry i doubt whether would allow a 
 
 does anyone really know what would or do asked harry angrily mr weasley sorry but it worth investigating if malfoy wants something fixing and he needs to threaten borgin to get it done probably something dark or dangerous it 
 
 i doubt it to be honest harry said mr weasley slowly you see when lucius malfoy was arrested we raided his house we took away everything that might have been dangerous 
 
 i think you missed something said harry stubbornly 
 
 well maybe said mr weasley but harry could tell that mr weasley was humoring him 
 
 there was a whistle behind them nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing 
 
 better hurry said mr weasley as mrs weasley cried harry quickly 
 
 he hurried forward and mr and mrs weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train 
 
 now dear coming to us for christmas all fixed with dumbledore so see you quite soon said mrs weasley through the window as harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move you make sure you look after yourself and 
 
 the train was gathering speed 
 
 be good and she was jogging to keep up now 
 
 stay safe 
 
 harry waved until the train had turned a corner and mr and mrs weasley were lost to view then turned to see where the others had got to he supposed ron and hermione were cloistered in the prefects carriage but ginny was a little way along the corridor chatting to some friends he made his way toward her dragging his trunk 
 
 people stared shamelessly as he approached they even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him he had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the chosen one rumors in the daily prophet but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight he tapped ginny on the shoulder 
 
 fancy trying to find a compartment 
 
 i harry i said meet dean said ginny brightly see you later 
 
 right said harry he felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she walked away her long red hair dancing behind her he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that ginny did not hang around with him ron and hermione while at school then he blinked and looked around he was surrounded by mesmerized girls 
 
 hi harry said a familiar voice from behind him 
 
 neville said harry in relief turning to see a boy struggling toward him 
 
 hello harry said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes who was just behind neville 
 
 luna hi how are you 
 
 very well thank you said luna she was clutching a magazine to her chest large letters on the front announced that there was a pair of free spectrespecs inside 
 
 the quibbler still going strong then asked harry who felt a certain fondness for the magazine having given it an exclusive interview the previous year 
 
 oh yes well up said luna happily 
 
 find seats said harry and the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students at last they found an empty compartment and harry hurried inside gratefully 
 
 even staring at us said neville indicating himself and luna because with you 
 
 staring at you because you were at the ministry too said harry as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack our little adventure there was all over the daily prophet you seen it 
 
 yes i thought gran would be angry about all the publicity said neville but she was really pleased says starting to live up to my dad at long last she bought me a new wand look 
 
 he pulled it out and showed it to harry 
 
 cherry and unicorn hair he said proudly we think it was one of the last ollivander ever sold he vanished next dayoi come back here trevor 
 
 and he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom 
 
 are we still doing meetings this year harry asked luna who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle of the quibbler 
 
 no point now got rid of umbridge is there said harry sitting down neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it he looked most disappointed 
 
 i liked the i learned loads with you 
 
 i enjoyed the meetings too said luna serenely it was like having friends 
 
 this was one of those uncomfortable things luna often said and which made harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment before he could respond however there was a disturbance outside their compartment door a group of girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass 
 
 you ask him 
 
 no you 
 
 do it 
 
 and one of them a girl with large dark eyes a prominent chin and long black hair pushed her way through the door 
 
 hi harry romilda romilda vane she said loudly and confidently why you join us in our compartment you have to sit with them she added in a stage whisper indicating bottom which was sticking out from under the seat again as he groped around for trevor and luna who was now wearing her free spectrespecs which gave her the look of a demented multicolored owl 
 
 friends of mine said harry coldly 
 
 oh said the girl looking very surprised oh okay 
 
 and she withdrew sliding the door closed behind her 
 
 people expect you to have cooler friends than us said luna once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty 
 
 you are cool said harry shortly none of them was at the ministry they fight with me 
 
 a very nice thing to say beamed luna then she pushed her spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read the quibbler 
 
 we face him though said neville emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a trevor in his hand you did you should hear my gran talk about you that harry got more backbone than the whole ministry of magic put together give anything to have you as a grandson 
 
 harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to results as soon as he could while neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a transfiguration with only an acceptable harry watched him without really listening 
 
 childhood had been blighted by voldemort just as much as had but neville had no idea how close he had come to having destiny the prophecy could have referred to either of them yet for his own inscrutable reasons voldemort had chosen to believe that harry was the one meant 
 
 had voldemort chosen neville it would be neville sitting opposite harry bearing the scar and the weight of the prophecy or would it would mother have died to save him as lily had died for harry surely she would but what if she had been unable to stand between her son and voldemort would there then have been no chosen one at all an empty seat where neville now sat and a scarless harry who would have been kissed goodbye by his own mother not 
 
 you all right harry you look funny said neville 
 
 harry started 
 
 sorryi 
 
 wrackspurt got you asked luna sympathetically peering at harry through her enormous colored spectacles 
 
 iwhat 
 
 a wrackspurt invisible they float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy she said i thought i felt one zooming around in here 
 
 she flapped her hands at thin air as though beating off large invisible moths harry and neville caught each eyes and hastily began to talk of quidditch 
 
 the weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer they passed through stretches of the chilling mist then out into weak clear sunlight it was during one of the clear spells when the sun was visible almost directly overhead that ron and hermione entered the compartment at last 
 
 wish the lunch trolley would hurry up starving said ron longingly slumping into the seat beside harry and rubbing his stomach hi neville hi luna guess what he added turning to harry not doing prefect duty just sitting in his compartment with the other slytherins we saw him when we passed 
 
 harry sat up straight interested it was not like malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect which he had happily abused all the previous year 
 
 what did he do when he saw you 
 
 the usual said ron indifferently demonstrating a rude hand gesture not like him though is it well that did the hand gesture why he out there bullying first years 
 
 dunno said harry but his mind was racing this look as though malfoy had more important things on his mind than bullying younger students 
 
 maybe he preferred the inquisitorial squad said hermione maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that 
 
 i think so said harry i think 
 
 but before he could expound on his theory the compartment door slid open again and a breathless girl stepped inside 
 
 supposed to deliver these to neville longbottom and harry she faltered as her eyes met and she turned scarlet she was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet ribbon perplexed harry and neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment 
 
 what is it ron demanded as harry unrolled his 
 
 an invitation said harry 
 
 harry 
 i would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment c 
 sincerely professor slughorn 
 professor slughorn asked neville looked perplexedly at his own invitation 
 
 new teacher said harry well i suppose have to go we 
 
 but what does he want me for asked neville nervously as though he was expecting detention 
 
 no idea said harry which was not entirely true though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct listen he added seized by a sudden brain wave go under the invisibility cloak then we might get a good look at malfoy on the way see what up to 
 
 this idea however came to nothing the corridors which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train every now and then students would hurtle out of their compartments to get a better look at him the exception was cho chang who darted into her compartment when she saw harry coming as harry passed the window he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend marietta who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face smirking slightly harry pushed on 
 
 when they reached compartment c they saw at once that they were not only invitees although judging by the enthusiasm of welcome harry was the most warmly anticipated 
 
 harry said slughorn jumping up at the sight of him so that his great belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment his shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden buttons on his waistcoat good to see you good to see you and you must be mr longbottom 
 
 neville nodded looking scared at a gesture from slughorn they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats which were nearest the door harry glanced around at their fellow guests he recognized a slytherin from their year a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long slanting eyes there were also two boys harry did not know and squashed in the corner beside slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure how she had got there ginny 
 
 now do you know everyone slughorn asked harry and neville blaise zabini is in your year of course 
 
 zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting nor did harry or neville gryffindor and slytherin students loathed each other on principle 
 
 this is cormac mclaggen perhaps come across each other no 
 
 mclaggen a large youth raised a hand and harry and neville nodded back at him 
 
 and this is marcus belby i know whether 
 
 belby who was thin and gave a strained smile 
 
 and this charming young lady tells me she knows you slughorn finished 
 
 ginny grimaced at harry and neville from behind back 
 
 well now this is most pleasant said slughorn cozily a chance to get to know you all a little better here take a napkin packed my own lunch the trolley as i remember it is heavy on licorice wands and a poor old digestive system quite up to such things pheasant belby 
 
 belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant 
 
 i was just telling young marcus here that i had the pleasure of teaching his uncle damocles slughorn told harry and neville now passing around a basket of rolls outstanding wizard outstanding and his order of merlin most do you see much of your uncle marcus 
 
 unfortunately beiby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant in his haste to answer slughorn he swallowed too fast turned purple and began to choke 
 
 anapneo said slughorn calmly pointing his wand at belby whose airway seemed to clear at once 
 
 not not much of him no gasped belby his eyes streaming 
 
 well of course i daresay busy said slughorn looking questioningly at belby i doubt he invented the wolfsbane potion without considerable hard work 
 
 i suppose said belby who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that slughorn had finished with him er he and my dad get on very well you see so i really know much about 
 
 his voice tailed away as slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to mclaggen instead 
 
 now you cormac said slughorn i happen to know you see a lot of your uncle tiberius because he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in i think norfolk 
 
 oh yeah that was fun that was said mclaggen we went with bertie higgs and rufus scrimgeourthis was before he became minister obviously 
 
 ah you know bertie and rufus too beamed slughorn now offering around a small tray of pies somehow belby was missed out now tell me 
 
 it was as harry had suspected everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody or influential everyone except ginny zabini who was interrogated after mclaggen turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother from what harry could make out she had been married seven times each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold it was turn next this was a very uncomfortable ten minutes for parents aurors had been tortured into insanity by bellatrix lestrange and a couple of death eater cronies at the end of interview harry had the impression that slughorn was reserving judgment on neville yet to see whether he had any of his parents flair 
 
 and now said slughorn shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act harry potter where to begin i feel i barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer 
 
 he contemplated harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant then said the chosen one calling you now 
 
 harry said nothing belby mclaggen and zabini were all staring at him 
 
 of course said slughorn watching harry closely there have been rumors for years i remember whenwellafter that terrible nightlilyjamesand you survivedand the word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary 
 
 zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to indicate amused skepticism an angry voice burst out from behind slughorn 
 
 yeah zabini because so talented at posing 
 
 oh dear chuckled slughorn comfortably looking around at ginny who was glaring at zabini around great belly you want to be careful blaise i saw this young lady perform the most marvelous hex as i was passing her carriage i cross her 
 
 zabini merely looked contemptuous 
 
 anyway said slughorn turning back to harry such rumors this summer of course one know what to believe the prophet has been known to print inaccuracies make mistakes but there seems little doubt given the number of witnesses that there was quite a disturbance at the ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all 
 
 harry who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying nodded but still said nothing slughorn beamed at him 
 
 so modest so modest no wonder dumbledore is so fondyou were there then but the rest of the storiesso sensational of course one know quite what to believethis fabled prophecy for instance 
 
 we never heard a prophecy said neville turning geranium pink as he said it 
 
 right said ginny staunchly neville and i were both there too and all this chosen one rubbish is just the prophet making things up as usual 
 
 you were both there too were you said slughorn with great interest looking from ginny to neville but both of them sat before his encouraging smile yes well it is true that the prophet often exaggerates of course slughorn said sounding a little disappointed i remember dear gwenog telling me gwenog jones i mean of course captain of the holyhead harpies 
 
 he meandered off into a reminiscence but harry had the distinct impression that slughorn had not finished with him and that he had not been convinced by neville and ginny 
 
 the afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious wizards slughorn had taught all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the slug club at hogwarts harry could not wait to leave but see how to do so politely finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset and slughorn looked around blinking in the twilight 
 
 good gracious getting dark already i notice that lit the lamps better go and change into your robes all of you mclaggen you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails harry blaise any time passing same goes for you miss he twinkled at ginny well off you go off you go 
 
 as he pushed past harry into the darkening corridor zabini shot him a filthy look that harry returned with interest he ginny and neville followed zabini back along the train 
 
 glad over muttered neville strange man he 
 
 yeah he is a bit said harry his eyes on zabini how come you ended up in there ginny 
 
 he saw me hex zacharias smith said ginny you remember that idiot from hufflepuff who was in the he kept on and on asking about what happened at the ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much i hexed himwhen slughorn came in i thought i was going to got detention but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch mad eh 
 
 better reason for inviting someone than because their famous said harry scowling at the back of head or because their uncle 
 
 but he broke off an idea had just occurred to him a reckless but potentially wonderful idea in a time zabini was going to the slytherin compartment and malfoy would be sitting there thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow slytherins if harry could only enter unseen behind him what might he not see or hear true there was little of the journey lefthogsmeade station had to be less than half an hour away judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windowsbut nobody else seemed prepared to take suspicions seriously so it was down to him to prove them 
 
 see you two later said harry under his breath pulling out his invisibility cloak and flinging it over himself 
 
 but you asked neville 
 
 later whispered harry darting after zabini as quietly as possible though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless 
 
 the corridors were almost completely empty now nearly everyone had returned to their carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions though he was as close as he could get to zabini without touching him harry was not quick enough to slip into the compartment when zabini opened the door zabini was already sliding it shut when harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing 
 
 wrong with this thing said zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into foot 
 
 harry seized the door and pushed it open hard zabini still clinging on to the handle toppled over sideways into gregory lap and in the ensuing ruckus harry darted into the compartment leapt onto temporarily empty seat and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack it was fortunate that goyle and zabini were snarling at each other drawing all eyes onto them for harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them indeed for one horrible moment he thought he saw eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight but then goyle slammed the door shut and flung zabini off him zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled vincent crabbe returned to his comic and malfoy sniggering lay back down across two seats with his head in pansy lap harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden and watched pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off forehead smirking as she did so as though anyone would have loved to have been in her place the lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene harry could read every word of comic directly below him 
 
 so zabini said malfoy what did slughorn want 
 
 just trying to make up to people said zabini who was still glowering at goyle not that he managed to find many 
 
 this information did not seem to please malfoy 
 
 who else had he invited he demanded 
 
 mclaggen from gryffindor said zabini 
 
 oh yeah his big in the ministry said malfoy 
 
 someone else called belby from ravenclaw 
 
 not him a prat said pansy 
 
 and longbottom potter and that weasley girl finished zabini 
 
 malfoy sat up very suddenly knocking hand aside 
 
 he invited longbottom 
 
 well i assume so as longbottom was there said zabini indifferently 
 
 longbottom got to interest slughorn 
 
 zabini shrugged 
 
 potter precious potter obviously he wanted a look at the chosen one sneered malfoy but that weasley girl so special about her 
 
 a lot of boys like her said pansy watching malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction even you think you blaise and we all know how hard you are to please 
 
 i touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like said zabini coldly and pansy looked pleased malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair 
 
 well i pity taste maybe going a bit senile shame my father always said he was a good wizard in his day my father used to be a bit of a favorite of his slughorn probably heard on the train or 
 
 i bank on an invitation said zabini he asked me about father when i first arrived they used to be old friends apparently but when he heard been caught at the ministry he look happy and nott get an invitation did he i think interested in death eaters 
 
 malfoy looked angry but forced out a singularly humorless laugh 
 
 well who cares what interested in what is he when you come down to it just some stupid teacher malfoy yawned ostentatiously i mean i might not even be at hogwarts next year it matter to me if some fat old likes me or not 
 
 what do you mean you might not be at hogwarts next year said pansy indignantly ceasing grooming malfoy at once 
 
 well you never know said malfoy with the ghost of a smirk i might haveermoved on to bigger and better things 
 
 crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak heart began to race what would ron and hermione say about this crabbe and goyle were gawping at malfoy apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things even zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features pansy resumed the slow stroking of malfoy s hair looking dumbfounded 
 
 do you meanhim 
 
 malfoy shrugged 
 
 mother wants me to complete my education but personally i see it as that important these days i mean think about it when the dark lord takes over is he going to care how many or got of course he be all about the kind of service he received the level of devotion he was shown 
 
 and you think be able to do something for him asked zabini scathingly sixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet 
 
 just said i maybe he care if qualified maybe the job he wants me to do something that you need to be qualified for said malfoy quietly 
 
 crabbe and goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles pansy was gazing down at malfoy as though she had never seen anything so 
 
 i can see hogwarts said malfoy clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window better get our robes on 
 
 harry was so busy staring at malfoy he did not notice goyle reaching up for his trunk as he swung it down it hit harry hard on the side of the head he let out an involuntary gasp of pain and malfoy looked up at the luggage rack frowning 
 
 harry was not afraid of malfoy but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his invisibility cloak by a group of unfriendly slytherins eyes still watering and head still throbbing he drew his wand careful not to disarrange the cloak and waited breath held to his relief malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise he pulled on his robes like the others locked his trunk and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck 
 
 harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that hermione and ron would take his things out onto the platform for him he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied at last with a final lurch the train came to a complete halt goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out into a crowd of second years punching them aside crabbe and zabini followed 
 
 you go on malfoy told pansy who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it i just want to check something 
 
 pansy left now harry and malfoy were alone in the compartment people were filing past descending onto the dark platform malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blinds so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in he then bent down over his trunk and opened it again 
 
 harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack his heart pumping a little faster what had malfoy wanted to hide from pansy was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so important to mend 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 without warning malfoy pointed his wand at harry who was instantly paralyzed as though in slow motion he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell with an agonizing crash at feet the invisibility cloak trapped beneath him his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position he move a muscle he could only gaze up at malfoy who smiled broadly 
 
 i thought so he said jubilantly i heard trunk hit you and i thought i saw something white flash through the air after zabini came back his eyes lingered for a moment upon trainers that was you blocking the door when zabini came back in i suppose 
 
 he considered harry a moment 
 
 you hear anything i care about potter but while got you here 
 
 and he stamped hard on face harry felt his nose break blood spurted everywhere 
 
 from my father now see 
 
 malfoy dragged the cloak out from under immobilized body and threw it over him 
 
 i reckon find you till the back in london he said quietly see you around potter or not 
 
 and taking care to tread on fingers malfoy left the compartment 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter seven the will of albus dumbledorecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 he was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn far below swathed in mist was the shadow of a small town was the man he sought down there the man he needed so badly he could think of little else the man who held the answer the answer to his problem 
 
 oi wake up 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was lying again on the camp bed in rons dingy attic room the sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing the scar on harrys forehead was prickling 
 
 you were muttering in your sleep 
 
 was i 
 
 yeah gregorovitch you kept saying gregorovitch 
 
 harry was not wearing his glasses rons face appeared slightly blurred 
 
 whos gregorovitch 
 
 i dunno do i you were the one saying it 
 
 harry rubbed his forehead thinking he had a vague idea he had heard the name before but he could not think where 
 
 i think voldemorts looking for him 
 
 poor bloke said ron fervently 
 
 harry sat up still rubbing his scar now wide awake he tried to remember exactly what he had seen in the dream but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley 
 
 i think hes abroad 
 
 who gregorovitch 
 
 voldemort i think hes somewhere abroad looking for gregorovitch it didnt look like anywhere in britain 
 
 you reckon you were seeing into his mind again 
 
 ron sounded worried 
 
 do me a favor and dont tell hermione said harry although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep 
 
 he gazed up at little pigwidgeons cage thinkingwhy was the name gregorovitch familiar 
 
 i think he said slowly hes got something to do with quidditch theres some connection but i cantci cant think what it is 
 
 quidditch said ron sure youre not thinking of gorgovitch 
 
 who 
 
 dragomir gorgovitch chaser transferred to the chudley cannons for a record fee two years ago record holder for most quaffle drops in a season 
 
 no said harry im definitely not thinking of gorgovitch 
 
 i try not to either said ron well happy birthday anyway 
 
 wow c thats right i forgot im seventeen 
 
 harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses and said accio glasses although they were only around a foot away there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him at least until they poked him in the eye 
 
 slick snorted ron 
 
 reveling in the removal of his trace harry sent rons possessions flying around the room causing pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand and purely for the pleasure of it turned the orange robes on rons chudley cannons posters bright blue 
 
 id do your fly by hand though ron advised harry sniggering when harry immediately checked it heres your present unwrap it up here its not for my mothers eyes 
 
 a book said harry as he took the rectangular parcel bit of a departure from tradition isnt it 
 
 this isnt your average book said ron itd pure gold twelve ways to charm witches explains everything you need to know about girls if only id had this last year id have known exactly how to get rid of lavender and i wouldve known how to get going with well fred and george gave me a copy and ive learned a lot youd be surprised its not all about wandwork either 
 
 when they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table bill and monsieur delacour were finishing their breakfasts while mrs weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan 
 
 arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth harry said mrs weasley beaming at him he had to leave early for work but hell be back for dinner thats our present on top 
 
 harry sat down took the square parcel she had indicated and unwrapped it inside was a watch very like the one mr and mrs weasley had given ron for his seventeenth it was gold with stars circling around the race instead of hands 
 
 its traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age said mrs weasley watching him anxiously from beside the cooker im afraid that one isnt new like rons it was actually my brother fabians and he wasnt terribly careful with his possessions its a bit dented on the back butc 
 
 the rest of her speech was lost harry had got up and hugged her he tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her then waved her wand in a slightly random way causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor 
 
 happy birthday harry said hermione hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile its not much but i hope you like it what did you get him she added to ron who seemed not to hear her 
 
 come on then open hermiones said ron 
 
 she had bought him a new sneakoscope the other packages contained an enchanted razor from bill and fleur ah yes zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever ave monsieur delacour assured him but you must tell it clearly what you wantozzerwise you might find you ave a leetle less hair zan you would like chocolates from the delacours and an enormous box of the latest weasleys wizard wheezes merchandise from fred and george 
 
 harry ron and hermione did not linger at the table as the arrival of madame delacour fleur and gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded 
 
 ill pack these for you hermione said brightly taking harrys presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs im nearly done im just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash ronc 
 
 rons splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the landing 
 
 harry will you come in here a moment 
 
 it was ginny ron came to an abrupt halt but hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs feeling nervous harry followed ginny into her room 
 
 he had never been inside it before it was small but bright there was a large poster of the wizarding band the weird sisters on one wall and a picture of gwenog jones captain of the quidditch team the holyhead harpies on the other a desk stood facing the open window which looked out over the orchard where he and ginny had once played a quidditch with ron and hermione and which now housed a large pearly white marquee the golden flag on top was level with ginnys window 
 
 ginny looked up into harrys face took a deep breath and said happy seventeenth 
 
 yeahthanks 
 
 she was looking at him steadily he however found it difficult to look back at her it was like gazing into a brilliant light 
 
 nice view he said feebly pointing toward with window 
 
 she ignored this he could not blame her 
 
 i couldnt think what to get you she said 
 
 you didnt have to get me anything 
 
 she disregarded this too 
 
 i didnt know what would be useful nothing too big because you wouldnt be able to take it with you 
 
 he chanced a glance at her she was not tearful that was one of the many wonderful things about ginny she was rarely weepy he had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have toughened her up 
 
 she took a step closer to him 
 
 so then i thought id like you to have something to remember me by you know if you meet some veela when youre off doing whatever youre doing 
 
 i think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground to be honest 
 
 theres the silver lining ive been looking for she whispered and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before and harry was kissing her back and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky she was the only real thing in the world ginny the feel of her one hand at her back and one in her long hairc the door banged open behind them and they jumped apart 
 
 oh said ron pointedly sorry 
 
 ron hermione was just behind him slight out of breath there was a strained silence then ginny had said in a flat little voice well happy birthday anyway harry 
 
 rons ears were scarlet hermione looked nervous harry wanted to slam the door in their faces but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble all the reasons for ending his relationship with ginny for staying well away from her seemed to have slunk inside the room with ron and all happy forgetfulness was gone 
 
 he looked at ginny wanting to say something though he hardly knew what but she had turned her back on him he thought that she might have succumbed for once to tears he could not do anything to comfort her in front of ron 
 
 ill see you later he said and followed the other two out of the bedroom 
 
 ron marched downstairs though the kitchen and into the yard and harry kept pace with him all the way hermione trotting along behind them looking scared 
 
 once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn ron rounded on harry 
 
 you ditched her what are you doing now messing her around 
 
 im not messing her around said harry as hermione caught up with them 
 
 ronc 
 
 but ron held up a hand to silence her 
 
 she was really cut up when you ended itc 
 
 so was i you know why i stopped it and it wasnt because i wanted to 
 
 yeah but you go snogging her now and shes just going to get her hopes up againc 
 
 shes not an idiot she knows it cant happen shes not expecting us tocto end up married orc 
 
 as he said it a vivid picture formed in harrys mind of ginny in a white dress marrying a tall faceless and unpleasant stranger 
 
 in one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him her future was free and unencumbered whereas hishe could see nothing but voldemort ahead 
 
 if you keep groping her every chance you getc 
 
 it wont happen again said harry harshly the day was cloudless but he felt as though the sun had gone in okay 
 
 ron looked half resentful half sheepish he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a moment then said right then well thatsyeah 
 
 
 
 
 ginny did not seek another meeting with harry for the rest of the day nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room nevertheless charlies arrival came as a relief to harry it provided a distraction watching mrs weasley force charlie into a chair raise her wand threateningly and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut 
 
 as harrys birthday dinner would have stretched the burrows kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of charlie lupin tonks and hagrid several tables were placed end to end in the garden fred and george bewitched a number of purple lanterns all emblazoned with a large number to hang in midair over the guests thanks to mrs weasleys ministrations georges wound was neat and clean but harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head despite the twins many jokes about it 
 
 hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes 
 
 nice said ron as with one final flourish of her wand hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold youve really got an eye for that sort of thing 
 
 thank you ron said hermione looking both pleased and a little confused harry turned away smiling to himself he had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of twelve ways to charm witches he caught ginnys eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with monsieur delacour 
 
 out of the way out of the way sang mrs weasley coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant snitch floating in front of her seconds later harry realized that it was his birthday cake which mrs weasley was suspending with her wand rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground when the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table harry said that looks amazing mrs weasley 
 
 oh its nothing dear she said fondly over her shoulder ron gave harry the and mouthed good one 
 
 by seven oclock all the guests had arrived led into the house by fred and george who had waited for them at the end of the lane hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best and horrible hairy brown suit although lupin smiled as he shook harrys hand harry thought he looked rather unhappy it was all very odd tonks beside him looked simply radiant 
 
 happy birthday harry she said hugging him tightly 
 
 seventeen eh said hagrid as he accepted a glass of wine from fred six years ter the day since we met harry dyeh remember it 
 
 vaguely said harry grinning up at him didnt you smash down the front door give dudley a pigs tail and tell me i was a wizard 
 
 i forge the details hagrid chortled all righ ron hermione 
 
 were fine said hermione how are you 
 
 ar not bad bin busy we got some newborn unicorns ill show yeh when yeh get backc harry avoided rons and hermiones gazes as hagrid rummaged in his pocket here harry c couldnt think what ter get teh but then i remembered this he pulled out a small slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string evidently intended to be worn around the neck mokeskin hide anythin in there an no one but the owner can get it out theyre rare them 
 
 hagrid thanks 
 
 snothin said hagrid with a wave of a hand an theres charlie always liked him c hey charlie 
 
 charlie approached running his hand slightly ruefully over his new brutally short haircut he was shorter than ron thickset with a number of burns and scratches up his muscled arms 
 
 hi hagrid hows it going 
 
 bin meanin ter write fer ages hows norbert doin 
 
 norbert charlie laughed the norwegian ridgeback we call her norberta now 
 
 wha c norberts a girl 
 
 oh yeah said charlie 
 
 how can you tell asked hermione 
 
 theyre a lot more vicious said charlie he looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice wish dad would hurry up and get here mums getting edgy 
 
 they all looked over at mrs weasley she was trying to talk to madame delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate 
 
 i think wed better start without arthur she called to the garden at large after a moment or two he must have been held up at c oh 
 
 they all saw it at the same time a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the table where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel which stood on its hind legs and spoke with mr weasleys voice 
 
 minister of magic coming with me 
 
 the patronus dissolved into thin air leaving fleurs family peering in astonishment at the place where it had vanished 
 
 we shouldnt be here said lupin at once harry c im sorry c ill explain some other timec 
 
 he seized tonkss wrist and pulled her away they reached the fence climbed over it and vanished from sight mrs weasley looked bewildered 
 
 the minister c but whyc i dont understandc 
 
 but there was no time to discuss the matter a second later mr weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate accompanied by rufus scrimgeour instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair 
 
 the two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the table where everybody sat in silence watching them draw closer as scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light harry saw that he looked much older than the last time that had met scraggy and grim 
 
 sorry to intrude said scrimgeour as he limped to a halt before the table especially as i can see that i am a party 
 
 his eyes lingered for a moment on the giant snitch cake 
 
 many happy returns 
 
 thanks said harry 
 
 i require a private word with you scrimgeour went on also with mr ronald weasley and miss hermione granger 
 
 us said ron sounding surprised why us 
 
 i shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private said scrimgeour is there such a place he demanded of mr weasley 
 
 yes of course said mr weasley who looked nervous the er sitting room why dont you use that 
 
 you can lead the way scrimgeour said to ron there will be no need for you to accompany us arthur 
 
 harry saw mr weasley exchange a worried look with mrs weasley as he ron and hermione stood up as they led the way back to the house in silence harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was scrimgeour must somehow had learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of hogwarts 
 
 scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into the burrows sitting room although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light it was already dark in here harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that mr weasley normally occupied leaving harry ron and hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa once they had done so scrimgeour spoke 
 
 i have some questions for the three of you and i think it will be best if we do it individually if you two c he pointed at harry and hermione c can wait upstairs i will start with ronald 
 
 were not going anywhere said harry while hermione nodded vigorously you can speak to us together or not at all 
 
 scrimgeour gave harry a cold appraising look harry had the impression that the minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early 
 
 very well then together he said shrugging he cleared his throat i am here as im sure you know because of albus dumbledores will 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked at one another 
 
 a surprise apparently you were not aware then that dumbledore had left you anything 
 
 of us said ron me and hermione too 
 
 yes all of c 
 
 but harry interrupted 
 
 dumbledore died over a month ago why has it taken this long to give us what he left us 
 
 isnt it obvious said hermione before scrimgeour could answer they wanted to examine whatever hes left us you had no right to do that she said and her voice trembled slightly 
 
 i had every right said scrimgeour dismissively the decree for justifiable confiscation gives the ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a willc 
 
 that law was created to stop wizards passing on dark artifacts said hermione and the ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceaseds possessions are illegal before seizing them are you telling me that you thought dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed 
 
 are you planning to follow a career in magical law miss granger asked scrimgeour 
 
 no im not retorted hermione im hoping to do some good in the world 
 
 ron laughed scrimgeours eyes flickered toward him and away again as harry spoke 
 
 so why have you decided to let us have our things now cant think of a pretext to keep them 
 
 no itll be because days are up said hermione at once they cant keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove theyre dangerous right 
 
 would you say you were close to dumbledore ronald asked scrimgeour ignoring hermione ron looked startled 
 
 me not c not really it was always harry who 
 
 ron looked around at harry and hermione to see hermione giving him a sort of look but the damage was done scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected and wanted to hear he swooped like a bird of prey upon rons answer 
 
 if you were not very close to dumbledore how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will he made exceptionally few personal bequests the vast majority of his possessions c his private library his magical instruments and other personal effects c were left to hogwarts why do you think you were singled out 
 
 idunno said ron iwhen i say we werent closei mean i think he liked me 
 
 youre being modest ron said hermione dumbledore was very fond of you 
 
 this was stretching the truth to breaking point as far as harry knew ron and dumbledore had never been alone together and direct contact between them had been negligible however scrimgeour did not seem to be listening he put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one hagrid had given harry from it he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud 
 
 the last will and testament of albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore yes here we are to ronald bilius weasley i leave my deluminator in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it 
 
 scrimgeour took from the bag an object that harry had seen before it looked something like a silver cigarette lighter but it had he knew the power to suck all light from a place and restore it with a simple click scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the deluminator to ron who took it and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned 
 
 that is a valuable object said scrimgeour watching ron it may even be unique certainly it is of dumbledores own design why would he have left you and item so rare 
 
 ron shook his head looking bewildered 
 
 dumbledore must have taught thousands of students scrimgeour persevered yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three why is that to what use did he think you would put to the deluminator mr weasley 
 
 put out lights i spose mumbled ron what else could i do with it 
 
 evidently scrimgeour had no suggestions after squinting at ron for a moment or tow he turned back to dumbledores will 
 
 to miss hermione jean granger i leave my copy of the tales of beedle the bard in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive 
 
 scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of secrets of the darkest art upstairs its binding was stained and peeling in places hermione took it from scrimgeour without a word she held the book in her lap and gazed at it harry saw that the title was in runes he had never learned to read them as he looked a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols 
 
 why do you think dumbledore left you that book miss granger asked scrimgeour 
 
 he he knew i liked books said hermione in a thick voice mopping her eyes with her sleeve 
 
 but why that particular book 
 
 i dont know he must have thought id enjoy it 
 
 did you ever discuss codes or any means of passing secret messages with dumbledore 
 
 no i didnt said hermione still wiping her eyes on her sleeve and if the ministry hasnt found any hidden codes in this book in days i doubt that i will 
 
 she suppressed a sob they were wedged together so tightly that ron had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around hermiones shoulders scrimgeour turned back to the will 
 
 to harry james potter he read and harrys insides contracted with a sudden excitement i leave the snitch he caught in his first quidditch match at hogwarts as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill 
 
 as scrimgeour pulled out the tiny golden ball its silver wings fluttered rather feebly and harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax 
 
 why did dumbledore leave you this snitch asked scrimgeour 
 
 no idea said harry for the reasons you just read out i suppose to remind me what you can get if you persevere and whatever it was 
 
 you think this a mere symbolic keepsake then 
 
 i suppose so said harry what else could it be 
 
 im asking the questions said scrimgeour shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa dusk was really falling outside now the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge 
 
 i notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a snitch scrimgeour said to harry why is that 
 
 hermione laughed derisively 
 
 oh it cant be a reference to the fact harrys a great seeker thats way too obvious she said there must be a secret message from dumbledore hidden in the icing 
 
 i dont think theres anything hidden in the icing said scrimgeour but a snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object you know why im sure 
 
 harry shrugged hermione however answered harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge 
 
 because snitches have flesh memories she said 
 
 what said harry and ron together both considered hermiones quidditch knowledge negligible 
 
 correct said scrimgeour a snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released not even by the maker who wears gloves it carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it in case of a disputed capture this snitch c he held up the tiny golden ball c will remember your touch potter 
 
 it occurs to me that dumbledore who had prodigious magical skill whatever his other faults might have enchanted this snitch so that it will open only for you 
 
 harrys heart was beating rather fast he was sure that scrimgeour was right how could he avoid taking the snitch with his bare hand in front of the minister 
 
 you dont say anything said scrimgeour perhaps you already know what the snitch contains 
 
 no said harry still wondering how he could appear to touch the snitch without really doing so if only he knew legilimency really knew it and could read hermiones mind he could practically hear her brain whizzing beside him 
 
 take it said scrimgeour quietly 
 
 harry met the ministers yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey he held out his hand and scrimgeour leaned forward again and place the snitch slowly and deliberately into harrys palm 
 
 nothing happened as harrys fingers closed around the snitch its tired wings fluttered and were still scrimgeour ron and hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball as if still hoping it might transform in some way 
 
 that was dramatic said harry coolly both ron and hermione laughed 
 
 thats all then is it asked hermione making to raise herself off the sofa 
 
 not quite said scrimgeour who looked bad tempered now dumbledore left you a second bequest potter 
 
 what is it asked harry excitement rekindling 
 
 scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time 
 
 the sword of godric gryffindor he said hermione and ron both stiffened harry looked around for a sign of the hilt but scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch which in any case looked much too small to contain it 
 
 so where is it harry asked suspiciously 
 
 unfortunately said scrimgeour that sword was not dumbledores to give away the sword of godric gryffindor is an important historical artifact and as such belongsc 
 
 it belongs to harry said hermione hotly it chose him he was the one who found it it came to him out of the sorting hatc 
 
 according to reliable historical sources the sword may present itself to any worthy gryffindor said scrimgeour that does not make it the exclusive property of mr potter whatever dumbledore may have decided scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek scrutinizing harry why do you thinkc 
 
 cdumbledore wanted to give me the sword said harry struggling to keep his temper maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall 
 
 this is not a joke potter growled scrimgeour was it because dumbledore believed that only the sword of godric gryffindor could defeat the heir of slytherin did he wish to give you that sword potter because he believed as do many that you are the one destined to destroy 
 
 interesting theory said harry has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in voldemort maybe the ministry should put some people onto that instead of wasting their time stripping down deluminators or covering up breakouts from azkaban so this is what youve been doing minister shut up in your office trying to break open a snitch people are dying c i was nearly one of them c voldemort chased me across three countries he killed moody but theres no word about any of that from the ministry has there and you still expect us to cooperate with you 
 
 you go too far shouted scrimgeour standing up harry jumped to his feet too scrimgeour limped toward harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand it singed a hole in harrys like a lit cigarette 
 
 oi said ron jumping up and raising his own wand but harry said no dyou want to give him an excuse to arrest us 
 
 remembered youre not at school have you said scrimgeour breathing hard into harrys face remembered that i am not dumbledore who forgave your insolence and insubordination you may wear that scar like a crown potter but it is not up to a boy to tell me how to do my job its time you learned some respect 
 
 its time you earned it said harry 
 
 the floor trembled there was a sound of running footsteps then the door to the sitting room burst open and mr and mrs weasley ran in 
 
 we c we thought we heard c began mr weasley looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of harry and the minister virtually nose to nose 
 
 c raised voices panted mrs weasley 
 
 scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from harry glancing at the hole he had made in harrys he seemed to regret his loss of temper 
 
 it c it was nothing he growled i regret your attitude he said looking harry full in the face once more you seem to think that the ministry does not desire what you c what dumbledore c desired we ought to work together 
 
 i dont like your methods minister said harry remember 
 
 for the second time he raised his right fist and displayed to scrimgeour the scar that still showed white on the back of it spelling i must not tell lies scrimgeours expression hardened he turned away without another word and limped from the room mrs weasley hurried after him harry heard her stop at the back door after a minute or so she called hes gone 
 
 what did he want mr weasley asked looking around at harry ron and hermione as mrs weasley came hurrying back to them 
 
 to give us what dumbledore left us said harry theyve only just released the content of his will 
 
 outside in the garden over the dinner tables the three objects scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand everyone exclaimed over the deluminator and the tales of beedle the bard and lamented the fact that scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why dumbledore would have left harry an old snitch as mr weasley examined the deluminator for the third of fourth time mrs weasley said tentatively harry dear everyones awfully hungry we didnt like to start without you shall i serve dinner now 
 
 they all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of happy birthday and much gulping of cake the party broke up hagrid who was invited to the wedding the following day but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched burrow left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field 
 
 meet us upstairs harry whispered to hermione while they helped mrs weasley restore the garden to its normal state after everyones gone to bed 
 
 up in the attic room ron examined his deluminator and harry filled hagrids moleskin purse not with gold but with those items he most prized apparently worthless though some of them were the marauders map the shard of siriuss enchanted mirror and locket he pulled the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck then sat holding the old snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly at last hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside 
 
 muffiato she whispered waving her wand in the direction of the stairs 
 
 thought you didnt approve of that spell said ron 
 
 times change said hermione now show us that deluminator 
 
 ron obliged at once holding i up in front of him he clicked it the solitary lamp they had lit went out at once 
 
 the thing is whispered hermione through the dark we could have achieved that with peruvian instant darkness powder 
 
 there was a small click and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more 
 
 still its cool said ron a little defensively and from what they said dumbledore invented it himself 
 
 i know but surely he wouldnt have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights 
 
 dyou think he knew the ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything hed left us asked harry 
 
 definitely said hermione he couldnt tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things but that will doesnt explain 
 
 why he couldnt have given us a hint when he was alive asked ron 
 
 well exactly said hermione now flicking through the tales of beedle the bard if these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the ministry youd think hed have left us know why unless he thought it was obvious 
 
 thought wrong then didnt he said ron i always said he was mental brilliant and everything but cracked leaving harry an old snitch c what the hell was that about 
 
 ive no idea said hermione when scrimgeour made you take it harry i was so sure that something was going to happen 
 
 yeah well said harry his pulse quickened as he raised the snitch in his fingers i wasnt going to try too hard in front of scrimgeour was i 
 
 what do you mean asked hermione 
 
 the snitch i caught in my first ever quidditch match said harry dont you remember 
 
 hermione looked simply bemused ron however gasped pointing frantically from harry to the snitch and back again until he found his voice 
 
 that was the one you nearly swallowed 
 
 exactly said harry and with his heart beating fast he pressed his mouth to the snitch 
 
 it did not open frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him he lowered the golden sphere but then hermione cried out 
 
 writing theres writing on it quick look he nearly dropped the snitch in surprise and excitement hermione was quite right engraved upon the smooth golden surface where seconds before there had been nothing were five words written in the thin slanted handwriting that harry recognized as dumbledores 
 
 i open at the close 
 
 he had barely read them when the words vanished again 
 
 i open at the close whats that supposed to mean 
 
 hermione and ron shook their heads looking blank 
 
 i open at the close at the close i open at the close 
 
 but no matter how often they repeated the words with many different inflections they were unable to wring any more meaning from them 
 
 and the sword said ron finally when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the snitchs inscription 
 
 why did he want harry to have the sword 
 
 and why couldnt he just have told me harry said quietly i was there it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year if he wanted me to have it why didnt he just give it to me then 
 
 he felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him his brain slow and unresponsive was there something he had missed in the long talks with dumbledore last year ought he to know what it all meant had dumbledore expected him to understand 
 
 and as for this book said hermione the tales of beedle the bard ive never even heard of them 
 
 youve never heard of the tales of beedle the bard said ron incredulously youre kidding right 
 
 no im not said hermione in surprise do you know them then 
 
 well of course i do 
 
 harry looked up diverted the circumstance of ron having read a book that hermione had not was unprecedented ron however looked bemused by their surprise 
 
 oh come on all the old kids stories are supposed to be beedles arent they the fountain of fair fortune the wizard and the hopping pot babbitty rabbitty and her cackling stump 
 
 excuse me said hermione giggling what was the last one 
 
 come off it said ron looking in disbelief from harry to hermione you mustve heard of babbitty rabbitty c 
 
 ron you know full well harry and i were brought up by muggles said hermione we didnt hear stories like that when we were little we heard snow white and the seven dwarves and cinderella c 
 
 whats that an illness asked ron 
 
 so these are childrens stories asked hermione bending against over the runes 
 
 yeah said ron uncertainly i mean just what you hear you know that all these old stories came from beedle i dunno what theyre like in the original versions 
 
 but i wonder why dumbledore thought i should read them 
 
 something cracked downstairs 
 
 probably just charlie now mums asleep sneaking off to regrow his hair said ron nervously 
 
 all the same we should get to bed whispered hermione it wouldnt do to oversleep tomorrow 
 
 no agreed ron a brutal triple murder by the bridegrooms mother might put a bit of damper on the wedding ill get the light 
 
 and he clicked the deluminator once more as hermione left the room 
 
 rowling

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 anne lisbeth 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 anne lisbeth was a beautiful young woman with a red and white 
 complexion glittering white teeth and clear soft eyes and her 
 footstep was light in the dance but her mind was lighter still she 
 had a little child not at all pretty so he was put out to be 
 nursed by a wife and his mother went to the castle 
 she sat in splendid rooms richly decorated with silk and velvet 
 not a breath of air was allowed to blow upon her and no one was 
 allowed to speak to her harshly for she was nurse to the 
 child he was fair and delicate as a prince and beautiful as an 
 angel and how she loved this child her own boy was provided for by being at the where the mouth watered more frequently than the pot boiled and where in general no one was at home to take care of the child then he would cry but what nobody knows nobody cares for so he would cry till he was tired and then fall asleep and while we are asleep we can feel neither hunger nor thirst ah yes sleep is a capital invention 
 
 as years went on anne child grew apace like weeds 
 although they said his growth had been stunted he had become quite 
 a member of the family in which he dwelt they received money to 
 keep him so that his mother got rid of him altogether she had become quite a lady she had a comfortable home of her own in the town and out of doors when she went for a walk she wore a bonnet but she never walked out to see the laborer that was too far from the town and indeed she had nothing to go for the boy now belonged to these laboring people he had food and he could also do something towards earning his living he took care of red cow for he knew how to tend cattle and make himself useful 
 
 the great dog by the yard gate of a mansion sits 
 proudly on the top of his kennel when the sun shines and barks at 
 every one that passes but if it rains he creeps into his house 
 and there he is warm and dry anne boy also sat in the 
 sunshine on the top of the fence cutting out a little toy if it 
 was he knew of three in blossom 
 which would certainly bear fruit this was his most hopeful thought 
 though it often came to nothing and he had to sit out in the rain 
 in the worst weather and get wet to the skin and let the cold wind 
 dry the clothes on his back afterwards if he went near the farmyard 
 belonging to the count he was pushed and knocked about for the men and the maids said he was so horrible ugly but he was used to all this for nobody loved him this was how the world treated anne 
 boy and how could it be otherwise it was his fate to be 
 beloved by no one hitherto he had been a land crab the land at 
 last cast him adrift he went to sea in a wretched vessel and sat 
 at the helm while the skipper sat over the he was dirty and 
 ugly and he always looked as if he never 
 had enough to eat which was really the case 
 
 late in the autumn when the weather was rough windy and wet 
 and the cold penetrated through the thickest clothing especially at 
 sea a wretched boat went out to sea with only two men on board or 
 more correctly a man and a half for it was the skipper and his 
 boy there had only been a kind of twilight all day and it soon 
 grew quite dark and so bitterly cold that the skipper took a dram to 
 warm him the bottle was old and the glass too it was perfect in the 
 upper part but the foot was broken off and it had therefore been 
 fixed upon a little carved block of wood painted blue a dram is a 
 great comfort and two are better still thought the skipper while 
 the boy sat at the helm which he held fast in his hard seamed 
 hands he was ugly and his hair was matted and he looked crippled 
 and stunted they called him the boy though in the 
 church register he was entered as anne son the wind cut 
 through the rigging and the boat cut through the sea the sails 
 filled by the wind swelled out and carried them along in wild career 
 it was wet and rough above and below and might still be worse 
 hold what is that what has struck the boat was it a waterspout 
 or a heavy sea rolling suddenly upon them 
 
 heaven help us cried the boy at the helm as the boat heeled 
 over and lay on its beam ends it had struck on a rock which rose 
 from the depths of the sea and sank at once like an old shoe in a 
 puddle it sank at once with mouse and man as the saying is 
 there might have been mice on board but only one man and a half 
 the skipper and the boy no one saw it but the skimming 
 and the fishes beneath the water and even they did not 
 see it properly for they darted back with terror as the boat filled 
 with water and sank there it lay scarcely a fathom below the 
 surface and those two were provided for buried and forgotten the 
 glass with the foot of blue wood was the only thing that did not sink 
 for the wood floated and the glass drifted away to be cast upon the 
 shore and broken where and when is indeed of no consequence it 
 had served its purpose and it had been loved which anne 
 boy had not been but in heaven no soul will be able to say never 
 loved 
 
 anne lisbeth had now lived in the town many years she was 
 called madame and felt dignified in consequence she remembered the old noble days in which she had driven in the carriage and had 
 associated with countess and baroness her beautiful noble child 
 had been a dear angel and possessed the kindest heart he had loved 
 her so much and she had loved him in return they had kissed and 
 loved each other and the boy had been her joy her second life now 
 he was fourteen years of age tall handsome and clever she had 
 not seen him since she carried him in her arms neither had she been 
 for years to the palace it was quite a journey thither from 
 the town 
 
 i must make one effort to go said anne lisbeth to see my 
 darling the sweet child and press him to my heart certainly 
 he must long to see me too the young count no doubt he thinks of me and loves me as in those days when he would fling his 
 round my neck and lisp anne liz it was music to my ears yes i 
 must make an effort to see him again she drove across the country in a cart and then got out and continued her journey on foot and thus reached the castle it was as great and magnificent as it had always been and the garden looked the same as ever all the servants were strangers to her not one of them knew anne lisbeth nor of what consequence she had once been there but she felt sure the countess would soon let them know it and her darling boy too how she longed to see him 
 
 now that anne lisbeth was at her end she was kept 
 waiting a long time and for those who wait time passes slowly but 
 before the great people went in to dinner she was called in and 
 spoken to very graciously she was to go in again after dinner and 
 then she would see her sweet boy once more how tall and slender and thin he had grown but the eyes and the sweet angel mouth were still beautiful he looked at her but he did not speak he certainly did 
 not know who she was he turned round and was going away but she seized his hand and pressed it to her lips 
 
 well well he said and with that he walked out of the room he 
 who filled her every thought he whom she loved best and who was 
 her whole earthly pride 
 
 anne lisbeth went forth from the castle into the public road 
 feeling mournful and sad he whom she had nursed day and night and 
 even now carried about in her dreams had been cold and strange and had not a word or thought respecting her a great black raven darted down in front of her on the high road and croaked dismally 
 ah said she what bird of ill omen art thou presently she 
 passed the hut his wife stood at the door and the two 
 women spoke to each other 
 
 you look well said the woman fat and plump you are 
 well off 
 
 oh yes answered anne lisbeth 
 
 the boat went down with them continued the woman hans the 
 skipper and the boy were both drowned so an end of them i 
 always thought the boy would be able to help me with a few dollars 
 never cost you anything more anne lisbeth 
 
 so they were drowned repeated anne lisbeth but she said no 
 more and the subject was dropped she felt very because her had shown no inclination to speak to her who loved him so well and who had travelled so far to see him the journey had cost money too and she had derived no great pleasure from it still she said not a word of all this she could not relieve her heart by telling the wife lest the latter should think she did not enjoy her former position at the castle then the raven flew over her screaming again as he flew 
 
 the black wretch said anne lisbeth he will end by frightening 
 me today she had brought coffee and chicory with her for she 
 thought it would be a charity to the poor woman to give them to her to boil a cup of coffee and then she would take a cup herself 
 
 the woman prepared the coffee and in the meantime anne lisbeth 
 seated her in a chair and fell asleep then she dreamed of something 
 which she had never dreamed before singularly enough she dreamed of her own child who had wept and hungered in the hut and had been knocked about in heat and in cold and who was now lying in the depths of the sea in a spot only known by god she fancied she was still sitting in the hut where the woman was busy preparing the coffee for she could smell the roasting but suddenly it seemed to her that there stood on the threshold a 
 beautiful young form as beautiful as the child and this 
 apparition said to her the world is passing away hold fast to me 
 for you are my mother after all you have an angel in heaven hold 
 me fast and the stretched out his hand and seized her 
 then there was a terrible crash as of a world crumbling to pieces 
 and the was rising from the earth and holding her by 
 the sleeve so tightly that she felt herself lifted from the ground 
 but on the other hand something heavy hung to her feet and dragged 
 her down and it seemed as if hundreds of women were clinging to 
 her and crying if thou art to be saved we must be saved too 
 hold fast hold fast and then they all hung on her but there were 
 too many and as they clung the sleeve was torn and anne lisbeth fell down in horror and awoke indeed she was on the point of falling over in reality with the chair on which she sat but she was so startled 
 and alarmed that she could not remember what she had dreamed only 
 that it was something very dreadful 
 
 they drank their coffee and had a chat together and then anne 
 lisbeth went away towards the little town where she was to meet the 
 carrier who was to drive her back to her own home but when she 
 came to him she found that he would not be ready to start till the 
 evening of the next day then she began to think of the expense and 
 what the distance would be to walk she remembered that the route by the was two miles shorter than by the high road and as 
 the weather was clear and there would be moonlight she determined to make her way on foot and to start at once that she might reach 
 home the next day 
 
 the sun had set and the evening bells sounded through the air 
 from the tower of the village church but to her it was not the bells 
 but the cry of the frogs in the marshes then they ceased and all 
 around became still not a bird could be heard they were all at rest 
 even the owl had not left her hiding place deep silence reigned on 
 the margin of the wood by the as anne lisbeth walked on she could hear her own footsteps in the sands even the waves of the sea were at rest and all in the deep waters had sunk into silence 
 
 there was quiet among the dead and the living in the deep sea anne 
 lisbeth walked on thinking of nothing at all as people say or 
 rather her thoughts wandered but not away from her for thought is 
 never absent from us it only slumbers many thoughts that have lain 
 dormant are roused at the proper time and begin to stir in the mind 
 and the heart and seem even to come upon us from above it is 
 written that a good deed bears a blessing for its fruit and it is 
 also written that the wages of sin is death much has been said and 
 much written which we pass over or know nothing of a light arises 
 within us and then forgotten things make themselves remembered and thus it was with anne lisbeth the germ of every vice and every virtue lies in our heart in yours and in mine they lie like little grains 
 of seed till a ray of sunshine or the touch of an evil hand or 
 you turn the corner to the right or to the left and the decision is 
 made the little seed is stirred it swells and shoots up and pours 
 its sap into your blood directing your course either for good or 
 evil troublesome thoughts often exist in the mind fermenting 
 there which are not realized by us while the senses are as it were 
 slumbering but still they are there anne lisbeth walked on thus with 
 her senses half asleep but the thoughts were fermenting within her 
 from one shrove tuesday to another much may occur to weigh down the heart it is the reckoning of a whole year much may be forgotten sins against heaven in word and thought sins against our neighbor and against our own conscience we are scarcely aware of their existence and anne lisbeth did not think of any of her errors 
 she had committed no crime against the law of the land she was an 
 honorable person in a good position that she knew 
 
 she continued her walk along by the margin of the sea what was it 
 she saw lying there an old hat a hat now when might that have been washed overboard she drew nearer she stopped to look at the hat ha what was lying yonder she shuddered yet it was nothing save a heap of grass and tangled seaweed flung across a long stone but it looked like a corpse only tangled grass and yet she was 
 frightened at it as she turned to walk away much came into her 
 mind that she had heard in her childhood old superstitions of 
 spectres by the of the ghosts of drowned but unburied 
 people whose corpses had been washed up on the desolate beach 
 the body she knew could do no harm to any one but the spirit could pursue the lonely wanderer attach itself to him and demand to be carried to the churchyard that it might rest in consecrated ground 
 hold fast hold fast the spectre would cry and as anne lisbeth 
 murmured these words to herself the whole of her dream was suddenly recalled to her memory when the mother had clung to her and uttered these words when amid the crashing of worlds her sleeve had been torn and she had slipped from the grasp of her child who wanted to hold her up in that terrible hour her child her own child which she had never loved lay now buried in the sea and might rise up like a spectre from the waters and cry hold fast carry me 
 to consecrated ground 
 
 as these thoughts passed through her mind fear gave speed to 
 her feet so that she walked faster and faster fear came upon her 
 as if a cold clammy hand had been laid upon her heart so that she 
 almost fainted as she looked across the sea all there grew darker a 
 heavy mist came rolling onwards and clung to bush and tree 
 distorting them into fantastic shapes she turned and glanced at the 
 moon which had risen behind her it looked like a pale rayless 
 surface and a deadly weight seemed to hang upon her limbs hold 
 thought she and then she turned round a second time to look at the 
 moon a white face appeared quite close to her with a mist hanging 
 like a garment from its shoulders stop carry me to consecrated 
 earth sounded in her ears in strange hollow tones the sound did 
 not come from frogs or ravens she saw no sign of such creatures 
 a grave dig me a grave was repeated quite loud yes it was indeed the spectre of her child the child that lay beneath the ocean and whose spirit could have no rest until it was carried to the 
 churchyard and until a grave had been dug for it in consecrated 
 ground she would go there at once and there she would dig she 
 turned in the direction of the church and the weight on her heart 
 seemed to grow lighter and even to vanish altogether but when she 
 turned to go home by the shortest way it returned stop stop 
 and the words came quite clear though they were like the croak of a 
 frog or the wail of a bird a grave dig me a grave 
 
 the mist was cold and damp her hands and face were moist and 
 clammy with horror a heavy weight again seized her and clung to 
 her her mind became clear for thoughts that had never before been 
 there 
 
 in these northern regions a often buds in a single 
 night and appears in the morning sunlight in its full glory of 
 youthful green so in a single instant can the consciousness of 
 the sin that has been committed in thoughts words and actions of our past life be unfolded to us when once the conscience is awakened it springs up in the heart spontaneously and god awakens the conscience when we least expect it then we can find no excuse for ourselves the deed is there and bears witness against us the 
 thoughts seem to become words and to sound far out into the world 
 we are horrified at the thought of what we have carried within us and at the consciousness that we have not overcome the evil which has its 
 origin in thoughtlessness and pride the heart conceals within 
 itself the vices as well as the virtues and they grow in the shallowest ground anne lisbeth now experienced in thought what we have clothed in words she was overpowered by them and sank down 
 and crept along for some distance on the ground a grave dig me a 
 grave sounded again in her ears and she would have gladly buried 
 herself if in the grave she could have found forgetfulness of her 
 actions 
 
 it was the first hour of her awakening full of anguish and 
 horror superstition made her alternately shudder with cold or burn 
 with the heat of fever many things of which she had feared even to 
 speak came into her mind silently as the in the 
 moonshine a spectral apparition flitted by her she had heard of it 
 before close by her galloped four snorting steeds with fire flashing 
 from their eyes and nostrils they dragged a burning coach and within it sat the wicked lord of the manor who had ruled there a hundred years before the legend says that every night at twelve he drove into his castleyard and out again he was not as pale as dead men are but black as a coal he nodded and pointed to 
 anne lisbeth crying out hold fast hold fast and then you may ride again in a carriage and forget your child 
 
 she gathered herself up and hastened to the churchyard but black 
 crosses and black ravens danced before her eyes and she could not 
 distinguish one from the other the ravens croaked as the raven had 
 done which she saw in the daytime but now she understood what they said i am the i am the each raven 
 croaked and anne lisbeth felt that the name also applied to her 
 and she fancied she should be transformed into a black bird and 
 have to cry as they cried if she did not dig the grave and she threw 
 herself upon the earth and with her hands dug a grave in the hard 
 ground so that the blood ran from her fingers a grave dig me a 
 grave still sounded in her ears she was fearful that the cock might 
 crow and the first red streak appear in the east before she had 
 finished her work and then she would be lost and the cock crowed 
 and the day dawned in the east and the grave was only half dug an 
 icy hand passed over her head and face and down towards her heart 
 only half a grave a voice wailed and fled away yes it fled 
 away over the sea it was the ocean spectre and exhausted and 
 overpowered anne lisbeth sunk to the ground and her senses left her 
 
 it was a bright day when she came to herself and two men were 
 raising her up but she was not lying in the churchyard but on the 
 where she had dug a deep hole in the sand and cut her hand with a piece of broken glass whose sharp stern was stuck in a 
 little block of painted wood anne lisbeth was in a fever 
 
 conscience had roused the memories of superstitions and had so 
 acted upon her mind that she fancied she had only half a soul and 
 that her child had taken the other half down into the sea never would 
 she be able to cling to the mercy of heaven till she had recovered 
 this other half which was now held fast in the deep water 
 
 anne lisbeth returned to her home but she was no longer the woman 
 she had been her thoughts were like a confused tangled skein only 
 one thread only one thought was clear to her namely that she must 
 carry the spectre of the to the churchyard and dig a 
 grave for him there that by so doing she might win back her soul 
 
 many a night she was missed from her home and was always found on the waiting for the spectre 
 
 in this way a whole year passed and then one night she vanished 
 again and was not to be found the whole of the next day was spent in a useless search after her 
 
 towards evening when the clerk entered the church to toll the 
 vesper bell he saw by the altar anne lisbeth who had spent the whole day there her powers of body were almost exhausted but her eyes flashed brightly and on her cheeks was a rosy flush the last rays of the setting sun shone upon her and gleamed over the altar upon the shining clasps of the bible which lay open at the words of the prophet joel rend your hearts and not your garments and turn unto the lord 
 
 that was just a chance people said but do things happen by 
 chance in the face of anne lisbeth lighted up by the evening sun 
 could be seen peace and rest she said she was happy now for she 
 had conquered the spectre of the shore her own child had come to 
 her the night before and had said to her thou hast dug me only half 
 a grave but thou hast now for a year and a day buried me altogether 
 in thy heart and it is there a mother can best hide her child and 
 then he gave her back her lost soul and brought her into the church now i am in the house of god she said and in that house 
 we are happy 
 
 when the sun set anne soul had risen to that region 
 where there is no more pain and anne troubles were at an 
 end 
 
 the end

 of marriage single life 
 he that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune for they are impediment to great enterprises either of virtue or mischief certainly the best works and of greatest merit for the public have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men which both in affection and means have married and endowed the public yet it were great reason that those that have children should have greatest care of future times unto which they know they must transmit their dearest pledges some there are who though they lead a single life yet their thoughts do end with themselves and account future times impertinences nay there are some other that account wife and children 
 but as bills of charges nay more there are some foolish rich covetous men that 
 take a pride in having no children because they may be thought so much the richer 
 for perhaps they have heard some talk such an one is a great rich man and another except to it yea but he hath a great charge of children as if it were an abatement to his riches but the most ordinary cause of a single life is liberty especially in certain and humorous minds which are so sensible of every restraint as they will go near to think their girdles and garters to be bonds and shackles 
 unmarried men are best friends best masters best servants but not always best subjects for they are light to run away and almost all fugitives are of that 
 condition a single life doth well with church men for charity will hardly water 
 the ground where it must first fill a pool it is indifferent for judges and magistrates for if they be facile and corrupt you shall have a servant five times 
 worse than a wife for soldiers i find the generals commonly in their hortatives 
 put men in mind of their wives and children and i think the despising of marriage 
 amongst the turks maketh the vulgar soldier more base certainly wife and children are a kind of discipline of humanity and single men though they be many times more charitable because their means are less exhaust yet on the other side they are more cruel and hard hearted good to make severe inquisitors because their tenderness is not so oft called upon grave natures led by custom and therefore constant are commonly loving husbands as was said of ulysses vetulam suam praetulit immortalitati 
 chaste women are often proud and forward as presuming upon the merit of their chastity it is one of the best bonds both of chastity and obedience in the wife if she think her husband wise which she will never do if she find him jealous wives are young mistresses companions for middle age and old nurses so as a man may have a quarrel to many when he will but yet he was reputed one of the wise men mat made answer to the question when a man should marry a young man not yet an elder man not at all it is often seen that bad husbands have very good wives whether it be that it raiseth the price of their kindness when it comes or that the wives take a pride in their patience but this never fails if the bad husbands were of their own choosing against their friends consent for then they will be sure to make good their own folly

 book just man 
 chapter vii 
 
 cravatte 
 it is here that a fact falls naturally into place which we must not omit because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the bishop of d was 
 after the destruction of the band of gaspard bes who had infested the gorges of ollioules one of his lieutenants cravatte took refuge in the mountains 
 he concealed himself for some time with his bandits the remnant of gaspard troop in the county of nice then he made his way to piedmont and suddenly reappeared in france in the vicinity of barcelonette 
 he was first seen at jauziers then at tuiles 
 he hid himself in the caverns of the and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of ubaye and ubayette 
 he even pushed as far as embrun entered the cathedral one night and despoiled the sacristy 
 his highway robberies laid waste the the gendarmes were set on his track but in vain he always escaped sometimes he resisted by main force 
 he was a bold wretch 
 in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived he was making his circuit to chastelar 
 the mayor came to meet him and urged him to retrace his steps 
 cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as arche and beyond there was danger even with an escort it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose 
 therefore said the bishop i intend to go without escort 
 you do not really mean that monseigneur exclaimed the mayor 
 i do mean it so thoroughly that i absolutely refuse any gendarmes and shall set out in an hour 
 set out 
 set out 
 alone 
 alone 
 monseigneur you will not do that 
 there exists yonder in the mountains said the bishop a tiny community no bigger than that which i have not seen for three years they are my good friends those gentle and honest shepherds 
 they own one goat out of every thirty that they tend 
 they make very pretty woollen cords of various colors and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes 
 they need to be told of the good god now and then 
 what would they say to a bishop who was afraid what would they say if i did not go 
 but the brigands monseigneur 
 hold said the bishop i must think of that 
 you are right i may meet them 
 they too need to be told of the good god 
 but monseigneur there is a band of them 
 a flock of wolves 
 monsieur le maire it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that jesus has constituted me the shepherd 
 who knows the ways of providence 
 they will rob you monseigneur 
 i have nothing 
 they will kill you 
 an old goodman of a priest who passes along mumbling his prayers bah 
 to what purpose 
 oh mon dieu what if you should meet them 
 i should beg alms of them for my poor 
 do not go monseigneur 
 in the name of heaven 
 you are risking your life 
 monsieur le maire said the bishop is that really all i am not in the world to guard my own life but to guard souls 
 they had to allow him to do as he pleased 
 he set out accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide 
 his obstinacy was bruited about the and caused great consternation 
 he would take neither his sister nor madame magloire 
 he traversed the mountain on encountered no one and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his good friends the shepherds he remained there for a fortnight preaching administering the sacrament teaching exhorting 
 when the time of his departure approached he resolved to chant a te deum pontifically 
 he mentioned it to the cure 
 but what was to be done 
 there were no episcopal ornaments they could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy with a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace 
 bah said the bishop 
 let us announce our te deum from the pulpit nevertheless monsieur le cure 
 things will arrange themselves 
 they instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood all the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly 
 while they were thus embarrassed a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the bishop by two unknown horsemen who departed on the instant 
 the chest was opened it contained a cope of cloth of gold a mitre ornamented with diamonds an cross a magnificent the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of notre dame in the chest was a paper on which these words were written from cravatte to monseigneur bienvenu 
 did not i say that things would come right of themselves said the bishop 
 then he added with a smile to him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate god sends the cope of an archbishop 
 monseigneur murmured the cure throwing back his head with a smile the devil 
 the bishop looked steadily at the cure and repeated with authority god 
 when he returned to chastelar the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity all along the road 
 at the house in chastelar he rejoined mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire who were waiting for him and he said to his sister 
 well was i in the right 
 the poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands and he returns from them with his hands full i set out bearing only my faith in god i have brought back the treasure of a cathedral 
 that evening before he went to bed he said again 
 let us never fear robbers nor murderers 
 those are dangers from without petty dangers 
 let us fear ourselves 
 prejudices are the real robbers vices are the real murderers 
 the great dangers lie within ourselves what matters it what threatens our head or our purse 
 let us think only of that which threatens our soul 
 then turning to his sister 
 sister never a precaution on the part of the priest against his that which his fellow does god permits 
 let us confine ourselves to prayer when we think that a danger is approaching us 
 let us pray not for ourselves but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account 
 however such incidents were rare in his life 
 we relate those of which we know but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment 
 one month of his year resembled one hour of his day 
 as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction it consisted of very handsome things very tempting things and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate 
 stolen they had already been elsewhere half of the adventure was completed it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor 
 however we make no assertions on this point 
 only a rather obscure note was found among the papers which may bear some relation to this matter and which is couched in these terms the question is to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital

 a new hope 
 vii 
 
 luke and ben were securing artoo detoo in the back of the speeder while threepiokept a lookout for any additional troops 
 if ship is as fast as his boasting we should be all right the old manobserved with satisfaction 
 but two fifteen more when we reach alderaan 
 not the fifteen that worries me the first two kenobi explained have to sell your speeder 
 luke let his gaze rove over the landspeeder but the thrill it had once given himwas along with other things best not dwelt on 
 all right he assured kenobi listlessly i think need it again 
 from their vantage point in another booth solo and chewbacca watched as theimperials strode through the bar two of them gave the corellian a lingering growled once and the two soldiers hurried their pace somewhat 
 solo grinned sardonically turning to his partner chewie this charter couldsave our necks seventeen thousand he shook his head in amazement thosetwo must really be desperate i wonder what wanted for but i agreed noquestions paying enough for it get falcon checkitself out 
 going somewhere solo 
 the corellian identify the voice coming as it did through an electronictranslator but there was no problem recognizing the speaker or the gun it held stuckin side 
 the creature was roughly and bipedal but its head was something outof delirium by way of an upset stomach it had huge eyes bulbous on face a ridge of short spines crested the high skull while nostrils andmouth were contained in a snout 
 as a matter of fact solo replied slowly i was just on my way to see yourboss you can tell jabba got the money i owe him 
 what you said last the week prior to too late solo not going back to jabba with another one of your stories 
 but really got the money this time solo protested 
 fine take it now please 
 solo sat down slowly minions were apt to be cursed with nervoustrigger fingers the alien took the seat across from him the muzzle of the ugly littlepistol never straying from chest 
 i got it here with me tell jabba 
 too late i think jabba would rather have your my dead body solo said unamiably 
 the alien was not impressed if you insist will you come outside with must i finish it here 
 i think like another killing in here solo pointed out 
 something which might have been a laugh came from the hardly notice get up solo been looking forward to this for a longtime embarrassed me in front of jabba with your pious excuses for the lasttime 
 i think right 
 light and noise filled the little corner of the cantina and when it had faded allthat remained of the unctuous alien was a smoking slimy spot on the stone floor 
 solo brought his hand and the smoking weapon it held out from beneath the bemused stares from several of the patrons and clucking soundsfrom its more knowledgeable ones they had known the creature had committed itsfatal mistake in allowing solo the chance to get his hands under cover 
 take a lot more than the likes of you to finish me off jabba the hutalways did skimp when it came to hiring his hands 
 leaving the booth solo flipped the bartender a handful of coins as he andchewbacca moved off sorry for the mess i always was a rotten host 
 heavily armed troopers hurried down the narrow alleyway glowering from timeto time at the darkly clad beings who hawked exotic goods from dingy little in mos inner regions the walls were high and narrow turning thepassageway into tunnel 
 no one stared angrily back at them no one shouted imprecations or mouthedobscenities these armored figures moved with the authority of the empire theirsidearms boldly displayed and activated all around men andmechanicals were crouched in doorways among accumulations ofgarbage and filth they exchanged information and concluded transactions of dubiouslegality 
 a hot wind moaned down the alleyway and the troopers closed their precision and order masked a fear of such claustrophobic quarters 
 one paused to check a door only to discover it tightly locked and bolted human shambling nearby visited a harangue on the inwardly the soldier gave the crazy human a sour eye before moving ondown the alley to join up again with his fellow 
 as soon as they were well past the door slid open a crack and a metallic facepeered out below leg a squat barrel shape struggled for a view 
 i would rather have gone with master luke than stay here with you are orders i quite know what all the trouble is about but sure itmust be your fault 
 artoo responded with a near impossibility a sniggering beep 
 you watch your language the taller machine warned 
 the number of old landspeeders and other powered transports in the dusty lotwhich were still capable of motion could be counted on the fingers of one hand butthat was not the concern of luke and ben as they stood bargaining with the insectoid owner they were here not to buy but to sell 
 none of the passersby favored the hagglers with so much as a curious transactions which were no more pleas or threats to be exchanged asthough doling out vials of his own blood the owner finalized the sale by passing anumber of small metal shapes to luke luke and the insectoid traded formal and then they parted each convinced he had gotten the better of the deal 
 he says the best he can do since the xp came out they just indemand anymore luke sighed 
 look so discouraged kenobi chided him what obtained willbe sufficient enough to cover the rest 
 leaving the main street they turned down an alleyway and walked past a smallrobot herding along a clutch of creatures resembling attenuated anteaters as theyrounded the corner luke strained for a forlorn glimpse of the old link with his former life then there was no more time for looking back 
 something short and dark that might have been human underneath all itswrappings stepped out of the shadows as they moved away from the corner itcontinued staring after them as they disappeared down a bend in the walkway 
 the entrance to the small spacecraft was completelyringed by half a dozen men and aliens of which the former were by half the mostgrotesque a great mobile tub of muscle and suet topped by a shaggy scarred skullsurveyed the semicircle of armed assassins with satisfaction moving forward fromthe center of the crescent he shouted toward the ship 
 come on out solo got you surrounded 
 if so facing the wrong way came a calm voice 
 jabba the hut itself a remarkable sight his lackeys see han solo and chewbacca standing behind them 
 you see been waiting for you jabba 
 i expected you would be the hut admitted at once pleased and alarmed by thefact that neither solo nor the big wookie appeared to be armed 
 not the type to run solo said 
 run run from what jabba countered the absence of visible weaponsbothered jabba more than he cared to admit to himself there was somethingpeculiar here and it would be better to make no hasty moves until he discovered whatwas amiss 
 han my boy there are times when you disappoint me i merely wish to knowwhy you paid me as you should have long ago and why did you have tofry poor greedo like that after all you and i have been through together 
 solo grinned tightly shove it jabba there enough sentiment in yourbody to warm an orphaned bacterium as for greedo you sent him to kill me 
 why han jabba protested in surprise why would i do that the bestsmuggler in the business too valuable to fry greedo was only relaying mynatural concern at your delays he going to kill you 
 i think he thought he was next time send one of those hired twerps got something to say come see me yourself 
 jabba shook his head and his jowls fleshy echoes of his mocksorrow han only you understandi just make an would i be if every pilot who smuggled for me dumped his shipment at thefirst sign of an imperial warship and then simply showed empty pockets when idemanded recompense not good business i can be generous and not to the point of bankruptcy 
 you know even i get boarded sometimes jabba did you think i dumped thatspice because i got tired of its smell i wanted to deliver it as much as you wantedto receive it i had no choice again the sardonic smile as you say toovaluable to fry but got a charter now and i can pay you back plus a little just need some more time i can give you a thousand on account the rest in threeweeks 
 the gross form seemed to consider then directed his next words not to solo butto his hirelings put your blasters away his gaze and a predatory smile turned tothe wary corellian 
 han my boy only doing this because the best and need youagain sometime so out of the greatness of my soul and a forgiving foran extra say twenty give you a little more time the voice nearlycracked with restraint but this is the last time if you disappoint me again if youtrample my generosity in your mocking laughter put a price on your head so largeyou be able to go near a civilized system for the rest of your life because onevery one your name and face will be known to men gladly cut your guts outfor of what promise them 
 glad we both have my best interests at heart replied solo pleasantly as heand chewbacca started past the staring eyes of the hired guns pay you but not because you threaten me pay you pleasure 
 starting to search the spaceport central the commander to alternately run a couple of steps and then walk to keep pace with the longstrides of darth vader the dark lord was deep in thought as he strode down one ofthe battle main corridors trailed by several aides 
 the reports are just starting to come in the commander went on only amatter of time before we have those droids 
 send in more men if you have to never mind the protests of the must have those droids her hope of that data being used againstus that is the pillar of her resistance to the mind probes 
 i understand lord vader until then we must waste our time with foolish plan to break her 
 docking bay luke told kenobi and the robots who hadrejoined them and chewbacca he seems excited about something 
 indeed the big wookie was waving over the heads of the crowd and jabberingloudly in their direction speeding their pace none of the foursome noticed thesmall thing that had followed them from the transporter lot 
 the creature moved into the doorway and pulled a tiny transmitter from a pouchconcealed by its multifold robes the transmitter looked far too new and modern tobe in the grasp of so decrepit a specimen yet its manipulator was speaking into it withsteady assurance 
 docking bay luke noted was no different in appearance from a hostof other grandiosely named docking bays scattered throughout mos eisley itconsisted mostly of an entrance rampway and an enormous pit gouged from the rockysoil this served as clearance radii for the effects of the simple antigrav drive whichboosted all spacecraft clear of the gravitational field of the planet 
 the mathematics of spacedrive were simple enough even to luke antigravcould operate only when there was a sufficient gravity well to push thatof a supralight travel could only take place when a ship was clear ofthat same gravity hence the necessity for the system on any extrasystemcraft 
 the pit which formed docking bay was as shabbily cut and as the majority of mos eisley its sloping sides were crumbling in placesinstead of being smoothly fashioned as they were on more populous worlds lukefelt it formed the perfect setting for the spacecraft chewbacca was leading themtoward 
 that battered ellipsoid which could only loosely be labeled a ship appeared tohave been pieced together out of old hull fragments and components discarded asunusable by other craft the wonder of it luke mused was that the thing actuallyheld its shape trying to picture this vehicle as spaceworthy would have caused himto collapse in the situation not so serious but to think of traveling toalderaan in this pathetic 
 what a piece of junk he finally murmured unable to hide his feelings anylonger they were walking up the rampway toward the open port this possibly make it into hyperspace 
 kenobi comment but merely gestured toward the port where a figure wascoming to meet them 
 either solo had supernaturally acute hearing or else he was used to the reactionthe sight of the millennium falcon produced in prospective passengers she maynot look like much he confessed as he approached them but all go a few unique modifications to her myself in addition to piloting i like totinker make point five factors beyond lightspeed 
 luke scratched his head as he tried to reassess the craft in view of its either the corellian was the biggest liar this side of the galactic center orthere was more to this vessel than met the eye luke thought back once more to admonition never to trust surface impressions and decided to reserve judgmenton the ship and its pilot until after he had watched them in operation 
 chewbacca had lingered behind at the entrance now he rushedup the ramp a hairy whirlwind and blabbered excitedly at solo the pilot regardedhim coolly nodding from time to time then barked a brief reply the wookiecharged into the ship pausing only to urge everyone to follow 
 we seem to be a bit rushed solo explained cryptically so if hurryaboard be off 
 luke was about to venture some questions but kenobi was already proddinghim up the ramp the droids followed 
 inside luke was slightly startled to see the bulky chewbacca squirm and fighthis way into a chair which despite modifications was still byhis massive form the wookie flipped several tiny switches with digits seeminglytoo big for the task those great paws drifted with surprising grace over the controls 
 a deep throbbing started somewhere within the ship as the engines wereactivated luke and ben began strapping themselves into the vacant seats in themain passageway 
 outside the entrance a long leathery snout protruded from darkfolds of cloth and somewhere in the depths to either side of that imposing stared intently they turned along with the rest of the head as a squad of eightimperial troops rushed up perhaps not surprisingly they headed straight for theenigmatic figure who whispered something to the lead trooper and gestured to thedocking bay 
 the information must have been provocative activating their weapons andraising them to firing position the troops charged en masse down the 
 a glint of light on moving metal caught eyes as the unwelcome outlinesof the first troops showed themselves solo thought it unlikely they would pause toengage in casual conversation his suspicion was confirmed before he could openhis mouth to protest their intrusion as several dropped to their knees and opened fireon him solo ducked back inside turning to yell forward 
 shields quick get us out of here 
 a throaty roar of acknowledgment came back to him 
 drawing his own pistol solo managed to snap off a couple of bursts from thecomparative safety of the hatchway seeing that their quarry was neither helplessnor comatose the exposed troops dove for cover 
 the low throbbing rose to a whine then to a deafening howl as hand camedown on the button immediately the overhead slammedshut 
 as the retreating troops raced out of the entrance the ground wastrembling steadily they ran smack into a second squad which had just arrived inresponse to the rapidly spreading emergency call one of the soldiers gesticulatingwildly tried to explain to the newly arrived ranking officer what had happened backin the bay 
 as soon as the panting trooper had finished the officer whipped out a compactcommunicator and shouted into it flight trying to escape sendeverything got after this ship 
 all across mos eisley alarms began to sound spreading out from docking in concentric circles of concern 
 several soldiers scouring one alleyway reacted to the citywide alarm at the sametime as they saw the small freighter lift gracefully into the clear blue sky above moseisley it shrank to a pinpoint before any of them thought to bring a weapon to bear 
 luke and ben were already undoing their acceleration straps as solo walked pastthem moving toward the cockpit with the easy stride of the experiencedspacer once forward he fell rather than sat in the seat and immediatelybegan checking readouts and gauges in the seat next to him chewbacca wasgrowling and grunting like a poorly tuned speeder engine he turned from studyinghis own instruments long enough to jab a massive finger at the tracking screen 
 solo gave it a quick glance then turned irritably to his own panel i know iknowlooks like two maybe three destroyers somebody certainly dislikes ourpassengers sure picked ourselves a hot one this time try to hold them offsomehow until i can finish the programming for the supralight jump angle thedeflectors for maximum shielding 
 with those instructions he ceased conversing with the huge wookie as his handsflew over the terminals solo did not even turned around when asmall cylindrical shape appeared in the doorway behind him artoo detoo beeped afew remarks then scurried away 
 rear scanners showed the baleful lemon eye of tatooine shrinking rapidlybehind them it rapid enough to eliminate the three points of light thatindicated the presence of the pursuing imperial warships 
 although solo had ignored artoo he turned to acknowledge the entrance of hishuman passengers got two more coming in from different angles he toldthem scrutinizing the remorseless instrumentation going to try box upbefore we can jump five shipswhat did you two do to attract that kind ofcompany 
 you outrun them luke asked sarcastically ignoring the questionthe question i thought you said this thing was fast 
 watch your mouth kid or find yourself floating home toomany of em for one thing but be safe enough once made the jumpinto hyperspace he grinned knowingly nobody track another shipaccurately at supralight speeds plus i know a few tricks that ought to lose anypersistent i wish known you boys were so popular 
 why luke said challengingly would you have refused to take us 
 not necessarily the corellian replied refusing to be baited but i boosted your fare 
 luke had a retort poised on his lips it was wiped out as he threw up his armsto ward off a brilliant red flash which gave black space outside the viewport thetemporary aspect of the surface of a sun kenobi solo and even chewbacca didlikewise since the proximity of the explosion nearly overrode the phototropicshielding 
 where the situation gets interesting solo muttered 
 how long before you can make the jump kenobi inquired easily apparentlyunconcerned that at any second they all might cease to exist 
 still within the gravitational influence of tatooine came the coolresponse it will be a few minutes yet before the navigation computer cancompensate and effect an accurate jump i could override its decision but thehyperdrive would likely shred itself that would give me a nice hold full of scrapmetal in addition to you four 
 a few minutes luke blurted staring at the screens at the rate 
 traveling through hyperspace like dusting crops boy ever triedcalculating a hyperspace jump luke had to shake his head no mean nice if we rushed it and passed right through a star or some other friendly spatialphenom like a black hole that would end our trip real quick 
 fresh explosions continued to flare close by despite best efforts atevasion on console a red warning light began to flash for attention 
 that luke wondered nervously 
 losing a deflector shield solo informed him with the air of a man aboutto have a tooth pulled better strap yourselves back in almost ready tomake the jump it could get bad if we take a at the wrong moment 
 back in the main hold area threepio was already locked tightly into his seat bymetal arms stronger than any acceleration straps artoo swayed back and forthunder the concussion produced by increasingly powerful energy bursts against deflectors 
 was this trip really necessary the tall robot muttered in desperation how much i hate space travel he broke off as luke and ben appearedand began strapping themselves back into their chairs 
 oddly luke was thinking of a dog he had once owned when an immenselypowerful something wrenched at the hull with the strength of a fallen angel 
 admiral motti entered the quiet conference room his face streaked by the linearlights lining the walls his gaze went to the spot where governor tarkin stoodbefore the curved viewscreen and he bowed slightly despite the evidence of thesmall green gem of a world entered in the screen he formally announced we haveentered the alderaan system we await your order 
 the door signaled and tarkin made a falsely gentle gesture to the a moment yet motti 
 the door slid aside and leia organa entered flanked by two armed by darth vader 
 i am tarkin began 
 i know who you are she spat governor tarkin i should have expected tofind you holding leash i thought i recognized your unique stench when iwas first brought on board 
 charming to the last tarkin declared in a fashion which suggested he wasanything but charmed you know how hard i found it to sign the order foryour termination his expression changed to one of mock sorrow of you cooperated in our investigation things might be otherwise lord vader hasinformed me that your resistance to our traditional methods of inquiry 
 torture you mean she countered a trifle shakily 
 let us not bandy semantics tarkin smiled 
 surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility for issuing the orderon yourself 
 tarkin sighed reluctantly i am a dedicated man and the pleasures i reservedfor myself are few one of them is that before your execution i should like you to bemy guest at a small ceremony it will certify this battle operational statuswhile at the same time ushering in a new era of imperial technical supremacy thisstation is the final link in the imperial chain which will bind the millionsystems of the galactic empire together once and for all your petty alliance will nolonger be of any concern to us after demonstration no one will dare toopposite imperial decree not even the senate 
 organa looked at him with contempt force will not keep the empire has never kept anything together for very long the more you tighten yourgrip the more systems will slip through your fingers a foolish foolish men often choke to death on their own delusions 
 tarkin smiled a smile his face a parchment it will beinteresting to see what manner of passing lord vader has in mind for you i amcertain it will be worthy of of him 
 but before you leave us we must demonstrate the power of this station onceand for all in a conclusive fashion in a way you have determined the choice ofsubject for this demonstration since you have proven reluctant to supply us withthe location of the rebel stronghold i have deemed it appropriate to select as analternate subject your home planet of alderaan 
 no you alderaan is a peaceful world with no standing 
 eyes gleamed you would prefer another target a military agreeable grow tired of such games for the last time where is themain rebel base 
 a voice announced over a hidden speaker that they had approached withinantigrav range of six planetary diameters that wasenough to accomplish what all of infernal devices had failed to 
 dantooine she whispered staring at the deck all pretense at defiance gonenow on dantooine 
 tarkin let out a slow sigh of satisfaction then turned to the black figure you see lord vader she can be reasonable one needs only frame thequestion properly to elicit the desired response he directed his attention to theother officers after concluding our little test here we shall make haste to move onto dantooine you may proceed with the operation gentlemen 
 it took several seconds for words so casually uttered to organa finally gasped 
 dantooine tarkin explained examining his fingers is too far from thecenters of imperial population to serve as the subject of an effective will understand that for reports of our power to spread rapidly through theempire we require an obstreperous world more centrally located have no we will deal with your rebel friends on dantooine as soon as possible 
 but you said organa started to protest 
 the only words which have meaning are the last ones spoken tarkin declaredcuttingly we will proceed with destruction of alderaan as planned then youwill enjoy watching with us as we obliterate the dantooine center of this stupid andfutile rebellion 
 he gestured to the two soldiers flanking her escort her to the principalobservation level and he smiled make certain she is provided with an unobstructedview

 book one 
 chapter viii 
 
 the friends were silent neither cared to begin talking pierre continually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand 
 let us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the door 
 they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining room everything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on his face began to talk as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out 
 never never marry my dear fellow my advice never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake marry when you are old and good for nothing or all that is good and noble in you will be lost it will all be wasted on trifles yes yes yes look at me with such surprise if you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future you will feel at every step that for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing room where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot but the good and he waved his arm 
 pierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different and the expression still more apparent and gazed at his friend in amazement 
 my wife continued prince andrew is an excellent woman one of those rare women with whom a honor is safe but o god what would i not give now to be unmarried you are the first and only one to whom i mention this because i like you 
 as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkonski who had lolled in anna easy chairs and with eyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation 
 you understand why i say this he continued but it is the whole story of life you talk of bonaparte and his career said he though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal he was free he had nothing but his aim to consider and he reached it but tie yourself up with a woman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom and all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and triviality these are the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the war the greatest war there ever was and i know nothing and am fit for nothing i am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued prince andrew and at anna they listen to me and that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist and those women if you only knew what those society women are and women in general my father is right selfish vain stupid trivial in everything what women are when you see them in their true colors when you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them but nothing nothing nothing no marry my dear fellow marry concluded prince andrew 
 it seems funny to me said pierre that you you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you have everything before you everything and you 
 he did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future 
 how can he talk like that thought pierre he considered his friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might be best described as strength of will pierre was always astonished at prince calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memory his extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and had an opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for work and study and if pierre was often struck by lack of capacity for philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength 
 even in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise and commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly 
 my part is played out said prince andrew the use of talking about me let us talk about you he added after a silence smiling at his reassuring thoughts 
 that smile was immediately reflected on face 
 but what is there to say about me said pierre his face relaxing into a careless merry smile what am i an illegitimate son he suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this without a name and without means and it really but he did not say what it really was for the present i am free and am all right only i the least idea what i am to do i wanted to consult you seriously 
 prince andrew looked kindly at him yet his glance friendly and affectionate as it was expressed a sense of his own superiority 
 i am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among our whole set yes all right choose what you will all the same be all right anywhere but look here give up visiting those kuragins and leading that sort of life it suits you so badly all this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it 
 what would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugging his shoulders women my dear fellow women 
 i understand it replied prince andrew women who are comme il faut a different matter but the kuragins set of women women and wine i understand 
 pierre was staying at prince vasili and sharing the dissipated life of his son anatole the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to prince sister 
 do you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thought seriously i have long been thinking of it leading such a life i decide or think properly about anything head aches and one spends all money he asked me for tonight but i go 
 you give me your word of honor not to go 
 on my honor

 chapter 
 
 on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock was born we were busy with the hay in a far away field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran 
 oh such a grand bairn she panted out the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says been in a consumption these many months i heard him tell mr hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and be dead before winter you must come home directly to nurse it nelly to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis 
 but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet 
 i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man out of her head for joy such a beauty if i were her certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of kenneth i was fairly mad at him dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up then the old croaker steps forward and says he earnshaw a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son when she came i felt convinced we keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her take on and fret about it too much it be helped and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass 
 and what did the master answer i inquired 
 i think he swore but i mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for sake he had room in his heart only for two wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i conceive how he would bear the loss 
 when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby 
 nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile 
 and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says 
 damn the doctor he interrupted reddening frances is quite right be perfectly well by this time next week are you going upstairs will you tell her that come if promise not to talk i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she her mr kenneth says she must be quiet 
 i delivered this message to mrs earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily 
 i hardly spoke a word there he has gone out twice crying well say i promise i speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him 
 poor soul till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he put him to further expense by attending her he retorted 
 i know you need does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool 
 he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up tomorrow a fit of coughing took very slight raised her in his arms she put her two hands about his neck her face changed and she was dead 
 as the girl had anticipated the child hareton fell wholly into my hands mr earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove 
 the bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity i could not half tell what an infernal house we had the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless edgar visits to miss cathy might be an exception at fifteen she was the queen of the countryside she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature i own i did not like her after her infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young linton with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace it used to hang on one side and his on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was can you make that out 
 mrs dean raised the candle and i discerned a face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression it formed a sweet picture the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eyes were large and serious the figure almost too graceful i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw 
 a very agreeable portrait i observed to the housekeeper is it like 
 yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general 
 catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive anyone in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise mr edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly he had a terror of reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery that sounds but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility she did bring herself finally to confess and confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser 
 mr hindley had gone from home one afternoon and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning his sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr earnshaw was faded away he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level then personal appearance sympathized with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance 
 catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him on the occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr edgar of her absence and was then preparing to receive him 
 cathy are you busy this afternoon asked heathcliff are you going anywhere 
 no it is raining she answered 
 why have you that silk frock on then he said nobody coming here i hope 
 not that i know of stammered miss but you should be in the field now heathcliff it is an hour past dinner time i thought you were gone 
 hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy not work any more today stay with you 
 oh but joseph will tell she suggested better go 
 joseph is loading lime on the farther side of pennistow crag it will take him till dark and never know 
 so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down catherine reflected an instant with knitted found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a silence as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good 
 order ellen to say you are engaged cathy he persisted turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours on the point sometimes of complaining that not 
 that they what cried catherine gazing at him with a troubled countenance oh nelly she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands combed my hair quite out of curl enough let me alone what are you on the point of complaining about heathcliff 
 look at the almanac on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me do you see marked every day 
 foolish as if i took notice replied catherine in a peevish tone and where is the sense of that 
 to show that i do take notice said heathcliff 
 and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated what good do i get what do you talk about you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either 
 you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company cathy exclaimed heathcliff in much agitation 
 no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered 
 her companion rose up but he time to express his feelings further for a feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect 
 he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do less gruff than we talk here and softer 
 not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser 
 no answered catherine what are you doing there nelly 
 my work miss i replied mr hindley had given me directions to make a third parry in any private visits linton chose to pay 
 she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are 
 a good opportunity now that the master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence sure mr edgar will excuse me 
 i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff 
 sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation 
 she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and not going to bear it 
 i touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze 
 that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her 
 she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water 
 catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed 
 leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over 
 little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest he drew back in consternation i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip 
 right i said to myself take warning and begone a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition 
 where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door 
 he swerved aside and attempted to pass 
 you must not go she exclaimed energetically 
 i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice 
 no she persisted grasping the handle not yet edgar linton sit down you shall not leave me in that temper i should be miserable all night and i be miserable for you 
 can i stay after you have struck me asked linton catherine was mute 
 made me afraid and ashamed of you he continued not come here again 
 her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle and you told a deliberate untruth he said 
 i she cried recovering her speech i did nothing deliberately well go if you away and now cry myself sick 
 she dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court there he lingered i resolved to encourage him 
 miss is dreadfully wayward sir i called out as bad as any marred child better be riding home or else she will be sick only to grieve us 
 the soft thing looked askance through the window he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half eaten ah i thought there will be no saving him doomed and flies to his fate and so it was he turned abruptly hastened into the house again shut the door behind him and when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home rabid drunk ready to pull the whole place about our ears his ordinary frame of mind in that condition i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful timidity and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship and confess themselves lovers 
 intelligence of mr arrival drove linton speedily to his horse and catherine to her chamber i went to hide little hareton and to take the shot out of the which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked or even attracted his notice too much and i had hit upon the plan of removing it that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun

 chapter eight 
 
 girls where are you going asked amy coming into their room one saturday afternoon and finding them getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity 
 never mind little girls ask questions returned jo sharply 
 now if there is anything mortifying to out feelings when we are young it is to be told that and to be bidden to run away dear is still more trying to us amy bridled up at this insult and determined to find out the secret if she teased for an hour turning to meg who never refused her anything very long she said coaxingly do tell me i should think you might let me go too for beth is fussing over her piano and i got anything to do and am so lonely 
 i dear because you invited began meg but jo broke in impatiently now meg be quiet or you will spoil it all you go amy so be a baby and whine about it 
 you are going somewhere with laurie i know you are you were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night and you stopped when i came in you going with him 
 yes we are now do be still and stop bothering 
 amy held her tongue but used her eyes and saw meg slip a fan into her pocket 
 i know i know going to the theater to see the seven castles she cried adding resolutely and i shall go for mother said i might see it and got my rag money and it was mean not to tell me in time 
 just listen to me a minute and be a good child said meg soothingly mother wish you to go this week because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece next week you can go with beth and hannah and have a nice time 
 i like that half as well as going with you and laurie please let me been sick with this cold so long and shut up dying for some fun do meg be ever so good pleaded amy looking as pathetic as she could 
 suppose we take her i believe mother would mind if we bundle her up well began meg 
 if she goes i and if i laurie like it and it will be very rude after he invited only us to go and drag in amy i should think hate to poke herself where she wanted said jo crossly for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself 
 her tone and manner angered amy who began to put her boots on saying in her most aggravating way i shall go meg says i may and if i pay for myself laurie anything to do with it 
 you sit with us for our seats are reserved and you sit alone so laurie will give you his place and that will spoil our pleasure or get another seat for you and that proper when you asked you stir a step so you may just stay where you are scolded jo crosser than ever having just pricked her finger in her hurry 
 sitting on the floor with one boot on amy began to cry and meg to reason with her when laurie called from below and the two girls hurried down leaving their sister wailing for now and then she forgot her ways and acted like a spoiled child just as the party was setting out amy called over the banisters in a threatening tone be sorry for this jo march see if you 
 fiddlesticks returned jo slamming the door 
 they had a charming time for the seven castles of the diamond lake was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish but in spite of the comical red imps sparkling elves and the gorgeous princes and princesses pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it the fairy yellow curls reminded her of amy and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her sorry for it she and amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused amy teased jo and jo irritated amy and semioccasional explosions occurred of which both were much ashamed afterward although the oldest jo had the least and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble her anger never lasted long and having humbly confessed her fault she sincerely repented and tried to do better her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward poor jo tried desperately to be good but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her and it took years of patient effort to subdue it 
 when they got home they found amy reading in the parlor she assumed an injured air as they came in never lifted her eyes from her book or asked a single question perhaps curiosity might have conquered resentment if beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play on going up to put away her best hat first look was toward the bureau for in their last quarrel amy had soothed her feelings by turning top drawer upside down on the floor everything was in its place however and after a hasty glance into her various closets bags and boxes jo decided that amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs 
 there jo was mistaken for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest meg beth and amy were sitting together late in the afternoon when jo burst into the room looking excited and demanding breathlessly has anyone taken my book 
 meg and beth said no at once and looked surprised amy poked the fire and said nothing jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute 
 amy got it 
 no i 
 you know where it is then 
 no i 
 a fib cried jo taking her by the shoulders and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than amy 
 it i got it know where it is now and care 
 you know something about it and better tell at once or make you and jo gave her a slight shake 
 scold as much as you like never see your silly old book again cried amy getting excited in her turn 
 why not 
 i burned it up 
 what my little book i was so fond of and worked over and meant to finish before father got home have you really burned it said jo turning very pale while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched amy nervously 
 yes i did i told you make you pay for being so cross yesterday and i have so 
 amy got no farther for hot temper mastered her and she shook amy till her teeth chattered in her head crying in a passion of grief and anger 
 you wicked wicked girl i never can write it again and never forgive you as long as i live 
 meg flew to rescue amy and beth to pacify jo but jo was quite beside herself and with a parting box on her ear she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret and finished her fight alone 
 the storm cleared up below for mrs march came home and having heard the story soon brought amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister book was the pride of her heart and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise it was only half a dozen little fairy tales but jo had worked over them patiently putting her whole heart into her work hoping to make something good enough to print she had just copied them with great care and had destroyed the old manuscript so that bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years it seemed a small loss to others but to jo it was a dreadful calamity and she felt that it never could be made up to her beth mourned as for a departed kitten and meg refused to defend her pet mrs march looked grave and grieved and amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them 
 when the tea bell rang jo appeared looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all courage to say meekly 
 please forgive me jo very very sorry 
 i never shall forgive you was stern answer and from that moment she ignored amy entirely 
 no one spoke of the great trouble not even mrs march for all had learned by experience that when jo was in that mood words were wasted and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident or her own generous nature softened resentment and healed the breach it was not a happy evening for though they sewed as usual while their mother read aloud from bremer scott or edgeworth something was wanting and the sweet home peace was disturbed they felt this most when singing time came for beth could only play jo stood dumb as a stone and amy broke down so meg and mother sang alone but in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual and all felt out of tune 
 as jo received her kiss mrs march whispered gently my dear let the sun go down upon your anger forgive each other help each other and begin again tomorrow 
 jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom and cry her grief and anger all away but tears were an unmanly weakness and she felt so deeply injured that she really quite forgive yet so she winked hard shook her head and said gruffly because amy was listening it was an abominable thing and she deserve to be forgiven 
 with that she marched off to bed and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night 
 amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed and began to wish she had not humbled herself to feel more injured than ever and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating jo still looked like a thunder cloud and nothing went well all day it was bitter cold in the morning she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter aunt march had an attack of the fidgets meg was sensitive beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home and amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet even try when other people set them a virtuous example everybody is so hateful ask laurie to go skating he is always kind and jolly and will put me to rights i know said jo to herself and off she went 
 amy heard the clash of skates and looked out with an impatient exclamation 
 there she promised i should go next time for this is the last ice we shall have but no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me 
 say that you were very naughty and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book but i think she might do it now and i guess she will if you try her at the right minute said meg go after them say anything till jo has got with laurie than take a quiet minute and just kiss her or do some kind thing and sure be friends again with all her heart 
 try said amy for the advice suited her and after a flurry to get ready she ran after the friends who were just disappearing over the hill 
 it was not far to the river but both were ready before amy reached them jo saw her coming and turned her back laurie did not see for he was carefully skating along the shore sounding the ice for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap 
 go on to the first bend and see if all right before we begin to race amy heard him say as he shot away looking like a young russian in his coat and cap 
 jo heard amy panting after her run stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on but jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river taking a bitter unhappy sort of satisfaction in her troubles she had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once as laurie turned the bend he shouted back 
 keep near the shore it safe in the middle jo heard but amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word jo glanced over her shoulder and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear 
 no matter whether she heard or not let her take care of herself 
 laurie had vanished round the bend jo was just at the turn and amy far behind striking out toward the the smoother ice in the middle of the river for a minute jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart then she resolved to go on but something held and turned her round just in time to see amy throw up her hands and go down with a sudden crash of rotten ice the splash of water and a cry that made heart stand still with fear she tried to call laurie but her voice was gone she tried to rush forward but her feet seemed to have no strength in them and for a second she could only stand motionless staring with a face at the little blue hood above the black water something rushed swiftly by her and voice cried out 
 bring a rail quick quick 
 how she did it she never knew but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed blindly obeying laurie who was quite and lying flat held amy up by his arm and hockey stick till jo dragged a rail from the fence and together they got the child out more frightened than hurt 
 now then we must walk her home as fast as we can pile our things on her while i get off these confounded skates cried laurie wrapping his coat round amy and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before 
 shivering dripping and crying they got amy home and after an exciting time of it she fell asleep rolled in blankets before a hot fire during the bustle jo had scarcely spoken but flown about looking pale and wild with her things half off her dress torn and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles when amy was comfortably asleep the house quiet and mrs march sitting by the bed she called jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands 
 are you sure she is safe whispered jo looking remorsefully at the golden head which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice 
 quite safe dear she is not hurt and even take cold i think you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly replied her mother cheerfully 
 laurie did it all i only let her go mother if she should die it would be my fault and jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears telling all that had happened bitterly condemning her hardness of heart and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her my dreadful temper i try to cure it i think i have and then it breaks out worse than ever oh mother what shall i do what shall i do cried poor jo in despair 
 watch and pray dear never get tired of trying and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault said mrs march drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that jo cried even harder 
 you know you guess how bad it is it seems as if i could do anything when in a passion i get so savage i could hurt anyone and enjoy it afraid i shall do something dreadful some day and spoil my life and make everybody hate me oh mother help me do help me 
 i will my child i will cry so bitterly but remember this day and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it jo dear we all have our temptations some far greater than yours and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them you think your temper is the worst in the world but mine used to be just like it 
 yours mother why you are never angry and for the moment jo forgot remorse in surprise 
 been trying to cure it for forty years and have only succeeded in controlling it i am angry nearly every day of my life jo but i have learned not to show it and i still hope to learn not to feel it though it may take me another forty years to do so 
 the patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to jo than the wisest lecture the sharpest reproof she felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her the knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers and tried to mend it made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen 
 mother are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes when aunt march scolds or people worry you asked jo feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before 
 yes learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips and when i feel that they mean to break out against my will i just go away for a minute and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked answered mrs march with a sigh and a smile as she smoothed and fastened up disheveled hair 
 how did you learn to keep still that is what troubles me for the sharp words fly out before i know what about and the more i say the worse i get till a pleasure to hurt feelings and say dreadful things tell me how you do it marmee dear 
 my good mother used to help me 
 as you do us interrupted jo with a grateful kiss 
 but i lost her when i was a little older than you are and for years had to struggle on alone for i was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else i had a hard time jo and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures for in spite of my efforts i never seemed to get on then your father came and i was so happy that i found it easy to be good but when i had four little daughters round me and we were poor then the old trouble began again for i am not patient by nature and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything 
 poor mother what helped you then 
 your father jo he never loses patience never doubts or complains but always hopes and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him he helped and comforted me and showed me that i must try to practice all the virtues i would have my little girls possess for i was their example it was easier to try for your sakes than for my own a startled or surprised look from one of you when i spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done and the love respect and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward i could receive for my efforts to be the woman i would have them copy 
 oh mother if ever half as good as you i shall be satisfied cried jo much touched 
 i hope you will be a great deal better dear but you must keep watch over your bosom enemy as father calls it or it may sadden if not spoil your life you have had a it and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today 
 i will try mother i truly will but you must help me remind me and keep me from flying out i used to see father sometimes put his finger on his lips and look at you with a very kind but sober face and you always folded your lips tight and went away was he reminding you then asked jo softly 
 yes i asked him to help me so and he never forgot it but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look 
 jo saw that her eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke and fearing that she had said too much she whispered anxiously was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it i mean to be rude but so comfortable to say all i think to you and feel so safe and happy here 
 mu jo you may say anything to your mother for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much i love them 
 i thought grieved you 
 no dear but speaking of father reminded me how much i miss him how much i owe him and how faithfully i should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him 
 yet you told him to go mother and cry when he went and never complain now or seem as if you needed any help said jo wondering 
 i gave my best to the country i love and kept my tears till he was gone why should i complain when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end if i seem to need help it is because i have a better friend even than father to comfort and sustain me my child the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your heavenly father as you do that of your earthly one the more you love and trust him and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom his love and care never tire or change can never be taken from you but my become the source of lifelong peace happiness and strength believe this heartily and go to god with all your little cares and hopes and sins and sorrows as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother 
 only answer was to hold her mother close and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words for in that sad yet happy hour she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair but the sweetness of and and led by her hand she had drawn nearer to the friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father tenderer than that of any mother 
 amy stirred and sighed in her sleep and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault l jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before 
 i let the sun go down on my anger i forgive her and today if it been for laurie it might have been too late how could i be so wicked said jo half aloud as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow 
 as if she heard amy opened her eyes and held out her arms with a smile that went straight to heart neither said a word but they hugged one another close in spite of the blankets and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss

 int room 
 across the room a dark figure stares out the tall 
 windows veiled with decaying lace he turns and his 
 smile lights up the room 
 morpheus 
 at last 
 he wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible 
 behind circular mirrored glasses 
 he strides to neo and they shake hands 
 morpheus 
 welcome neo as you no doubt have guessed i am morpheus 
 neo 
 an honor 
 morpheus 
 please come sit 
 he nods to trinity 
 morpheus 
 thank you trinity 
 she bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an 
 adjacent room 
 they sit across from one another in cracked burgundy 
 leather chairs 
 morpheus 
 i imagine right now you must be feeling a bit like alice tumbling 
 down the rabbit hole 
 neo 
 you could say that 
 morpheus 
 i can see it in your eyes you have the look of a man who accepts 
 what he sees because he is expecting to wake up 
 a smile curls the corner of his lips 
 morpheus 
 ironically this is not far from the truth but getting ahead 
 of myself can you tell me neo why are you here 
 neo 
 morpheus a legend most hackers would die to meet 
 you 
 morpheus 
 yes thank you but i think we both know more to it than 
 that do you believe in fate neo 
 neo 
 no 
 morpheus 
 why not 
 neo 
 because i like the idea that not in control of my life 
 morpheus 
 i know exactly what you mean 
 again that smile that could cut glass 
 morpheus 
 let me tell you why you are here you are here because you have the gift 
 neo 
 what gift 
 morpheus 
 watched you neo you do not use a computer like a tool you 
 use it like it was part of yourself what you can do inside 
 a computer is not normal i know seen it what you do is 
 magic 
 neo shrugs 
 neo 
 not magic 
 morpheus 
 but it is neo it is how else would you describe what has been 
 happening to you 
 he leans forward 
 morpheus 
 we are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and 
 logical have you ever wondered why 
 neo shakes his head 
 morpheus 
 as children we do not separate the possible from the impossible 
 which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a 
 mind like yours can be very difficult 
 neo 
 free from what 
 morpheus 
 from the matrix 
 neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself 
 morpheus 
 do you want to know what it is neo 
 neo swallows and nods his head 
 morpheus 
 that feeling you have had all your life that feeling that 
 something was wrong with the world you know what it is 
 but there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad 
 driving you to me but what is it 
 the leather creaks as he leans back 
 morpheus 
 the matrix is everywhere all around us here even in this room 
 you can see it out your window or on your television you feel it 
 when you go to work or go to church or pay your taxes it is 
 the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from 
 the truth 
 neo 
 what truth 
 morpheus 
 that you are a slave neo that you like everyone else was born 
 into bondage 
 kept inside a prison that you cannot smell taste or touch a 
 prison for your mind 
 outside the wind batters a loose pane of glass 
 morpheus 
 unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is you have to 
 see it for yourself 
 neo 
 how 
 morpheus 
 hold out your hands 
 in right hand morpheus drops a red pill 
 morpheus 
 this is your last chance after this there is no going back 
 in his left a blue pill 
 morpheus 
 you take the blue pill and the story ends you wake in your bed 
 and you believe whatever you want to believe 
 the pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses 
 morpheus 
 you take the red pill and you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the goes 
 neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules with the 
 moisture growing in his palms 
 morpheus 
 remember that all i am offering is the truth nothing more 
 neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill the 
 cheshire smile returns 
 morpheus 
 follow me 
 he leads neo into the other room which is cramped with 
 equipment glowing and electric green 
 from the racks of monitors 
 trinity apoc and cypher look up as they enter 
 cypher 
 shit 
 trinity 
 i knew he would 
 cypher saddles up to morpheus talking in a hushed tone 
 away from neo 
 cypher 
 morpheus i know what you believe but i think this is a mistake 
 rushing him old afraid he might pop 
 morpheus 
 i always told you cypher not to let fear control your life 
 apoc are we 
 neo recognizes the large man from the el train 
 apoc 
 almost 
 he and trinity are working quickly hardwiring a complex 
 system of monitors modules and drives 
 neo 
 apoc you wrote the four horsemen virus 
 apoc 
 right 
 morpheus 
 neo time is always against us will you take a seat there 
 in the center of the room sits a chair near the chair 
 is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked 
 morpheus 
 i imagine you know sonething about virtual reality 
 neo sits and trinity begins gently fixing white electrode 
 disks to his head arns and the back of his neck 
 neo 
 a little 
 morpheus 
 tell me about it 
 neo 
 essentially a hardware system that uses an apparatus 
 headgear gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a 
 computer program 
 morpheus 
 if the virtual reality apparatus as you called it was wired to all 
 of your senses and controlled them completely would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world 
 neo 
 you might not no 
 morpheus 
 no you 
 neo whispers to trinity 
 neo 
 you did all this 
 she nods placing a set of headphones over his ears 
 they are wired to an old hotel phone 
 morpheus 
 the pill you took is part of a trace program going to make 
 things feel a bit strange 
 distantly through the ear phones he hears apoc pounding 
 on a keyboard sweat beads his face his eyes blink and 
 twitch when he notices the mirror 
 he stares as it begins to heal itself a 
 webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the 
 mirror were becoming liquid 
 neo 
 shit 
 cypher works with apoc checking reams of phosphorescent 
 data trinity monitors electric vital signs 
 neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers 
 disappear beneath the rippling surface 
 quickly he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror 
 stretches in long rubbery strands like 
 stuck to his fingertips 
 neo 
 what is this mescaline 
 morpheus 
 just relax neo 
 the strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away 
 until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break 
 with the tinkling of glass shimmering snowflakes 
 of mercury fall hit the ground and 
 fade 
 he looks at his hand fingers distended into mirrored 
 icicles that begin to melt rapidly dripping running 
 like wax down his fingers spreading across his palms 
 where he sees his face reflected 
 neo 
 
 trinity 
 going into replication 
 morpheus 
 apoc 
 apoc 
 still nothing 
 morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number 
 morpheus 
 tank going to need the signal soon stay calm neo 
 the mirror gel seems to come to life racing crawling up 
 his arns like hundreds of insects 
 neo 
 cold

lionfish nov chapter eight the deathday partycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 october arrived spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle madam pomfrey the nurse was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students her pepperup potion worked instantly though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward ginny weasley who had been looking pale was bullied into taking some by percy the steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end the lake rose the flower beds turned into muddy streams and pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds oliver enthusiasm for regular training sessions however was not dampened which was why harry was to be found late one stormy saturday afternoon a few days before halloween returning to gryffindor tower drenched to the skin and splattered with mud 
 
 even aside from the rain and wind it been a happy practice session fred and george who had been spying on the slytherin team had seen for themselves the speed of those new nimbus two thousand and ones they reported that the slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs shooting through the air like missiles as harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was nearly headless nick the ghost of gryffindor tower was staring morosely out of a window muttering under his breath fulfill their requirements half an inch if that 
 
 hello nick said harry 
 
 hello hello said nearly headless nick starting and looking round he wore a dashing plumed hat on his long curly hair and a tunic with a ruff which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed he was pale as smoke and harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside 
 
 you look troubled young potter said nick folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet 
 
 so do you said harry 
 
 ah nearly headless nick waved an elegant hand a matter of no importance not as though i really wanted to join thought apply but apparently i fulfill requirements 
 
 in spite of his airy tone there was a look of great bitterness on his face 
 
 but you would think you he erupted suddenly pulling the letter back out of his pocket that getting hit times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the headless hunt 
 
 oh yes said harry who was obviously supposed to agree 
 
 i mean nobody wishes more than i do that it had all been quick and clean and my head had come off properly i mean it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule however nearly headless nick shook his letter open and read furiously 
 
 we can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies you will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as horseback and head polo it is with the greatest regret therefore that i must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements with very best wishes sir patrick 
 
 fuming nearly headless nick stuffed the letter away 
 
 half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on harry most people would think good and beheaded but oh no not enough for sir properly 
 
 nearly headless nick took several deep breaths and then said in a far calmer tone so bothering you anything i can do 
 
 no said harry not unless you know where we can get seven free nimbus two thousand and ones for our match against sly 
 
 the rest of sentence was drowned out by a mewling from somewhere near his ankles he looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of yellow eyes it was mrs norris the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker argus filch as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students 
 
 better get out of here harry said nick quickly filch in a good mood got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five been cleaning all morning and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place 
 
 right said harry backing away from the accusing stare of mrs norris but not quickly enough drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat argus filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to right wheezing and looking wildly about for the there was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head and his nose was unusually purple 
 
 filth he shouted his jowls aquiver his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from quidditch robes mess and muck everywhere had enough of it i tell you follow me potter 
 
 so harry waved a gloomy to nearly headless nick and followed filch back downstairs doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor harry had never been inside office before it was a place most students avoided the room was dingy and windowless lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling a faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls from their labels harry could see that they contained details of every pupil filch had ever punished fred and george weasley had an entire drawer to themselves a highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind desk it was common knowledge that he was always begging dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling 
 
 filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment 
 
 dung he muttered furiously great sizzling dragon bogies frog brains rat intestines had enough of it make an example the form yes 
 
 he retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him dipping his long black quill into the ink pot 
 
 name harry potter crime 
 
 it was only a bit of mud said harry 
 
 only a bit of mud to you boy but to me an extra hour scrubbing shouted filch a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose crime befouling the castle suggested sentence 
 
 dabbing at his streaming nose filch squinted unpleasantly at harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall 
 
 but as filch lowered his quill there was a great bang on the ceiling of the office which made the oil lamp rattle 
 
 peeves filch roared flinging down his quill in a transport of rage have you this time have you 
 
 and without a backward glance at harry filch ran from the office mrs norris streaking alongside him 
 
 peeves was the school poltergeist a grinning airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress harry much like peeves but help feeling grateful for his timing hopefully whatever peeves had done and it sounded as though wrecked something very big this time would distract filch from harry 
 
 thinking that he should probably wait for filch to come back harry sank into a chair next to the desk there was only one thing on it apart from his form a large glossy purple envelope with silver lettering on the front with a quick glance at the door to check that filch on his way back harry picked up the envelope and read 
 
 kwikspell 
 
 a correspondence course in 
 
 intrigued harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside more curly silver writing on the front page said 
 
 
 feel out of step in the world of modern magic find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork 
 
 there is an answer 
 
 kwikspell is an course hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the kwikspell method 
 
 madam z nettles of topsham writes 
 
 i had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke now after a kwikspell course i am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my scintillation solution 
 
 warlock d j prod of didsbury says 
 
 my wife used to sneer at my feeble charms but one month into your fabulous kwikspell course and i succeeded in turning her into a yak thank you kwikspell 
 
 fascinated harry thumbed through the rest of the contents why on earth did filch want a kwikspell course did this mean he a proper wizard harry was just reading lesson one holding your wand some useful tips when shuffling footsteps outside told him filch was coming back stuffing the parchment back into the envelope harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened 
 
 filch was looking triumphant 
 
 that vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully to mrs norris have peeves out this time my sweet 
 
 his eyes fell on harry and then darted to the kwikspell envelope which harry realized too late was lying two feet away from where it had started 
 
 pasty face went brick red harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury filch hobbled across to his desk snatched up the envelope and threw it into a drawer 
 
 have you did you read he sputtered 
 
 no harry lied quickly 
 
 knobbly hands were twisting together 
 
 if i thought read my private not that mine for a friend be that as it may however 
 
 harry was staring at him alarmed filch had never looked madder his eyes were popping a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks and the tartan scarf help 
 
 very well go and breathe a word not that however if you read go now i have to write up go 
 
 amazed at his luck harry sped out of the office up the corridor and back upstairs to escape from office without punishment was probably some kind of school record 
 
 harry harry did it work 
 
 nearly headless nick came gliding out of a classroom behind him harry could see the wreckage of a large cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height 
 
 i persuaded peeves to crash it right over office said nick eagerly thought it might distract him 
 
 was that you said harry gratefully yeah it worked i even get detention thanks nick 
 
 they set off up the corridor together nearly headless nick harry noticed was still holding sir rejection letter 
 
 i wish there was something i could do for you about the headless hunt harry said nearly headless nick stopped in his tracks and harry walked right through him he wished he it was like stepping through an icy shower 
 
 but there is something you could do for me said nick excitedly harry would i be asking too much but no you want 
 
 what is it said harry well this halloween will be my five hundredth deathday said nearly headless nick drawing himself up and looking dignified 
 
 oh said harry not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this right 
 
 holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons friends will be coming from all over the country it would be such an honor if you would attend mr weasley and miss granger would be most welcome too of course but i daresay rather go to the school feast he watched harry on tenterhooks 
 
 no said harry quickly come 
 
 my dear boy harry potter at my deathday party and he hesitated looking excited do you think you could possibly mention to sir patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me 
 
 of of course said harry 
 
 nearly headless nick beamed at him 
 
 a deathday party said hermione keenly when harry had changed at last and joined her and ron in the common room i bet there many living people who can say been to one of those be fascinating 
 
 why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died said ron who was halfway through his potions homework and grumpy sounds dead depressing to me 
 
 rain was still lashing the windows which were now inky black but inside all looked bright and cheerful the firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading talking doing homework or in the case of fred and george weasley trying to find out what would happen if you fed a filibuster firework to a salamander fred had rescued the brilliant orange lizard from a care of magical creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people 
 
 harry was at the point of telling ron and hermione about filch and the kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room the sight of percy bellowing himself hoarse at fred and george the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the mouth and its escape into the fire with accompanying explosions drove both filch and the kwikspell envelope from mind 
 
 by the time halloween arrived harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party the rest of the school was happily anticipating their halloween feast the great hall had been decorated with the usual live bats vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in and there were rumors that dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment 
 
 a promise is a promise hermione reminded harry bossily you said go to the deathday party 
 
 so at seven harry ron and hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed great hall which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons 
 
 the passageway leading to nearly headless party had been lined with candles too though the effect was far from cheerful these were long thin tapers all burning bright blue casting a dim ghostly light even over their own living faces the temperature dropped with every step they took as harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard 
 
 is that supposed to be music ron whispered they turned a corner and saw nearly headless nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes 
 
 my dear friends he said mournfully welcome welcome so pleased you could come 
 
 he swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside 
 
 it was an incredible sight the dungeon was full of hundreds of translucent people mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor waltzing to the dreadful quavering sound of thirty musical saws played by an orchestra on a raised platform a chandelier overhead blazed with a thousand more black candles their breath rose in a mist before them it was like stepping into a freezer 
 
 shall we have a look around harry suggested wanting to warm up his feet 
 
 careful not to walk through anyone said ron nervously and they set off around the edge of the dance floor they passed a group of gloomy nuns a ragged man wearing chains and the fat friar a cheerful hufflepuff ghost who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead harry surprised to see that the bloody baron a gaunt staring slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts 
 
 oh no said hermione stopping abruptly turn back turn back i want to talk to moaning myrtle 
 
 who said harry as they backtracked quickly 
 
 she haunts one of the toilets in the on the first floor said hermione 
 
 she haunts a toilet 
 
 yes been all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place i never went in there anyway if i could avoid it awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you 
 
 look food said ron 
 
 on the other side of the dungeon was a long table also covered in black velvet they approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks horrified the smell was quite disgusting large rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters cakes burned were heaped on salvers there was a great maggoty haggis a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and in pride of place an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone with icing forming the words 
 
 sir nicholas de 
 
 died st october 
 
 harry watched amazed as a portly ghost approached the table crouched low and walked through it his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon 
 
 can you taste it if you walk though it harry asked him 
 
 almost said the ghost sadly and he drifted away 
 
 i expect let it rot to give it a stronger flavor said hermione knowledgeably pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis 
 
 can we move i feel sick said ron 
 
 they had barely turned around however when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them 
 
 hello peeves said harry cautiously 
 
 unlike the ghosts around them peeves the poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent he was wearing a bright orange party hat a revolving bow tie and a broad grin on his wide wicked face 
 
 nibbles he said sweetly offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus 
 
 no thanks said hermione 
 
 heard you talking about poor myrtle said peeves his eyes dancing rude you was about poor myrtle he took a deep breath and bellowed oy myrtle 
 
 oh no peeves tell her what i said be really upset hermione whispered frantically i mean it i mind her er hello myrtle 
 
 the squat ghost of a girl had glided over she had the glummest face harry had ever seen behind lank hair and thick pearly spectacles 
 
 what she said sulkily 
 
 how are you myrtle said hermione in a falsely bright voice nice to see you out of the toilet 
 
 myrtle sniffed 
 
 miss granger was just talking about you said peeves slyly in ear just saying 
 
 just saying saying how nice you look tonight said hermione glaring at peeves 
 
 myrtle eyed hermione suspiciously 
 
 making fun of me she said silver tears welling rapidly in her small eyes 
 
 no honestly i just say how nice looking said hermione nudging harry and ron painfully in the ribs 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 she did 
 
 lie to me myrtle gasped tears now flooding down her face while peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder think i know what people call me behind my back fat myrtle ugly myrtle miserable moaning moping myrtle 
 
 forgotten pimply peeves hissed in her ear 
 
 moaning myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon peeves shot after her pelting her with moldy peanuts yelling pimply pimply 
 
 oh dear said hermione sadly 
 
 nearly headless nick now drifted toward them through the crowd 
 
 enjoying yourselves 
 
 oh yes they lied 
 
 not a bad turnout said nearly headless nick proudly the wailing widow came all the way up from kent nearly time for my speech better go and warn the orchestra 
 
 the orchestra however stopped playing at that very moment they and everyone else in the dungeon fell silent looking around in excitement as a hunting horn sounded 
 
 oh here we go said nearly headless nick bitterly 
 
 through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses each ridden by a headless horseman the assembly clapped wildly harry started to clap too but stopped quickly at the sight of face 
 
 the horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted rearing and plunging at the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm from which position he was blowing the horn the ghost leapt down lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd everyone laughed and strode over to nearly headless nick squashing his head back onto his neck 
 
 nick he roared how are you head still hanging in there 
 
 he gave a hearty guffaw and clapped nearly headless nick on the shoulder 
 
 welcome patrick said nick stiffly 
 
 live uns said sir patrick spotting harry ron and hermione and giving a huge fake jump of astonishment so that his head fell off again the crowd howled with laughter 
 
 very amusing said nearly headless nick darkly 
 
 mind nick shouted sir head from the floor still upset we let him join the hunt but i mean to say look at the fellow 
 
 i think said harry hurriedly at a meaningful look from nick very frightening and er 
 
 ha yelled sir head 
 
 bet he asked you to say that 
 
 if i could have attention time for my speech said nearly headless nick loudly striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight 
 
 my late lamented lords ladies and gentlemen it is my great sorrow 
 
 but nobody heard much more sir patrick and the rest of the headless hunt had just started a game of head hockey and the crowd were turning to watch nearly headless nick tried vainly to recapture his audience but gave up as sir head went sailing past him to loud cheers 
 
 harry was very cold by now not to mention hungry 
 
 i stand much more of this ron muttered his teeth chattering as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor 
 
 go harry agreed 
 
 they backed toward the door nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles 
 
 pudding might not be finished yet said ron hopefully leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall 
 
 and then harry heard it 
 
 rip tear kill 
 
 it was the same voice the same cold murderous voice he had heard in office 
 
 he stumbled to a halt clutching at the stone wall listening with all his might looking around squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway 
 
 harry you 
 
 that voice again shut up a minute 
 
 soo hungry for so long 
 
 listen said harry urgently and ron and hermione froze watching him 
 
 kill time to kill 
 
 the voice was growing fainter harry was sure it was moving away moving upward a mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling how could it be moving upward was it a phantom to whom stone ceilings matter 
 
 this way he shouted and he began to run up the stairs into the entrance hall it was no good hoping to hear anything here the babble of talk from the halloween feast was echoing out of the great hall harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor ron and hermione clattering behind him 
 
 harry we 
 
 shh 
 
 harry strained his ears distantly from the floor above and growing fainter still he heard the voice i smell blood i smell blood 
 
 his stomach lurched 
 
 going to kill someone he shouted and ignoring and bewildered faces he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor ron and hermione panting behind him not stopping until they turned a corner into the last deserted passage 
 
 harry what was that all about said ron wiping sweat off his face i hear anything 
 
 but hermione gave a sudden gasp pointing down the corridor 
 
 look 
 
 something was shining on the wall ahead they approached slowly squinting through the darkness words had been daubed on the wall between two windows shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches 
 
 the chamber of secrets has been 
 
 opened enemies of the heir beware 
 
 that thing hanging underneath said ron a slight quiver in his voice 
 
 as they edged nearer harry almost slipped there was a large puddle of water on the floor ron and hermione grabbed him and they inched toward the message eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it all three of them realized what it was at once and leapt backward with a splash 
 
 mrs norris the cat was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket she was stiff as a board her eyes wide and staring 
 
 for a few seconds they move then ron said get out of here 
 
 we try and help harry began awkwardly 
 
 trust me said ron we want to be found here 
 
 but it was too late a rumble as though of distant thunder told them that the feast had just ended from either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs and the loud happy talk of people next moment students were crashing into the passage from both ends 
 
 the chatter the bustle the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat harry ron and hermione stood alone in the middle of the corridor as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight 
 
 then someone shouted through the quiet 
 
 enemies of the heir beware be next mudbloods 
 
 it was draco malfoy he had pushed to the front of the crowd his cold eyes alive his usually bloodless face flushed as he grinned at the sight of the hanging immobile cat 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight flight of the fat ladycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 in no time at all defense against the dark arts had become most favorite class only draco malfoy and his gang of slytherins had anything bad to say about professor lupin 
 
 look at the state of his robes malfoy would say in a loud whisper as professor lupin passed he dresses like our old house elf 
 
 but no one else cared that professor robes were patched and frayed his next few lessons were just as interesting as the first after boggarts they studied red caps nasty little creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost from red caps they moved on to kappas creepy that looked like scaly monkeys with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds 
 
 harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes worst of all was potions snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days and no one was in any doubt why the story of the boggart assuming shape and the way that neville had dressed it in his clothes had traveled through the school like wildfire snape seem to find it funny his eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of professor name and he was bullying neville worse than ever 
 
 harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in professor stifling tower room deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols trying to ignore the way professor enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him he like professor trelawney even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class parvati patil and lavender brown had taken to haunting professor tower room at lunch times and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces as though they knew things the others they had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to harry as though he were on his deathbed 
 
 nobody really liked care of magical creatures which after the first class had become extremely dull hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence they were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence 
 
 why would anyone bother looking after them said ron after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms throats 
 
 at the start of october however harry had something else to occupy him something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes the quidditch season was approaching and wood captain of the gryffindor team called a meeting on thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season 
 
 there were seven people on a quidditch team three chasers whose job it was to score goals by putting the quaffle a red ball through one of the hoops at each end of the field two beaters who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the bludgers two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players a keeper who defended the goal posts and the seeker who had the hardest job of all that of catching the golden snitch a tiny winged ball whose capture ended the game and earned the team an extra one hundred and fifty points 
 
 oliver wood was a burly now in his seventh and final year at hogwarts there was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening quidditch field 
 
 this is our last chance my last chance to win the quidditch cup he told them striding up and down in front of them be leaving at the end of this year never get another shot at it 
 
 gryffindor won for seven years now okay so had the worst luck in the world injuries then the tournament getting called off last year wood swallowed as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat but we also know got the best ruddy team in the school he said punching a fist into his other hand the old manic glint back in his eye got three superb chasers 
 
 wood pointed at alicia spinner angelina johnson and katie bell 
 
 got two unbeatable beaters 
 
 stop it oliver embarrassing us said fred and george weasley together pretending to blush 
 
 and got a seeker who has never failed to win us a match wood rumbled glaring at harry with a kind of furious pride and me he added as an afterthought 
 
 we think very good too oliver said george 
 
 spanking good keeper said fred 
 
 the point is wood went on resuming his pacing the quidditch cup should have had our name on it these last two years ever since harry joined the team thought the thing was in the bag but we got it and this the last chance get to finally see our name on the thing 
 
 wood spoke so dejectedly that even fred and george looked sympathetic 
 
 oliver this our year said fred 
 
 do it oliver said angelina 
 
 definitely said harry 
 
 full of determination the team started training sessions three evenings a week the weather was getting colder and wetter the nights darker but no amount of mud wind or rain could tarnish wonderful vision of finally winning the huge silver quidditch cup 
 
 harry returned to the gryffindor common room one evening after training cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone to find the room buzzing excitedly 
 
 happened he asked ron and hermione who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for astronomy 
 
 first hogsmeade weekend said ron pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board end of october halloween 
 
 excellent said fred who had followed harry through the portrait hole i need to visit nearly out of stink pellets 
 
 harry threw himself into a chair beside ron his high spirits ebbing away hermione seemed to read his mind 
 
 harry sure be able to go next time she said bound to catch black soon been sighted once already 
 
 not fool enough to try anything in hogsmeade said ron ask mcgonagall if you can go this time harry the next one might not be for ages 
 
 ron said hermione supposed to stay in school 
 
 he be the only third year left behind said ron ask mcgonagall go on harry 
 
 yeah i think i will said harry making up his mind 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to argue but at that moment crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap a large dead spider was dangling from his mouth 
 
 does he have to eat that in front of us said ron scowling 
 
 clever crookshanks did you catch that all by yourself said hermione 
 
 crookshanks slowly chewed up the spider his yellow eyes fixed insolently on ron 
 
 just keep him over there all said ron irritably turning back to his star chart got scabbers asleep in my bag 
 
 harry yawned he really wanted to go to bed but he still had his own star chart to complete he pulled his bag toward him took out parchment ink and quill and started work 
 
 you can copy mine if you like said ron labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward harry 
 
 hermione who disapproved of copying pursed her lips but say anything crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at ron flicking the end of his bushy tail then without warning he pounced 
 
 oy ron roared seizing his bag as crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously get off you stupid animal 
 
 ron tried to pull the bag away from crookshanks but crookshanks clung on spitting and slashing 
 
 ron hurt him squealed hermione the whole common room was watching ron whirled the bag around crookshanks still clinging to it and scabbers came flying out of the top 
 
 catch that cat ron yelled as crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag sprang over the table and chased after the terrified scabbers 
 
 george weasley made a lunge for crookshanks but missed scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers crookshanks skidded to a halt crouched low on his bandy legs and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw 
 
 ron and hermione hurried over hermione grabbed crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away ron threw himself onto his stomach and with great difficulty pulled scabbers out by the tail 
 
 look at him he said furiously to hermione dangling scabbers in front of her skin and bone you keep that cat away from him 
 
 crookshanks understand wrong said hermione her voice shaking all cats chase rats ron 
 
 something funny about that animal said ron who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling scabbers back into his pocket it heard me say that scabbers was in my bag 
 
 oh what rubbish said hermione impatiently crookshanks could smell him ron how else think 
 
 that got it in for scabbers said ron ignoring the people around him who were starting to giggle and scabbers was here first and ill 
 
 ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys dormitories 
 
 
 
 ron was still in a bad mood with hermione next day he barely talked to her all through herbology even though he harry and hermione were working together on the same puffapod 
 
 scabbers hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail 
 
 hiding at the bottom of my bed shaking said ron angrily missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor 
 
 careful weasley careful cried professor sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes 
 
 they had transfiguration next harry who had resolved to ask professor mcgonagall after the lesson whether he could go into hogsmeade with the rest joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case he was distracted however by a disturbance at the front of the line 
 
 lavender brown seemed to be crying parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were looking very serious 
 
 the matter lavender said hermione anxiously as she harry and ron went to join the group 
 
 she got a letter from home this morning parvati whispered her rabbit binky been killed by a fox 
 
 oh said hermione sorry lavender 
 
 i should have known said lavender tragically you know what day it is 
 
 er 
 
 the sixteenth of october that thing dreading it will happen on the sixteenth of october remember she was right she was right 
 
 the whole class was gathered around lavender now seamus shook his head seriously hermione hesitated then she said you you were dreading binky being killed by a fox 
 
 well not necessarily by a fox said lavender looking up at hermione with streaming eyes but i was obviously dreading him dying i 
 
 oh said hermione she paused again then 
 
 was binky an old rabbit 
 
 n no sobbed lavender h he was only a baby 
 
 parvati tightened her arm around shoulders 
 
 but then why would you dread him dying said hermione 
 
 parvati glared at her 
 
 well look at it logically said hermione turning to the rest of the group i mean binky even die today did he lavender just got the news today lavender wailed loudly c and she have been dreading it because come as a real shock 
 
 mind hermione lavender said ron loudly she think other pets matter very much 
 
 professor mcgonagall opened the classroom door at that moment which was perhaps lucky hermione and ron were looking daggers at each other and when they got into class they seated themselves on either side of harry and talk to each other for the whole class 
 
 harry still decided what he was going to say to professor mcgonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson but it was she who brought up the subject of hogsmeade first 
 
 one moment please she called as the class made to leave as all in my house you should hand hogsmeade permission forms to me before halloween no form no visiting the village so forget 
 
 neville put up his hand 
 
 please professor i i think lost 
 
 your grandmother sent yours to me directly longbottom said professor mcgonagall she seemed to think it was safer well all you may leave 
 
 ask her now ron hissed at harry 
 
 oh but hermione began 
 
 go for it harry said ron stubbornly 
 
 harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear then headed nervously for professor desk 
 
 yes potter harry took a deep breath 
 
 professor my aunt and uncle er forgot to sign my form he said 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but say anything 
 
 so er think it would be all right mean will it be okay if i if i go to hogsmeade 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk 
 
 afraid not potter she said you heard what i said no form no visiting the village the rule 
 
 but professor my aunt and uncle you know muggles they really understand about about hogwarts forms and stuff harry said while ron egged him on with vigorous nods if you said i could go 
 
 but i say so said professor mcgonagall standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer the form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission she turned to look at him with an odd expression on her face was it pity sorry potter but my final word you had better hurry or be late for your next lesson 
 
 
 
 there was nothing to be done ron called professor mcgonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed hermione hermione assumed an expression that made ron even angrier and harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first once they got into hogsmeade 
 
 always the feast said ron in an effort to cheer harry up you know the halloween feast in the evening 
 
 yeah said harry gloomily great 
 
 the halloween feast was always good but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in hogsmeade with everyone else nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind dean thomas who was good with a quill had offered to forge uncle signature on the form but as harry had already told professor mcgonagall he had it signed that was no good ron halfheartedly suggested the invisibility cloak but hermione stamped on that one reminding ron what dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort 
 
 they make a fuss about hogsmeade but i assure you harry not all cracked up to be he said seriously all right the rather good and joke frankly dangerous and yes the shrieking always worth a visit but really harry apart from that not missing anything 
 
 
 
 on halloween morning harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast feeling thoroughly depressed though doing his best to act normally 
 
 bring you lots of sweets back from honeydukes said hermione looking desperately sorry for him 
 
 yeah loads said ron he and hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about crookshanks in the face of difficulties 
 
 worry about me said harry in what he hoped was at offhand voice see you at the feast have a good time 
 
 he accompanied them to the entrance hall where filch the caretaker was standing inside the front doors checking off names against a long list peering suspiciously into every face and making sure that no one was sneaking out who be going 
 
 staying here potter shouted malfoy who was standing in line with crabbe and goyle scared of passing the dementors 
 
 harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase through the deserted corridors and back to gryffindor tower 
 
 password said the fat lady jerking out of a doze 
 
 fortuna major said harry listlessly 
 
 the portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room it was full of chattering and a few older students who had obviously visited hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off 
 
 harry harry hi harry 
 
 it was colin creevey a second year who was deeply in awe of harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to him 
 
 you going to hogsmeade harry why not hey colin looked eagerly around at his friends you can come and sit with us if you like harry 
 
 er no thanks colin said harry who in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead i got to go to the library got to get some work done 
 
 after that he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again 
 
 what was the point of waking me up the fat lady called grumpily after him as he walked away 
 
 harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library but halfway there he changed his mind he feel like working he turned around and came with filch who had obviously just seen off the last of the hogsmeade visitors 
 
 what are you doing filch snarled suspiciously 
 
 nothing said harry truthfully 
 
 nothing spat filch his jowls quivering unpleasantly a likely story sneaking around on your own why you in hogsmeade buying stink pellets and belch powder and whizzing worms like the rest of your nasty little friends 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 well get back to your common room where you belong snapped filch and he stood glaring until harry had passed out of sight 
 
 but harry go back to the common room he climbed a staircase thinking vaguely of visiting the owlery to see hedwig and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said harry 
 
 harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met professor lupin looking around his office door 
 
 what are you doing said lupin though in a very different voice from filch where are ron and hermione 
 
 hogsmeade said harry in a casual voice 
 
 ah said lupin he considered harry for a moment why you come in just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson 
 
 a what said harry 
 
 he followed lupin into his office in the corner stood a very large tank of water a sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass pulling faces and flexing its long spindly fingers 
 
 water demon said lupin surveying the grindylow thoughtfully we have much difficulty with him not after the kappas the trick is to break his grip you notice the abnormally long fingers strong but very brittle 
 
 the grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner 
 
 cup of tea lupin said looking around for his kettle i was just thinking of making one 
 
 all right said harry awkwardly 
 
 lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout 
 
 sit down said lupin taking the lid off a dusty tin only got teabags afraid but i daresay had enough of tea leaves 
 
 harry looked at him eyes were twinkling 
 
 how did you know about that harry asked 
 
 professor mcgonagall told me said lupin passing harry a chipped mug of tea not worried are you 
 
 no said harry 
 
 he thought for a moment of telling lupin about the dog seen in magnolia crescent but decided not to he want lupin to think he was a coward especially since lupin already seemed to think he cope with a boggart 
 
 something of thoughts seemed to have shown on his face because lupin said anything worrying you harry 
 
 no harry lied he drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him yes he said suddenly putting his tea down on desk you know that day we fought the boggart 
 
 yes said lupin slowly 
 
 why you let me fight it said harry abruptly 
 
 lupin raised his eyebrows 
 
 i would have thought that was obvious harry he said sounding surprised 
 
 harry who had expected lupin to deny that done any such thing was taken aback 
 
 why he said again 
 
 well said lupin frowning slightly i assumed that if the boggart faced you it would assume the shape of lord voldemort 
 
 harry stared not only was this the last answer expected but lupin had said name the only person harry had ever heard say the name aloud apart from himself was professor dumbledore 
 
 clearly i was wrong said lupin still frowning at harry but i think it a good idea for lord voldemort to materialize in the staffroom i imagined that people would panic 
 
 i think of voldemort said harry honestly i i remembered those dementors 
 
 i see said lupin thoughtfully well impressed he smiled slightly at the look of surprise on face that suggests that what you fear most of all is fear very wise harry 
 
 harry know what to say to that so he drank some more tea 
 
 so been thinking that i believe you capable of fighting the boggart said lupin shrewdly 
 
 wellyeah said harry he was suddenly feeling a lot happier professor lupin you know the dementors 
 
 he was interrupted by a knock on the door 
 
 come in called lupin 
 
 the door opened and in came snape he was carrying a goblet which was smoking faintly and stopped at the sight of harry his black eyes narrowing 
 
 ah severus said lupin smiling thanks very much could you leave it here on the desk for me 
 
 snape set down the smoking goblet his eyes wandering between harry and lupin 
 
 i was just showing harry my grindylow said lupin pleasantly pointing at the tank 
 
 fascinating said snape without looking at it you should drink that directly lupin 
 
 yes yes i will said lupin 
 
 i made an entire cauldronful snape continued if you need more 
 
 i should probably have some again tomorrow thanks very much severus 
 
 not at all said snape but there was a look in his eye harry like he backed out of the room unsmiling and watchful 
 
 harry looked curiously at the goblet lupin smiled 
 
 professor snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me he said i have never been much of a and this one is particularly complex he picked up the goblet and sniffed it pity sugar makes it useless he added taking a sip and shuddering 
 
 why harry began lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question 
 
 been feeling a bit he said this potion is the only thing that helps i am very lucky to be working alongside professor snape there many wizards who are up to making it 
 
 professor lupin took another sip and harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands 
 
 professor very interested in the dark arts he blurted out 
 
 really said lupin looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion 
 
 some people reckon harry hesitated then plunged recklessly on some people reckon do anything to get the defense against the dark arts job 
 
 lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face 
 
 disgusting he said well harry better get back to work see you at the feast later 
 
 right said harry putting down his empty teacup 
 
 the empty goblet was still smoking 
 
 
 
 there you go said ron we got as much as we could carry 
 
 a shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into lap it was dusk and ron and hermione had just turned up in the common room from the cold wind and looking as though had the time of their lives 
 
 thanks said harry picking up a packet of tiny black pepper imps hogsmeade like where did you go 
 
 by the sound of it everywhere dervish and banges the wizarding equipment shop joke shop into the three broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer and many places besides 
 
 the post office harry about two hundred owls all sitting on shelves all depending on how fast you want your letter to get there 
 
 honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge they were giving out free samples a bit look 
 
 we think we saw an ogre honestly they get all sorts at the three broomsticks 
 
 wish we could have brought you some butterbeer really warms you up 
 
 what did you do said hermione looking anxious did you get any work done 
 
 no said harry lupin made me a cup of tea in his office and then snape came in 
 
 he told them all about the goblet mouth fell open 
 
 lupin drank it he gasped is he mad 
 
 hermione checked her watch 
 
 better go down you know the be starting in five minutes they hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd still discussing snape 
 
 but if he you know hermione dropped her voice glancing nervously around if he was trying to to poison lupin he have done it in front of harry 
 
 yeah maybe said harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the great hall it had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of pumpkins a cloud of fluttering live bats and many flaming orange streamers which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes 
 
 the food was delicious even hermione and ron who were full to bursting with honeydukes sweets managed second helpings of everything harry kept glancing at the staff table professor lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did he was talking animatedly to tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher harry moved his eyes along the table to the place where snape sat was he imagining it or were eyes flickering toward lupin more often than was natural 
 
 the feast finished with an entertainment provided by the hogwarts ghosts they popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading 
 
 it had been such a pleasant evening that good mood even be spoiled by malfoy who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall the dementors send their love potter 
 
 harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the gryffindors along the usual path to gryffindor tower but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the fat lady they found it jammed with students 
 
 why anyone going in said ron curiously 
 
 harry peered over the heads in front of him the portrait seemed to be closed 
 
 let me through please came voice and he came bustling importantly through the crowd the holdup here you all have forgotten the password excuse me head boy 
 
 and then a silence fell over the crowd from the front first so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor they heard percy say in a suddenly sharp voice somebody get professor dumbledore quick 
 
 heads turned those at the back were standing on tiptoe 
 
 going on said ginny who had just arrived 
 
 a moment later professor dumbledore was there sweeping toward the portrait the gryffindors squeezed together to let him through and harry ron and hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was 
 
 oh my hermione grabbed arm 
 
 the fat lady had vanished from her portrait which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor great chunks of it had been torn away completely dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned his eyes somber to see professors mcgonagall lupin and snape hurrying toward him 
 
 we need to find her said dumbledore professor mcgonagall please go to mr filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the fat lady 
 
 be lucky said a cackling voice 
 
 it was peeves the poltergeist bobbing over the crowd and looking delighted as he always did at the sight of wreckage or worry 
 
 what do you mean peeves said dumbledore calmly and grin faded a little he dare taunt dumbledore instead he adopted an oily voice that was no better than his cackle ashamed your headship sir want to be seen a horrible mess saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor sir dodging between the trees crying something dreadful he said happily poor thing he added unconvincingly 
 
 did she say who did it said dumbledore quietly 
 
 oh yes professorhead said peeves with the air of one cradling a large bombshell in his arms he got very angry when she let him in you see peeves flipped over and grinned at dumbledore from between his own legs nasty temper got that sirius black 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight the quidditch world cupcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 clutching their purchases mr weasley in the lead they all hurried into the wood following the trail they could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them shouts and laughter snatches of singing the atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious harry stop grinning they walked through the wood for twenty minutes talking and joking loudly until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium though harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it 
 
 seats a hundred thousand said mr weasley spotting the awestruck look on face ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year muggle repelling charms on every inch of it every time muggles have got anywhere near here all year suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away againbless them he added fondly leading the way toward the nearest entrance which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards 
 
 prime seats said the ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets top box straight upstairs arthur and as high as you can go 
 
 the stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple they clambered upward with the rest of the crowd which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right mr party kept climbing and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts about twenty chairs stood in two rows here and harry filing into the front seats with the weasleys looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined 
 
 a hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats which rose in levels around the long oval field everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light which seemed to come from the stadium itself the field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position at either end of the field stood three goal hoops fifty feet high right opposite them almost at eye level was a gigantic blackboard gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again watching it harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field 
 
 the bluebottle a broom for all the family safe reliable and with buzzermrs all purpose magical mess remover no pain no wizardwear london paris hogsmeade 
 harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them so far it was empty except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them the creature whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga and it had its face hidden in its hands yet those long batlike ears were oddly familiar 
 
 dobby said harry incredulously 
 
 the tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato it dobby it was however unmistakably a as friend dobby had been harry had set dobby free from his old owners the malfoy family 
 
 did sir just call me dobby squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers its voice was higher even than had been a teeny quivering squeak of a voice and harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a that this one might just be female ron and hermione spun around in their seats to look though they had heard a lot about dobby from harry they had never actually met him even mr weasley looked around in interest 
 
 sorry harry told the elf i just thought you were someone i knew 
 
 but i knows dobby too sir squeaked the elf she was shielding her face as though blinded by light though the top box was not brightly lit my name is winky sir and you sir her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon scar you is surely harry potter 
 
 yeah i am said harry 
 
 but dobby talks of you all the time sir she said lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck 
 
 how is he said harry freedom suiting him 
 
 ah sir said winky shaking her head ah sir meaning no disrespect sir but i is not sure you did dobby a favor sir when you is setting him free 
 
 why said harry taken aback wrong with him 
 
 freedom is going to head sir said winky sadly ideas above his station sir get another position sir 
 
 why not said harry 
 
 winky lowered her voice by a and whispered he is wanting paying for his work sir 
 
 paying said harry blankly well why he be paid 
 
 winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was again 
 
 is not paid sir she said in a muffled squeak no no no i says to dobby i says go find yourself a nice family and settle down dobby he is getting up to all sorts of high jinks sir what is unbecoming to a you goes racketing around like this dobby i says and next thing i hear up in front of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures like some common goblin 
 
 well about time he had a bit of fun said harry 
 
 is not supposed to have fun harry potter said winky firmly from behind her hands does what they is told i is not liking heights at all harry potter she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped but my master sends me to the top box and i comes sir 
 
 he sent you up here if he knows you like heights said harry frowning 
 
 master master wants me to save him a seat harry potter he is very busy said winky tilting her head toward the empty space beside her winky is wishing she is back in tent harry potter but winky does what she is told winky is a good 
 
 she gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again harry turned back to the others 
 
 so a ron muttered weird things they 
 
 dobby was weirder said harry fervently 
 
 ron pulled out his omnioculars and started testing them staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium 
 
 wild he said twiddling the replay knob on the side i can make that old bloke down there pick his nose againand againand again 
 
 hermione meanwhile was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered tasseled program 
 
 a display from the team mascots will precede the match she read aloud 
 
 oh always worth watching said mr weasley national teams bring creatures from their native land you know to put on a bit of a show 
 
 the box filled gradually around them over the next half hour mr weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog when cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself arrived percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered highly embarrassed he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat throwing jealous looks at harry whom cornelius fudge had greeted like an old friend they had met before and fudge shook hand in a fatherly fashion asked how he was and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him 
 
 harry potter you know he told the bulgarian minister loudly who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and seem to understand a word of english harry potteroh come on now you know who he isthe boy who survived do know who he is 
 
 the bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly pointing at it 
 
 knew get there in the end said fudge wearily to harry no great shakes at languages i need barty crouch for this sort of thing ah i see his saving him a job too these bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best placesah and lucius 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned quickly edging along the second row to three seats right behind mr weasley were none other than dobby the former owners lucius malfoy his son draco and a woman harry supposed must be mother 
 
 harry and draco malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to hogwarts a pale boy with a pointed face and hair draco greatly resembled his father his mother was blonde too tall and slim she would have been if she been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose 
 
 ah fudge said mr malfoy holding out his hand as he reached the minister of magic how are you i think met my wife narcissa or our son draco 
 
 how do you do how do you do said fudge smiling and bowing to mrs malfoy and allow me to introduce you to mr oblansk obalonsk mr well the bulgarian minister of magic and he understand a word saying anyway so never mind and see who else you know arthur weasley i daresay 
 
 it was a tense moment mr weasley and mr malfoy looked at each other and harry vividly recalled the last time they had come it had been in flourish and blotts bookshop and they had had a fight mr cold gray eyes swept over mr weasley and then up and down the row 
 
 good lord arthur he said softly what did you have to sell to get seats in the top box surely your house have fetched this much 
 
 fudge who listening said lucius has just given a very generous contribution to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries arthur here as my guest 
 
 how how nice said mr weasley with a very strained smile 
 
 mr eyes had returned to hermione who went slightly pink but stared determinedly back at him harry knew exactly what was making mr lip curl like that the malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods in other words they considered anyone of muggle descent like hermione however under the gaze of the minister of magic mr malfoy dare say anything he nodded sneeringly to mr weasley and continued down the line to his seats draco shot harry ron and hermione one contemptuous look then settled himself between his mother and father 
 
 slimy gits ron muttered as he harry and hermione turned to face the field again next moment ludo bagman charged into the box 
 
 everyone ready he said his round face gleaming like a great excited edam minister ready to go 
 
 ready when you are ludo said fudge comfortably 
 
 ludo whipped out his wand directed it at his own throat and said sonorus and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium his voice echoed over them booming into every corner of the stands 
 
 ladies and gentlemenwelcome welcome to the final of the four hundred and quidditch world cup 
 
 the spectators screamed and clapped thousands of flags waved adding their discordant national anthems to the racket the huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message bertie every flavor beans a risk with every mouthful and now showed bulgaria ireland 
 
 and now without further ado allow me to introducethe bulgarian national team mascots 
 
 the side of the stands which was a solid block of scarlet roared its approval 
 
 i wonder what brought said mr weasley leaning forward in his seat aaah he suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes veela 
 
 what are veel 
 
 but a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field and question was answered for him veela were womenthe most beautiful women harry had ever seenexcept that they they be human this puzzled harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be what could make their skin shine like that or their hair fan out behind them without windbut then the music started and harry stopped worrying about them not being human in fact he stopped worrying about anything at all 
 
 the veela had started to dance and mind had gone completely and blissfully blank all that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela because if they stopped dancing terrible things would happen 
 
 and as the veela danced faster and faster wild thoughts started chasing through dazed mind he wanted to do something very impressive right now jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good ideabut would it be good enough 
 
 harry what are you doing said voice from a long way off 
 
 the music stopped harry blinked he was standing up and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box next to him ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard 
 
 angry yells were filling the stadium the crowd want the veela to go harry was with them he would of course be supporting bulgaria and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest ron meanwhile was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat mr weasley smiling slightly leaned over to ron and tugged the hat out of his hands 
 
 be wanting that he said once ireland have had their say 
 
 huh said ron staring openmouthed at the veela who had now lined up along one side of the field 
 
 hermione made a loud tutting noise she reached up and pulled harry back into his seat honestly she said 
 
 and now roared ludo voice kindly put your wands in the airfor the irish national team mascots 
 
 next moment what seemed to be a great comet came zooming into the stadium it did one circuit of the stadium then split into two smaller comets each hurtling toward the goal posts a rainbow arced suddenly across the field connecting the two balls of light the crowd oooohed and aaaaahed as though at a fireworks display now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged they had formed a great shimmering shamrock which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it 
 
 excellent yelled ron as the shamrock soared over them and heavy gold coins rained from it bouncing off their heads and seats squinting up at the shamrock harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green 
 
 leprechauns said mr weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold 
 
 there you go ron yelled happily stuffing a fistful of gold coins into hand for the omnioculars now got to buy me a christmas present ha 
 
 the great shamrock dissolved the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela and settled themselves to watch the match 
 
 and now ladies and gentlemen kindly welcome the bulgarian national quidditch team i give you dimitrov 
 
 a figure on a broomstick moving so fast it was blurred shot out onto the field from an entrance far below to wild applause from the bulgarian supporters 
 
 ivanova 
 
 a second player zoomed out 
 
 zograf levski vulchanov volkov aaaaaaand krum 
 
 him him yelled ron following krum with his omnioculars harry quickly focused his own 
 
 viktor krum was thin dark and with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows he looked like an overgrown bird of prey it was hard to believe he was only eighteen 
 
 and now please greet the irish national quidditch team yelled bagman presenting connolly ryan troy mullet moran quigley aaaaaand lynch 
 
 seven green blurs swept onto the field harry spun a small dial on the side of his omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word firebolt on each of their brooms and see their names embroidered in silver upon their backs 
 
 and here all the way from egypt our referee acclaimed chairwizard of the international association of quidditch hassan mostafa 
 
 a small and skinny wizard completely bald but with a mustache to rival uncle wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium strode out onto the field a silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm his broomstick under the other harry spun the speed dial on his omnioculars back to normal watching closely as mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open four balls burst into the air the scarlet quaffle the two black bludgers and harry saw it for the briefest moment before it sped out of sight the minuscule winged golden snitch with a sharp blast on his whistle mostafa shot into the air after the balls 
 
 off screamed bagman and mullet troy moran dimitrov back to mullet troy levski moran 
 
 it was quidditch as harry had never seen it played before he was pressing his omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose the speed of the players was incredible the chasers were throwing the quaffle to one another so fast that bagman only had time to say their names harry spun the slow dial on the right of his omnioculars again pressed the button on the top and he was immediately watching in slow motion while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums 
 
 hawkshead attacking formation he read as he watched the three irish chasers zoom closely together troy in the center slightly ahead of mullet and moran bearing down upon the bulgarians porskoff ploy flashed up next as troy made as though to dart upward with the quaffle drawing away the bulgarian chaser ivanova and dropping the quaffle to moran one of the bulgarian beaters volkov swung hard at a passing bludger with his small club knocking it into path moran ducked to avoid the bludger and dropped the quaffle and levski soaring beneath caught it troy scores roared bagman and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers ten zero to ireland 
 
 what harry yelled looking wildly around through his omnioculars but got the quaffle 
 
 harry if not going to watch at normal speed going to miss things shouted hermione who was dancing up and down waving her arms in the air while troy did a lap of honor around the field harry looked quickly over the top of his omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great glittering shamrock across the field the veela were watching them sulkily 
 
 furious with himself harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed 
 
 harry knew enough about quidditch to see that the irish chasers were superb they worked as a seamless team their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one minds as they positioned themselves and the rosette on chest kept squeaking their names troy mullet moran and within ten minutes ireland had scored twice more bringing their lead to and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the supporters 
 
 the match became still faster but more brutal volkov and vulchanov the bulgarian beaters were whacking the bludgers as fiercely as possible at the irish chasers and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves twice they were forced to scatter and then finally ivanova managed to break through their ranks dodge the keeper ryan and score first goal 
 
 fingers in your ears bellowed mr weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration harry screwed up his eyes too he wanted to keep his mind on the game after a few seconds he chanced a glance at the field the veela had stopped dancing and bulgaria was again in possession of the quaffle 
 
 dimitrov levski dimitrov ivanova oh i say roared bagman 
 
 one hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two seekers krum and lynch plummeted through the center of the chasers so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes harry followed their descent through his omnioculars squinting to see where the snitch was 
 
 going to crash screamed hermione next to harry 
 
 she was half right at the very last second viktor krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off lynch however hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium a huge groan rose from the irish seats 
 
 fool moaned mr weasley krum was feinting 
 
 yelled voice as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine aidan lynch 
 
 be okay he only got ploughed charlie said reassuringly to ginny who was hanging over the side of the box looking which is what krum was after of course 
 
 harry hastily pressed the replay and buttons on his omnioculars twiddled the speed dial and put them back up to his eyes 
 
 he watched as krum and lynch dived again in slow motion wronski defensive feint dangerous seeker diversion read the shining purple lettering across his lenses he saw face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time while lynch was flattened and he understood krum seen the snitch at all he was just making lynch copy him harry had never seen anyone fly like that krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless harry turned his omnioculars back to normal and focused them on krum he was now circling high above lynch who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion harry focusing still more closely upon face saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below he was using the time while lynch was revived to look for the snitch without interference 
 
 lynch got to his feet at last to loud cheers from the supporters mounted his firebolt and kicked back off into the air his revival seemed to give ireland new heart when mostafa blew his whistle again the chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything harry had seen so far 
 
 after fifteen more fast and furious minutes ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals they were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten and the game was starting to get dirtier 
 
 as mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again clutching the quaffle tightly under her arm the bulgarian keeper zograf flew out to meet her whatever happened was over so quickly harry catch it but a scream of rage from the irish crowd and long shrill whistle blast told him it had been a foul 
 
 and mostafa takes the bulgarian keeper to task for cobbing excessive use of elbows bagman informed the roaring spectators and yes a penalty to ireland 
 
 the leprechauns who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when mullet had been fouled now darted together to form the words ha ha ha 
 
 the veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet tossed their hair angrily and started to dance again 
 
 as one the weasley boys and harry stuffed their fingers into their ears but hermione who bothered was soon tugging on arm he turned to look at her and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears 
 
 look at the referee she said giggling 
 
 harry looked down at the field hassan mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela and was acting very oddly indeed he was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly 
 
 now we have that said ludo bagman though he sounded highly amused somebody slap the referee 
 
 a mediwizard came tearing across the field his fingers stuffed into his own ears and kicked mostafa hard in the shins mostafa seemed to come to himself harry watching through the omnioculars again saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous 
 
 and unless much mistaken mostafa is actually attempting to send off the bulgarian team mascots said voice now something we seen beforeoh this could turn nasty 
 
 it did the bulgarian beaters volkov and vulchanov landed on either side of mostafa and began arguing furiously with him gesticulating toward the leprechauns who had now gleefully formed the words hee hee hee mostafa was not impressed by the bulgarians arguments however he was jabbing his finger into the air clearly telling them to get flying again and when they refused he gave two short blasts on his whistle 
 
 two penalties for ireland shouted bagman and the bulgarian crowd howled with anger and volkov and vulchanov had better get back on those broomsyesthere they goand troy takes the quaffle 
 
 play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen the beaters on both sides were acting without mercy volkov and vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air dimitrov shot straight at moran who had the quaffle nearly knocking her off her broom 
 
 foul roared the irish supporters as one all standing up in a great wave of green 
 
 foul echoed ludo magically magnified voice dimitrov skins moran deliberately flying to collide there and got to be another penalty yes the whistle 
 
 the leprechauns had risen into the air again and this time they formed a giant hand which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field at this the veela lost control instead of dancing they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns watching through his omnioculars harry saw that they look remotely beautiful now on the contrary their faces were elongating into sharp bird heads and long scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders 
 
 and that boys yelled mr weasley over the tumult of the crowd below is why you should never go for looks alone 
 
 ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns but with little success meanwhile the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above harry turned this way and that staring through his omnioculars as the quaffie changed hands with the speed of a bullet 
 
 levski dimitrov moran troy mullet ivanova moran again moran moran scores 
 
 but the cheers of the irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela the blasts now issuing from the ministry members wands and the furious roars of the bulgarians the game recommenced immediately now levski had the quaffle now dimitrov 
 
 the irish beater quigley swung heavily at a passing bludger and hit it as hard as possible toward krum who did not duck quickly enough it hit him full in the face 
 
 there was a deafening groan from the crowd nose looked broken there was blood everywhere but hassan mostafa blow his whistle he had become distracted and harry blame him one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight 
 
 harry wanted someone to realize that krum was injured even though he was supporting ireland krum was the most exciting player on the field ron obviously felt the same 
 
 ah come on he play like that look at him 
 
 look at lynch harry yelled 
 
 for the irish seeker had suddenly gone into a dive and harry was quite sure that this was no wronski feint this was the real thing 
 
 seen the snitch harry shouted seen it look at him go 
 
 half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening the irish supporters rose in another great wave of green screaming their seeker onbut krum was on his tail how he could see where he was going harry had no idea there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him but he was drawing level with lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again 
 
 going to crash shrieked hermione 
 
 not roared ron 
 
 lynch is yelled harry 
 
 and he was right for the second time lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela 
 
 the snitch the snitch bellowed charlie along the row 
 
 got it got it all over shouted harry 
 
 krum his red robes shining with blood from his nose was rising gently into the air his fist held high a glint of gold in his hand 
 
 the scoreboard was flashing bulgaria ireland across the crowd who seem to have realized what had happened then slowly as though a great jumbo jet were revving up the rumbling from the ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight 
 
 ireland wins bagman shouted who like the irish seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match 
 
 krum gets the snitch but ireland wins good lord i think any of us were expecting that 
 
 what did he catch the snitch for ron bellowed even as he jumped up and down applauding with his hands over his head he ended it when ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead the idiot 
 
 he knew they were never going to catch up harry shouted back over all the noise also applauding loudly the irish chasers were too goodhe wanted to end it on his terms all 
 
 he was very brave he hermione said leaning forward to watch krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him he looks a terrible mess 
 
 harry put his omnioculars to his eyes again it was hard to see what was happening below because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field but he could just make out krum surrounded by mediwizards he looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up his team members were around him shaking their heads and looking dejected a short way away the irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots flags were waving all over the stadium the irish national anthem blared from all sides the veela were shrinking back into their usual beautiful selves now though looking dispirited and forlorn 
 
 vell ve fought bravely said a gloomy voice behind harry he looked around it was the bulgarian minister of magic 
 
 you can speak english said fudge sounding outraged and been letting me mime everything all day 
 
 veil it vos very funny said the bulgarian minister shrugging 
 
 and as the irish team performs a lap of honor flanked by their mascots the quidditch world cup itself is brought into the top box roared bagman 
 
 eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light as the top box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside squinting toward the entrance he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box which they handed to cornelius fudge who was still looking very disgruntled that been using sign language all day for nothing 
 
 have a really loud hand for the gallant losers bulgaria bagman shouted 
 
 and up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated bulgarian players the crowd below was applauding appreciatively harry could see thousands and thousands of omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction 
 
 one by one the bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box and bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with fudge krum who was last in line looked a real mess two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face he was still holding the snitch harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground he was slightly and distinctly but when name was announced the whole stadium gave him a resounding earsplitting roar 
 
 and then came the irish team aidan lynch was being supported by moran and connolly the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused but he grinned happily as troy and quigley lifted the cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval hands were numb with clapping 
 
 at last when the irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms aidan lynch on the back of clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered quietus 
 
 be talking about this one for years he said hoarsely a really unexpected twist it have lasted yesyes i owe much 
 
 for fred and george had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of ludo bagman with broad grins on their faces their hands outstretched 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight the hearingcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry gasped he could not help himself the large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar he had not only seen it before he had been here before this was the place he had visited inside pensieve the place where he had watched the lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in azkaban 
 
 the walls were made of dark stone dimly lit by torches empty benches rose on either side of him but ahead in the highest benches of all were many shadowy figures they had been talking in low voices but as the heavy door swung closed behind harry an ominous silence fell 
 
 a cold male voice rang across the courtroom 
 
 late 
 
 sorry said harry nervously ii know the time had been changed 
 
 that is not the fault said the voice an owl was sent to you this morning take your seat 
 
 harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the centre of the room the arms of which were covered in chains he had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them his footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor when he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked threateningly but did not bind him feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the bench above 
 
 there were about fifty of them all as far as he could see wearing robes with an elaborately worked silver w on the side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him some with very austere expressions others looks of frank curiosity 
 
 in the very middle of the front row sat cornelius fudge the minister for magic fudge was a portly man who often sported a bowler hat though today he had dispensed with it he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to harry a broad witch with very short grey hair sat on fudges left she wore a monocle and looked forbidding on fudges right was another witch but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow 
 
 very well said fudge the accused being presentfinallylet us begin are you ready he called down the row 
 
 yes sir said an eager voice harry knew brother percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench harry looked at percy expecting some sign of recognition from him but none came eyes behind his glasses were fixed on his parchment a quill poised in his hand 
 
 disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of august said fudge in a ringing voice and percy began taking notes at once into offences committed under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and the international statute of secrecy by harry james potter resident at number four privet drive little whinging surrey 
 
 interrogators cornelius oswald fudge minister for magic amelia susan bones head of the department of magical law enforcement dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister court scribe percy ignatius weasley 
 
 witness for the defence albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore said a quiet voice from behind harry who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck 
 
 dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long robes and a perfectly calm expression his long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with harry and looked up at fudge through the spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose 
 
 the members of the wizengamot were muttering all eyes were now on dumbledore some looked annoyed others slightly frightened two elderly witches in the back row however raised their hands and waved in welcome 
 
 a powerful emotion had risen in chest at the sight of dumbledore a fortified hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him he wanted to catch eye but dumbledore was not looking his way he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered fudge 
 
 ah said fudge who looked thoroughly disconcerted dumbledore yes youergot ourer message that the time anderplace of the hearing had been changed then 
 
 i must have missed it said dumbledore cheerfully however due to a lucky mistake i arrived at the ministry three hours early so no harm done 
 
 yeswelli suppose need another chairiweasley could you 
 
 not to worry not to worry said dumbledore pleasantly he took out his wand gave it a little flick and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to harry dumbledore sat down put the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed fudge over them with an expression of polite interest the wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly only when fudge spoke again did they settle down 
 
 yes said fudge again shuffling his notes well then so the charges yes 
 
 he extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him took a deep breath and read out the charges against the accused are as follows that he did knowingly deliberately and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions having received a previous written warning from the ministry of magic on a similar charge produce a patronus charm in a area in the presence of a muggle on the second of august at minutes past nine which constitutes an offence under paragraph c of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and also under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy 
 
 you are harry james potter of number four privet drive little whinging surrey fudge said glaring at harry over the top of his parchment 
 
 yes harry said 
 
 you received an official warning from the ministry for using illegal magic three years ago did you not 
 
 yes but 
 
 and yet you conjured a patronus on the night of the second of august said fudge 
 
 yes said harry but 
 
 knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen 
 
 yes but 
 
 knowing that you were in an area full of muggles 
 
 yes but 
 
 fully aware that you were in close proximity to a muggle at the time 
 
 yes said harry angrily but i only used it because we were 
 
 the witch with the monocle cut across him in a booming voice 
 
 you produced a patronus 
 
 yes said harry because 
 
 a corporeal patronus 
 
 awhat said harry 
 
 your patronus had a clearly defined form i mean to say it was more than vapour or smoke 
 
 yes said harry feeling both impatient and slightly desperate a stag always a stag 
 
 always boomed madam bones you have produced a patronus before now 
 
 yes said harry been doing it for over a year 
 
 and you are fifteen years old 
 
 yes and 
 
 you learned this at school 
 
 yes professor lupin taught me in my third year because of the 
 
 impressive said madam bones staring down at him a true patronus at his age very impressive indeed 
 
 some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again a few nodded but others were frowning and shaking their heads 
 
 not a question of how impressive the magic was said fudge in a testy voice in fact the more impressive the worse it is i would have thought given that the boy did it in plain view of a muggle 
 
 those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement but it was the sight of sanctimonious little nod that goaded harry into speech 
 
 i did it because of the dementors he said loudly before anyone could interrupt him again 
 
 he had expected more muttering but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before 
 
 dementors said madam bones after a moment her thick eyebrows rising until her monocle looked in danger of falling out what do you mean boy 
 
 i mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin 
 
 ah said fudge again smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the wizengamot as though inviting them to share the joke yes yes i thought be hearing something like this 
 
 dementors in little whinging madam bones said in a tone of great surprise i understand 
 
 you amelia said fudge still smirking let me explain been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story very nice indeed muggles see dementors can they boy highly convenient highly convenient so just your word and no witnesses 
 
 not lying said harry loudly over another outbreak of muttering from the court there were two of them coming from opposite ends of the alley everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it 
 
 enough enough said fudge with a very supercilious look on his face sorry to interrupt what sure would have been a very story 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat the wizengamot fell silent again 
 
 we do in fact have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway he said other than dudley dursley i mean 
 
 plump face seemed to slacken as though somebody had let air out of it he stared down at dumbledore for a moment or two then with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together said we got time to listen to more tarradiddles afraid dumbledore i want this dealt with quickly 
 
 i may be wrong said dumbledore pleasantly but i am sure that under the wizengamot charter of rights the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case that the policy of the department of magical law enforcement madam bones he continued addressing the witch in the monocle 
 
 true said madam bones perfectly true 
 
 oh very well very well snapped fudge where is this person 
 
 i brought her with me said dumbledore just outside the door should i 
 
 noweasley you go fudge barked at percy who got up at once ran down the stone steps from the balcony and hurried past dumbledore and harry without glancing at them 
 
 a moment later percy returned followed by mrs figg she looked scared and more batty than ever harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers 
 
 dumbledore stood up and gave mrs figg his chair conjuring a second one for himself 
 
 full name said fudge loudly when mrs figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat 
 
 arabella doreen figg said mrs figg in her quavery voice 
 
 and who exactly are you said fudge in a bored and lofty voice 
 
 a resident of little whinging close to where harry potter lives said mrs figg 
 
 we have no record of any witch or wizard living in little whinging other than harry potter said madam bones at once that situation has always been closely monitored given given past events 
 
 a squib said mrs figg so you have me registered would you 
 
 a squib eh said fudge eyeing her closely be checking that leave details of your parentage with my assistant weasley incidentally can squibs see dementors he added looking left and right along the bench 
 
 yes we can said mrs figg indignantly 
 
 fudge looked back down at her his eyebrows raised very well he said aloofly what is your story 
 
 i had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of wisteria walk around about nine on the evening of the second of august gabbled mrs figg at once as though she had learned what she was saying by heart when i heard a disturbance down the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk on approaching the mouth of the alleyway i saw dementors running 
 
 running said madam bones sharply dementors run they glide 
 
 what i meant to say said mrs figg quickly patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys 
 
 what did they look like said madam bones narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh 
 
 well one was very large and the other one rather skinny 
 
 no no said madam bones impatiently the dementors describe them 
 
 oh said mrs figg the pink flush creeping up her neck now they were big big and wearing cloaks 
 
 harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach whatever mrs figg might say it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like the eerie way they moved hovering inches over the ground or the rotting smell of them or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air 
 
 in the second row a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour a witch she smirked and nodded 
 
 big and wearing cloaks repeated madam bones coolly while fudge snorted derisively i see anything else 
 
 yes said mrs figg i felt them everything went cold and this was a very warm night mark you and i felt as though all happiness had gone from the world and i remembered dreadful things 
 
 her voice shook and died 
 
 madam eyes widened slightly harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it 
 
 what did the dementors do she asked and harry felt a rush of hope 
 
 they went for the boys said mrs figg her voice stronger and more confident now the pink flush ebbing away from her face one of them had fallen the other was backing away trying to repel the dementor that was harry he tried twice and produced only silver vapour on the third attempt he produced a patronus which charged down the first dementor and then with his encouragement chased the second one away from his cousin and that that is what happened mrs figg finished somewhat lamely 
 
 madam bones looked down at mrs figg in silence fudge was not looking at her at all but fidgeting with his papers finally he raised his eyes and said rather aggressively what you saw is it 
 
 that is what happened mrs figg repeated 
 
 very well said fudge you may go 
 
 mrs figg cast a frightened look from fudge to dumbledore then got up and shuffled off towards the door harry heard it thud shut behind her 
 
 not a very convincing witness said fudge loftily 
 
 oh i know said madam bones in her booming voice she certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately and i imagine why she would say they were there if they 
 
 but dementors wandering into a muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard snorted fudge the odds on that must be very very long even bagman have bet 
 
 oh i think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence said dumbledore lightly 
 
 the witch sitting to the right of fudge with her face in shadow moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent 
 
 and what is that supposed to mean fudge asked icily 
 
 it means that i think they were ordered there said dumbledore 
 
 i think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through little whinging barked fudge 
 
 not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the ministry of magic these days said dumbledore calmly i have already given you my views on this matter cornelius 
 
 yes you have said fudge forcefully and i have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge dumbledore the dementors remain in place in azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to 
 
 then said dumbledore quietly but clearly we must ask ourselves why somebody within the ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of august 
 
 in the complete silence that greeted these words the witch to the right of fudge leaned forwards so that harry saw her for the first time 
 
 he thought she looked just like a large pale toad she was rather squat with a broad flabby face as little neck as uncle vernon and a very wide slack mouth her eyes were large round and slightly bulging even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue 
 
 the chair recognises dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister said fudge 
 
 the witch spoke in a fluttery girlish voice that took harry aback he had been expecting a croak 
 
 sure i must have misunderstood you professor dumbledore she said with a simper that left her big round eyes as cold as ever so silly of me but it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the ministry of magic had ordered an attack on this boy 
 
 she gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of neck stand up a few other members of the wizengamot laughed with her it could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused 
 
 if it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the ministry of magic and it is also true that two dementors attacked harry and his cousin a week ago then it follows logically that somebody at the ministry might have ordered the attacks said dumbledore politely of course these particular dementors may have been outside ministry control 
 
 there are no dementors outside ministry control snapped fudge who had turned brick red 
 
 dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow 
 
 then undoubtedly the ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation 
 
 it is not for you to decide what the ministry of magic does or does not do dumbledore snapped fudge now a shade of magenta of which uncle vernon would have been proud 
 
 of course it said dumbledore mildly i was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated 
 
 he glanced at madam bones who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him frowning slightly 
 
 i would remind everybody that the behaviour of these dementors if indeed they are not figments of this imagination is not the subject of this hearing said fudge we are here to examine harry offences under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery 
 
 of course we are said dumbledore but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant clause seven of the decree states that magic may be used before muggles in exceptional circumstances and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself or any witches wizards or muggles present at the time of the 
 
 we are familiar with clause seven thank you very much snarled fudge 
 
 of course you are said dumbledore courteously then we are in agreement that use of the patronus charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describes 
 
 if there were dementors which i doubt 
 
 you have heard it from an eyewitness dumbledore interrupted 
 
 if you still doubt her truthfulness call her back question her again i am sure she would not object 
 
 ithatnot blustered fudge fiddling with the papers before him want this over with today dumbledore 
 
 but naturally you would not care how many times you heard from a witness if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice said dumbledore 
 
 serious miscarriage my hat said fudge at the top of his voice have you ever bothered to tot up the number of stories this boy has come out with dumbledore while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school i suppose forgotten the hover charm he used three years ago 
 
 that me it was a said harry 
 
 you see roared fudge gesturing flamboyantly in direction a in a muggle house i ask you 
 
 the in question is currently in the employ of hogwarts school said dumbledore i can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish 
 
 inoti got time to listen to anyway not the onlyhe blew up his aunt for sake fudge shouted banging his fist on the bench and upsetting a bottle of ink 
 
 and you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion accepting i presume that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions said dumbledore calmly as fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes 
 
 and i even started on what he gets up to at school 
 
 but as the ministry has no authority to punish hogwarts students for misdemeanours at school behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing said dumbledore as politely as ever but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words 
 
 oho said fudge not our business what he does at school eh you think so 
 
 the ministry does not have the power to expel hogwarts students cornelius as i reminded you on the night of the second of august said dumbledore nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven again as i reminded you on the night of the second of august in your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld you appear inadvertently i am sure to have overlooked a few laws yourself 
 
 laws can be changed said fudge savagely 
 
 of course they can said dumbledore inclining his head and you certainly seem to be making many changes cornelius why in the few short weeks since i was asked to leave the wizengamot it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic 
 
 a few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce the toadlike witch on his right however merely gazed at dumbledore her face quite expressionless 
 
 as far as i am aware dumbledore continued there is no law yet in place that says this job is to punish harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed he has been charged with a specific offence and he has presented his defence all he and i can do now is to await your verdict 
 
 dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more fudge glared at him evidently incensed harry glanced sideways at dumbledore seeking reassurance he was not at all sure that dumbledore was right in telling the wizengamot in effect that it was about time they made a decision again however dumbledore seemed oblivious to attempt to catch his eye he continued to look up at the benches where the entire wizengamot had fallen into urgent whispered conversations 
 
 harry looked at his feet his heart which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size was thumping loudly under his ribs he had expected the hearing to last longer than this he was not at all sure that he had made a good impression he had not really said very much he ought to have explained more fully about the dementors about how he had fallen over about how both he and dudley had nearly been kissed 
 
 twice he looked up at fudge and opened his mouth to speak but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back down at his shoes 
 
 then the whispering stopped harry wanted to look up at the judges but found that it was really much much easier to keep examining his laces 
 
 those in favour of clearing the witness of all charges said madam boness booming voice 
 
 head jerked upwards there were hands in the air many of them more than half breathing very fast he tried to count but before he could finish madam bones had said and those in favour of conviction 
 
 fudge raised his hand so did half a dozen others including the witch on his right and the wizard and the witch in the second row 
 
 fudge glanced around at them all looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat then lowered his own hand he took two deep breaths and said in a voice distorted by suppressed rage very well very well cleared of all charges 
 
 excellent said dumbledore briskly springing to his feel pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish well i must be getting along good day to you all 
 
 and without looking once at harry he swept from the dungeon 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight snape victoriouscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry could not move a muscle he lay there beneath the invisibility cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow hot and wet over his face listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond his immediate thought was that someone would surely check the compartments before the train departed again but at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment he would be neither seen nor heard his best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him 
 
 harry had never hated malfoy more than as he lay there like an absurd turtle on its back blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth what a stupid situation to have landed himself in and now the last few footsteps were dying away everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk 
 
 ron and hermione would think that he had left the train without them once they arrived at hogwarts and took their places in the great hall looked up and down the gryffindor table a few times and finally realized that he was not there he no doubt would be halfway back to london 
 
 he tried to make a sound even a grunt but it was impossible then he remembered that some wizards like dumbledore could perform spells without speaking so he tried to summon his wand which had fallen out of his hand by saying the words accio wand over and over again in his head but nothing happened 
 
 he thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake and the hoot of an owl but no hint of a search being made or even he despised himself slightly for hoping it panicked voices wondering where harry potter had gone a feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage malfoy was riding in where he could be recounting his attack on harry to crabbe goyle zabini and pansy parkinson 
 
 the train lurched causing harry to roll over onto his side now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling the floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life the express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it 
 
 then he felt his invisibility cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said wotcher harry 
 
 there was a flash of red light and body unfroze he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand and raise his head to look up at tonks who was holding the invisibility cloak she had just pulled away 
 
 better get out of here quickly she said as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station come on jump 
 
 harry hurried after her into the corridor she pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum he followed her staggered a little on landing then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed round the corner and disappear from view 
 
 the cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose tonks was looking at him he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position silently she handed him back the invisibility cloak 
 
 who did it 
 
 draco malfoy said harry bitterly thanks for well 
 
 no problem said tonks without smiling from what harry could see in the darkness she was as and as she had been when he had met her at the burrow i can fix your nose if you stand still 
 
 harry did not think much of this idea he had been intending to visit madam pomfrey the matron in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to healing spells but it seemed rude to say this so he stayed and closed his eyes 
 
 episkey said tonks 
 
 nose felt very hot and then very cold he raised a hand and felt gingerly it seemed to be mended 
 
 thanks a lot 
 
 better put that cloak back on and we can walk up to the school said tonks still unsmiling as harry swung the cloak back over himself she waved her wand an immense silvery creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness 
 
 was that a patronus asked harry who had seen dumbledore send messages like this 
 
 yes sending word to the castle that got you or worry come on better not dawdle 
 
 they set off toward the lane that led to the school 
 
 how did you find me 
 
 i noticed you left the train and i knew you had that cloak i thought you might be hiding for some reason when i saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment i thought check 
 
 but what are you doing here anyway harry asked 
 
 stationed in hogsmeade now to give the school extra protection said tonks 
 
 is it just you stationed up here or 
 
 no proudfoot savage and dawlish are here too 
 
 dawlish that auror dumbledore attacked last year 
 
 right 
 
 they trudged up the dark deserted lane following the freshly made carriage tracks harry looked sideways at tonks under his cloak last year she had been inquisitive to the point of being a little annoying at times she had laughed easily she had made jokes now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful was this all the effect of what had happened at the ministry he reflected uncomfortably that hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about sirius to her that it been her fault at all but he bring himself to do it he was far from blaming her for death it was no more her fault than anyone and much less than his but he did not like talking about sirius if he could avoid it and so they tramped on through the cold night in silence long cloak whispering on the ground behind them 
 
 having always traveled there by carriage harry had never before appreciated just how far hogwarts was from hogsmeade station with great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates each topped with a winged boar he was cold he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new gloomy tonks behind but when he put out a hand to push open the gates he found them chained shut 
 
 alohomora he said confidently pointing his wand at the padlock but nothing happened 
 
 that work on these said tonks dumbledore bewitched them himself 
 
 harry looked around 
 
 i could climb a wall he suggested 
 
 no you said tonks flatly jinxes on all of them been tightened a hundredfold this summer 
 
 well then said harry starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness i suppose just have to sleep out here and wait for morning 
 
 coming down for you said tonks look 
 
 a lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews it was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them and had pulled off his invisibility cloak so that he could be seen that he recognized with a rush of pure loathing the uplit hooked nose and long black greasy hair of severus snape 
 
 well well well sneered snape taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open nice of you to turn up potter although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance 
 
 i change i have my harry began but snape cut across him 
 
 there is no need to wait nymphadora potter is quiteahsafe in my hands 
 
 i meant hagrid to get the message said tonks frowning 
 
 hagrid was late for the feast just like potter here so i took it instead and incidentally said snape standing back to allow harry to pass him i was interested to see your new patronus 
 
 he shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again so that they slithered clinking back into place 
 
 i think you were better off with the old one said snape the malice in his voice unmistakable the new one looks weak 
 
 as snape swung the lantern about harry saw fleetingly a look of shock and anger on face then she was covered in darkness once more 
 
 goodnight harry called to her over his shoulder as he began the walk up to the school with snape thanks for everything 
 
 see you harry 
 
 snape did not speak for a minute or so harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that snape could not feel them burning him he had loathed snape from their first encounter but snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of forgiveness by his attitude toward sirius whatever dumbledore said harry had had time to think over the summer and had concluded that snide remarks to sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the order of the phoenix were off fighting voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in sirius rushing off to the ministry the night that he had died harry clung to this notion because it enabled him to blame snape which felt satisfying and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that sirius was dead it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness 
 
 fifty points from gryffindor for lateness i think said snape and let me see another twenty for your muggle attire you know i believe any house has ever been in negative figures this early in the termwe even started pudding you might have set a record potter 
 
 the fury and hatred bubbling inside harry seemed to blaze but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to london than tell snape why he was late 
 
 i suppose you wanted to make an entrance did you snape continued and with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the great hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect 
 
 still harry remained silent though he thought his chest might explode he knew that snape had come to fetch him for this for the few minutes when he could needle and torment harry without anyone else listening 
 
 they reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the great hall harry wondered whether he could slip his invisibility cloak back on thereby gaining his seat at the long gryffindor table which inconveniently was the farthest from the entrance hall without being noticed 
 
 as though he had read mind however snape said no cloak you can walk in so that everyone sees you which is what you wanted sure 
 
 harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors anything to get away from snape the great hall with its four long house tables and its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow it was all a shimmering blur to harry however who walked so fast that he was passing the hufflepuff table before people really started to stare and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him he had spotted ron and hermione sped along the benches toward them and forced his way in between them 
 
 youblimey you done to your face said ron goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity 
 
 why wrong with it said harry grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection 
 
 covered in blood said hermione come here 
 
 she raised her wand said tergeo and siphoned off the dried blood 
 
 thanks said harry feeling his now clean face my nose looking 
 
 normal said hermoine anxiously why it harry what happened been terrified 
 
 tell you later said harry curtly he was very conscious that ginny neville dean and seamus were listening in even nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop 
 
 but said hermione 
 
 not now hermione said harry in a darkly significant voice he hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic preferably involving a couple of death eaters and a dementor of course malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could but there was always a chance it reach too many gryffindor ears 
 
 he reached across ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips but before he could take them they vanished to be replaced with puddings 
 
 you missed the sorting anyway said hermione as ron dived for a large chocolate gateau 
 
 hat say anything interesting asked harry taking a piece of treacle tart 
 
 more of the same really advising us all to unite in the face enemies you know 
 
 dumbledore mentioned voldemort at all 
 
 not yet but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast he it be long now 
 
 snape said hagrid was late for the feast 
 
 seen snape how come said ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau 
 
 bumped into him said harry evasively 
 
 hagrid was only a few minutes late said hermione look waving at you harry 
 
 harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at hagrid who was indeed waving at him hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house the top of whose head came up to somewhere between elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting harry was surprised to see the divination teacher professor trelawney sitting on other side she rarely left her tower room and he had never seen her at the feast before she looked as odd as ever glittering with beads and trailing shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles having always considered her a bit of a fraud harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused lord voldemort to kill parents and attack harry himself the knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company thankfully this year he would be dropping divination her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction he hastily looked away toward the slytherin table draco malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart his insides burning again what he would give to fight malfoy 
 
 so what did professor slughorn want hermione asked 
 
 to know what really happened at the ministry said harry 
 
 him and everyone else here sniffed hermione people were interrogating us about it on the train they ron 
 
 yeah said ron all wanting to know if you really are the chosen one 
 
 there has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts interrupted nearly headless nick inclining his barely connected head toward harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff i am considered something of a potter authority it is widely known that we are friendly i have assured the spirit community that i will not pester you for information however harry potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence i told them i would rather die than betray his trust 
 
 not saying much seeing as already dead ron observed 
 
 once again you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe said nearly headless nick in affronted tones and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the gryffindor table just as dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table the talk and laughter echoing around the hall died away almost instantly 
 
 the very best of evenings to you he said smiling broadly his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room 
 
 what happened to his hand gasped hermione 
 
 she was not the only one who had noticed right hand was as blackened and as it had been on the night he had come to fetch harry from the dursleys whispers swept the room dumbledore interpreting them correctly merely smiled and shook his sleeve over his injury 
 
 nothing to worry about he said airily now to our new students welcome to our old students welcome back another year full of magical education awaits you 
 
 his hand was like that when i saw him over the summer harry whispered to hermione i thought have cured it by now though or madam pomfrey done 
 
 it looks as if died said hermione with a nauseated expression but there are some injuries you cure old curses and there are poisons without antidotes 
 
 and mr filch our caretaker has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called weasleys wizard wheezes 
 
 those wishing to play for their house quidditch teams should give their names to their heads of house as usual we are also looking for new quidditch commentators who should do likewise 
 
 we are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year professor slughorn slughorn stood up his bald head gleaming in the candlelight his big waistcoated belly casting the table into shadow is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of potions master 
 
 potions 
 
 potions 
 
 the word echoed all over the hall as people wondered whether they had heard right 
 
 potions said ron and hermione together turning to stare harry but you said 
 
 professor snape meanwhile said dumbledore raising voice so that it carried over all the muttering will be taking the position of defense against the dark arts teacher 
 
 no said harry so loudly that many heads turned in his direction he did not care he was staring up at the staff table incensed how could snape be given the defense against the dark arts job after all this time it been widely known for years that dumbledore did not trust him to do it 
 
 but harry you said that slughorn was going to be teaching defense against the dark arts said hermione 
 
 i thought he was said harry racking his brains to remember when dumbledore had told him this but now that he came to think of it he was unable to recall dumbledore ever telling him what slughorn would be teaching 
 
 snape who was sitting on right did not stand up his mention of his name he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the slytherin table yet harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much 
 
 well one good thing he said savagely be gone by the end of the year 
 
 what do you mean asked ron 
 
 that jinxed no ones lasted more than a year quirrell actually died doing it personally going to keep my fingers crossed for another death 
 
 harry said hermione shocked and reproachful 
 
 he might just go back to teaching potions at the end of the year said ron reasonably that slughorn bloke might not want to stay moody 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat harry ron and hermione were not the only ones who had been talking the whole hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that snape had finally achieved his desire seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing 
 
 now as everybody in this hall knows lord voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength 
 
 the silence seemed to tauten and strain as dumbledore spoke harry glanced at malfoy malfoy was not looking at dumbledore but making his fork hover in midair with his wand as though he found the words unworthy of his attention 
 
 i cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is and how much care each of us at hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe the magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer we are protected in new and more powerful ways but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff i urge you therefore to abide by any security restrictions that you teachers might impose upon you however irksome you might find themin particular the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours i implore you should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle to report it to a member of staff immediately i trust you to conduct yourselves always with the utmost regard for your own and others safety 
 
 blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more 
 
 but now your beds await as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish and i know that your top priority is to be for your lessons tomorrow let us therefore say good night pip pip 
 
 with the usual deafening scraping noise the benches moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the great hall toward their dormitories harry who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd nor to get near enough to malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the lagged behind pretending to retie the lace on his trainer allowing most of gryffindors to draw ahead of him hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her duty of shepherding the first years but ron remained with harry 
 
 what really happened to your nose he asked once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the hall and out of earshot of anyone else 
 
 harry told him it was a mark of the strength of their friendship that ron did not laugh 
 
 i saw malfoy miming something to do with a nose he said darkly 
 
 yeah well never mind that said harry bitterly listen to what he was saying before he found out i was there 
 
 harry had expected ron to be stunned by boasts with what harry considered pure pigheadedness however ron was unimpressed 
 
 come on harry he was just showing off for parkinson what kind of mission would have given him 
 
 how know voldemort need someone at hogwarts it be the first 
 
 i wish stop sayin tha name harry said a reproachful voice behind them harry looked over his shoulder to see hagtid shaking his head 
 
 dumbledore uses that name said harry stubbornly 
 
 yeah well dumbledore innit said hagrid mysteriously so how come yeh were late harry i was worried 
 
 got held up on the train said harry why were you late 
 
 i was with grawp said hagrid happily los track o the time got a new home up in the mountains now dumbledore fixed itnice big cave much happier than he was in the forest we were havin a good chat 
 
 really said harry taking care not to catch eye the last time he had met a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots his vocabulary had comprised five words two of which he was unable to pronounce properly 
 
 oh yeah really come on said hagrid proudly be amazed thinkin o trainin him up as me assistant 
 
 ron snorted loudly but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze they were now standing beside the oak front doors 
 
 anyway see yeh tomorrow firs straight after lunch come early an yeh can say hello ter buck i mean witherwings 
 
 raising an arm in cheery farewell he headed out of the doors into the darkness 
 
 harry and ron looked at each other harry could tell that ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself 
 
 not taking care of magical creatures are you 
 
 ron shook his head and not either are you 
 
 harry shook his head too 
 
 and hermione said ron not is she 
 
 harry shook his head again exactly what hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject he did not like to think 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight the weddingcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 three oclock on the following afternoon found harry ron fred and george standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests harry had taken a large dose of polyjuice potion and was now the double of a redheaded muggle boy from the local village ottery st catchpole from whom fred had stolen hairs using a summoning charm the plan was to introduce harry as cousin barny and trust to the great number of weasley relatives to camouflage him 
 
 all four of them were clutching seating plans so that they could help show people to the right seats a host of waiters had arrived an hour earlier along with a golden jacketed band and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot behind harry the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet the supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers fred and george had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where bill and fleur would shortly become husband and wife outside butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow harry was rather uncomfortable the muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summers day 
 
 when i get married said fred tugging at the collar of his own robes i wont be bothering with any of this nonsense you can all wear what you like and ill put a full body bird curse on mum until its all over 
 
 she wasnt too bad this morning considering said george cried a bit about percy not being here but who wants him oh blimey brace yourselves here they come look 
 
 brightly colored figures were appearing one by one out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard within minutes a procession had formed which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches hats while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards cravats a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent 
 
 excellent i think i see a few veela cousins said george craning his neck for a better look theyll need help understanding our english customs ill look after them 
 
 not so fast your holeyness said fred and darting past the gaggle of witches heading for the procession he said here c permetiez moi to assister vous to a pair of pretty french girls who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside george was left to deal with the witches and ron took charge of mr weasleys old perkins while a rather deaf old couple fell to harrys lot 
 
 wotcher said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found tonks and lupin at the front of the queue she had turned blonde for the occasion arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair sorry about last night she added in a whisper as harry led them up the aisle the ministrys being very at the museum and we thought our presence might not do you any favors 
 
 its fine i understand said harry speaking more to lupin than tonks lupin gave him a swift smile but as they turned away harry saw lupins face fall again into lines of misery he did not understand it but there was no time to dwell on the matter hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption having misunderstood freds directions as he had sat himself not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row but on five sets that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks 
 
 while mr weasley repaired the damage and hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen harry hurried back to the entrance to find ron with a most wizard slightly with white hair the texture of candyfloss he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an shade of yellow an odd symbol rather like a triangular eye glistened from a golden chain around his neck 
 
 xenophilius lovegood he said extending a hand to harry my daughter and i live just over the hill so kind of the good weasleys to invite us but i think you know my luna he added to ron 
 
 yes said ron isnt she with you 
 
 she lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes such a glorious infestation how few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes c or to give them their correct name the gernumbli gardensi 
 
 ours do know a lot of excellent swear words said ron but i think fred and george taught them those 
 
 he led a party of warlocks into the marquee as luna rushed up 
 
 hello harry she said 
 
 er c my names barry said harry flummoxed 
 
 oh have you changed that too she asked brightly 
 
 how did you know 
 
 oh just your expression she said 
 
 like her father luna was wearing bright yellow robes which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair once you get over the brightness of it all the general effect was quite pleasant at least there were no radishes dangling from her ears 
 
 xenophilius who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance had missed the exchange between luna and harry biding the wizard farewell he turned to his daughter who held up her finger and said daddy look c one of the gnomes actually bit me 
 
 how wonderful gnome saliva is enormously beneficial said mr lovegood seizing lunas outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks luna my love if you should feel any burgeoning talent today c perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims in mermish c do not repress it you may have been gifted by the gernumblies 
 
 ron passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort 
 
 ron can laugh said luna serenely as harry led her and xenophilius toward their seats but my father has done a lot of research on gernumbli magic 
 
 really said harry who had long since decided not to challenge luna or her fathers peculiar views are you sure you dont want to put anything on that bite though 
 
 oh its fine said luna sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking harry up and down you look smart i told daddy most people would probably wear dress robes but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding for luck you know 
 
 as she drifted off after her father ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm her beaky nose eyes and leathery pink hat gave her the look of a flamingo 
 
 and your hairs much too long ronald for a moment i thought you were ginevra merlins beard what is xenophilius lovegood wearing he looks like an omelet and who are you she barked at harry 
 
 oh yeah auntie muriel this is our cousin barny 
 
 another weasley you breed like gnomes isnt harry potter here i was hoping to meet him i thought he was a friend of yours ronald or have you merely been boasting 
 
 no c he couldnt come c 
 
 hmm made an excuse did he not as gormless as he looks in press photographs then ive just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara she shouted at harry you know and been in my family for centuries shes a girl but still c french well well find me a good seat ronald i am a hundred and seven and i ought not to be on my feet too long 
 
 ron gave harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time when next they met at the entrance harry had shown a dozen more people to their places the marquee was nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue outside 
 
 nightmare muriel is said ron mopping his forehead on his sleeve she used to come for christmas every year then thank god she took offense because fred and george set off a dungbomb under her chair at diner dad always says shell have written them out of her will c like they care theyre going to end up richer than anyone in the family rate theyre going wow he added blinking rather rapidly as hermione came hurrying toward them you look great 
 
 always the tone of surprise said hermione though she smiled she was wearing a floaty dress with matching high heels her hair was sleek and shiny your muriel doesnt agree i just met her upstairs while she was giving fleur the tiara she said oh dear is this the and then bad posture and skinny ankles 
 
 dont take it personally shes rude to everyone said ron 
 
 talking about muriel inquired george reemerging from the marquee with fred yeah shes just told me my ears are lopsided old bat i wish old uncle bilius was still with us though he was a right laugh at weddings 
 
 wasnt he the one who saw a grim and died hours later asked hermione 
 
 well yeah he went a bit odd toward the end conceded george 
 
 but before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party said fred he used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky then run onto the dance floor hoist up his robes and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his c 
 
 yes he sounds a real charmer said hermione while harry roared with laughter 
 
 never married for some reason said ron 
 
 you amaze me said hermione 
 
 they were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer a young man with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows until he held out his invitation to ron and said with his eyes on hermione you look vunderful 
 
 viktor she shrieked and dropped her small beaded bag which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size as she scrambled blushing to pick it up she said i didnt know you were c goodness c its lovely to see c how are you 
 
 rons ears had turned bright red again after glancing at krums invitation as if he did not believe a word of it he said much too loudly how come youre here 
 
 fleur invited me said krum eyebrows raised 
 
 harry who had no grudge against krum shook hands then feeling that it would be prudent to remove krum from rons vicinity offered to show him his seat 
 
 your friend is not pleased to see me said krum as they entered the now packed marquee or is he a relative he added with a glance at harrys red curly hair 
 
 cousin harry muttered but krum was not really listening his appearance was causing a stir particularly amongst the veela cousins he was after all a famous quidditch player while people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him ron hermione fred and george came hurrying down the aisle 
 
 time to sit down fred told harry or were going to get run over by the bride 
 
 harry ron and hermione took their seats in the second row behind fred and george hermione looked rather pink and rons ears were still scarlet after a few moments he muttered to harry did you see hes grown a stupid little beard 
 
 harry gave a noncommittal grunt 
 
 a sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter mr and mrs weasley strolled up the aisle smiling and waving at relatives mrs weasley was wearing a set of amethyst colored robes with a matching hat 
 
 a moment later bill and charlie stood up at the front of the marquee both wearing dress robes with larger white roses in their buttonholes fred and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons 
 
 ooooh said hermione swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance 
 
 a great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as monsieur delacour and fleur came walking up the aisle fleur gliding monsieur delacour bouncing and beaming fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong silvery glow while her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison today it beautified everybody it fell upon ginny and gabrielle both wearing golden dresses looked even prettier than usual and once fleur had reached for him bill did not look as though he had ever met fenrit greyback 
 
 ladies and gentlemen said a slightly singsong voice and with a slight shock harry saw the same small wizard who had presided at dumbledores funeral now standing in front of bill and fleur we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls 
 
 yes my tiara set off the whole thing nicely said auntie muriel in a rather carrying whisper but i must say ginevras dress is far too low cut 
 
 ginny glanced around grinning winked at harry then quickly faced the front again harrys mind wandered a long way from the marquee back to the afternoons spent alone with ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds they seemed so long ago they had always seemed too good to be true as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal persons life a person without a scar on his forehead 
 
 do you william arthur take fleur isabelle 
 
 in the front row mrs weasley and madame delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that hagrid had taken out one of his own handkerchiefs hermione turned around and beamed at harry her eyes too were full of tears 
 
 then i declare you bonded for life 
 
 the wizard waved his hand high over the heads of bill and fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them spiraling around their now entwined figures as fred and george led a round of applause the golden balloons overhead burst birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them adding their songs and chimes to the din 
 
 ladies and gentlemen called the wizard if you would please stand up 
 
 they all did so auntie muriel grumbling audibly he waved his wand again the scars on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside next a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small tables which all floated gracefully back to earth round it and the hand trooped toward a podium 
 
 smooth said ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides some hearing silver trays of pumpkin juice butterbeer and firewhisky others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches 
 
 we should go and congratulate them said hermione standing on tiptoe to see the place where bill and fleur had vanished amid a crowd of 
 
 well have time later shrugged ron snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to harry hermione cop hold lets grab a table not there nowhere near muriel c 
 
 ron led the way across the empty dance floor glancing left and right as he went harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for krum by the time they had reached the other side of the marquee most of the tables were occupied the emptiest was the one where luna sat alone 
 
 all right if we join you asked ron 
 
 oh yes she said happily daddys just gone to give bill and fleur our present 
 
 what is it a lifetimes supply of gurdyroots asked ron 
 
 hermione aimed a kick at him under the table but caught harry instead eyes watering in pain harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments 
 
 the band had begun to play bill and fleur took to the dance floor first to great applause after a while mr weasley led madame delacour onto the floor followed by mr weasley and fleurs father 
 
 i like this song said luna swaying in time to the waltzlike tune and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor where she revolved on the spot quite alone eyes closed and waving her arms 
 
 shes great isnt she said ron admiringly always good value 
 
 but the smile vanished from his face at once viktor krum had dropped into lunas vacant seat hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time krum had not come to compliment her with a scowl on his face he said who is that man in the yellow 
 
 thats xenophilius lovegood hes the father of a friend of ours said ron his pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at xenophilius despite the clear provocation come and dance he added abruptly to hermione 
 
 she looked taken aback but pleased too and got up they vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor 
 
 ah they are together now asked krum momentarily distracted 
 
 er c sort of said harry 
 
 who are you krum asked 
 
 barny weasley 
 
 they shook hands 
 
 you barny c you know this man lovegood well 
 
 no i only met him today why 
 
 krum glowered over the top of his drink watching xenophilius who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor 
 
 because said krum if he vus not a guest of fleurs i vould dud him here and now for veering that filthy sign upon his chest 
 
 sign said harry looking over at xenophilius too the strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest why whats wrong with it 
 
 grindelvald that is grindelvalds sign 
 
 grindelwald the dark wizard dumbledore defeated 
 
 exactly 
 
 krums jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing then he said grindelvald killed many people my grandfather for instance of course he vos never powerful in this country they said he feared dumbledore c and rightly seeing how he vos finished but this c he pointed a finger at xenophilius c this is his symbol i recognized it at vunce grindelvald carved it into a vall at durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to shock make themselves impressive c until those of us who had lost family members to grindelvald taught them better 
 
 krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at xenophilius harry felt perplexed it seemed incredibly unlikely that lunas father was a supporter of the dark arts and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular finlike shape 
 
 are you c er c quite sure its grindelwalds 
 
 i am not mistaken said krum coldly i walked past that sign for several years i know it vell 
 
 well theres a chance said harry that xenophilius doesnt actually know what the symbol means the lovegoods are quite unusual he could have easily picked it up somewhere and think its a cross section of the head of a snorkack or something 
 
 the cross section of a vot 
 
 well i dont know what they are but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them 
 
 harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining luna and her father 
 
 thats her he said pointing at luna who was still dancing alone waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges 
 
 vy is she doing that asked krum 
 
 probably trying to get rid of a wrackspurt said harry who recognized the symptoms 
 
 krum did not seem to know whether or not harry was making fun of him he drew his hand from inside his robe and tapped it menacingly on his thighs sparks flew out of the end 
 
 gregorovitch said harry loudly and krum started but harry was too excited to care the memory had come back to him at the sight of krums wand ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the triwizard tournament 
 
 vot about him asked krum suspiciously 
 
 hes a wandmaker 
 
 i know that said krum 
 
 he made your wand thats why i thought c quidditch c 
 
 krum was looking more and more suspicious 
 
 how do you know gregorovitch made my wand 
 
 ii read it somewhere i think said harry in a c a fan magazine he improvised wildly and krum looked mollified 
 
 i had not realized i ever discussed my vand with fans he said 
 
 so er where is gregorowitch these days 
 
 krum looked puzzled 
 
 he retired several years ago i was one of the last to purchase a gregorovitch vand they are the best calthough i know of course that your britons set much store by ollivander 
 
 harry did not answer he pretended to watch the dancers like krum but he was thinking hard so voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and harry did not have to search far for a reason it was surely because of what harry wand had done on the night that voldemort pursued him across the skies the holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand some thing that ollivander had not anticipated or understood would gregorowitch know better was he truly more skilled than ollivander did he know secrets of wands that ollivander did not 
 
 this girl is very krum said recalling harry to his surroundings krum was pointing at ginny who had just joined luna she is also a relative of yours 
 
 yeah said harry suddenly irritated and shes seeing someone jealous type big bloke you wouldnt want to cross him 
 
 krum grunted 
 
 vot he said draining his goblet and getting to his feet again is the point of being an international quidditch player if all the girls are taken 
 
 and he strode off leaving harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor he wanted to find ron to tell him about gregorovitch but he was dancing with hermione out in the middle of the floor harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched ginny who was now dancing with fred and georges friend lee jordan trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given ron 
 
 he had never been to a wedding before so he could not judge how wizarding celebrations differed from muggle ones though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd as the evening drew in and moths began to swoop under the canopy now lit with floating golden lanterns the revelry became more and more uncontained fred and george had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of fleurs cousins charlie hagrid and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing odo the hero in the corner 
 
 wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of rons who seemed unsure whether or not harry was his son harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table his cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a fez he was vaguely familiar racking his brains harry suddenly realized that this was elphias doge member of the order of the phoenix and the writer of dumbledores obituary 
 
 harry approached him 
 
 may i sit down 
 
 of course of course said doge he had a rather wheezy voice 
 
 harry leaned in 
 
 mr doge im harry potter 
 
 doge gasped 
 
 my dear boy arthur told me you were here disguised i am so glad so honored 
 
 in a flutter of nervous pleasure doge poured harry a goblet of champagne 
 
 i thought of writing to you he whispered after dumbledore the shock and for you i am sure 
 
 doges tiny eyes filled with sudden tears 
 
 i saw the obituary you wrote for the daily prophet said harry i didnt realize you knew professor dumbledore so well 
 
 as well as anyone said doge dabbing his eyes with a napkin certainly i knew him longest if you dont count aberforth c and somehow people never do seem to count aberforth 
 
 speaking of the daily prophet i dont know whether you saw mr doge 
 
 oh please call me elphias dear boy 
 
 elphias i dont know whether you saw the interview rita skeeter gave about dumbledore 
 
 doges face flooded with angry color 
 
 oh yes harry i saw it that woman or vulture might be a more accurate term positively pestered me to talk to her i am ashamed to say that i became rather rude called her an interfering trout which resulted as you my have seen in aspersions cast upon my sanity 
 
 well in that interview harry went on rita skeeter hinted that professor dumbledore was involved in the dark arts when he was young 
 
 dont believe a word of it said doge at once not a word harry let nothing tarnish your memories of albus dumbledore 
 
 harry looked into doges earnest pained face and felt not reassured but frustrated did doge really think it was that easy that harry could simply choose not to believe didnt doge understand harrys need to be sure to know everything 
 
 perhaps doge suspected harrys feelings for he looked concerned and hurried on harry rita skeeter is a dreadful c 
 
 but he was interrupted by a shrill cackle 
 
 rita skeeter oh i love her always read her 
 
 harry and doge looked up to see auntie muriel standing there the plumes dancing on her hair a goblet of champagne in her hand shes written a book about dumbledore you know 
 
 hello muriel said doge yes we were just discussing c 
 
 you there give me your chair im a hundred and seven 
 
 another redheaded weasley cousin jumped off his seat looking alarmed and auntie muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between doge and harry 
 
 hello again barry or whatever your name is she said to harry now what were you saying about rita skeeter elphias you know shes written a biography of dumbledore i cant wait to read it i must remember to place an order at flourish and blotts 
 
 doge looked stiff and solemn at this but auntie muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement she took another large gulp of champagne belched and then said theres no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh there were some mighty funny rumors about albus 
 
 sniping said doge turning again 
 
 you would say that elphias cackled auntie muriel i noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours 
 
 im sorry you think so said doge more coldly still i assure you i was writing from the heart 
 
 oh we all know you worshipped dumbledore i daresay youll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his squib sister 
 
 muriel exclaimed doge 
 
 a chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through harrys chest 
 
 what do you mean he asked muriel who said his sister was a squib i thought she was ill 
 
 thought wrong then didnt you barry said auntie muriel looking delighted at the effect she had produced anyway how could you expect to know anything about it it all happened years and years before you were even thought of my dear and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened thats why i cant wait to find out what skeeters unearthed dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time 
 
 untrue wheezed doge absolutely untrue 
 
 he never told me his sister as a squib said harry without thinking still cold inside 
 
 and why on earth would he tell you screeched muriel swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon harry 
 
 the reason albus never spoke about ariana began elphias in a voice stiff with emotion is i should have thought quite clear he was so devastated by her death c 
 
 why did nobody ever see her elphias squawked muriel why did half of us never even know she existed until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her where was saintly albus while ariana was locked in the cellar off being brilliant at hogwarts and never mind what was going on in his own house 
 
 what dyou mean locked in the cellar asked harry what is this 
 
 doge looked wretched auntie muriel cackled again and answered harry 
 
 dumbledores mother was a terrifying woman simply terrifying though i heard she pretended otherwise 
 
 she never pretended anything of the sort kendra was a fine woman whispered doge miserably but auntie muriel ignored him 
 
 proud and very domineering the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a squib 
 
 ariana was not a squib wheezed doge 
 
 so you say elphias but explain then why she never attended hogwarts said auntie muriel she turned back to harry in our day squibs were often hushed up thought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didnt exist c 
 
 i tell you thats not what happened said doge but auntie muriel steamrollered on still addressing harry 
 
 squibs were usually shipped off to muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the muggle community much kinder than trying to find them a place in the wizarding world where they must always be second class but naturally kendra dumbledore wouldnt have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a muggle school c 
 
 ariana was delicate said doge desperately her health was always too poor to permit her c 
 
 to permit her to leave the house cackled muriel and yet she was never taken to st mungos and no healer was ever summoned to see her 
 
 really muriel how can you possibly know whether c 
 
 for your information elphias my cousin lancelot was a healer at st mungos at the time and he told my family in strictest confidence that ariana had never been seen there all most suspicious lancelot thought 
 
 doge looked to be on the verge of tears auntie muriel who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely snapped her fingers for more champagne numbly harry thought of how the dursleys had once shut him up locked him away kept him out of sight all for the crime of being a wizard had dumbledores sister suffered the same fate in reverse imprisoned for her lack of magic and had dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented 
 
 now if kendra hadnt died first muriel resumed id have said that it was she who finished off ariana c 
 
 how can you muriel groaned doge a mother kill her own daughter think what youre saying 
 
 if the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end why not shrugged auntie muriel but as i say it doesnt fit because kendra died before ariana c of what nobody ever seemed sure 
 
 yes ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed kendra in the struggle said auntie muriel thoughtfully shake your head all you like elphias you were at arianas funeral were you not 
 
 yes i was said doge through trembling lips and a more desperately sad occasion i cannot remember albus was heartbroken 
 
 his heart wasnt the only thing didnt aberforth break albus nose halfway through the service 
 
 if doge had looked horrified before this it was nothing to how he looked now muriel might have stabbed him she cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne which dribbled down her chin 
 
 how do you croaked doge 
 
 my mother was friendly with old bathilda bagshot said auntie muriel happily bathilda described the whole thing to mother while i was listening at the door a brawl the way bathilda told it aberforth shouted that it was all albus fault that ariana was dead and then punched him in the face according to bathilda albus did not even defend himself and thats odd enough in itself albus could have destroyed aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back 
 
 muriel swigged yet more champagne the recitation of those old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified doge harry did not know what to think what to believe he wanted the truth and yet all doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that ariana had been ill harry could hardly believe that dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story 
 
 and ill tell you something else muriel said hiccupping slightly as she lowered her goblet i think bathilda has spilled the beans to rita skeeter all those hints in skeeters interview about an important source close to the dumbledores c goodness knows she was there all through the ariana business and it would fit 
 
 bathilda would never talk to rita skeeter whispered doge 
 
 bathilda bagshot harry said the author of a history of magic 
 
 the name was printed on the front of one of harrys textbooks though admittedly not one of the ones he had read more attentively 
 
 yes said doge clutching at harrys question like a drowning man at a life heir a most gifted magical historian and an old friend of albuss 
 
 quite gaga these days ive heard said auntie muriel cheerfully 
 
 if that is so it is even more dishonorable for skeeter to have taken advantage of her said doge and no reliance can be placed on anything bathilda may have said 
 
 oh there are ways of bringing back memories and im sure rita skeeter knows them all said auntie muriel but even if bathildas completely cuckoo im sure shed still have old photographs maybe even letters she knew the dumbledores for years well worth a trip to godrics hollow id have thought 
 
 harry who had been taking a sip of butterbeer choked doge banged him on the back as harry coughed looking at auntie muriel through streaming eyes once he had control of his voice again he asked bathilda bagshot lives in godrics hollow 
 
 oh yes shes been there forever the dumbledores moved there after percival was imprisoned and she was their neighbor 
 
 the dumbledores lived in godrics hollows 
 
 yes barry thats what i just said said auntie muriel testily 
 
 harry felt drained empty never once in six years had dumbledore told harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in godrics hollow why were lily and james buried close to dumbledores mother and sister had dumbledore visited their graves perhaps walked past lilys and jamess to do so and he had never once told harry never bothered to say 
 
 and why it was so important harry could not explain even to himself yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common he stared ahead of him barely noticing what was going on around him and did not realize that hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him 
 
 i simply cant dance anymore she panted slipping of one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot rons gone looking to find more butterbeers its a bit odd ive just seen viktor storming away from lunas father it looked like theyd been arguing c she dropped her voice staring at him harry are you okay 
 
 harry did not know where to begin but it did not matter at that moment something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor graceful and gleaming the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers heads turned as those nearest it froze absurdly in then the patronuss mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud deep slow voice of kingsley shacklebolt 
 
 the ministry has fallen scrimgeour is dead they are coming 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows
