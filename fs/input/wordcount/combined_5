 a new hope 
 iv 
 
 aunt beru was filling a pitcher with blue liquid from a refrigerated her in the dining area a steady buzz of conversation reached to the kitchen 
 she sighed sadly the mealtime discussions between her husband and lukehad grown steadily more acrimonious as the restlessness pulled him indirections other than farming directions for which owen a stolid man of the soil ifthere ever was one had absolutely no sympathy 
 returning the bulk container to the refrigerator unit she placed the pitcher on atray and hurried back to the dining room beru was not a brilliant woman but shepossessed an instinctive understanding of her important position in this functioned like the damping rods in a nuclear reactor as long as she waspresent owen and luke would continue to generate a lot of heat but if she was out oftheir presence for too 
 condenser units built into the bottom of each plate kept the food on the table hot as she hurried in immediately both men lowered their voices tosomething civilized and shifted the subject beru pretended not to notice the change 
 i think that artoo unit might have been stolen uncle owen luke was if that had been the topic of conversation all along 
 his uncle helped himself to the milk pitcher mumbling his reply around amouthful of food the jawas have a tendency to pick up anything not tieddown luke but remember basically afraid of their own shadows to resortto outright theft have to have considered the consequences of being pursuedand punished theoretically their minds be capable of that what makesyou think the droid is stolen 
 for one thing in awfully good shape for a discard it generated ahologram recording while i was cleaning luke tried to conceal his horror at theslip he added hastily but not important the reason i think it might bestolen is because it claims to be the property of someone it calls kenobi 
 maybe something in the food or perhaps the milk caused uncle to again it might have been an expression of disgust which was way ofindicating his opinion of that peculiar personage in any case he continued eatingwithout looking up at his nephew 
 luke pretended the display of graphic dislike had never happened i continued determinedly it might have meant old ben the first name is the last is identical 
 when his uncle steadfastly maintained his silence luke prompted him you know who talking about uncle owen 
 surprisingly his uncle looked uncomfortable instead of angry mumbled still not meeting gaze a name from another time hesquirmed nervously in his seat a name that can only mean trouble 
 luke refused to heed the implied warning and pressed on is it someonerelated to old ben then i know he had any relatives 
 you stay away from that old wizard he hear me his uncle substituting threat for reason 
 owen aunt beru started to interject gently but the big farmer cut her offsternly 
 now this is important beru he turned his attention back to his told you about kenobi before a crazy old man dangerous and fullof mischief and the best left well along 
 pleading gaze caused him to quiet somewhat that droid has nothingto do with him have he grumbled half to himself tomorrow i want you to take the unit into anchorhead and have its memoryflushed 
 snorting owen bent to his meal with determination that will bethe end of this foolishness i care where that machine thinks it came from ipaid hard credit for it and it belongs to us now 
 but suppose it does belong to someone else luke wondered what if person comes looking for his droid 
 an expression between sorrow and a sneer crossed his seamed face at aremembrance he i think that man exists anymore he died aboutthe same time as your father a huge mouthful of hot food was shoveled forget about it 
 then it was a real person luke murmured staring down at his plate headded slowly did he know my father 
 i said forge about it owen snapped your only worry as far as thosetwo droids are concerned is having them ready for work tomorrow remember thelast of our saving is tied up in those two even have bought them if so near harvest he shook a spoon at his nephew in the morning i wantyou to have them working with the irrigation units up on the south ridge 
 you know luke replied distantly i think these droids are going to work outfine in fact i he hesitated shooting his uncle a surreptitious glare i wasthinking about our agreement about me staying on for another season 
 his uncle failed to react so luke rushed on before his nerve failed if thesenew droids do work out i want to transmit my application to enter the academy fornext year 
 owen scowled trying to hide his displeasure with food you mean you wantto transmit application next the harvest 
 you have more than enough droids now and in good last 
 droids yes his uncle agreed but droids replace a man luke youknow that the harvest is when i need you the most just for one more seasonafter this one he looked away bluster and anger gone now 
 luke toyed with his food not eating saying nothing 
 listen his uncle told him for the first time got a chance for a realfortune make enough to hire some extra hands for next time not then you can go to the academy he fumbled over words unaccustomedto pleading i need you here luke you understand that you 
 another year his nephew objected sullenly another year 
 how many times had he heard that before how many times had theyrepeated this identical charade with the same result 
 convinced once more that luke had come round to his way of thinking owenshrugged the objection off time will pass before you know it 
 abruptly luke rose shoving his barely touched plate of food aside you said last year when biggs left he spun and half ran from the room 
 where are you going luke his aunt yelled worriedly after him 
 reply was bleak bitter looks like going nowhere then headded out of consideration for his sensibilities i have to finish cleaningthose droids if going to be ready to work tomorrow 
 silence hung in the air of the dining room after luke departed husband andwife ate mechanically eventually aunt beru stopped shoving her food around herplate looked up and pointed out earnestly owen you keep him here of his friends are gone the people he grew up with the academy means somuch to him 
 listlessly her husband replied make it up to him next year i have maybe the year after that 
 just not a farmer owen she continued firmly he never will be nomatter how hard you try to make him one she shook her head slowly gottoo much of his father in him 
 for the first time all evening owen lars looked thoughtful as well as concernedas he gazed down the passage luke had taken what afraid of hewhispered 
 luke had gone topside he stood on the sand watching the double sunset asfirst one and then the other of twin suns sank slowly behind the distantrange of dunes in the fading light the sands turned gold russet and flaming before advancing night put the bright colors to sleep for another day the first time those sands would blossom with food plants this formerwasteland would see and eruption of green 
 the thought ought to have sent a thrill of anticipation through luke he shouldhave been as flushed with excitement as his uncle was whenever he described thecoming harvest instead luke felt nothing but a vast indifferent emptiness noteven the prospect of having a lot of money for the first time in his life excited was there to do with money in on tatooine for thatmatter 
 part of him an increasingly large part was growing more and more restless atremaining unfulfilled this was not an uncommon feeling in youths his age but forreasons luke did not understand it was much stronger in him than in any of hisfriends 
 as the night cold came creeping over the sand and up his legs he brushed thegrit from his trousers and descended into the garage maybe working on the droidswould bury some of the remorse a little deeper in his mind a quick survey of thechamber showed no movement neither of the new machines was in slightly luke took a small control box from his belt and activated a coupleof switches set into the plastic 
 a low him came from the box the caller produced the taller of the two in fact he gave a yell of surprise as he jumped up behind the skyhopper 
 luke started toward him openly puzzled what are you hiding back therefor 
 the robot came stumbling around the prow of the craft he attitude one ofdesperation it occurred to luke then that despite his activating the caller the artoounit was still nowhere to be seen 
 the reason for his something related to pouring unbiddenfrom threepio it my fault the robot begged frantically please me i told him not to go but faulty he must be has totally boiled his logic circuits he kept babbling on about some sortof mission sir i never heard a robot with delusions of grandeur before suchthings even be within the cogitative theory units of one as basic as anartoo unit and 
 you mean luke started to gape 
 yes gone 
 and i removed his restraining coupling myself luke muttered he could visualize his face the last of their savings tied up inthese droids he had said 
 racing out of the garage luke hunted for reasons why the artoounit should go berserk threepio followed on his heels 
 from a small ridge which formed the highest point close by the homestead lukehad a panoramic view of the surrounding desert bringing out the preciousmacrobinoculars he scanned the rapidly darkening horizons for something and out of its mechanical mind 
 threepio fought his way up through the sand to stand beside luke that artoounit has always caused nothing but trouble he groaned astromech droids arebecoming too iconoclastic even for me to understand sometimes 
 the binoculars finally came down and luke commented nowhere in sight he kicked furiously at the ground damn could ihave been so stupid letting it trick me into removing that restrainer uncle to kill me 
 begging your pardon sir ventured a hopeful threepio visions of jawasdancing in his head but we go after him luke turned studiously he examined the wall of black advancing toward at night too dangerous with all the raiders around not too concernedabout the jawas but sandpeopleno not in the dark have to wait untilmorning to try to track him 
 a shout rose from the homestead below are you finished withthose droids yet turning down the power for the night 
 all right luke responded sidestepping the question be down in a fewminutes uncle owen turning he took one last look at the vanished am i in for it he muttered that little going to get me in a lot oftrouble 
 oh he excells at that sir threepio confirmed with mock cheerfulness lukethrew him a sour look and together they turned and descended into the garage 
 lukeluke still rubbing the morning sleep from his eyes owen glancedfrom side to side loosening his neck muscles where could that boy be loafingnow he wondered aloud at the lack of response there was no sign of movementin the homestead and he had already checked above 
 luke he yelled again luke luke lukethe name echoed teasing back athim from the homestead walls turning angrily he stalked back into the beru was preparing breakfast 
 have you seen luke this morning he asked as softly as he could manage 
 she glance briefly at him then returned to her cooking yes he said he hadsome things to do before he started out to the south ridge this morning so he leftearly 
 before breakfast owen frowned worriedly not like him did hetake the new droids with him 
 i think so i am sure i saw at least one of them with him 
 well owen mused uncomfortable but with nothing to really hangimprecations on better have those ridge units repaired by midday or behell to pay 
 an unseen face shielded by smooth white metal emerged from the pod that now formed the backbone of a dune slightly higher than its voice sounded efficient but tired 
 nothing the inspecting trooper muttered to his several companions notapes and no sign of habitation 
 powerful handguns lowered at the information that the pod was deserted oneof the armored men turned calling out to an officer standing some distance is definitely the pod that cleared the rebel ship sir but nothing onboard 
 yet it set down intact the officer was murmuring to himself it could havedone so on automatics but if it was a true malfunction then they have beenengaged something make sense 
 why nothing on board and no hint of life sir a voice declared 
 the officer turned and strode several paces to where another trooper waskneeling in the sand he held up an object for the inspection it shone inthe sun 
 droid plating the officer observed after a quick glance at the metal and underling exchanged a significant glance then their eyes turnedsimultaneously to the high mesas off to the north 
 gravel and fine sand formed a gritty fog beneath the landspeeder as it slid acrossthe rippling wasteland of tatooine on humming repulsors occasionally the craftwould jog slightly as it encountered a dip or slight rise to return to its smooth passageas its pilot compensated for the change in terrain 
 luke leaned back in the seat luxuriating in unaccustomed relaxation as threepioskillfully directed the powerful landcraft around dunes and rocky outcrops youhandle a landspeeder pretty well for a machine he noted admiringly 
 thank you sir a gratified threepio responded his eyes never moving from thelandscape ahead i was not lying to your uncle when i claimed versatility as mymiddle name in fact on occasion i have been called upon to perform unexpectedfunctions in circumstances which would have appalled my designers 
 something pinged behind them then pinged again 
 luke frowned and popped the speeder canopy a few moments of digging inthe motor casing eliminated the metallic bark 
 that he yelled forward 
 threepio signaled that the adjustment was satisfactory luke turned back intothe cockpit and closed the canopy over them again silently he brushed his hair back out of his eyes as his attention returned to the dry desert ahead ofthem 
 old ben kenobi is supposed to live out in this general direction even thoughnobody knows exactly where i see how that artoo unit could have come this farso quickly his expression was downcast we must have missed him back in thedunes somewhere he could be anywhere out here and uncle owen must bewondering why i called in from the south ridge by now 
 threepio considered a moment then ventured would it help sir if you toldhim that it was my fault 
 luke appeared to brighten at the suggestion surehe needs you twice asmuch now probably only deactivate you for a day or so or give you a partialmemory flush 
 deactivate memory flush threepio added hastily on second thought would still be around if you removed his restraining module 
 but something more important than fixing responsibility for the little was on mind at the moment wait a minute he advisedthreepio as he stared fixedly at the instrument panel something deadahead on the metal scanner distinguish outlines at this distance but judgingby size alone it could be our wandering droid hit it 
 the landspeeder jumped forward as threepio engaged the accelerator but itsoccupants were totally unaware that other eyes were watching as the craft increasedits speed 
 those eyes were not organic but then they wholly mechanical one could say for certain because no one had ever made that intimate a study ofthe tusken less formally to the margin farmers of tatooine simply asthe sandpeople 
 the tusken permit close study of themselves discouraging potentialobservers by methods as effective as they were uncivilized a few xenologiststhought they must be related to the jawas even fewer hypothesized that the jawaswere actually the mature form of the sandpeople but this theory was discounted bythe majority of serious scientists 
 both races affected tight clothing to shield them from twin dose ofsolar radiation but there most comparisons ended instead of heavy woven cloakslike the jawas wore the sandpeople wrapped themselves in endlessswathing and bandages and loose bits of cloth 
 where the jawas feared everything a tusken raider feared little thesandpeople were larger stronger and far more aggressive fortunately for thehuman colonists of tatooine they were not very numerous and elected to pursue theirnomadic existence in some of most desolate regions contact betweenhuman and tusken therefore was infrequent and uneasy and they murdered no morethan a handful of human per year since the human population had claimed its shareof tuskens not always with reason a peace of a sort existed between the as neither side gained an advantage 
 one of the pair felt that that unstable condition had temporarily shifted in hisfavor and he was about to take full advantage of it as he raised his rifle toward thelandspeeder but his companion grabbed the weapon and shoved down on it beforeit could be fired this set off a violent argument between the two and as theytraded vociferous opinions in a language consisting mostly of consonants thelandspeeder sped on its way 
 either because the speeder had passed out of range or because the second tuskenhad convinced the other the two broke off the discussion and scrambled down thebackside of the high ridge snuffling and a shifting of weight took place at the ridgebottom as the two banthas stirred at the approach of their masters each was aslarge as a small dinosaur with bright eyes and long thick fur they hissed anxiouslyas the two sandpeople approached then mounted them from knee to saddle 
 with a kick banthas rose moving slowly but with enormous strides the twomassive horned creatures swept down the back of the rugged bluff urged on by theiranxious equally outrageous mahouts 
 him all right luke declared with mixed anger and satisfaction as the tinytripodal form came into view the speeder banked and swung down onto the floorof a huge sandstone canyon luke slipped his rifle out from behind the seat andswung it over his shoulder come round in front of him threepio he instructed 
 with pleasure sir 
 the artoo unit obviously noted their approach but mad no move to escape itcould hardly have outrun the landspeeder anyway artoo simply halted as soon as itdetected them and waited until the craft swung around in a smooth arc threepiocame to a sharp halt sending up a low cloud of sand on the smaller the whine from the engine dropped to a low idling hum asthreepio put it in parking mode a last sigh and the craft stopped completely 
 after finishing a cautious survey of the canyon luke led his companion out ontothe gravelly surface and up to artoo detoo just where he inquired sharply didyou think you were going 
 a feeble whistle issued from the apologetic robot but it was threepio and notthe recalcitrant rover who was abruptly doing most of the talking 
 master luke here is now your rightful owner artoo how could you justamble away from him like this now found you have no more ofthis gibberish i know where picked that thatmelodramatic hologram either 
 artoo started to beep in protest but indignation was too great topermit excuses and talk to me about your mission what rot master luke blast you into a million pieces right here and now 
 not much chance of that admitted luke a bit overwhelmed by vindictiveness come getting late he eyed the rapidly risingsuns i just hope we can get back before uncle owen really lets go 
 if you mind my saying so threepio suggested apparently unwilling thatthe artoo unit should get off so easily i think you ought to deactivate the littlefugitive until gotten him safely back in the garage 
 no not going to try anything luke studied the softly beeping droidsternly i hope learned his lesson no need to 
 without warning the artoo unit suddenly leaped off the mean featconsidering the weakness of the spring mechanisms in his three thick legs hiscylindrical body was twisting and spinning as he let out a frantic symphony ofwhistles hoots and electronic exclamations 
 luke was tired not alarmed what is it wrong with him was beginning to see how patience could be worn thin he had hadabout enough of this addled instrument himself 
 undoubtedly the artoo unit had acquired the holo of the girl by accident thenused it to entice luke into removing his restraining module threepio probably hadthe right attitude still once luke got its circuits realigned and its logic couplingscleaned it would make a perfectly serviceable farm unit onlyif that was the why was threepio looking around so anxiously 
 oh my sir artoo claims there are several creatures of unknown typeapproaching from the southeast 
 that could be another attempt by artoo to distract them but luke takethe chance instantly he had his rifle off his shoulder and had activated the energycell he examined the horizon in the indicated direction and saw nothing but were experts at making themselves unseeable 
 luke suddenly realized exactly how far out they were how much ground thelandspeeder had covered that morning never been out in this direction this farfrom the farm before he informed threepio there are some awfully strangethings living out here not all of them have been classified better to treatanything as dangerous until determined otherwise of course if somethingutterly new his curiosity prodded him in any case this was probably justanother ruse of artoo take a look he decided 
 moving cautiously forward and keeping his rifle ready he led threepio towardthe crest of a nearby high dune at the same time he took care not to let artoo out ofhis sight 
 once at the top he lay flat and traded his rifle for the macrobinoculars canyon spread out before them rising to a wall of rust andocher advancing the binocs slowly across the canyon floor he settled unexpectedlyon two tethered shapes riderless 
 did you say something sir wheezed threepio struggling up behind locomotors were not designed for such outer climbing and scrambling 
 banthas all right luke whispered over his shoulder not considering in theexcitement of the moment that threepio might not know a bantha from a panda 
 he looked back into the eyepieces refocusing slightly i see one of them 
 something dark suddenly blocked his sight for a moment he thought that arock might have moved in front of them irritably he dropped the binoculars andreached out to move the blinding object aside his hand touched something like softmetal 
 it was a bandaged leg about as big around as both of together looked upand up the towering figure glaring down at him was no jawa ithad seemingly erupted straight from the sand 
 threepio took a startled step backward and found no footing as gyros whinedin protest the tall robot tumbled backward down the side of the dune frozen inplace luke heard steadily fading bangs and rattles as threepio bounced down thesteep slope behind him 
 as the moment of confrontation passed the tusken let out a terrifying grunt offury and pleasure and brought down his heavy gaderffii the axwould have cleaved skull neatly in two except that he threw the rifle up in agesture more instinctive than calculated his weapon deflected the blow but wouldnever do so again made from cannibalized freighter plating the huge ax shatteredthe barrel and made metallic confetti of the delicate insides 
 luke scrambled backward and found himself against a steep drop the raiderstalked him slowly weapon held high over its head it uttered agruesome chuckling laugh the sound made all the more inhuman by the distortioneffect of its sandfilter 
 luke tried to view his situation objectively as he had been instructed to do insurvival school trouble was his mouth was dry his hands were shaking and hewas paralyzed with fear with the raider in front of him and a probably fatal dropbehind something else in his mind took over and opted for the least painful fainted 
 none of the raiders notice artoo detoo as the tiny robot force himself into asmall alcove in the rocks near the landspeeder one of them was carrying the inertform of luke he dumped the unconscious youth in a heap next to the speeder thenjoined his fellows as they began swarming over the open craft 
 supplies and spare parts were thrown in all directions from time to time theplundering would be interrupted as several of them quibbled or fought over aparticularly choice bit of booty 
 unexpectedly distribution of the content ceased and withfrightening speed the raiders became part of the desertscape looking in all directions 
 a lost breeze idled absently down the canyon far off to the west somethinghowled a rolling booming drone ricocheted off canyon walls and crawlednervously up and down a gorgon scale 
 the sandpeople remained poised a moment longer then they were utteringloud grunts and moans of fright as they rushed to get away from the highly visiblelandspeeder 
 the shivering howl sounded again nearer this time bu now the sandpeoplewere halfway to their waiting banthas that were likewise lowing tensely and tuggingat their tethers 
 although the sound held no meaning for artoo detoo the little droid tried tosqueeze himself even deeper into the the booming howl came by the way the sandpeople had reacted something monstrous beyondimagining had to be behind that rolling cry something monstrous and might not have the sense to distinguish between edible organics and inediblemachines 
 not even the dust of their passing remained to mark where the tusken raidershad only minutes before been dismembering the interior of the landspeeder artoodetoo shut down all but vital functions trying to minimize noise and light as aswishing sound grew gradually audible moving toward the landspeeder thecreature appeared above the top of a nearby dune

 book one 
 chapter v 
 
 and what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at milan asked anna pavlovna and of the comedy of the people of genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte and monsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations adorable it is enough to make head whirl it is as if the whole world had gone crazy 
 prince andrew looked anna pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile 
 dieu me la donne gare a qui la touche they say he was very fine when he said that he remarked repeating the words in italian dio mi dato guai a chi la tocchi 
 god has given it to me let him who touches it beware 
 i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over anna pavlovna continued the sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything 
 the sovereigns i do not speak of russia said the vicomte polite but hopeless the sovereigns madame what have they done for louis xvii for the queen or for madame elizabeth nothing and he became more animated and believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the bourbon cause the sovereigns why they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper 
 and sighing disdainfully he again changed his position 
 prince hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the conde coat of arms on the table he explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it 
 baton de gueules engrele de gueules d azur maison conde said he 
 the princess listened smiling 
 if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer the vicomte continued with the air of a man who in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone too far by intrigues violence exile and executions french society i mean good french society will have been forever destroyed and then 
 he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands pierre wished to make a remark for the conversation interested him but anna pavlovna who had him under observation interrupted 
 the emperor alexander said she with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family has declared that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose their own form of government and i believe that once free from the usurper the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant 
 that is doubtful said prince andrew monsieur le vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far i think it will be difficult to return to the old regime 
 from what i have heard said pierre blushing and breaking into the conversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to side 
 it is the buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without looking at pierre at the present time it is difficult to know the real state of french public opinion 
 bonaparte has said so remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile 
 it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him though without looking at him 
 i showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it prince andrew continued after a short silence again quoting words i opened my antechambers and they crowded in i do not know how far he was justified in saying so 
 not in the least replied the vicomte after the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero if to some people he went on turning to anna pavlovna he ever was a hero after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth 
 before anna pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the epigram pierre again broke into the conversation and though anna pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate she was unable to stop him 
 the execution of the duc declared monsieur pierre was a political necessity and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed 
 dieu mon dieu muttered anna pavlovna in a terrified whisper 
 what monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing her work nearer to her 
 oh oh exclaimed several voices 
 capital said prince hippolyte in english and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand 
 the vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued 
 i say so he continued desperately because the bourbons fled from the revolution leaving the people to anarchy and napoleon alone understood the revolution and quelled it and so for the general good he could not stop short for the sake of one life 
 you come over to the other table suggested anna pavlovna 
 but pierre continued his speech without heeding her 
 no cried he becoming more and more eager napoleon is great because he rose superior to the revolution suppressed its abuses preserved all that was good in it equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press and only for that reason did he obtain power 
 yes if having obtained power without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king i should have called him a great man remarked the vicomte 
 he could not do that the people only gave him power that he might rid them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man the revolution was a grand thing continued monsieur pierre betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind 
 what revolution and regicide a grand thing well after that but you come to this other table repeated anna pavlovna 
 contrat social said the vicomte with a tolerant smile 
 i am not speaking of regicide i am speaking about ideas 
 yes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an ironical voice 
 those were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most important what is important are the rights of man emancipation from prejudices and equality of citizenship and all these ideas napoleon has retained in full force 
 liberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were words which have long been discredited who does not love liberty and equality even our saviour preached liberty and equality have people since the revolution become happier on the contrary we wanted liberty but buonaparte has destroyed it 
 prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess in the first moment of outburst anna pavlovna despite her social experience was but when she saw that sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator 
 but my dear monsieur pierre said she how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc or even an ordinary man who is innocent and untried 
 i should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains the th brumaire was not that an imposture it was a swindle and not at all like the conduct of a great man 
 and the prisoners he killed in africa that was horrible said the little princess shrugging her shoulders 
 a low fellow say what you will remarked prince hippolyte 
 pierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled his smile was unlike the of other people when he smiled his grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by another a childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to ask forgiveness 
 the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested all were silent 
 how do you expect him to answer you all at once said prince andrew besides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor so it seems to me 
 yes yes of course pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement 
 one must admit continued prince andrew that napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of arcola and in the hospital at jaffa where he gave his hand to the but but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify 
 prince andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go 
 suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend and asking them all to be seated began 
 i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it excuse me vicomte i must tell it in russian or the point will be lost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story 
 there is in moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy she must have two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones that was her taste and she had a maid also big she said 
 here prince hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty 
 she said oh yes she said girl to the maid put on a livery get up behind the carriage and come with me while i make some calls 
 here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator several persons among them the elderly lady and anna pavlovna did however smile 
 she went suddenly there was a great wind the girl lost her hat and her long hair came down here he could contain himself no longer and went on between gasps of laughter and the whole world knew 
 and so the anecdote ended though it was unintelligible why he had told it or why it had to be told in russian still anna pavlovna and the others appreciated prince social tact in so agreeably ending unpleasant and unamiable outburst after the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and where

 chapter 
 
 in the course of time mr earnshaw began to fail he had been active and healthy yet his strength left him suddenly and when he was confined to the chimney comer he grew grievously irritable a nothing vexed him and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits this was especially to be remarked if anyone attempted to impose upon or domineer over his favourite he was painfully jealous lest a word should be spoken amiss to him seeming to have got into his head the notion that because he liked heathcliff all hated and longed to do him an ill turn it was a disadvantage to the lad for the kinder among us did not wish to fret the master so we humoured his partiality and that humouring was rich nourishment to the pride and black tempers still it became in a manner necessary twice or thrice manifestation of scorn while his father was near roused the old man to a fury he seized his stick to strike him and shook with rage that he could not do it 
 at last our curate we had a curate then who made the living answer by teaching the little lintons and earnshaws and farming his bit of land himself he advised that the young man should be sent to college and mr earnshaw agreed though with a heavy spirit for he was nought and would never thrive as where he wandered 
 i hoped heartily we should have peace now it hurt me to think the master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed i fancied the discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements as he would have it that it did really you know sir it was in his sinking frame we might have got on tolerably notwithstanding but for two people miss cathy and joseph the servant you saw him i dare say up yonder he was and is yet most likely the wearisomest pharisee that ever ransacked a bible to rake the promises to himself and fling the curses on his neighbours by his knack of sermonizing and pious discoursing he contrived to make a great impression on mr earnshaw and the more feeble the master became the more influence he gained he was relentless in worrying him about his concerns and about ruling his children rigidly he encouraged him to regard hindley as a reprobate and night after night he regularly grumbled out a long string of tales against heathcliff and catherine always minding to flatter weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the last 
 certainly she had ways with her such as i never saw a child take up before and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener in a day from the hour she came downstairs till the hour she went to bed we had not a security that she be in mischief her spirits were always at mark her tongue always laughing and plaguing everybody who would not do the same a wild wicked slip she she had the bonniest eye the sweetest smile and lightest foot in the parish and after all i believe she meant no harm for when once she made you cry in good earnest it seldom happened that she would not keep you company and oblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her she was much too fond of heathcliff the greatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him yet she got chided more than any of us on his account in play she liked exceedingly to act the little mistress using her hands freely and commanding her companions she did so to me but i would not bear shopping and ordering and so i let her know 
 now mr earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children he had always been strict and grave with them and catherine on her part had no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing condition than he was in his prime his peevish reproofs wakened in her a naughty delight to provoke him she was never so happy as when we were all scolding her at once and she defying us with her bold saucy look and her ready words turning religious curses into ridicule baiting me and doing just what her father hated how her pretended insolence which he thought real had more power over heathcliff than his kindness how the boy would do her bidding in anything and his only when it suited his own inclination after behaving as badly as possible all day she sometimes came fondling to make it up at night nay cathy the old man would say i cannot love thee worse than thy brother go say thy prayers child and ask pardon i doubt thy mother and i must rue that we ever reared thee that made her cry at first and then being repulsed continually hardened her and she laughed if i told her to say she was sorry for her faults and beg to be forgiven 
 but the hour came at last that ended mr troubles on earth he died quietly in his chair one october evening seated by the fireside a high wind blustered round the house and roared in the chimney it sounded wild and stormy yet it was not cold and we were all a little removed from the hearth busy at my knitting and joseph reading his bible near the table for the servants generally sat in the house then after their work was done miss cathy had been sick and that made her still she leant against her knee and heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap i remember the master before he fell into a doze stroking her bonny hair it pleased him rarely to see her canst thou not always be a good lass cathy and she turned her face up to his and laughed and answered why cannot you always be a good man father but as soon as she saw him vexed again she kissed his hand and said she would sing him to sleep she began singing very low till his fingers dropped from hers and his head sank on his breast then i told her to hush and not stir for fear she should wake him we all kept as mute as mice a full and should have done longer only joseph having finished his chapter got up and said that he must rouse the master for prayers and bed he stepped forward and called him by name and touched his shoulder but he would not move so he took the candle and looked at him i thought there was something wrong as he set down the light and seizing the children each by an arm whispered them to frame upstairs and make little might pray alone that had summut to do 
 i shall bid father good night first said catherine putting her arms round his neck before we could hinder her the poor thing discovered her loss screamed dead heathcliff dead and they both set up a cry 
 i joined my wail to theirs loud and bitter but joseph asked what we could be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven he told me to put on my cloak and run to gimmerton for the doctor and the parson i could not guess the use that either would be of then however i went through wind and rain and brought one the doctor back with me the other said he would come in the morning leaving joseph to explain matters i ran to the room their door was ajar i saw they had never laid down though it was past midnight but they were calmer and did not need me to console them the little souls were comforting each other with better thoughts than i could have hit on no parson in the world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did in their innocent talk and while i sobbed and listened i could not help wishing we were all there safe together

 chapter five 
 
 what in the world are you going to do now jo asked 
 meg one snowy afternoon as her sister came tramping through the hall in rubber boots old sack and hood with a broom in one hand and a shovel in the other 
 going out for exercise answered jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes 
 i should think two long walks this morning would have been enough cold and dull out and i advise you to stay warm and dry by the fire as i do said meg with a shiver 
 never take advice keep still all day and not being a pussycat i like to doze by the fire i like adventures and going to find some 
 meg went back to toast her feet and read ivanhoe and jo began to dig paths with great energy the snow was light and with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden for beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls needed air now the garden separated the marches house from that of mr laurence both stood in a suburb of the city which was still countrylike with groves and lawns large gardens and quiet streets a low hedge parted the two estates on one side was an old brown house looking rather bare and shabby robbed of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers which then surrounded it on the other side was a stately stone mansion plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury from the big coach house and grounds to the conservatory and the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains 
 yet it seemed a lonely lifeless sort of house for no children frolicked on the lawn no motherly face ever smiled at the windows and few people went in and out except the old gentleman and his grandson 
 to lively fancy this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted palace full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed she had long wanted to behold these hidden glories and to know the laurence boy who looked as if he would like to be known if he only knew how to begin since the party she had been more eager than ever and had planned many ways of making friends with him but he had not been seen lately and jo began to think he had gone away when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window looking wistfully down into their garden where beth and amy were one another 
 that boy is suffering for society and fun she said to herself his grandpa does not know good for him and keeps him shut up all alone he needs a party of jolly boys to play with or somebody young and lively a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so 
 the idea amused jo who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing meg by her queer performances the plan of going over was not forgotten and when the snowy afternoon came jo resolved to try what could be done she saw mr lawrence drive off and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge where she paused and took a survey all quiet curtains down at the lower windows servants out of sight and nothing human visible but a curly black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window 
 there he is thought jo poor boy all alone and sick this dismal day a shame toss up a snowball and make him look out and then say a kind word to him 
 up went a handful of soft snow and the head turned at once showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute as the big eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile jo nodded and laughed and flourished her broom as she called out 
 how do you do are you sick 
 laurie opened the window and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven 
 better thank you had a bad cold and been shut up a week 
 sorry what do you amuse yourself with 
 nothing dull as tombs up here 
 you read 
 not much they let me 
 somebody read to you 
 grandpa does sometimes but my books interest him and i hate to ask brooke all the time 
 have someone come and see you then 
 there anyone like to see boys make such a row and my head is weak 
 there some nice girl read and amuse you girls are quiet and like to play nurse 
 know any 
 you know us began jo then laughed and stopped 
 so i do will you come please cried laurie 
 not quiet and nice but come if mother will let me go ask her shut the window like a good boy and wait till i come 
 with that jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house wondering what they would all say to her laurie was in a flutter of excitement at the idea of having company and flew about to get ready for as mrs march said he was a little gentleman and did honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate putting on a fresh color and trying tidy up the room which in spite of half a dozen servants was anything but neat presently there came a loud ring than a decided voice asking for mr laurie and a surprised looking servant came running up to announce a young lady 
 all right show her up miss jo said laurie going to the door of his little parlor to meet jo who appeared looking rosy and quite at her ease with a covered dish in one hand and three kittens in the other 
 here i am bag and baggage she said briskly mother sent her love and was glad if i could do anything for you meg wanted me to bring some of her blancmange she makes it very nicely and beth thought her cats would be comforting i knew laugh at them but i refuse she was so anxious to do something 
 it so happened that funny loan was just the thing for in laughing over the kits laurie forgot his bashfulness and grew sociable at once 
 that looks too pretty to eat he said smiling with pleasure as jo uncovered the dish and showed the blancmange surrounded by a garland of green leaves and the scarlet flowers of pet geranium 
 it anything only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it tell the girl to put it away for your tea so simple you can eat it and being soft it will slip down without hurting your sore throat what a cozy room this is 
 it might be it it was kept nice but the maids are lazy and i know how to make them mind it worries me though 
 right it up in two minutes for it only needs to have the hearth brushed the things made straight on the mantelpiece the books put here and the bottles there and your sofa turned from the light and the pillows plumped up a bit now then fixed 
 and so he was for as she laughed and talked jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room laurie watched her in respectful silence and when she beckoned him to his sofa he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction saying gratefully 
 how kind you are yes what it wanted now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company 
 no i came to amuse you shall i read aloud and jo looked affectionately toward some inviting books near by 
 thank you read all those and if you mind rather talk answered laurie 
 not a bit talk all day if only set me going beth says i never know when to stop 
 is beth the rosy one who stays at home good deal and sometimes goes out with a little basket asked laurie with interest 
 yes beth my girl and a regular good one she is too 
 the pretty one is meg and the one is amy i believe 
 laurie colored up but answered frankly why you see i often hear you calling to one another and when alone up here i help looking over at your house you always seem to be having such good times i beg your pardon for being so rude but sometimes you forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are and when the lamps are lighted like looking at a picture to see the fire and you all around the table with your mother her face is right opposite and it looks so sweet behind the flowers i help watching it i got any mother you know and laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control 
 the solitary hungry look in his eyes went straight to warm heart she had been so simply taught that there was no nonsense in her head and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank as any child laurie was sick and lonely and feeling how rich she was in home and happiness she gladly tried to share it with him her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said 
 never draw that curtain any more and i give you leave to look as much as you like i just wish though instead of peeping come over and see us mother is so splendid do you heaps of good and beth would sing to you if i begged her to and amy would dance meg and i would make you laugh over our funny stage properties and have jolly times your grandpa let you 
 i think he would if your mother asked him very kind though he does not look so and he lets me do what i like pretty much only afraid i might be a bother to strangers began laurie brightening more and more 
 we are not strangers we are neighbors and you think be a bother we want to know you and been trying to do it this ever so long we been here a great while you know but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you 
 you see grandpa lives among his books and mind much what happens outside mr brooke my tutor stay here you know and i have no one to go about with me so i just stop at home and get on as i can 
 bad you ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked then have plenty of friends andpleasant places to go to never mind being bashful it last long if you keep going 
 laurie turned red again but offended at being accused of bashfulness for there was so much good will in jo it was impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were meant 
 do you like your school asked the boy changing the subject after a little pause during which he stared at the fire and jo looked about her well pleased 
 go to school a i mean i go to wait on my and a dear cross old soul she is too answered jo 
 laurie opened his mouth to ask another question but remembering just in time that it manners to make too many inquiries into affairs he shut it again and looked uncomfortable 
 jo liked his good breeding and mind having a laugh at aunt march so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety old lady her fat poodle the parrot that talked spanish and the library where she reveled 
 laurie enjoyed that immensely and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo aunt march and in the middle of a fine speech how poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter 
 oh that does me no end of good tell on please he said taking his face out of the sofa cushion red and shining with merriment 
 much elated with her success jo did tell on all about their plays and plans their hopes and fears for father and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived then they got to talking about books and to delight she found that laurie loved them as well as she did and had read even more than herself 
 if you like them so much come down and see ours grandfather is out so you be afraid said laurie getting up 
 not afraid of anything returned jo with a toss of the head 
 i believe you are exclaimed the boy looking at her with much admiration though he privately thought she would have good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman if she met hem in some of his moods 
 the atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike laurie led the way from room to room letting jo stop to examine whatever struck her fancy and so at last they came to the library where she clapped her hands and pranced as she always did when especially delighted it was lined with books and there were pictures and statues and distracting little cabinets full of coins and curiosities and sleepy hollow chairs and queer tables and bronzes and best of all a great open fireplace with quaint tiles all round it 
 what richness sighed jo sinking into the depth of a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction theodore laurence you ought to be the happiest boy in the added impressively 
 a fellow live on books said laurie shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite 
 before he could more a bell rang and jo flew up exclaiming with alarm mercy me your grandpa 
 well what if it is you are not afraid of anything you know returned the boy looking wicked 
 i think i am a little bit afraid of him but i know why i should be marmee said i might come and i think any the worse for it said jo composing herself though she kept her eyes on the door 
 a great deal better for it and ever so much obliged only afraid you are very tired of talking to me it was so pleasant i bear to stop said laurie gratefully 
 the doctor to see you sir and the maid beckoned as she spoke 
 would you mind if i left you for a minute i suppose i must see him said laurie 
 mind me happy as a cricket here answered jo 
 laurie went away and his guest amused herself in her own way she was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again and without turning she said decidedly sure now that i be afraid of him for got kind eyes though his mouth is grim and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of hisown he as handsome as my grandfather but i like him 
 thank you said a gruff voice behind her and there to her great dismay stood old mr laurence 
 poor jo blushed till she blush any redder and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said for a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her but that was cowardly and the girls would laugh at her so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could a second look showed her that the living eyes under the bushy eyebrows were kinder even than the painted ones and there was a sly twinkle in them which lessened her fear a good deal the gruff voice was gruffer than ever as the old gentleman said abruptly after the dreadful pause so not afraid of me hey 
 not much sir 
 and you think me as handsome as your grandfather 
 not quite sir 
 and got a tremendous will have i 
 i only said i thought so 
 but you like me in spite of it 
 yes i do sir 
 that answer pleased the old gentleman he gave a short laugh shook hands with her and putting his finger under her chin turned up her face examined it gravely and let it go saying with a nod got your spirit if you his face he was a fine man my dear but what is better he was a brave and an honest one and i was proud to be his friend 
 thank you sir and jo was quite comfortable after that for it suited her exactly 
 what have you been doing to this boy of mine hey was the next question sharply put 
 only trying to be neighborly sir and jo to how her visit came about 
 you think he needs cheering up a bit do you 
 yes sir he seems a little lonely and young folks would do him good perhaps we are only girls but we should be glad to help if we could for we forget the splendid christmas present you sent us said jo eagerly 
 tut tut tut that was the affair how is the poor woman 
 doing nicely sir and off went jo talking very fast as she told all about the hummels in whom her mother had interested richer friends than they were 
 just her way of doing good i shall come and see your mother some fine day tell her so the tea bell we have it early on the account come down and go on being neighborly 
 if like to have me sir 
 ask you if i and mr laurence offered her his arm with courtesy 
 what would meg say to this thought jo as she was marched away while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling the story at home 
 hey why what the dickens has come to the fellow said the old gentleman as laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather 
 i know come sir he began as jo gave him a triumphant little glance 
 evident by the way you racket downstairs come to your tea sir and behave like a gentleman and having pulled the hair by way of a caress mr laurence walked on while laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their backs which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from jo 
 the old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea but he watched the young people who soon chatted away like old friends and the change in his grandson did not escape him there was color light and life in the face now vivacity in his manner and genuine merriment in his laugh 
 right the lad is lonely see what these little girls can do for him thought mr laurence as he looked and listened he liked jo for her odd blunt ways suited him and she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had been one herself 
 if the laurences had been what jo called prim and poky she would not have got on at all for such people always made her shy and awkward but finding them free and easy she was so herself and made a good impression when they rose she proposed to go but laurie said he had something more to show her and took her away to the conservatory which had been lighted for her benefit it seemed quite fairylike to jo as she went up and down the walks enjoying the blooming walls on either side the soft light the damp sweet air and the wonderful vines and trees that hung about her while her new friend cut the finest flowers till his hands were full then he tied them up saying with the happy look jo liked to see please give these to your mother and tell her i like the medicine she sent me very much 
 they found mr laurence standing before the fire in the great drawing room by attention was entirely absorbed by a grand piano which stood open 
 do you play she asked turning to laurie with a respectful expression 
 sometimes he answered modestly 
 please do now i want to hear it so i can tell beth 
 you first 
 know how too stupid to learn but i love music dearly 
 so laurie played and jo listened with her nose luxuriously buried in heliotrope and tea roses her respect and regard for the laurence boy increased very much for he played remarkably well and put on any airs she wished beth could hear him but she did not say so only praised him till he was quite abashed and his grandfather came to his rescue 
 that will do that will do young lady too many sugarplums are not good for him his music bad but i hope he will do as well in more important things going well much obliged to you and i hope come again my respects to your mother good night doctor jo 
 he shook hands kindly but looked as if something did not please him when they got into the hall jo asked laurie if she had said something amiss he shook his head 
 no it was me he like to hear me play 
 why not 
 tell you some day john is going home with you as i 
 no need of that i am not a young lady and only a step take care of yourself you 
 yes but you will come again i hope 
 if you promise to come and see us after you are well 
 i will 
 good night laurie 
 good night jo good night 
 when all the adventures had been told the family felt inclined to go visiting in a body for each found something very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge mrs march wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had not forgotten him meg longed to walk in the conservatory beth sighed for the grand piano and amy was eager to see the fine pictures and statues 
 mother why mr laurence like to have laurie play asked jo who was of an inquiring disposition 
 i am not sure but i think it was because his son father married an italian lady a musician which displeased the old man who is very proud the lady was good and lovely and accomplished but he did not like her and never saw his son after he married they both died when laurie was a little child and then his grandfather took him home i fancy the boy who was born in italy is not very strong and the old man is afraid of losing him which makes him so careful laurie comes naturally by his love of music for he is like his mother and i dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician at any rate his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like and so he glowered as jo said 
 dear me how romantic exclaimed meg 
 how silly said jo let him be a musician if he wants to and not plague his life out sending him to college when he hates to go 
 why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners i suppose italians are always nice said meg who was a little sentimental 
 what do you know about his eyes and his manners you never spoke to him hardly cried jo who was not sentimental 
 i saw him at the party and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave that was a nice little speech about the medicine mother sent him 
 he meant the blanc mange i suppose how stupid you are child he meant you of course 
 did he and jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before 
 i never saw such a girl you know a compliment when you get it said meg with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter 
 i think they are great nonsense and thank you not to be silly and spoil my fun a nice boy and i like him and i have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish all be good to him because he got any mother and he may come over and see us he marmee 
 yes jo your little friend is very welcome and i hope meg will remember that children should be children as long as they can 
 i call myself a child and not in my teens yet observed amy what do you say beth 
 i was thinking about our progress answered beth who had not heard a word how we got out of the slough and through the wicket gate by resolving to be good and up the steep hill by trying and that maybe the house over there full of splendid things is going to be our palace beautiful 
 we have got to get by the lions first said jo as if she rather liked the prospect

 egyptologist 
 feni 
 the three diggers pull hard the ancient seams start to give 
 the egyptologist yells again the diggers pull harder the 
 compartment starts to loosen again he yells the diggers 
 give one final pull and 
 an intense burst of liquid sprays out of the seam hits the 
 three diggers melts their skin clean off they scream dying 
 horribly half skeletal by the time they hit the ground 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 the dust is starting to clear evelyn and jonathan 
 slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement 
 we immediately recognize it as imhotepis sarcophagus 
 evelyn 
 oh my god it looks like 
 it looks like a sarcophagus 
 
 why would they bury somebody 
 in the ceiling 
 evelyn 
 they they buried him 
 at the foot of anubis he was 
 either someone of great importance 
 or he did something very naughty 
 int scarab chamber day 
 the warden drops an into his pouch then 
 prying away at another it rips off he drops 
 it into his pouch only he misses and this scarab quietly 
 falls to the sandy floor without the warden noticing 
 close on the scarab on the floor it begins to transform 
 the amethyst starts to glow something inside starts to 
 wiggle as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon 
 then it splits open and a real live hideous 
 scurries out it races over to the shoe quickly 
 burrows into the leather and vanishes inside 
 the eyes fly open he starts to scream drops his 
 knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg 
 higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a 
 large hideous lump burrowing under his skin it burrows 
 way up his fat belly and across his hairy chest the 
 warden claws and scratches at it trying to stop it the lump 
 burrows up his neck the warden starts gagging and coughing 
 and then the vanishes into his head 
 int imhotepis chamber day 
 our heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus 
 revealing a single ominous hieroglyph evelyn stares at it 
 jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid 
 jonathan 
 well who is it 
 evelyn stares at the hieroglyph confused and concerned 
 evelyn 
 he that shall not be named 
 dusts off the huge lock 
 
 some sort of lock here 
 you say these are made 
 of granite with a steel interior 
 evelyn 
 quarried granite with a cobalt lining 
 jonathan 
 in here sure 
 getting out 
 
 no kiddin without a key 
 take us a month to crack this thing 
 evelyn 
 a key it what he 
 was talking about 
 
 who was talking about what 
 evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on back 
 evelyn 
 the man on the barge the one 
 with the hook he was looking 
 for a key 
 evelyn pulls out the jonathan tries to take it back 
 jonathan 
 hey mine 
 evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box now 
 shaped exactly like the keyhole evelyn smiles and 
 when they hear the screams echoing through 
 the labyrinth all three of them turn and running 
 int labyrinth day 
 the warden is screaming and dancing insanely around the 
 labyrinth totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head 
 evelyn and jonathan run up just as the warden 
 starts ripping his own hair out of his head and 
 jonathan grab at the hands but far too crazed 
 he shoves them aside runs full bore down the length of the 
 labyrinth and slams his head straight into a rock wall the 
 warden drops to the ground dead as lead eyes wide open 
 evelyn and jonathan just stand there staring 
 breathing hard themselves 
 ext base camp night 
 evelyn and jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire 
 evelyn 
 what do you suppose killed him 
 jonathan 
 did you ever see him eat 
 comes up over some rocks 
 
 seems the americans had a little 
 misadventure of their own today 
 three of their diggers were killed 
 evelyn 
 how 
 
 salt acid pressurized salt acid 
 some sort of ancient 
 jonathan 
 maybe this place really is cursed 
 a gust of wind blows through the camp the campfire flickers 
 and jonathan share a nervous look evelyn laughs 
 evelyn 
 two 
 
 believe in curses huh 
 evelyn 
 no i believe if i can see it 
 and i can touch it then 
 real what i believe 
 cocks his rifle gives her a big grin 
 
 i believe in being prepared 
 jonathan opens the pouch the one that held the 
 scarabs he reaches in starts scrounging around we slowly 
 push in waiting for the attack the music builds and then 
 jonathan screams in pain and rips his hand back out of the 
 pouch and evelyn both jump 
 
 what what is it 
 jonathan sucks his finger then reaches back into the pouch 
 and pulls out a liquor bottle the top has been chipped off 
 jonathan 
 seagrams 
 jonathan smiles at the bottle then turns the pouch inside 
 out and shakes it nothing but sand is inside it 
 jonathan 
 well he may have been a stinky 
 he had good taste 
 jonathan takes a swig and evelyn laugh guiltily 
 and then suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear to 
 the sand evelyn and jonathan watch him a beat and then a 
 barage of gunfire is heard coming from the american camp 
 jumps up and throws the elephant gun to evelyn 
 
 stay here 
 he takes off running through the ruins evelyn immediately 
 gets up and runs after him jonathan grabs a gun holds the 
 bottle of seagrams tight and dashes after her 
 jonathan

 the toil of trace and trail 
 
 
 thirty days from the time it left dawson the salt water mail with buck and his mates at the fore arrived at skaguay they were in a wretched state worn out and worn down one hundred and forty pounds had dwindled to one hundred and fifteen the rest of his mates though lighter dogs had relatively lost more weight than he pike the malingerer who in his lifetime of deceit had often successfully feigned a hurt leg was now limping in earnest was limping and dub was suffering from a wrenched shoulder blade 
 they were all terribly footsore no spring or rebound was left in them their feet fell heavily on the trail jarring their bodies and doubling the fatigue of a travel there was nothing the matter with them except that they were dead tired it was not the dead tiredness that comes through brief and excessive effort from which recovery is a matter of hours but it was the dead tiredness that comes through the slow and prolonged strength drainage of months of toil there was no power of recuperation left no reserve strength to call upon it had been all used the last least bit of it every muscle every fiber every cell was tired dead tired and there was reason for it in less than five months they had traveled hundred miles during the last eighteen hundred of which they had but five days rest when they arrived at skaguay they were apparently on their last legs they could barely keep the traces taut and on the down grades just managed to keep out of the way of the sled 
 mush on poor sore feets the driver encouraged them as they tottered down the main street of skaguay dis is de last den we get one long rest eh for sure one bully long rest 
 the drivers confidently expected a long stopover themselves they had covered twelve hundred miles with two days rest and in the nature of reason and common justice they deserved an interval of loafing but so many were the men who had rushed into the klondike and so many were the sweethearts wives and kin that had not rushed in that the congested mail was taking on alpine proportions also there were official orders fresh batches of hudson bay dogs were to take the places of those worthless for the trail the worthless ones were to be got rid of and since dogs count for little against dollars they were to be sold 
 three days passed by which time buck and his mates found how really tired and weak they were then on the morning of the fourth day two men from the states came along and bought them harness and all for a song the men addressed each other as hal and charles charles was a lightish colored man with weak and watery eyes and a mustache that twisted fiercely and vigorously up giving the lie to the limply drooping lip it concealed hal was a youngster of nineteen or twenty with a big revolver and a hunting knife strapped about him on a belt that fairly bristled with cartridges this belt was the most salient thing about him it advertised his callowness sheer and unutterable both men were manifestly out of place and why such as they should adventure the north is part of the mystery of things that passes understanding 
 buck heard the chaffering saw the money pass between the man and the government agent and knew that the scotch and the drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of perrault and francois and the others who had gone before when driven with his mates to the new owners camp buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair tent dishes unwashed everything in disorder also he saw a woman mercedes the men called her she was wife and nice family party 
 buck watched them apprehensively as they proceeded to take down the tent and load the sled there was a great deal of effort about their manner but no businesslike method the tent was rolled into an awkward bundle three times as large as it should have been the tin dishes were packed away unwashed mercedes continually fluttered in the way of her men and kept up an unbroken chattering of remonstrance and advice when they put a on the front of the sled she suggested it should go on the back and when they had it put on the back and covered it over with a couple of the bundles she discovered overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else but in that very sack and they unloaded again 
 three men from a neighboring tent came out and looked on grinning and winking at one another 
 got a right smart load as it is said one of them and its not me should tell you your business but i tote that tent along if i was you 
 undreamed of cried mercedes throwing up her hands in dainty dismay however in the world could i manage without a tent 
 springtime and you get any more cold weather the man replied 
 she shook her head decidedly and charles and hal put the last odds and ends on top the mountainous load 
 think ride one of the men asked 
 why it charles demanded rather shortly 
 oh all right all right the man hastened meekly to say i was just a wondering that is all it seemed a mite 
 charles turned his back and drew the lashings down as well as he could which was not in the least well 
 and of course the dogs can hike along all day with that contraption behind them affirmed a second of the men 
 certainly said hal with freezing politeness taking hold of the with one hand and swinging his whip from the other mush he shouted mush on there 
 the dogs sprang against the breastbands strained hard for a few moments then relaxed they were unable to move the sled 
 the lazy brutes show them he cried preparing to lash out at them with the whip 
 but mercedes interfered crying oh hal you as she caught hold of the whip and wrenched it from him the poor dears now you must promise you be harsh with them for the rest of the trip or i go a step 
 precious lot you know about dogs her brother sneered and i wish leave me alone lazy i tell you and got to whip them to get anything out of them their way you ask anyone ask one of those men 
 mercedes looked at them imploringly untold repugnances at sight of pain written in her pretty face 
 weak as water if you want to know came the reply from one of the men plum tuckered out the matter they need a rest 
 rest be blanked said hal with his beardless lips and mercedes said oh in pain and sorrow at the oath 
 but she was a clannish creature and rushed at once to the defense of her brother never mind that man she said pointedly driving our dogs and you do what you think best with them 
 again whip fell upon the dogs they threw themselves against the breastbands dug their feet into the packed snow got down low to it and put forth all their strength the sled held as though it were an anchor after two efforts they stood still panting the whip was whistling savagely when once more mercedes interfered she dropped on her knees before buck with tears in her eyes and put her arms around his neck 
 you poor poor dears she cried sympathetically why you pull hard then you be whipped buck did not like her but he was feeling too miserable to resist her taking it as a part of the miserable work 
 one of the onlookers who had been clenching his teeth to suppress hot speech now spoke up 
 not that i care a whoop what becomes of you but for the dogs sakes i just want to tell you you can help them a mighty lot by breaking out that sled the runners are froze fast throw your weight against the right and left and break it out 
 a third time the attempt was made but this time following the advice hal broke out the runners which had been frozen to the snow the overloaded and unwieldy sled forged ahead buck and his mates struggling frantically under the rain of blows a hundred yards ahead the path turned and sloped steeply into the main street it would have required an experienced man to keep the sled upright and hal was not such a man as they swung on the turn the sled went over spilling half its load through the loose lashings the dogs never stopped the lightened sled bounded on its side behind them they were angry because of the ill treatment they had received and the unjust load buck was raging he broke into a run the team following his lead hal cried whoa whoa but they gave no heed he tripped and was pulled off his feet the capsized sled ground over him and the dogs dashed on up the street adding to the gaiety of skaguay as they scattered the remainder of the outfit along its chief thoroughfare 
 citizens caught the dogs and gathered up the scattered belongings also they gave advice half the load and twice the dogs if they ever expected to reach dawson was what was said hal and his sister and listened unwillingly pitched tent and overhauled the outfit canned goods were turned out that made men laugh for canned goods on the long trail is a thing to dream about blankets for a hotel quoth one of the men who laughed and helped half as many is too much get rid of them throw away that tent and all those going to wash them anyway good lord do you think traveling on a pullman 
 and so it went the inexorable elimination of the superfluous mercedes cried when her were dumped on the ground and article after article was thrown out she cried in general and she cried in particular over each discarded thing she clasped hands about knees rocking back and forth she averred she would not go an inch not for a dozen charleses she appealed to everybody and to everything finally wiping her eyes and proceeding to cast out even articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries and in her zeal when she had finished with her own she attacked the belongings of her men and went through them like a tornado 
 this accomplished the outfit though cut in half was still a formidable bulk charles and hal went out in the evening and bought six outside dogs they added to the six of the original team and teek and koona the huskies obtained at the rink rapids on the record trip brought the team up to fourteen but the outside dogs though practically broken in since their landing did not amount to much three were pointers one was a newfoundland and the other two were mongrels of indeterminate breed they did not seem to know anything these newcomers buck and his comrades looked upon them with disgust and though he speedily taught them their places and what not to do he could not teach them what to do they did not take kindly to trace and trail with the exception of the two mongrels they were bewildered and by the strange savage environment in which they found themselves and by the ill treatment they had received the two mongrels were without spirit at all bones were the only things breakable about them 
 with the newcomers hopeless and forlorn and the old team worn out by hundred miles of continuous trail the outlook was anything but bright the two men however were quite cheerful and they were proud too they were doing the thing in style with fourteen dogs they had seen other sleds depart over the pass for dawson or come in from dawson but never had they seen a sled with so many as fourteen dogs in the nature of arctic travel there was a reason why fourteen dogs should not drag one sled and that was that one sled could not carry the food for fourteen dogs but charles and hal did not know this they had worked the trip out with a pencil so much to a dog so many dogs and so many days mercedes looked over their shoulders and nodded comprehensively it was all so very simple 
 late next morning buck led the long team up the street there was nothing lively about it no snap or go in him and his fellows they were starting dead weary four times he had covered the distance between salt water and dawson and the knowledge that jaded and tired he was facing the same trail once more made him bitter his heart was not in the work nor was the heart of any dog the outsiders were timid and frightened the insiders without confidence in their masters 
 buck felt vaguely that there was no depending upon these two men and the woman they did not know how to do anything and as the days went by it became apparent that they could not learn they were slack in all things without order or discipline it took them half the night to pitch a slovenly camp and half the morning to break that camp and get the sled loaded in fashion so slovenly that for the rest of the day they were occupied in stopping and rearranging the load some days they did not make ten miles on other days they were unable to get started at all and on no day did they succeed in making more than half the distance used by the men as a basis in their computation 
 it was inevitable that they should go short on dog food but they hastened it by overfeeding bringing the day nearer when underfeeding would commence the outsider dogs whose digestions had not been trained by chronic famine to make the most of little had voracious appetites and when in addition to this the huskies pulled weakly hal decided that the orthodox ration was too small he doubled it and to cap it all when mercedes with tears in her pretty eyes and a quaver in her throat could not cajole him into giving the dogs still more she stole from the and fed them slyly but is was not food that buck and the huskies needed but rest and though they were making poor time the heavy load they dragged sapped their strength severely 
 then came the underfeeding hal awoke one day to the fact that his dog food was and the distance only quarter covered further that for love or money no additional dog food was to be obtained so he cut down even the orthodox ration and tried to increase the travel his sister and seconded him but they were frustrated by their heavy outfit and their own incompetence it was a simple matter to give the dogs less food but it was impossible to make the dogs travel faster while their own inability to get under way earlier in the morning prevented them from traveling longer hours not only did they not know how to work dogs but they did not know how to work themselves 
 the first to go was dub poor blundering thief that he was always getting caught and punished he had none the less been a faithful worker his wrenched untreated and unrested went from bad to worse till finally hal shot him with the big revolver it is a saying of the country that an outside dog starves to death on the ration of the husky so the six outside dogs under buck could do no less than die on half the ration of the husky the newfoundland went first followed by the three pointers the two mongrels hanging more grittily on to life but going in the end 
 by this time all the amenities and gentleness of the southland had fallen away from the three people shorn of its glamour and romance arctic travel became to them a reality too harsh for their manhood and womanhood mercedes ceased weeping over the dogs being too occupied with weeping over herself and with quarreling with her husband and brother to quarrel was the one thing they were never too weary to do their irritability arose out of their misery increased with it doubled upon it it the wonderful patience of the trail which comes to men who toil hard and suffer sore and remain sweet of speech and kindly did not come to these two men and the woman they had no inkling of such a patience they were stiff and in pain their muscles ached their bones ached their very hearts ached and because of this they became sharp of speech and hard words were first on their lips in the morning and last at night 
 charles and hal wrangled whenever mercedes gave them a chance it was the cherished belief of each that he did more than his share of the work and neither forbore to speak this belief at every opportunity sometimes mercedes sided with her husband sometimes with her brother the result was a beautiful and unending family quarrel starting from a dispute as to which should chop a few sticks for the fire a dispute which concerned only charles and hal presently would be lugged in the rest of the family fathers mothers uncles cousins people thousands of miles away and some of them dead that views on art or the sort of society plays his brother wrote should have anything to do with the chopping of a few sticks of firewood passes comprehension nevertheless the quarrel was as likely to tend in that direction as in the direction of political prejudices and that tongue should be relevant to the building of a yukon fire was apparent only to mercedes who disburdened herself of copious opinions upon that topic and incidentally upon a few other traits unpleasantly peculiar to her family in the meantime the fire remained unbuilt the camp and the dogs unfed 
 mercedes nursed a special grievance of sex she was pretty and soft and had been chivalrously treated all her days but the present treatment by her husband and brother was everything save chivalrous it was her custom to be helpless they complained upon which impeachment of what to her was her most essential sex prerogative she made their lives unendurable she no longer considered the dogs and because she was sore and tired she persisted in riding in the sled she was pretty and soft but she weighed one hundred and twenty lusty last straw to the load dragged by the weak and starving animals she rode for days till they fell in the traces and the sled stood still charles and hal begged her to get off and walk pleaded with her entreated the while she wept and importuned heaven with a recital of their brutality 
 on one occasion they took her off the sled by main strength they never did it again she let her legs go limp like a spoiled child and sat down on the trail they went on their way but she did not move after they had traveled three miles they unloaded the sled came back for her and by main strength put her on the sled again 
 in the excess of their own misery they were callous to the suffering of their animals theory which he practiced on others was that one must get hardened he had started out preaching it to his sister and failing there he hammered it into the dogs with a club at the five fingers the dog food gave out and a toothless old squaw offered to trade them a few pounds of frozen horsehide for the revolver that kept the big hunting knife company at hip a poor substitute for food was this hide just as it had been stripped from the starved horses of the cattlemen six months back in its frozen state it was more like strips of galvanized iron and when a dog wrestled it into his stomach it thawed into thin and unnutritious leathery strings and into a mass of short hair irritating and indigestible 
 and through it all buck staggered along at the head of the team as in a nightmare he pulled when he could when he could no longer pull he fell down and remained down till blows from whip or club drove him to his feet again all the stiffness and gloss had gone out of his beautiful furry coat the hair hung down limp and draggled or matted with dried blood where club had bruised him his muscles had wasted away to knotty strings and the flesh pads had disappeared so that each rib and every bone in his frame were outlined cleanly through the loose hide that was wrinkled in folds of emptiness it was heartbreaking only heart was unbreakable the man in the red sweater had proved that 
 as it was with buck so was it with his mates they were perambulating skeletons there were seven all together including him in their very great misery they had become insensible to the bite of the lash or the bruise of the club the pain of the beating was dull and distant just as the things their eyes saw and their ears heard seemed dull and distant they were not or they were simply so many bags of bones in which sparks of life fluttered faintly when a halt was made they dropped down in the traces like dead dogs and the spark dimmed and paled and seemed to go out and when the club or whip fell upon them the spark fluttered feebly up and they tottered to their feet and staggered on 
 there came a day when billee the fell and could not rise hal had traded off his revolver so he took the axe and knocked billee on the head as he lay in the traces then cut the carcass out of the harness and dragged it to one side buck saw and his mates saw and they knew that this thing was very close to them on the next day koona went and but five of them remained joe too far gone to be malignant pike crippled and limping only and not conscious enough longer to malinger the still faithful to the toil of trace and trail and mournful in that he had so little strength with which to pull teek who had not traveled so far that winter and who was now beaten more than the others because he was fresher and buck still at the head of the team but no longer enforcing discipline or striving to enforce it blind with weakness half the time and keeping the trail by the loom of it and by the dim feel of his feet 
 it was beautiful spring weather but neither dogs nor humans were aware of it each day the sun rose earlier and set later it was dawn by three in the morning and twilight lingered till nine at night the whole long day was a blaze of sunshine the ghostly winter silence had given way to the great spring murmur of awakening life this murmur arose from all the land fraught with the joy of living it came from the things that lived and moved again things which had been as dead and which had not moved during the long months of frost the sap was rising in the pines the willows and aspens were bursting out in young buds shrubs and vines were putting on fresh garbs of green crickets sang in the nights and in the days all manner of creeping crawling things rustled forth into the sun partridges and woodpeckers were booming and knocking in the forest squirrels were chattering birds singing and overhead honked the wild fowl driving up from the south in cunning wedges that split the air 
 from every hill slope came the trickle of water the music of unseen fountains all things were thawing bending snapping the yukon was straining to break loose the ice that bound it down it ate away from beneath the sun ate from above formed fissures sprang and spread apart while thin sections of ice fell through bodily into the river and amid all this bursting rending throbbing of awakening life under the blazing sun and through the breezes like wayfarers to death staggered the two men the woman and the huskies 
 with the dogs falling mercedes weeping and riding hal swearing innocuously and charles eyes wistfully watering they staggered into john camp at the mouth of the white river when they halted the dogs dropped down as though they had all been struck dead mercedes dried her eyes and looked at john thornton charles sat down on a log to rest he sat down very slowly and painstakingly what of his great stiffness hal did the talking john thornton was whittling the last touches on an he had made from a stick of birch he whittled and listened gave monosyllabic replies and when it was asked terse advice he knew the breed and he gave his advice in the certainty that it would not be followed 
 they told us up above that the bottom was dropping out of the trail and that the best thing for us to do was to lay over hal said in response to warning to take no more chances on the rotten ice they told us we make white river and here we are this last with a sneering ring of triumph in it 
 and they told you true john thornton answered the likely to drop out at any moment only fools with the blind luck of fools could have made it i tell you straight i risk my carcass on that ice for all the gold in alaska 
 because not a fool i suppose said hal all the same go on to dawson he uncoiled his whip get up there buck hi get up there mush on 
 thornton went on whittling it was idle he knew to get between a fool and his folly while two or three fools more or less would not alter the scheme of things 
 but the team did not get up at the command it had long since passed into the stage where blows were required to rouse it the whip flashed out here and there on its merciless errands john thornton compressed his lips was the first to crawl to his feet teek followed joe came next yelping with pain pike made painful efforts twice he fell over when and on the third attempt managed to rise buck made no effort he lay quietly where he had fallen the lash bit into him again and again but he neither whined nor struggled several times thornton started as though to speak but changed his mind a moisture came into his eyes and as the whipping continued he arose and walked irresolutely up and down 
 this was the first time buck had failed in itself a sufficient reason to drive hal into a rage he exchanged the whip for the customary club buck refused to move under the rain of heavier blows which now fell upon him like his mates he was barely able to get up but unlike them he had made up his mind not to get up he had a vague feeling of impending doom this had been strong upon him when he pulled into the bank and it had not departed from him what of the thin and rotten ice he had felt under his feet all day it seemed that he sensed disaster close at hand out there ahead on the ice where his master was trying to drive him he refused to stir so greatly had he suffered and so far gone was he that the blows did not hurt much and as they continued to fall upon him the spark of life within flickered and went down it was nearly out he felt strangely numb as though from a great distance he was aware that he was being beaten the last sensations of pain left him he no longer felt anything though very faintly he could hear the impact of the club upon his body but it was no longer his body it seemed so far away 
 and then suddenly without warning uttering a cry that was inarticulate and more like the cry of an animal john thornton sprang upon the man who wielded the club hal was hurled backward as though struck by a falling tree mercedes screamed charles looked on wistfully wiped his watery eyes but did not get up because of his stiffness 
 john thornton stood over buck struggling to control himself too convulsed with rage to speak 
 if you strike that dog again kill you he at last managed to say in a choking voice 
 my dog hal replied wiping the blood from his mouth as he came back get out of my way or fix you going to dawson 
 thornton stood between him and buck and evinced no intention of getting out of the way hal drew his long hunting knife mercedes screamed cried laughed and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria thornton rapped knuckles with the knocking the knife to the ground he rapped his knuckles again as he tried to pick it up then he stooped picked it up himself and with two strokes cut traces 
 hal had no fight left in him besides his hands were full with his sister or his arms rather while buck was too near dead to be of further use in hauling the sled a few minutes later they pulled out from the bank and down the river buck heard them go and raised his head to see pike was leading was at the wheel and between were joe and teek they were limping and staggering mercedes was riding the loaded sled hal guided at the and charles stumbled along in the rear 
 as buck watched them thornton knelt beside him and with rough kindly hands searched for broken bones by the time his search had disclosed nothing more than many bruises and a state of terrible starvation the sled was a quarter of a mile away dog and man watched it crawling along over the ice suddenly they saw its back end drop down as into a rut and the with hal clinging to it jerk into the air mercedes scream came to their ears they saw charles turn one step to run back sand then a whole section of ice give way and dogs and humans disappear a yawning hole was all that was to be seen the bottom had dropped out of the trail 
 you poor devil said john thornton and buck licked his hand

lionfish nov chapter five the whomping willowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the end of the summer vacation came too quickly for liking he was looking forward to getting back to hogwarts but his month at the burrow had been the happiest of his life it was difficult not to feel jealous of ron when he thought of the dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on privet drive 
 
 on their last evening mrs weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of favorite things ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding fred and george rounded off the evening with a display of filibuster fireworks they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed 
 
 it took a long while to get started next morning they were up at dawn but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do mrs weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills people kept colliding on the stairs with bits of toast in their hands and mr weasley nearly broke his neck tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying trunk to the car 
 
 harry see how eight people six large trunks two owls and a rat were going to fit into one small ford anglia he had reckoned of course without the special features that mr weasley had added 
 
 not a word to molly he whispered to harry as he opened the trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily 
 
 when at last they were all in the car mrs weasley glanced into the back seat where harry ron fred george and percy were all sitting comfortably side by side and said muggles do know more than we give them credit for they she and ginny got into the front seat which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench i mean never know it was this roomy from the outside would you 
 
 mr weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard harry turning back for a last look at the house he barely had time to wonder when see it again when they were back george had forgotten his box of filibuster fireworks five minutes after that they skidded to a halt in the yard so that fred could run in for his broomstick they had almost reached the highway when ginny shrieked that left her diary by the time she had clambered back into the car they were running very late and tempers were running high 
 
 mr weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife 
 
 molly dear 
 
 no arthur 
 
 no one would see this little button here is an invisibility booster i installed get us up in the air then we fly above the clouds be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser 
 
 i said no arthur not in broad daylight 
 
 they reached cross at a quarter to eleven mr weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station 
 
 harry had caught the hogwarts express the previous year the tricky part was getting onto platform nine and which visible to the muggle eye what you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten it hurt but it had to be done carefully so that none of the muggles noticed you vanishing 
 
 percy first said mrs weasley looking nervously at the clock overhead which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier 
 
 percy strode briskly forward and vanished mr weasley went next fred and george followed 
 
 take ginny and you two come right after us mrs weasley told harry and ron grabbing hand and setting off in the blink of an eye they were gone 
 
 go together only got a minute ron said to harry 
 
 harry made sure that cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier he felt perfectly confident this nearly as uncomfortable as using floo powder both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier gathering speed a few feet away from it they broke into a run and 
 
 crash 
 
 both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward trunk fell off with a loud thump harry was knocked off his feet and cage bounced onto the shiny floor and she rolled away shrieking indignantly people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled what in blazes think doing 
 
 lost control of the trolley harry gasped clutching his ribs as he got up ron ran to pick up hedwig who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd 
 
 why we get through harry hissed to ron 
 
 i dunno 
 
 ron looked wildly around a dozen curious people were still watching them 
 
 going to miss the train ron whispered i understand why the sealed itself 
 
 harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach ten seconds nine seconds 
 
 he wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might the metal remained solid 
 
 three seconds two seconds one second 
 
 gone said ron sounding stunned the left what if mum and dad get back through to us have you got any muggle money 
 
 harry gave a hollow laughed the dursleys given me pocket money for about six years 
 
 ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier 
 
 hear a thing he said tensely we going to do i know how long take mum and dad to get back to us 
 
 they looked around people were still watching them mainly because of continuing screeches 
 
 i think better go and wait by the car said harry attracting too much atten 
 
 harry said ron his eyes gleaming the car 
 
 what about it 
 
 we can fly the car to hogwarts 
 
 but i thought 
 
 stuck right and got to get to school we and even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if a real emergency section nineteen or something of the restriction of thingy 
 
 but your mum and dad said harry pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way how will they get home 
 
 they need the car said ron impatiently they know how to apparate you know just vanish and reappear at home they only bother with floo powder and the car because all underage and not allowed to apparate yet 
 
 feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement 
 
 can you fly it 
 
 no problem said ron wheeling his trolley around to face the exit go if we hurry be able to follow the hogwarts express 
 
 and they marched off through the crowd of curious muggles out of the station and back onto the side road where the old ford anglia was parked 
 
 ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand they heaved their luggage back in put hedwig on the back seat and got into the front 
 
 check that no watching said ron starting the ignition with another tap of his wand harry stuck his head out of the window traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead but their street was empty 
 
 okay he said 
 
 ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard the car around them vanished and so did they harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him hear the engine feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose but for all he could see he had become a pair of eyeballs floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars 
 
 go said voice from his right 
 
 and the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away dropping out of sight as the car rose in seconds the whole of london lay smoky and glittering below them 
 
 then there was a popping noise and the car harry and ron reappeared 
 
 said ron jabbing at the invisibility booster faulty 
 
 both of them pummeled it the car vanished then it flickered back again 
 
 hold on ron yelled and he slammed his foot on the accelerator they shot straight into the low woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy 
 
 now what said harry blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides 
 
 we need to see the train to know what direction to go in said ron 
 
 dip back down again quickly 
 
 they dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats squinting at the ground 
 
 i can see it harry yelled right ahead there 
 
 the hogwarts express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake 
 
 due north said ron checking the compass on the dashboard okay just have to check on it every half hour or so hold on 
 
 and they shot up through the clouds a minute later they burst out into a blaze of sunlight 
 
 it was a different world the wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud the sky a bright endless blue under the blinding white sun 
 
 all got to worry about now are airplanes said ron 
 
 they looked at each other and started to laugh for a long time they stop 
 
 it was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream this thought harry was surely the only way to travel past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud in a car full of hot bright sunlight with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment and the prospect of seeing and jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of hogwarts castle 
 
 they made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view london was soon far behind them replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide purplish moors a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants villages with tiny toy churches 
 
 several uneventful hours later however harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off the toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink he and ron had pulled off their sweaters but was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose he had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below where you could buy pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch why they been able to get onto platform nine and 
 
 be much further can it croaked ron hours later still as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud staining it a deep pink ready for another check on the train 
 
 it was still right below them winding its way past a snowcapped mountain it was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds 
 
 ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again but as he did so the engine began to whine 
 
 harry and ron exchanged nervous glances 
 
 probably just tired said ron never been this far before 
 
 and they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker stars were blossoming in the blackness harry pulled his sweater back on trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly as though in protest 
 
 not far said ron more to the car than to harry not far now and he patted the dashboard nervously 
 
 when they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew 
 
 there harry shouted making ron and hedwig jump straight ahead 
 
 silhouetted on the dark horizon high on the cliff over the lake stood the many turrets and towers of hogwarts castle 
 
 but the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed 
 
 come on ron said cajolingly giving the steering wheel a little shake nearly there come on 
 
 the engine groaned narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake 
 
 the car gave a nasty wobble glancing out of his window harry saw the smooth black glassy surface of the water a mile below knuckles were white on the steering wheel the car wobbled again 
 
 come on ron muttered 
 
 they were over the lake the castle was right ahead ron put his foot down 
 
 there was a loud clunk a splutter and the engine died completely 
 
 said ron into the silence 
 
 the nose of the car dropped they were falling gathering speed heading straight for the solid castle wall 
 
 noooooo ron yelled swinging the steering wheel around they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc soaring over the dark greenhouses then the vegetable patch and then out over the black lawns losing altitude all the time 
 
 ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket 
 
 stop stop he yelled whacking the dashboard and the windshield but they were still plummeting the ground flying up toward them 
 
 watch out for that tree harry bellowed lunging for the steering wheel but too late 
 
 crunch 
 
 with an earsplitting bang of metal on wood they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood hedwig was shrieking in terror a lump was throbbing on head where he had hit the windshield and to his right ron let out a low despairing groan 
 
 are you okay harry said urgently 
 
 my wand said ron in a shaky voice look at my wand 
 
 it had snapped almost in two the tip was dangling limply held on by a few splinters 
 
 harry opened his mouth to say he was sure be able to mend it up at the school but he never even got started at that very moment something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull sending him lurching sideways into ron just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof 
 
 happen 
 
 ron gasped staring through the windshield and harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it the tree they had hit was attacking them its trunk was bent almost double and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach 
 
 aaargh said ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof which seemed to be caving in 
 
 run for it ron shouted throwing his full weight against his door but next second he had been knocked backward into lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch 
 
 done for he moaned as the ceiling sagged but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating the engine had restarted 
 
 reverse harry yelled and the car shot backward the tree was still trying to hit them they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up lashing out at them as they sped out of reach 
 
 that panted ron was close well done car 
 
 the car however had reached the end of its tether with two sharp clunks the doors flew open and harry felt his seat tip sideways next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk cage flew through the air and burst open she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look then dented scratched and steaming the car rumbled off into the darkness its rear lights blazing angrily 
 
 come back ron yelled after it brandishing his broken wand kill me 
 
 but the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust 
 
 can you believe our luck said ron miserably bending down to pick up scabbers of all the trees we hit we had to get one that hits back 
 
 he glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree which was still flailing its branches threateningly 
 
 come on said harry wearily better get up to the school 
 
 it at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured stiff cold and bruised they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope toward the great oak front doors 
 
 i think the already started said ron dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window hey harry come and look the sorting 
 
 harry hurried over and together he and ron peered in at the great hall 
 
 innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long crowded tables making the golden plates and goblets sparkle overhead the bewitched ceiling which always mirrored the sky outside sparkled with stars 
 
 through the forest of pointed black hogwarts hats harry saw a long line of first years filing into the hall ginny was among them easily visible because of her vivid weasley hair meanwhile professor mcgonagall a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun was placing the famous hogwarts sorting hat on a stool before the newcomers 
 
 every year this aged old hat patched frayed and dirty sorted new students into the four hogwarts houses gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin harry well remembered putting it on exactly one year ago and waiting petrified for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear for a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in slytherin the house that had turned out more dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in gryffindor along with ron hermione and the rest of the weasleys last term harry and ron had helped gryffindor win the house championship beating slytherin for the first time in seven years 
 
 a very small boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head eyes wandered past him to where professor dumbledore the headmaster sat watching the sorting from the staff table his long silver beard and glasses shining brightly in the candlelight several seats along harry saw gilderoy lockhart dressed in robes of aquamarine and there at the end was hagrid huge and hairy drinking deeply from his goblet 
 
 hang on harry muttered to ron an empty chair at the staff table snape 
 
 professor severus snape was least favorite teacher harry also happened to be least favorite student cruel sarcastic and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house slytherin snape taught potions 
 
 maybe ill said ron hopefully 
 
 maybe left said harry because he missed out on the defense against dark arts job again 
 
 or he might have been sacked said ron enthusiastically i mean everyone hates him 
 
 or maybe said a very cold voice right behind them waiting to hear why you two arrive on the school train 
 
 harry spun around there his black robes rippling in a cold breeze stood severus snape he was a thin man with sallow skin a hooked nose and greasy black hair and at this moment he was smiling in a way that told harry he and ron were in very deep trouble 
 
 follow me said snape 
 
 not daring even to look at each other harry and ron followed snape up the steps into the vast echoing entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches a delicious smell of food was wafting from the great hall but snape led them away from the warmth and light down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons 
 
 in he said opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing 
 
 they entered office shivering the shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars in which floated all manner of revolting things harry really want to know the name of at the moment the fireplace was dark and empty snape closed the door and turned to look at them 
 
 so he said softly the train good enough for the famous harry potter and his faithful sidekick weasley wanted to arrive with a bang did we boys 
 
 no sir it was the barrier at cross it 
 
 silence said snape coldly what have you done with the car ron gulped this the first time snape had given harry the impression of being able to read minds but a moment later he understood as snape unrolled issue of the evening prophet you were seen he hissed showing them the headline flying ford anglia mystifies muggles he began to read aloud two muggles in london convinced they saw an old car flying over the post office tower at noon in norfolk mrs hetty bayliss while hanging out her washing mr angus fleet of peebles reported to police six or seven muggles in all i believe your father works in the misuse of muggle artifacts office he said looking up at ron and smiling still more nastily dear dear his own son 
 
 harry felt as though just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad larger branches if anyone found out mr weasley had bewitched the car he thought of that 
 
 i noticed in my search of the park that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable whomping willow snape went on 
 
 that tree did more damage to us than we ron blurted out 
 
 silence snapped snape again most unfortunately you are not in my house and the decision to expel you does not rest with me i shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power you will wait here 
 
 harry and ron stared at each other harry feel hungry any more he now felt extremely sick he tried not to look at a large slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind desk if snape had gone to fetch professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house they were hardly any better off she might be fairer than snape but she was still extremely strict 
 
 ten minutes later snape returned and sure enough it was professor mcgonagall who accompanied him harry had seen professor mcgonagall angry on several occasions but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go or he had never seen her this angry before she raised her wand the moment she entered harry and ron both flinched but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace where flames suddenly erupted 
 
 sit she said and they both backed into chairs by the fire 
 
 explain she said her glasses glinting ominously 
 
 ron launched into the story starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through 
 
 so we had no choice professor we get on the train 
 
 why you send us a letter by owl i believe you have an owl professor mcgonagall said coldly to harry 
 
 harry gaped at her now she said it that seemed the obvious thing to have done 
 
 i i think 
 
 that said professor mcgonagall is obvious 
 
 there was a knock on the office door and snape now looking happier than ever opened it there stood the headmaster professor dumbledore 
 
 whole body went numb dumbledore was looking unusually grave he stared down his very crooked nose at them and harry suddenly found himself wishing he and ron were still being beaten up by the whomping willow 
 
 there was a long silence then dumbledore said please explain why you did this 
 
 it would have been better if he had shouted harry hated the disappointment in his voice for some reason he was unable to look dumbledore in the eyes and spoke instead to his knees he told dumbledore everything except that mr weasley owned the bewitched car making it sound as though he and ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station he knew dumbledore would see through this at once but dumbledore asked no questions about the car when harry had finished he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles 
 
 go and get our stuff said ron in a hopeless sort of voice 
 
 what are you talking about weasley barked professor mcgonagall 
 
 well expelling us you said ron 
 
 harry looked quickly at dumbledore 
 
 not today mr weasley said dumbledore but i must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done i will be writing to both your families tonight i must also warn you that if you do anything like this again i will have no choice but to expel you 
 
 snape looked as though christmas had been canceled he cleared his throat and said professor dumbledore these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree surely acts of this nature 
 
 it will be for professor mcgonagall to decide on these severus said dumbledore calmly they are in her house and are therefore her responsibility he turned to professor mcgonagall i must go back to the feast minerva got to give out a few notices come severus a custard tart i want to sample 
 
 snape shot a look of pure venom at harry and ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office leaving them alone with professor mcgonagall who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle 
 
 better get along to the hospital wing weasley bleeding 
 
 not much said ron hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve 
 
 professor i wanted to watch my sister being sorted 
 
 the sorting ceremony is over said professor mcgonagall your sister is also in gryffindor 
 
 oh good said ron 
 
 and speaking of gryffindor professor mcgonagall said sharply but harry cut in professor when we took the car term started so so gryffindor really have points taken from it should it he finished watching her anxiously 
 
 professor mcgonagall gave him a piercing look but he was sure she had almost smiled her mouth looked less thin anyway 
 
 i will not take any points from gryffindor she said and heart lightened considerably but you will both get a detention it was better than harry had expected as for writing to the dursleys that was nothing harry knew perfectly well just be disappointed that the whomping willow squashed him flat 
 
 professor mcgonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at desk a large plate of sandwiches two silver goblets and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop 
 
 you will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory she said i must also return to the feast 
 
 when the door had closed behind her ron let out a long low whistle 
 
 i thought had it he said grabbing a sandwich 
 
 so did i said harry taking one too 
 
 can you believe our luck though said ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham fred and george flown that car five or six times and no muggle ever saw them he swallowed and took another huge bite why we get through the barrier 
 
 harry shrugged have to watch our step from now on though he said taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice wish we gone up to the feast 
 
 she want us showing off said ron sagely want people to think clever arriving by flying car 
 
 when they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could the plate kept refilling itself they rose and left the office treading the familiar path to gryffindor tower the castle was quiet it seemed that the feast was over they walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to gryffindor tower was hidden behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress 
 
 password she said as they approached 
 
 er said harry 
 
 they know the new password not having met a gryffindor prefect yet but help came almost immediately they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see hermione dashing toward them 
 
 there you are where have you been the most ridiculous rumors someone said been expelled for crashing a flying car 
 
 well we been expelled harry assured her 
 
 not telling me you did fly here said hermione sounding almost as severe as professor mcgonagall 
 
 skip the lecture said ron impatiently and tell us the new password 
 
 wattlebird said hermione impatiently but not the point 
 
 her words were cut short however as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping it looked as though the whole of gryffindor house was still awake packed into the circular common room standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs waiting for them to arrive arms reached through the portrait hole to pull harry and ron inside leaving hermione to scramble in after them 
 
 brilliant yelled lee jordan inspired what an entrance flying a car right into the whomping willow be talking about that one for years 
 
 good for you said a fifth year harry had never spoken to someone was patting him on the back as though just won a marathon fred and george pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together why come in the car eh 
 
 ron was scarlet in the face grinning embarrassedly but harry could see one person who look happy at all percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off harry nudged ron in the ribs and nodded in direction ron got the point at once 
 
 got to get upstairs bit tired he said and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories 
 
 night harry called back to hermione who was wearing a scowl just like 
 
 they managed to get to the other side of the common room still having their backs slapped and gained the peace of the staircase they hurried up it right to the top and at last reached the door of their old dormitory which now had a sign on it saying second years they entered the familiar circular room with its five hung with red velvet and its high narrow windows their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds 
 
 ron grinned guiltily at harry 
 
 i know i enjoyed that or anything but 
 
 the dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year gryffindor boys seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom 
 
 unbelievable beamed seamus 
 
 cool said dean 
 
 amazing said neville awestruck 
 
 harry help it he grinned too 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter five the dementorcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 tom woke harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea harry got dressed and was just persuading a disgruntled hedwig to get back into her cage when ron banged his way into the room pulling a sweatshirt over his head and looking irritable 
 
 the sooner we get on the train the better he said at least i can get away from percy at hogwarts now accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of penelope clearwater you know ron grimaced his girlfriend hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy 
 
 got something to tell you harry began but they were interrupted by fred and george who had looked in to congratulate ron on infuriating percy again 
 
 they headed down to breakfast where mr weasley was reading the front page of the daily prophet with a furrowed brow and mrs weasley was telling hermione and ginny about a love potion made as a young girl all three of them were rather giggly 
 
 what were you saying ron asked harry as they sat down 
 
 later harry muttered as percy stormed in 
 
 harry had no chance to speak to ron or hermione in the chaos of leaving they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the leaky narrow staircase and piling them up near the door with hedwig and hermes screech owl perched on top in their cages a small wickerwork basket stood beside the heap of trunks spitting loudly 
 
 all right crookshanks hermione cooed through the wickerwork let you out on the train 
 
 you snapped ron what about poor scabbers eh 
 
 he pointed at his chest where a large lump indicated that scabbers was curled up in his pocket 
 
 mr weasley who had been outside waiting for the ministry cars stuck his head inside 
 
 here he said harry come on 
 
 mr weasley marched harry across the short stretch of pavement toward the first of two dark green cars each of which was driven by a wizard wearing a suit of emerald velvet 
 
 in you get harry said mr weasley glancing up and down the crowded street 
 
 harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by hermione ron and to disgust percy 
 
 the journey to cross was very uneventful compared with trip on the knight bus the ministry of magic cars seemed almost ordinary though harry noticed that they could slide through gaps that uncle new company car certainly have managed they reached cross with twenty minutes to spare the ministry drivers found them trolleys unloaded their trunks touched their hats in salute to mr weasley and drove away somehow managing to jump to the head of an unmoving line at the traffic lights 
 
 mr weasley kept close to elbow all the way into the station 
 
 right then he said glancing around them do this in pairs as there are so many of us go through first with harry 
 
 mr weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten pushing trolley and apparently very interested in the intercity that had just arrived at platform nine with a meaningful look at harry he leaned casually against the barrier harry imitated him 
 
 in a moment they had fallen sideways through the solid metal onto platform nine and and looked up to see the hogwarts express a scarlet steam engine puffing smoke over a platform packed with witches and wizards seeing their children onto the train 
 
 percy and ginny suddenly appeared behind harry they were panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run 
 
 ah penelope said percy smoothing his hair and going pink again ginny caught eye and they both turned away to hide their laughter as percy strode over to a girl with long curly hair walking with his chest thrown out so that she miss his shiny badge 
 
 once the remaining weasleys and hermione had joined them harry and mr weasley led the way to the end of the train past packed compartments to a carriage that looked quite empty they loaded the trunks onto it stowed hedwig and crookshanks in the luggage rack then went back outside to say goodbye to mr and mrs weasley 
 
 mrs weasley kissed all her children then hermione and finally harry he was embarrassed but really quite pleased when she gave him an extra hug 
 
 do take care you harry she said as she straightened up her eyes oddly bright then she opened her enormous handbag and said made you all sandwiches here you are ronno not corned beef fred fred here you are dear 
 
 harry said mr weasley quietly come over here for a moment 
 
 he jerked his head towards a pillar and harry followed him behind it leaving the others crowded around mrs weasley 
 
 something got to tell you before you leave said mr weasley in a tense voice 
 
 all right mr weasley said harry i already know 
 
 you know how could you know 
 
 i er i heard you and mrs wesley talking last night i help hearing harry added quickly sorry 
 
 not the way have chosen for you to find out said mr weasley looking anxious 
 
 no honestly ok this way you broken your word to fudge and i know going on 
 
 harry you must be scared 
 
 not said harry sincerely really he added because mr weasley was looking disbelieving not trying to be a hero but seriously sirius black be worse than lord voldemort can he 
 
 mr weasley flinched at the sound of the name but overlooked it 
 
 harry i knew you were well made of stronger stuff than fudge seems to think and obviously pleased that not scared but 
 
 arthur called mrs weasley who was now shepherding the rest onto the train arthur what are you doing about to go 
 
 coming molly said mr weasley but he turned back to harry and kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice listen i want you to give me your word 
 
 that be a good boy and stay in the castle said harry gloomily 
 
 not entirely said mr weasley who looked more serious than harry had ever seen him harry swear to me you go looking for black 
 
 harry stared what 
 
 there was a loud whistle guards were walking along the train slamming all the doors shut 
 
 promise me harry said mr weasley talking more quickly still that whatever happens 
 
 why would i go looking for someone i know wants to kill me said harry blankly 
 
 swear to me that whatever you might hear 
 
 arthur quickly cried mrs weasley 
 
 steam was billowing from the train it had started to move harry ran to the compartment door and ron threw it open and stood back to let him on they leaned out of the window and waved at mr and mrs weasley until the train turned a corner and blocked them from view 
 
 i need to talk to you in private harry muttered to ron and hermione as the train picked up speed 
 
 go away ginny said ron 
 
 oh nice said ginny huffily and she stalked off 
 
 harry ron and hermione set off down the corridor looking for an empty compartment but all were full except for the one at the very end of the train 
 
 this had only one occupant a man sitting fast asleep next to the window harry ron and hermione checked on the threshold the hogwarts express was usually reserved for students and they had never seen an adult there before except for the witch who pushed the food cart 
 
 the stranger was wearing an extremely shabby set of robes that had been darned in several places he looked ill and exhausted though quite young his light brown hair was flecked with gray 
 
 who reckon he is ron hissed as they sat down and slid the door shut taking the seats farthest away from the window 
 
 professor r j lupin whispered hermione at once 
 
 you know that 
 
 on his case she replied pointing at the luggage rack over the head where there was a small battered case held together with a large quantity of neatly knotted string the name professor r j lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling letters 
 
 wonder what he teaches said ron frowning at professor pallid profile 
 
 obvious whispered hermione only one vacancy there defense against the dark arts 
 
 harry ron and hermione had already had two defense against the dark arts teachers both of whom had lasted only one year there were rumors that the job was jinxed 
 
 well i hope up to it said ron doubtfully he looks like on good hex would finish him off he anyway he turned to harry what were you going to tell us 
 
 harry explained all about mr and mrs argument and the warning mr weasley had just given him when finished ron looked thunderstruck and hermione had her hands over her mouth she finally lowered them to say sirius black escaped to come after you oh have to be really really careful go looking for trouble harry 
 
 i go looking for trouble said harry nettled trouble usually finds me 
 
 how thick would harry have to be to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him said ron shakily 
 
 they were taking the news worse than harry had expected both ron and hermione seemed to be much more frightened of black than he was 
 
 no one knows how he got out of azkaban said ron uncomfortably no ever done it before and he was a prisoner too 
 
 but catch him they said hermione earnestly i mean got all the muggles looking out for him too 
 
 that noise said ron suddenly 
 
 a faint tinny sort of whistle was coming from somewhere they looked all around the compartment 
 
 coming from your trunk harry said ron standing up and reaching into the luggage rack a moment later he had pulled the pocket sneakoscope out from between robes it was spinning very fast in the palm of hand and glowing brilliantly 
 
 is that a sneakoscope said hermione interestedly standing up for a better look 
 
 yeahmind you a very cheap one ron said it went haywire just as i was tying it to leg to send it to harry 
 
 were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time said hermione shrewdly 
 
 no welli supposed to be using errol you know not really up to long journeysbut how else was i supposed to get present to him 
 
 stick it back in the trunk harry advised as the sneakoscope whistled piercingly or wake him up 
 
 he nodded toward professor lupin ron stuffed the sneakoscope into a particularly horrible pair of uncle old socks which deadened the sound then closed the lid of the trunk on it 
 
 we could get it checked in hogsmeade said ron sitting back down they sell that sort of thing in dervish and banges magical instruments and stuff fred and george told me 
 
 do you know much about hogsmeade asked hermione keenly read the only entirely settlement in britain 
 
 yeah i think it is said ron in an offhand sort of way but not why i want to go i just want to get inside honeydukes 
 
 that said hermione 
 
 this sweetshop said ron a dreamy look coming over his face where got everythingpepper imps they make you smoke at the mouth and great fat chocoballs full of strawberry mousse and clotted cream and really excellent sugar quills which you can suck in class and just look like thinking what to write nextc 
 
 but a very interesting place it hermione pressed on eagerly in sites of historical sorcery it says the inn was the headquarters for the goblin rebellion and the shrieking supposed to be the most severely haunted building in britain 
 
 c and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few inches off the ground while sucking them said ron who was plainly not listening to a word hermione was saying 
 
 hermione looked around at harry 
 
 it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore hogsmeade 
 
 spect it will said harry heavily have to tell me when found out 
 
 what mean said ron 
 
 i go the dursleys sign my permission form and fudge either 
 
 ron looked horrified 
 
 not allowed to come but no way mcgonagall or someone will give you permission 
 
 harry gave a hollow laugh professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house was very strict 
 
 c or we can ask fred and george they know every secret passage out of the castle 
 
 ron said hermione sharply i think harry should be sneaking out of the school with black on the loose 
 
 yeah i expect what mcgonagall will say when i ask of permission said harry bitterly 
 
 but if with him said ron spiritedly to hermione black dare 
 
 oh ron talk rubbish snapped hermione already murdered a whole bunch of people in the middle of a crowded street do you really think going to worry about attacking harry just because there 
 
 she was fumbling with the straps of basket as she spoke 
 
 let that thing out ron said but too late crookshanks leapt lightly from the basket stretched yawned and sprang onto knees the lump in pocket trembled and he shoved crookshanks angrily away 
 
 get out of it 
 
 ron said hermione angrily 
 
 ron was about to answer back when professor lupin stirred they watched him apprehensively but he simply turned his head the other way mouth slightly open and slept on 
 
 the hogwarts express moved steadily north and the scenery outside the window became wilder and darker while the clouds overhead thickened overhead people were chasing backwards and forwards past the door of their compartment crookshanks had now settled in an empty seat his squashed face turned towards ron his yellow eyes on top pocket 
 
 at one the plump witch with the food cart arrived at the compartment door 
 
 think we should wake him up ron asked awkwardly nodding towards professor lupin he looks like he could do with some food 
 
 hermione approached professor lupin cautiously 
 
 er professor she said excuse me professor 
 
 he move 
 
 worry dear said the witch as she handed a large stack of cauldron cakes if hungry when he wakes be up front with the driver 
 
 i suppose he is asleep said ron quietly as the witch slid the compartment door closed i mean he died has he 
 
 no no breathing whispered hermione taking the cauldron cake harry passed her 
 
 he might not be very good company but professor presence in their compartment had its uses just as it had started to rain blurring the rolling hills outside the window they heard footsteps outside in the corridor again and their three least favorite people appeared at the door draco malfoy flanked by his cronies vincent crabbe and gregory goyle 
 
 draco malfoy and harry had been enemies ever since they had met on their very first journey to hogwarts malfoy who had a pale pointed sneering face was in slytherin house he played seeker on the slytherin quidditch team the same position that harry played on the gryffindor team crabbe and goyle seemed to exist to do bidding they were both wide and muscly crabbe was taller with a haircut and a very thick neck goyle had short bristly hair and long gorilla arms 
 
 well look who it is said malfoy in his usual lazy drawl pulling open the compartment door potty and the weasel 
 
 crabbe and goyle chuckled trollishly 
 
 i heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer weasley said malfoy did your mother die of shock 
 
 ron stood up so quickly he knocked basket to the floor professor lupin gave a snort 
 
 that said malfoy taking an automatic step backward as he spotted lupin 
 
 new teacher said harry who got to his feet too in case he needed to hold ron back what were you saying malfoy 
 
 pale eyes narrowed he fool enough to pick a fight right under a nose 
 
 he muttered resentfully to crabbe and goyle and they disappeared 
 
 harry and ron sat down again ron massaging his knuckles 
 
 not going to take any crap from malfoy this year he said angrily i mean it if he makes one more crack about my family going to get hold of his head and 
 
 ron made a violent gesture in midair 
 
 ron hissed hermione pointing at professor lupin be careful 
 
 but professor lupin was still fast asleep 
 
 the rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north the windows were now a solid shimmering gray which gradually darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors and over the luggage racks the train rattled the rain hammered the wind roared but still professor lupin slept 
 
 we must be nearly there said ron leaning forward to look past professor lupin at the now completely black window 
 
 the words had hardly left him when the train started to slow down 
 
 great said ron getting up and walking carefully past professor lupin to try and see outside starving i want to get to the feast 
 
 we be there yet said hermione checking her watch 
 
 so we stopping 
 
 the train was getting slower and slower as the noise of the pistons fell away the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against the windows 
 
 harry who was nearest the door got up to look into the corridor all along the carriage heads were sticking curiously out of their compartments 
 
 the train came to a stop with a jolt and distant thuds and bangs told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks then without warning all the lamps went out and they were plunged into total darkness 
 
 going on said voice from behind harry 
 
 ouch gasped hermione ron that was my foot 
 
 harry felt his way back to his seat 
 
 think broken down 
 
 dunno 
 
 there was a squeaking sound and harry saw the dim black outline of ron wiping a patch clean on the window and peering out 
 
 something moving out there ron said i think people are coming aboard 
 
 the compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell painfully over legs 
 
 sorry know going on ouch sorry 
 
 hullo neville said harry feeling around in the dark and pulling neville up by his cloak 
 
 harry is that you happening 
 
 no idea sit down 
 
 there was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain neville had tried to sit on crookshanks 
 
 going to go and ask the driver going on came voice harry felt her pass him heard the door slide open again and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain 
 
 that 
 
 that 
 
 ginny 
 
 hermione 
 
 what are you doing 
 
 i was looking for ron 
 
 come in and sit down 
 
 not here said harry hurriedly here 
 
 ouch said neville 
 
 quiet said a hoarse voice suddenly 
 
 professor lupin appeared to have woken up at last harry could hear movements in his corner 
 
 none of them spoke 
 
 there was a soft crackling noise and a shivering light filled the compartment professor lupin appeared to be holding a handful of flames they illuminated his tired gray face but his eyes looked alert and wary 
 
 stay where you are he said in the same hoarse voice and he got slowly to his feet with his handful of fire held out in front of him 
 
 but the door slid slowly open before lupin could reach it 
 
 standing in the doorway illuminated by the shivering flames in hand was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling its face was completely hidden beneath its hood eyes darted downward and what he saw made his stomach contract there was a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening grayish and scabbed like something dead that had decayed in water 
 
 but it was visible only for a split second as though the creature beneath the cloak sensed gaze the hand was suddenly withdrawn into the folds of its black cloak 
 
 and then the thing beneath the hood whatever it was drew a long slow rattling breath as though it were trying to suck something more than air from its surroundings 
 
 an intense cold swept over them all harry felt his own breath catch in his chest the cold went deeper than his skin it was inside his chest it was inside his very heart 
 
 eyes rolled up into his head he see he was drowning in cold there was a rushing in his ears as though of water he was being dragged downward the roaring growing louder 
 
 and then from far away he heard screaming terrible terrified pleading screams he wanted to help whoever it was he tried to move his arms but thick white fog was swirling around him inside him 
 
 harry harry are you all right 
 
 someone was slapping his face 
 
 
 
 harry opened his eyes there were lanterns above him and the floor was shaking the hogwarts express was moving again and the lights had come back on he seemed to have slid out of his seat onto the floor ron and hermione were kneeling next to him and above them he could see neville and professor lupin watching harry felt very sick when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on he felt cold sweat on his face 
 
 ron and hermione heaved him back onto his seat 
 
 are you okay ron asked nervously 
 
 yeah said harry looking quickly toward the door the hooded creature had vanished what happened that that thing who screamed 
 
 no one screamed said ron more nervously still 
 
 harry looked around the bright compartment ginny and neville looked back at him both very pale 
 
 but i heard screaming 
 
 a loud snap made them all jump professor lupin was breaking an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces 
 
 here he said to harry handing him a particularly large piece eat it help 
 
 harry took the chocolate but eat it 
 
 what was that thing he asked lupin 
 
 a dementor said lupin who was now giving chocolate to everyone else one of the dementors of azkaban 
 
 everyone stared at him professor lupin crumpled up the empty chocolate wrapper and put it in his pocket 
 
 eat he repeated help i need to speak to the driver excuse me 
 
 he strolled past harry and disappeared into the corridor 
 
 are you sure okay harry said hermione watching harry anxiously 
 
 i get it what happened said harry wiping more sweat off his face 
 
 well that thing the dementor stood there and looked around i mean i think it did i see its face and you you 
 
 i thought you were having a fit or something said ron who still looked scared you went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching 
 
 and professor lupin stepped over you and walked toward the dementor and pulled out his wand said hermione and he said none of us is hiding sirius black under our cloaks go but the dementor move so lupin muttered something and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it and it turned around and sort of glided away 
 
 it was horrible said neville in a higher voice than usual did you feel how cold it got when it came in 
 
 i felt weird said ron shifting his shoulders uncomfortably like never be cheerful again 
 
 ginny who was huddled in her corner looking nearly as bad as harry felt gave a small sob hermione went over and put a comforting arm around her 
 
 but any of you fall off your seats said harry awkwardly 
 
 no said ron looking anxiously at harry again ginny was shaking like mad though 
 
 harry understand he felt weak and shivery as though he were recovering from a bad bout of flu he also felt the beginnings of shame why had he gone to pieces like that when no one else had 
 
 professor lupin had come back he paused as he entered looked around and said with a small smile i poisoned that chocolate you know 
 
 harry took a bite and to his great surprise felt warmth spread suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes 
 
 be at hogwarts in ten minutes said professor lupin are you all right harry 
 
 harry ask how professor lupin knew his name 
 
 fine he muttered embarrassed 
 
 they talk much during the remainder of the journey at long last the train stopped at hogsmeade station and there was a great scramble to get outside owls hooted cats meowed and pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat it was freezing on the tiny platform rain was driving down in icy sheets 
 
 firs years this way called a familiar voice harry ron and hermione turned and saw the gigantic outline of hagrid at the other end of the platform beckoning the new students forward for their traditional journey across the lake 
 
 all right you three hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd they waved at him but had no chance to speak to him because the mass of people around them was shunting them away along the platform harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the school along the platform and out onto a rough mud track where at least a hundred stagecoaches awaited the remaining students each pulled harry could only assume by an invisible horse because when they climbed inside and shut the door the coach set off all by itself bumping and swaying in procession 
 
 the coach smelled faintly of mold and straw harry felt better since the chocolate but still weak ron and hermione kept looking at him sideways as though frightened he might collapse again 
 
 as the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought iron gates flanked with stone columns topped with winged boars harry saw two more towering hooded dementors standing guard on either side a wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again he leaned back into the lumpy seat and closed his eyes until they had passed the gates the carriage picked up speed on the long sloping drive up to the castle hermione was leaning out of the tiny window watching the many turrets and towers draw nearer at last the carriage swayed to a halt and hermione and ron got out 
 
 as harry stepped down a drawling delighted voice sounded in his ear 
 
 you fainted potter is longbottorn telling the truth you actually fainted 
 
 malfoy elbowed past hermione to block way up the stone steps to the castle his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting maliciously 
 
 shove off malfoy said ron whose jaw was clenched 
 
 did you faint as well weasley said malfoy loudly did the scary old dementor frighten you too weasley 
 
 is there a problem said a mild voice professor lupin had just gotten out of the next carriage 
 
 malfoy gave professor lupin an insolent stare which took in the patches on his robes and the dilapidated suitcase with a tiny hint of sarcasm in his voice he said oh no er professor then he smirked at crabbe and goyle and led them up the steps into the castle 
 
 hermione prodded ron in the back to make him hurry and the three of them joined the crowd swarming up the steps through the giant oak front doors into the cavernous entrance hall which was lit with flaming torches and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors 
 
 the door into the great hall stood open at the right harry followed the crowd toward it but had barely glimpsed the enchanted ceiling which was black and cloudy tonight when a voice called potter granger i want to see you both 
 
 harry and hermione turned around surprised professor mcgonagall transfiguration teacher and head of gryffindor house was calling over the heads of the crowd she was a stern looking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun her sharp eyes were framed with square spectacles harry fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding professor mcgonagall had a way of making him feel he must have done something wrong 
 
 no need to look so worried i just want a word in my office she told them move along there weasley 
 
 ron stared as professor mcgonagall ushered harry and hermione away from the chattering crowd they accompanied her across the entrance hall up the marble staircase and along a corridor 
 
 once they were in her office a small room with a large welcoming fire professor mcgonagall motioned harry and hermione to sit down she settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly professor lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train potter 
 
 before harry could reply there was a soft knock on the door and madam pomfrey the nurse came bustling in 
 
 harry felt himself going red in the face it was bad enough that passed out or whatever he had done without everyone making all this fuss 
 
 fine he said i need anything 
 
 oh you is it said madam pomfrey ignoring this and bending down to stare closely at him i suppose been doing something dangerous again 
 
 it was a dementor poppy said professor mcgonagall 
 
 they exchanged a dark look and madam pomfrey clucked disapprovingly 
 
 setting dementors around a school she muttered pushing back hair and feeling his forehead he be the last one who collapses yes all clammy terrible things they are and the effect they have on people who are already delicate 
 
 not delicate said harry crossly 
 
 of course not said madam pomfrey absentmindedly now taking his pulse 
 
 what does he need said professor mcgonagall crisply bed rest should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing 
 
 fine said harry jumping up the thought of what draco malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture 
 
 well he should have some chocolate at the very least said madam pomfrey who was now trying to peer into eyes 
 
 already had some said harry professor lupin gave me some he gave it to all of us 
 
 did he now said madam pomfrey approvingly so finally got a defense against the dark arts teacher who knows his remedies 
 
 are you sure you feel all right potter professor mcgonagall said sharply 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 very well kindly wait outside while i have a quick word with miss granger about her course schedule then we can go down to the feast together 
 
 harry went back into the corridor with madam pomfrey who left for the hospital wing muttering to herself he had to wait only a few minutes then hermione emerged looking very happy about something followed by professor mcgonagall and the three of them made their way back down the marble staircase to the great hall 
 
 it was a sea of pointed black hats each of the long house tables was lined with students their faces glimmering by the light of thousands of candles which were floating over the tables in midair professor flitwick who was a tiny little wizard with a shock of white hair was carrying an ancient hat and a stool out of the hall 
 
 oh said hermione softly missed the sorting 
 
 new students at hogwarts were sorted into houses by trying on the sorting hat which shouted out the house they were best suited to gryffindor ravenclaw hufflepuff or slytherin professor mcgonagall strode off toward her empty seat at the staff table and harry and hermione set off in the other direction as quietly as possible toward the gryffindor table people looked around at them as they passed along the back of the hall and a few of them pointed at harry had the story of his collapsing in front of the dementor traveled that fast 
 
 he and hermione sat down on either side of ron who had saved them seats 
 
 what was all that about he muttered to harry 
 
 harry started to explain in a whisper but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak and he broke off 
 
 professor dumbledore though very old always gave an impression of great energy he had several feet of long silver hair and beard spectacles and an extremely crooked nose he was often described as the greatest wizard of the age but that why harry respected him you help trusting albus dumbledore and as harry watched him beaming around at the students he felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had entered the train compartment 
 
 welcome said dumbledore the candlelight shimmering on his beard welcome to another year at hogwarts i have a few things to say to you all and as one of them is very serious i think it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our excellent feast 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat and continued as you will all be aware after their search of the hogwarts express our school is presently playing host to some of the dementors of azkaban who are here on ministry of magic business 
 
 he paused and harry remembered what mr weasley had said about dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding the school 
 
 they are stationed at every entrance to the grounds dumbledore continued and while they are with us i must make it plain that nobody is to leave school without permission dementors are not to be fooled by tricks or disguises or even invisibility cloaks he added blandly and harry and ron glanced at each other it is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading or excuses i therefore warn each and every one of you to give them no reason to harm you i look to the prefects and our new head boy and girl to make sure that no student runs afoul of the dementors he said 
 
 percy who was sitting a few seats down from harry puffed out his chest again and stared around impressively dumbledore paused again he looked very seriously around the hall and nobody moved or made a sound 
 
 on a happier note he continued i am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year 
 
 first professor lupin who has kindly consented to fill the post of defense against the dark arts teacher 
 
 there was some scattered rather unenthusiastic applause only those who had been in the compartment on the train with professor lupin clapped hard harry among them professor lupin looked particularly shabby next to all the other teachers in their best robes 
 
 look at snape ron hissed in ear 
 
 professor snape the potions master was staring along the staff table at professor lupin it was common knowledge that snape wanted the defense against the dark arts job but even harry who hated snape was startled at the expression twisting his thin sallow face it was beyond anger it was loathing harry knew that expression only too well it was the look snape wore every time he set eyes on harry 
 
 as to our second new appointment dumbledore continued as the lukewarm applause for professor lupin died away well i am sorry to tell you that professor kettleburn our care of magical creatures teacher retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs however i am delighted to say that his place will be filled by none other than rubeus hagrid who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his gamekeeping duties 
 
 harry ron and hermione stared at one another stunned then they joined in with the applause which was tumultuous at the gryffindor table in particular harry leaned forward to see hagrid who was ruby red in the face and staring down at his enormous hands his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard 
 
 we known ron roared pounding the table who else would have assigned us a biting book 
 
 harry ron and hermione were the last to stop clapping and as professor dumbledore started speaking again they saw that hagrid was wiping his eyes on the tablecloth 
 
 well i think everything of importance said dumbledore let the feast begin 
 
 the golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with food and drink harry suddenly ravenous helped himself to everything he could reach and began to eat 
 
 it was a delicious feast the hall echoed with talk laughter and the clatter of knives and forks harry ron and hermione however were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to hagrid they knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him hagrid a fully qualified wizard he had been expelled from hogwarts in his third year for a crime he had not committed it had been harry ron and hermione who had cleared name last year 
 
 at long last when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted from the golden platters dumbledore gave the word that it was time for them all to go to bed and they got their chance 
 
 congratulations hagrid hermione squealed as they reached the teachers table 
 
 all down ter you three said hagrid wiping his shining face on his napkin as he looked up at them can believe itgreat man dumbledorecame straight down to me hut after professor kettleburn said had what i always wanted 
 
 overcome with emotion he buried his face in his napkin and professor mcgonagall shooed them away 
 
 harry ron and hermione joined the gryffindors streaming up the marble staircase and very tired now along more corridors up more and more stairs to the hidden entrance to gryffindor tower where a large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them password 
 
 coming through coming through percy called from behind the crowd the new fortuna major 
 
 oh no said neville longbottom sadly he always had trouble remembering the passwords 
 
 through the portrait hole and across the common room the girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases harry climbed the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was to be back they reached their familiar circular dormitory with its five beds and harry looking around felt he was home at last 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter five weasleys wizard wheezescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry spun faster and faster elbows tucked tightly to his sides blurred fireplaces flashing past him until he started to feel sick and closed his eyes then when at last he felt himself slowing down he threw out his hands and came to a halt in time to prevent himself from falling face forward out of the weasleys kitchen fire 
 
 did he eat it said fred excitedly holding out a hand to pull harry to his feet 
 
 yeah said harry straightening up what was it 
 
 toffee said fred brightly george and i invented them and been looking for someone to test them on all summer 
 
 the tiny kitchen exploded with laughter harry looked around and saw that ron and george were sitting at the scrubbed wooden table with two people harry had never seen before though he knew immediately who they must be bill and charlie the two eldest weasley brothers 
 
 you doing harry said the nearer of the two grinning at him and holding out a large hand which harry shook feeling calluses and blisters under his fingers this had to be charlie who worked with dragons in romania charlie was built like the twins shorter and stockier than percy and ron who were both long and lanky he had a broad face which was and so freckly that he looked almost tanned his arms were muscular and one of them had a large shiny burn on it 
 
 bill got to his feet smiling and also shook hand bill came as something of a surprise harry knew that he worked for the wizarding bank gringotts and that bill had been head boy at hogwarts harry had always imagined bill to be an older version of percy fussy about and fond of bossing everyone around however bill was there was no other word for it cool he was tall with long hair that he had tied back in a ponytail he was wearing an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it clothes would not have looked out of place at a rock concert except that harry recognized his boots to be made not of leather but of dragon hide 
 
 before any of them could say anything else there was a faint popping noise and mr weasley appeared out of thin air at shoulder he was looking angrier than harry had ever seen him 
 
 that funny fred he shouted what on earth did you give that muggle boy 
 
 i give him anything said fred with another evil grin i just dropped was his fault he went and ate it i never told him to 
 
 you dropped it on purpose roared mr weasley you knew eat it you knew he was on a diet 
 
 how big did his tongue get george asked eagerly 
 
 it was four feet long before his parents would let me shrink it 
 
 harry and the weasleys roared with laughter again 
 
 it funny mr weasley shouted that sort of behavior seriously undermines relations i spend half my life campaigning against the mistreatment of muggles and my own sons 
 
 we give it to him because a muggle said fred indignantly 
 
 no we gave it to him because a great bullying git said george he harry 
 
 yeah he is mr weasley said harry earnestly 
 
 not the point raged mr weasley you wait until i tell your mother 
 
 tell me what said a voice behind them 
 
 mrs weasley had just entered the kitchen she was a short plump woman with a very kind face though her eyes were presently narrowed with suspicion 
 
 oh hello harry dear she said spotting him and smiling then her eyes snapped back to her husband tell me what arthur 
 
 mr weasley hesitated harry could tell that however angry he was with fred and george he really intended to tell mrs weasley what had happened there was a silence while mr weasley eyed his wife nervously then two girls appeared in the kitchen doorway behind mrs weasley one with very bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth was and friend hermione granger the other who was small and was younger sister ginny both of them smiled at harry who grinned back which made ginny go scarlet she had been very taken with harry ever since his first visit to the burrow 
 
 tell me what arthur mrs weasley repeated in a dangerous sort of voice 
 
 nothing molly mumbled mr weasley fred and george just but had words with them 
 
 what have they done this time said mrs weasley if got anything to do with weasleys wizard wheezes 
 
 why you show harry where sleeping ron said hermione from the doorway 
 
 he knows where sleeping said ron in my room he slept there last 
 
 we can all go said hermione pointedly 
 
 oh said ron cottoning on right 
 
 yeah come too said george 
 
 you stay where you are snarled mrs weasley 
 
 harry and ron edged out of the kitchen and they hermione and ginny set off along the narrow hallway and up the rickety staircase that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories 
 
 what are weasleys wizard wheezes harry asked as they climbed 
 
 ron and ginny both laughed although hermione 
 
 mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning fred and room said ron quietly great long price lists for stuff invented joke stuff you know fake wands and trick sweets loads of stuff it was brilliant i never knew been inventing all that 
 
 been hearing explosions out of their room for ages but we never thought they were actually making things said ginny we thought they just liked the noise 
 
 only most of the stuff well all of it really was a bit dangerous said ron and you know they were planning to sell it at hogwarts to make some money and mum went mad at them told them they allowed to make any more of it and burned all the order furious at them anyway they get as many as she expected 
 
 were ordinary wizarding levels the examinations hogwarts students took at the age of fifteen 
 
 and then there was this big row ginny said because mum wants them to go into the ministry of magic like dad and they told her all they want to do is open a joke shop 
 
 just then a door on the second landing opened and a face poked out wearing glasses and a very annoyed expression 
 
 hi percy said harry 
 
 oh hello harry said percy i was wondering who was making all the noise trying to work in here you know got a report to finish for the office and rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs 
 
 not thundering said ron irritably walking sorry if disturbed the workings of the ministry of magic 
 
 what are you working on said harry 
 
 a report for the department of international magical cooperation said percy smugly trying to standardize cauldron thickness some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year 
 
 change the world that report will said ron front page of the daily prophet i expect cauldron leaks 
 
 percy went slightly pink 
 
 you might sneer ron he said heatedly but unless some sort of international law is imposed we might well find the market flooded with flimsy products that seriously endanger 
 
 yeah yeah all right said ron and he started off upstairs again percy slammed his bedroom door shut as harry hermione and ginny followed ron up three more flights of stairs shouts from the kitchen below echoed up to them it sounded as though mr weasley had told mrs weasley about the toffees 
 
 the room at the top of the house where ron slept looked much as it had the last time that harry had come to stay the same posters of favorite quidditch team the chudley cannons were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling and the fish tank on the windowsill which had previously held frog spawn now contained one extremely large frog old rat scabbers was here no more but instead there was the tiny gray owl that had delivered letter to harry in privet drive it was hopping up and down in a small cage and twittering madly 
 
 shut up pig said ron edging his way between two of the four beds that had been squeezed into the room fred and george are in here with us because bill and charlie are in their room he told harry percy gets to keep his room all to himself because got to work 
 
 er why are you calling that owl pig harry asked ron 
 
 because being stupid said ginny its proper name is pigwidgeon 
 
 yeah and not a stupid name at all said ron sarcastically ginny named him he explained to harry she reckons sweet and i tried to change it but it was too late he answer to anything else so now pig got to keep him up here because he annoys errol and hermes he annoys me too come to that 
 
 pigwidgeon zoomed happily around his cage hooting shrilly harry knew ron too well to take him seriously he had moaned continually about his old rat scabbers but had been most upset when cat crookshanks appeared to have eaten him 
 
 crookshanks harry asked hermione now 
 
 out in the garden i expect she said he likes chasing gnomes never seen any before 
 
 enjoying work then said harry sitting down on one of the beds and watching the chudley cannons zooming in and out of the posters on the ceiling 
 
 enjoying it said ron darkly i reckon come home if dad make him obsessed just get him onto the subject of his boss according to mr crouchas i was saying to mr crouch mr crouch is of the opinionmr crouch was telling be announcing their engagement any day now 
 
 have you had a good summer harry said hermione did you get our food parcels and everything 
 
 yeah thanks a lot said harry they saved my life those cakes 
 
 and have you heard from ron began but at a look from hermione he fell silent harry knew ron had been about to ask about sirius ron and hermione had been so deeply involved in helping sirius escape from the ministry of magic that they were almost as concerned about godfather as he was however discussing him in front of ginny was a bad idea nobody but themselves and professor dumbledore knew about how sirius had escaped or believed in his innocence 
 
 i think stopped arguing said hermione to cover the awkward moment because ginny was looking curiously from ron to harry shall we go down and help your mum with dinner 
 
 yeah all right said ron the four of them left room and went back downstairs to find mrs weasley alone in the kitchen looking extremely 
 
 eating out in the garden she said when they came in just not room for eleven people in here could you take the plates outside girls bill and charlie are setting up the tables knives and forks please you two she said to ron and harry pointing her wand a little more vigorously than she had intended at a pile of potatoes in the sink which shot out of their skins so fast that they ricocheted off the walls and ceiling 
 
 oh for sake she snapped now directing her wand at a dustpan which hopped off the sideboard and started skating across the floor scooping up the potatoes those two she burst out savagely now pulling pots and pans out of a cupboard and harry knew she meant fred and george i know going to happen to them i really no ambition unless you count making as much trouble as they possibly can 
 
 mrs weasley slammed a large copper saucepan down on the kitchen table and began to wave her wand around inside it a creamy sauce poured from the wand tip as she stirred 
 
 not as though they got brains she continued irritably taking the saucepan over to the stove and lighting it with a further poke of her wand but wasting them and unless they pull themselves together soon be in real trouble had more owls from hogwarts about them than the rest put together if they carry on the way going end up in front of the improper use of magic office 
 
 mrs weasley jabbed her wand at the cutlery drawer which shot open harry and ron both jumped out of the way as several knives soared out of it flew across the kitchen and began chopping the potatoes which had just been tipped back into the sink by the dustpan 
 
 i know where we went wrong with them said mrs weasley putting down her wand and starting to pull out still more saucepans been the same for years one thing after another and they listen to oh not again 
 
 she had picked up her wand from the table and it had emitted a loud squeak and turned into a giant rubber mouse 
 
 one of their fake wands again she shouted how many times have i told them not to leave them lying around 
 
 she grabbed her real wand and turned around to find that the sauce on the stove was smoking 
 
 ron said hurriedly to harry seizing a handful of cutlery from the open drawer go and help bill and charlie 
 
 they left mrs weasley and headed out the back door into the yard 
 
 they had only gone a few paces when ginger cat crookshanks came pelting out of the garden tail held high in the air chasing what looked like a muddy potato on legs harry recognized it instantly as a gnome barely ten inches high its horny little feet pattered very fast as it sprinted across the yard and dived headlong into one of the wellington boots that lay scattered around the door harry could hear the gnome giggling madly as crookshanks inserted a paw into the boot trying to reach it meanwhile a very loud crashing noise was coming from the other side of the house the source of the commotion was revealed as they entered the garden and saw that bill and charlie both had their wands out and were making two battered old tables fly high above the lawn smashing into each other each attempting to knock the out of the air fred and george were cheering ginny was laughing and hermione was hovering near the hedge apparently torn between amusement and anxiety 
 
 table caught with a huge bang and knocked one of its legs off there was a clatter from overhead and they all looked up to see head poking out of a window on the second floor 
 
 will you keep it down he bellowed 
 
 sorry perce said bill grinning the cauldron bottoms coming on 
 
 very badly said percy peevishly and he slammed the window shut chuckling bill and charlie directed the tables safely onto the grass end to end and then with a flick of his wand bill reattached the table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere 
 
 by seven the two tables were groaning under dishes and dishes of mrs excellent cooking and the nine weasleys harry and hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath a clear sky to somebody who had been living on meals of increasingly stale cake all summer this was paradise and at first harry listened rather than talked as he helped himself to chicken and ham pie boiled potatoes and salad 
 
 at the far end of the table percy was telling his father all about his report on cauldron bottoms 
 
 told mr crouch that have it ready by tuesday percy was saying pompously a bit sooner than he expected it but i like to keep on top of things i think be grateful done it in good time i mean its extremely busy in our department just now what with all the arrangements for the world cup just not getting the support we need from the department of magical games and sports ludo bagman 
 
 i like ludo said mr weasley mildly he was the one who got us such good tickets for the cup i did him a bit of a favor his brother otto got into a spot of trouble a lawnmower with unnatural powers i smoothed the whole thing over 
 
 oh likable enough of course said percy dismissively but how he ever got to be head of departmentwhen i compare him to mr crouch i see mr crouch losing a member of our department and not trying to find out happened to them you realize bertha jorkins has been missing for over a month now went on holiday to albania and never came back 
 
 yes i was asking ludo about that said mr weasley frowning he says gotten lost plenty of times before now though must say if it was someone in my department be worried 
 
 oh hopeless all right said percy i hear been shunted from department to department for years much more trouble than worthbut all the same bagman ought to be trying to find her mr crouch has been taking a personal interest she worked in our department at one time you know and i think mr crouch was quite fond of her but bagman just keeps laughing and saying she probably misread the map and ended up in australia instead of albania however percy heaved an impressive sigh and took a deep swig of elderflower wine got quite enough on our plates at the department of international magical cooperation without trying to find members of other departments too as you know got another big event to organize right after the world cup 
 
 percy cleared his throat significantly and looked down toward the end of the table where harry ron and hermione were sitting you know the one talking about father he raised his voice slightly the one 
 
 ron rolled his eyes and muttered to harry and hermione been trying to get us to ask what that event is ever since he started work probably an exhibition of cauldrons 
 
 in the middle of the table mrs weasley was arguing with bill about his earring which seemed to be a recent acquisition 
 
 with a horrible great fang on it really bill what do they say at the bank 
 
 mum no one at the bank gives a damn how i dress as long as i bring home plenty of treasure said bill patiently 
 
 and your getting silly dear said mrs weasley fingering her wand lovingly i wish let me give it a trim 
 
 i like it said ginny who was sitting beside bill so mum anyway nowhere near as long as professor 
 
 next to mrs weasley fred george and charlie were all talking spiritedly about the world cup 
 
 got to be ireland said charlie thickly through a mouthful of potato they flattened peru in the semifinals 
 
 bulgaria has got viktor krum though said fred 
 
 one decent player ireland has got seven said charlie shortly i wish england had got through that was embarrassing that was 
 
 what happened said harry eagerly regretting more than ever his isolation from the wizarding world when he was stuck on privet drive 
 
 went down to transylvania three hundred and ninety to ten said charlie gloomily shocking performance and wales lost to uganda and scotland was slaughtered by luxembourg 
 
 harry had been on the gryffindor house quidditch team ever since his first year at hogwarts and owned one of the best racing brooms in the world a firebolt flying came more naturally to harry than anything else in the magical world and he played in the position of seeker on the gryffindor house team 
 
 mr weasley conjured up candles to light the darkening garden before they had their homemade strawberry ice cream and by the time they had finished moths were fluttering low over the table and the warm air was perfumed with the smells of grass and honeysuckle harry was feeling extremely well fed and at peace with the world as he watched several gnomes sprinting through the rosebushes laughing madly and closely pursued by crookshanks 
 
 ron looked carefully up the table to check that the rest of the family were all busy talking then he said very quietly to harry so have you heard from sirius lately 
 
 hermione looked around listening closely 
 
 yeah said harry softly twice he sounds okay i wrote to him yesterday he might write back while here 
 
 he suddenly remembered the reason he had written to sirius and for a moment was on the verge of telling ron and hermione about his scar hurting again and about the dream that had awoken himbut he really want to worry them just now not when he himself was feeling so happy and peaceful 
 
 look at the time mrs weasley said suddenly checking her wristwatch you really should be in bed the whole lot of you be up at the crack of dawn to get to the cup harry if you leave your school list out get your things for you tomorrow in diagon alley getting everyone there might not be time after the world cup the match went on for five days last time 
 
 wow hope it does this time said harry enthusiastically 
 
 well i certainly said percy sanctimoniously i shudder to think what the state of my would be if i was away from work for five days 
 
 yeah someone might slip dragon dung in it again eh perce said fred 
 
 that was a sample of fertilizer from norway said percy going very red in the face it was nothing personal 
 
 it was fred whispered to harry as they got up from the table we sent it 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter five the order of the phoenixcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 your 
 
 my dear old mum yeah said sirius been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a permanent sticking charm on the back of the canvas get downstairs quick before they all wake up again 
 
 but a portrait of your mother doing here harry asked bewildered as they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone steps the others just behind them 
 
 anyone told you this was my parents house said sirius but the last black left so mine now i offered it to dumbledore for headquartersabout the only useful thing been able to do 
 
 harry who had expected a better welcome noted how hard and bitter voice sounded he followed his godfather to the bottom of the steps and through a door leading into the basement kitchen 
 
 it was scarcely less gloomy than the hall above a cavernous room with rough stone walls most of the light was coming from a large fire at the far end of the room a haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fumes through which loomed the menacing shapes of heavy iron pots and pans hanging from the dark ceiling many chairs had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of them littered with rolls of parchment goblets empty wine bottles and a heap of what appeared to be rags mr weasley and his eldest son bill were talking quietly with their heads together at the end of the table 
 
 mrs weasley cleared her throat her husband a thin balding man who wore glasses looked around and jumped to his feet 
 
 harry mr weasley said hurrying forward to greet him and shaking his hand vigorously good to see you 
 
 over his shoulder harry saw bill who still wore his long hair in a ponytail hastily rolling up the lengths of parchment left on the table 
 
 journey all right harry bill called trying to gather up twelve scrolls at once make you come via greenland then 
 
 he tried said tonks striding over to help bill and immediately toppling a candle on to the last piece of parchment oh nosorry 
 
 here dear said mrs weasley sounding exasperated and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand in the flash of light caused by mrs charm harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building 
 
 mrs weasley had seen him looking she snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into already overladen arms 
 
 this sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meetings she snapped before sweeping off towards an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plates 
 
 bill took out his wand muttered evanesce and the scrolls vanished 
 
 sit down harry said sirius met mundungus you 
 
 the thing harry had taken to be a pile of rags gave a prolonged grunting snore then jerked awake 
 
 say mundungus mumbled sleepily i agree with sirius he raised a very grubby hand in the air as though voting his droopy bloodshot eyes unfocused 
 
 ginny giggled 
 
 the over dung said sirius as they all sat down around him at the table arrived 
 
 eh said mundungus peering bale fully at harry through his matted ginger hair blimey so e as yeah you all right arry 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 mundungus fumbled nervously in his pockets still staring at harry and pulled out a grimy black pipe he stuck it in his mouth ignited the end of it with his wand and took a deep pull on it great billowing clouds of greenish smoke obscured him within seconds 
 
 owe you a pology grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud 
 
 for the last time mundungus called mrs weasley will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen especially not when about to eat 
 
 ah said mundungus right sorry molly 
 
 the cloud of smoke vanished as mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket but an acrid smell of burning socks lingered 
 
 and if you want dinner before midnight need a hand mrs weasley said to the room at large no you can stay where you are harry dear had a long journey 
 
 what can i do molly said tonks enthusiastically bounding forwards 
 
 mrs weasley hesitated looking apprehensive 
 
 erno all right tonks you have a rest too done enough today 
 
 no no i want to help said tonks brightly knocking over a chair as she hurried towards the dresser from which ginny was collecting cutlery 
 
 soon a series of heavy knives were chopping meat and vegetables of their own accord supervised by mr weasley while mrs weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plates more goblets and food from the pantry harry was left at the table with sirius and mundungus who was still blinking at him mournfully 
 
 seen old figgy since he asked 
 
 no said harry i seen anyone 
 
 see i ave left said mundungus leaning forward a pleading note in his voice but i ad a business opportunity 
 
 harry felt something brush against his knees and started but it was only crookshanks ginger cat who wound himself once around legs purring then jumped on to lap and curled up sirius scratched him behind the ears as he turned still to harry 
 
 had a good summer so far 
 
 no been lousy said harry 
 
 for the first time something like a grin flitted across free 
 
 know what complaining about myself 
 
 what said harry incredulously 
 
 personally have welcomed a dementor attack a deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely you think had it bad at least been able to get out and about stretch your legs get into a few fights been stuck inside for a month 
 
 how come asked harry frowning 
 
 because the ministry of still after me and voldemort will know all about me being an animagus by now wormtail will have told him so my big disguise is useless not much i can do for the order of the phoenix or so dumbledore feels 
 
 there was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which sirius uttered name that told harry that sirius too was not very happy with the headmaster eithe harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather 
 
 at least known been going on he said bracingly 
 
 oh yeah said sirius sarcastically listening to reports having to take all his snide hints that out there risking his life while sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time asking me how the going 
 
 what cleaning asked harry 
 
 trying to make this place fit for human habitation said sirius waving a hand around the dismal kitchen no lived here for ten years not since my dear mother died unless you count her old and gone round the twist cleaned anything in ages 
 
 sirius said mundungus who did not appear to have paid any attention to the conversation but had been closely examining an empty goblet this solid silver mate 
 
 yes said sirius surveying it with distaste finest silver embossed with the black family crest 
 
 come orf though muttered mundungus polishing it with his cuff 
 
 fredgeorgeno just carry them mrs weasley shrieked 
 
 harry sirius and mundungus looked around and within a split second they had dived away from the table fred and george had bewitched a large cauldron of stew an iron flagon of butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard complete with knife to hurtle through the air towards them the stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash spilling its contents everywhere the bread knife slipped off the board and landed point down and quivering ominously exactly where right hand had been seconds before 
 
 for sake screamed mrs weasley there was no need had enough of this just because allowed to use magic now you have to whip your wands out for every tiny little thing 
 
 we were just trying to save a bit of time said fred hurrying forward to wrench the bread knife out of the table sorry sirius mean to 
 
 harry and sirius were both laughing mundungus who had toppled backwards off his chair was swearing as he got to his feet crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser from where his large yellow eyes glowed in the darkness 
 
 boys mr weasley said lifting the stew back into the middle of the table your right supposed to show a sense of responsibility now come of age 
 
 none of your brothers caused this sort of trouble mrs weasley raged at the twins as she slammed a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost as much again bill feel the need to apparate every few feet charlie charm everything he met percy 
 
 she stopped dead catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband whose expression was suddenly wooden 
 
 eat said bill quickly 
 
 it looks wonderful molly said lupin ladling stew on to a plate for her and handing it across the table 
 
 for a few minutes there was silence but for the chink of plates and cutlery and the scraping of chairs as everyone settled down to their food then mrs weasley turned to sirius 
 
 been meaning to tell you sirius something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room it keeps rattling and shaking of course it could just be a boggart but i thought we ought to ask alastor to have a look at it before we let it out 
 
 whatever you like said sirius indifferently 
 
 the curtains in there are full of doxys too mrs weasley went on i thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow 
 
 i look forward to it said sirius harry heard the sarcasm in his voice but he was not sure that anyone else did 
 
 opposite harry tonks was entertaining hermione and ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in bedroom her nose swelled to a protuberance that resembled shrank to the size of a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril apparently this was a regular mealtime entertainment because hermione and ginny were soon requesting their favourite noses 
 
 do that one like a pig snout tonks 
 
 tonks obliged and harry looking up had the fleeting impression that a female dudley was grinning at him from across the table 
 
 mr weasley bill and lupin were having an intense discuss on about goblins 
 
 not giving anything away yet said bill i still work out whether or not they believe back course they might prefer not to take sides at all keep out of it 
 
 sure never go over to said mr weasley shaking his head suffered losses too remember that goblin family he murdered last time somewhere near nottingham 
 
 i think it depends what offered said lupin and not talking about gold if offered the freedoms been denying them for centuries going to be tempted have you still not had any luck with ragnok bill 
 
 feeling pretty at the moment said bill he stopped raging about the bagman business he reckons the ministry did a those goblins never got their gold from him you know 
 
 a gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of words fred george ron and mundungus were rolling around in their seats 
 
 and then choked mundungus tears running down his face and then if believe it e says to me e says ere dung where didja get all them toads from cos some son of a gone and nicked all mine and i says nicked all your toads will what next so be wanting some more then and if believe me lads the gormless gargoyle buys all is own toads back orf me for a lot what e paid in the first place 
 
 i think we need to hear any more of your business dealings thank you very much mundungus said mrs weasley sharply as ron slumped forwards on to the table howling with laughter 
 
 beg pardon molly said mundungus at once wiping his eyes and winking at harry but you know will nicked em orf warty harris in the first place so i really doing nothing wrong 
 
 i know where you learned about right and wrong mundungus but you seem to have missed a few crucial lessons said mrs weasley coldly 
 
 fred and george buried their faces in their goblets of butterbeer george was hiccoughing for some reason mrs weasley threw a very nasty look at sirius before getting to her feet and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding harry looked round at his godfather 
 
 molly approve of mundungus said sirius in an undertone 
 
 how come in the order harry said very quietly 
 
 useful sirius muttered knows all the crookswell he would seeing as one himself but also very loyal to dumbledore who helped him out of a tight spot once it pays to have someone like dung around he hears things we but molly thinks inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far she forgiven him for slipping off duty when he was supposed to be tailing you 
 
 three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight which was saying something as the jeans had once been as he laid down his spoon there was a lull in the general conversation mr weasley was leaning back in his chair looking replete and relaxed tonks was yawning widely her nose now back to normal and ginny who had lured crookshanks out from under the dresser was sitting on the floor rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase 
 
 nearly time for bed i think said mrs weasley with a yawn 
 
 not just yet molly said sirius pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at harry you know surprised at you i thought the first thing do when you got here would be to start asking questions about voldemort 
 
 the atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity harry associated with the arrival of dementors where seconds before it had been sleepily relaxed it was now alert even tense a frisson had gone around the table at the mention of name lupin who had been about to take a sip of wine lowered his goblet slowly looking wary 
 
 i did said harry indignantly i asked ron and hermione but they said not allowed in the order so 
 
 and quite right said mrs weasley too young 
 
 she was sitting bolt upright in her chair her fists clenched an its arms every trace of drowsiness gone 
 
 since when did someone have to be in the order of the phoenix to ask questions asked sirius been trapped in that muggle house for a month got the right to know been happen 
 
 hang on interrupted george loudly 
 
 how come harry gets his questions answered said fred angrily 
 
 been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you told us a single stinking thing said george 
 
 too young not in the order said fred in a voice that sounded uncannily like his not even of age 
 
 not my fault you been told what the doing said sirius calmly your parents decision harry on the other hand 
 
 not down to you to decide good for harry said mrs weasley sharply the expression on her normally kind face looked dangerous you forgotten what dumbledore said i suppose 
 
 which bit sirius asked politely but with the air of a man readying himself for a fight 
 
 the bit about not telling harry more than he needs to know said mrs weasley placing a heavy emphasis on the last three words 
 
 ron hermione fred and heads swivelled from sirius to mrs weasley as though they were following a tennis rally ginny was kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer corks watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open eyes were fixed on sirius 
 
 i intend to tell him more than he needs to know molly said sirius but as he was the one who saw voldemort come back again there was a collective shudder around the table at the name he has more right than most to 
 
 not a member of the order of the phoenix said mrs weasley only fifteen and 
 
 and dealt with as much as most in the order said sirius and more than some 
 
 no denying what done said mrs weasley her voice rising her fists trembling on the arms of her chair but still 
 
 not a child said sirius impatiently 
 
 not an adult either said mrs weasley the colour rising in her cheeks not james sirius 
 
 perfectly clear who he is thanks molly said sirius coldly 
 
 not sure you are said mrs weasley sometimes the way you talk about him as though you think got your best friend back 
 
 wrong with that said harry 
 
 wrong harry is that you are not your father however much you might look like him said mrs weasley her eyes still boring into sirius you are still at school and adults responsible for you should not forget it 
 
 meaning an irresponsible godfather demanded sirius his voice rising 
 
 meaning you have been known to act rashly sirius which is why dumbledore keeps reminding you to stay at home and 
 
 leave my instructions from dumbledore out of this if you please said sirius loudly 
 
 arthur said mrs weasley rounding on her husband arthur back me up 
 
 mr weasley did not speak at once he took off his glasses and cleaned them slowly on his robes not looking at his wife only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he reply 
 
 dumbledore knows the position has changed molly he accepts that harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters 
 
 yes but a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he likes 
 
 personally said lupin quietly looking away from sirius at last as mrs weasley turned quickly to him hopeful that finally she was about to get an ally i think it better that harry gets the factsnot all the facts molly but the general picturefrom us rather than a garbled version from others 
 
 his expression was mild but harry felt sure lupin at least knew that some extendable ears had survived mrs purge 
 
 well said mrs weasley breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come well i can see going to be overruled just say this dumbledore must have had his reasons for not wanting harry to know too much and speaking as someone who has best interests at heart 
 
 not your son said sirius quietly 
 
 as good as said mrs weasley fiercely who else has he got 
 
 got me 
 
 yes said mrs weasley her lip curling the thing is been rather difficult for you to look after him while been locked up in azkaban it 
 
 sirius started to rise from his chair 
 
 molly not the only person at this table who cares about harry said lupin sharply sirius sit down 
 
 mrs weasleys lower lip was trembling sirius sank slowly back into his chair his face white 
 
 i think harry ought to be allowed a say in this lupin continued old enough to decide for himself 
 
 i want to know been going on harry said at once 
 
 he did not look at mrs weasley he had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son but he was also impatient with her mollycoddling sirius was right he was not a child 
 
 very well said mrs weasley her voice cracking ginnyronhermionefredgeorgei want you out of this kitchen now 
 
 there was instant uproar 
 
 of age fred and george bellowed together 
 
 if allowed why i shouted ron 
 
 mum i want to hear wailed ginny 
 
 no shouted mrs weasley standing up her eyes overbright i absolutely forbid 
 
 molly you stop fred and george said mr weasley wearily they are of age 
 
 still at school 
 
 but legally adults now said mr weasley in the same tired voice 
 
 mrs weasley was now scarlet in the face 
 
 ioh all right then fred and george can stay but ron 
 
 tell me and hermione everything you say anyway said ron hotly you he added uncertainly meeting eyes 
 
 for a split second harry considered telling ron that he tell him a single word that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it but the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other 
 
 course i will harry said 
 
 ron and hermione beamed 
 
 fine shouted mrs weasley fine ginnybed 
 
 ginny did not go quietly they could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stairs and when she reached the hall mrs blacks shrieks were added to the din lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm it was only after he had returned closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again that sirius spoke 
 
 ok harry what do you want to know 
 
 harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had obsessed him for the last month 
 
 voldemort he said ignoring the renewed shudders and winces at the name he doing been trying to watch the muggle news and there been anything that looks like him yet no funny deaths or anything 
 
 because there been any funny deaths yet said sirius not as far as we know anyway and we know quite a lot 
 
 more than he thinks we do anyway said lupin 
 
 how come stopped killing people harry asked he knew voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone 
 
 because he want to draw attention to himself said sirius it would be dangerous for him his comeback come off quite the way he wanted it to you see he messed it up 
 
 or rather you messed it up for him said lupin with a satisfied smile 
 
 how harry asked perplexed 
 
 you supposed to survive said sirius nobody apart from his death eaters was supposed to know come back but you survived to bear witness 
 
 and the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back was dumbledore said lupin and you made sure dumbledore knew at once 
 
 how has that helped harry asked 
 
 are you kidding said bill incredulously dumbledore was the only one was ever scared of 
 
 thanks to you dumbledore was able to recall the order of the phoenix about an hour after voldemort returned said sirius 
 
 so the order been doing said harry looking around at them all 
 
 working as hard as we can to make sure voldemort carry out his plans said sirius 
 
 how know what his plans are harry asked quickly 
 
 got a shrewd idea said lupin and shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate 
 
 so what does dumbledore reckon planning 
 
 well firstly he wants to build up his army again said sirius in the old days he had huge numbers at his command witches and wizards bullied or bewitched into following him his faithful death eaters a great variety of dark creatures you heard him planning to recruit the giants well be just one of the groups after certainly not going to try and take on the ministry of magic with only a dozen death eaters 
 
 so trying to stop him getting more followers 
 
 doing our best said lupin 
 
 how 
 
 well the main thing is to try and convince as many people as possible that really has returned to put them on their guard said bill proving tricky though 
 
 why 
 
 because of the attitude said tonks you saw cornelius fudge after came back harry well he shifted his position at all absolutely refusing to believe happened 
 
 but why said harry desperately he being so stupid if dumbledore 
 
 ah well put your finger on the problem said mr weasley with a wry smile dumbledore 
 
 fudge is frightened of him you see said tonks sadly 
 
 frightened of dumbledore said harry incredulously 
 
 frightened of what up to said mr weasley fudge thinks plotting to overthrow him he thinks dumbledore wants to be minister for magic 
 
 but dumbledore want 
 
 of course he said mr weasley never wanted the job even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when millicent bagnold retired fudge came to power instead but never quite forgotten how much popular support dumbledore had even though dumbledore never applied for the job 
 
 deep down fudge knows much cleverer than he is a much more powerful wizard and in the early days of his ministry he was forever asking dumbledore for help and advice said lupin but it seems become fond of power and much more confident he loves being minister for magic and managed to convince himself that the clever one and simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it 
 
 how can he think that said harry angrily how can he think dumbledore would just make it all upthat make it all up 
 
 because accepting that back would mean trouble like the ministry had to cope with for nearly fourteen years said sirius bitterly fudge just bring himself to face it so much more comfortable to convince himself lying to destabilise him 
 
 you see the problem said lupin while the ministry insists there is nothing to fear from voldemort hard to convince people back especially as they really want to believe it in the first place more the leaning heavily on the daily prophet not to report any of what calling so most of the wizarding community are completely unaware happened and that makes them easy targets for the death eaters if using the imperius curse 
 
 but telling people you said harry looking around at mr weasley sirius bill mundungus lupin and tonks letting people know back 
 
 they all smiled humourlessly 
 
 well as everyone thinks a mad and the put a ten thousand galleon price on my head i can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflets can i said sirius restlessly 
 
 and not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community said lupin an occupational hazard of being a werewolf 
 
 tonks and arthur would lose their jobs at the ministry if they started shooting their mouths off said sirius and very important for us to have spies inside the ministry because you can bet voldemort will have them 
 
 managed to convince a couple of people though said mr weasley tonks here for too young to have been in the order of the phoenix last time and having aurors on our side is a huge advantage kingsley been a real asset too in charge of the hunt for sirius so been feeding the ministry information that sirius is in tibet 
 
 but if none of you are putting the news out that back harry began 
 
 who said none of us are putting the news out said sirius why think in such trouble 
 
 what mean harry asked 
 
 trying to discredit him said lupin you see the daily prophet last week they reported that been voted out of the chairmanship of the international confederation of wizards because getting old and losing his grip but not true he was voted out by ministry wizards after he made a speech announcing return demoted him from chief warlock on the the wizard high courtand talking about taking away his order of merlin first class too 
 
 but dumbledore says he care what they do as long as they take him off the chocolate frog cards said bill grinning 
 
 no laughing matter said mr weasley sharply if he carries on defying the ministry like this he could end up in azkaban and the last thing we want is to have dumbledore locked up while knows out there and wise to what up to going to go cautiously if out of the waywell will have a clear field 
 
 but if trying to recruit more death eaters bound to get out that come back it asked harry desperately 
 
 voldemort march up to houses and bang on their front doors harry said sirius he tricks jinxes and blackmails them at operating in secret in any case gathering followers is only one thing interested in got other plans too plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed and concentrating on those for the moment 
 
 he after apart from followers harry asked swiftly he thought he saw sirius and lupin exchange the most fleeting of looks before sirius answered stuff he can only get by stealth 
 
 when harry continued to look puzzled sirius said like a weapon something he have last time 
 
 when he was powerful before 
 
 yes 
 
 like what kind of weapon said harry something worse than the avada kedavra 
 
 enough 
 
 mrs weasley spoke from the shadows beside the door harry noticed her return from taking ginny upstairs her arms were crossed and she looked furious 
 
 i want you in bed now all of you she added looking around at fred george ron and hermione 
 
 you boss us fred began 
 
 watch me snarled mrs weasley she was trembling slightly as she looked at sirius given harry plenty of information any more and you might just as well induct him into the order straightaway 
 
 why not said harry quickly join i want to join i want to fight 
 
 no 
 
 it was not mrs weasley who spoke this time but lupin 
 
 the order is comprised only of overage wizards he said wizards who have left school he added as fred and george opened their mouths there are dangers involved of which you can have no idea any of you i think right sirius said enough 
 
 sirius but did not argue mrs weasley beckoned imperiously to her sons and herrnione one by one they stood up and harry recognising defeat followed suit 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter five an excess of phlegmcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry and dumbledore approached the back door of the burrow which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old wellington boots and rusty cauldrons harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed dumbledore knocked three times and harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window 
 
 there said a nervous voice he recognized as mrs declare yourself 
 
 it is i dumbledore bringing harry 
 
 the door opened at once there stood mrs weasley short plump and wearing an old green dressing gown 
 
 harry dear gracious albus you gave me a fright you said not to expect you before morning 
 
 we were lucky said dumbledore ushering harry over the threshold slughorn proved much more persuadable than i had expected doing of course ah hello nymphadora 
 
 harry looked around and saw that mrs weasley was not alone despite the lateness of the hour a young witch with a pale face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hands 
 
 hello professor she said wotcher harry 
 
 hi tonks 
 
 harry thought she looked drawn even ill and there was something forced in her smile certainly her appearance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of hair 
 
 better be off she said quickly standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders thanks for the tea and sympathy molly 
 
 please leave on my account said dumbledore courteously i cannot stay i have urgent matters to discuss with rufus scrimgeour 
 
 no no i need to get going said tonks not meeting eyes night 
 
 dear why not come to dinner at the weekend remus and are coming 
 
 no really molly thanks anyway goodnight 
 
 tonks hurried past dumbledore and harry into the yard a few paces beyond the doorstep she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air harry noticed that mrs weasley looked troubled 
 
 well i shall see you at hogwarts harry said dumbledore take care of yourself molly your servant 
 
 he made mrs weasley a bow and followed tonks vanishing at precisely the same spot mrs weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance 
 
 like ron she sighed looking him up and down both of you look as though had stretching jinxes put on you i swear grown four inches since i last bought him school robes are you hungry harry 
 
 yeah i am said harry suddenly realizing just how hungry he was 
 
 sit down dear knock something up 
 
 as harry sat down a furry ginger cat with a squashed face lumped onto his knees and settled there purring 
 
 so here he asked happily as he tickled crookshanks behind the ears 
 
 oh yes she arrived the day before yesterday said mrs weasley rapping a large iron pot with her wand it bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once in bed of course we expect you for hours here you are 
 
 she tapped the pot again it rose into the air flew toward harry and tipped over mrs weasley slid a bowl nearly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick steaming onion soup 
 
 bread dear 
 
 thanks mrs weasley 
 
 she waved her wand over her shoulder a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table as the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove mrs weasley sat down opposite him 
 
 so you persuaded horace slughorn to take the job 
 
 harry nodded his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak 
 
 he taught arthur and me said mrs weasley he was at hogwarts for ages started around the same time as dumbledore i think did you like him 
 
 his mouth now full of bread harry shrugged and gave a jerk of the head 
 
 i know what you mean said mrs weasley nodding wisely of course he can be charming when he wants to be but never liked him much the littered with old favorites he was always good at giving leg ups but he never had much time for arthur seem to think he was enough of a highflier well that just shows you even slughorn makes mistakes i know whether told you in any of his letters only just happened but been promoted 
 
 it could not have been clearer that mrs weasley had been bursting to say this 
 
 harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering 
 
 great he gasped 
 
 you are sweet beamed mrs weasley possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the news yes rufus scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation and heading the office for the detection and confiscation of counterfeit defensive spells and protective objects a big job got ten people reporting to him now 
 
 what exactly 
 
 well you see in all the panic about odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere things that are supposed to guard against and the death eaters you can imagine the kind of thing protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added or instructions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off well in the main the perpetrators are just people like mundungus hotelier never done an honest work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is but every now and then something really nasty turns up the other day arthur confiscated a box of cursed sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a death eater so you see a very important job and i tell him just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that muggle rubbish mrs weasley ended her speech with a stern look as if it had been harry suggesting that it was natural to miss 
 
 is mr weasley still at work harry asked 
 
 yes he is as a matter of fact a tiny bit late he said be back around midnight 
 
 she turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table harry recognized it at once it had nine hands each inscribed with the name of a family member and usually hung on the weasleys sitting room wall though its current position suggested that mrs weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at mortal peril 
 
 been like that for a while now said mrs weasley in an unconvincingly casual voice ever since came back into the open i suppose in mortal danger now i think it can be just our family but i know anyone else got a clock like this so i check oh 
 
 with a sudden exclamation she pointed at the face mr hand had switched to traveling 
 
 coming 
 
 and sure enough a moment later there was a knock on the back door mrs weasley jumped up and hurried to it with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly arthur is that you 
 
 yes came mr weary voice but i would say that even if i were a death eater dear ask the question 
 
 oh honestly 
 
 molly 
 
 all right all right what is your dearest ambition 
 
 to find out how airplanes stay up 
 
 mrs weasley nodded and turned the doorknob but apparently mr weasley was holding tight to it on the other side because the door remained firmly shut 
 
 molly got to ask you your question first 
 
 arthur really this is just silly 
 
 what do you like me to call you when alone together 
 
 even by the dim light of the lantern harry could tell that mrs weasley had turned bright red he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck and hastily gulped soup clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl 
 
 mollywobbles whispered a mortified mrs weasley into the crack at the edge of the door 
 
 correct said mr weasley now you can let me in 
 
 mrs weasley opened the door to reveal her husband a thin balding wizard wearing spectacles and a long and dusty traveling cloak 
 
 i still see why we have to go through that every time you come home said mrs weasley still pink in the face as she helped her husband out of his cloak i mean a death eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you 
 
 i know dear but ministry procedure and i have to set an example something smells good onion soup 
 
 mr weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table 
 
 harry we expect you until morning 
 
 they shook hands and mr weasley dropped into the chair beside harry as mrs weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too 
 
 thanks molly been a tough night some started selling just sling them around your neck and be able to change your appearance at will a hundred thousand disguises all for ten galleons 
 
 and what really happens when you put them on 
 
 mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color but a couple of people have also sprouted tentacle like warts all over their bodies as if st have enough to do already 
 
 it sounds like the sort of thing fred and george would find funny said mrs weasley hesitantly are you sure 
 
 of course i am said mr weasley the boys do anything like that now not when people are desperate for protection 
 
 so is that why late 
 
 no we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in elephant and castle but luckily the magical law enforcement squad had sorted it out by the time we got there 
 
 harry stifled a yawn behind his hand 
 
 bed said an undeceived mrs weasley at once got fred and room all ready for you have it to yourself 
 
 why where are they 
 
 oh in diagon alley sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as so busy said mrs weasley i must say i approve at first but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business come on dear your trunks already up there 
 
 night mr weasley said harry pushing back his chair crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room 
 
 harry said mr weasley 
 
 harry saw mrs weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen all the hands were once again at mortal peril 
 
 fred and bedroom was on the second floor mrs weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what harry thought was gunpowder a considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked sealed cardboard boxes amongst which stood school trunk the room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse 
 
 hedwig hooted happily at harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe then took off through the window harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting harry bade mrs weasley good night put on pajamas and got into one of the beds there was something hard inside the pillowcase he groped inside it and pulled out a sticky sweet which he recognized as a puking pastille smiling to himself he rolled over and was instantly asleep 
 
 seconds later or so it seemed to harry he was awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open sitting bolt upright he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back the dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes shielding them with one hand he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the other 
 
 wuzzgoinon 
 
 we know you were here already said a loud and excited voice and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head 
 
 ron hit him said a voice reproachfully 
 
 hand found his glasses and he shoved them on though i he light was so bright he could hardly see anyway a long looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment he blinked and ron weasley came into focus grinning down at him 
 
 all right 
 
 never been better said harry rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows you 
 
 not bad said ron pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it when did you get here only just told us 
 
 about one this morning 
 
 were the muggles all right did they treat you okay 
 
 same as usual said harry as hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed they talk to me much but i like it better that way you hermione 
 
 oh fine said hermione who was scrutinizing harry as though he was sickening for something he thought he knew what was behind this and as he had no wish to discuss death or any other miserable subject at the moment he said the time have i missed breakfast 
 
 worry about that bringing you up a tray she reckons you look underfed said ron rolling his eyes so been going on 
 
 nothing much just been stuck at my aunt and i 
 
 come off it said ron been off with dumbledore 
 
 it that exciting he just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement his horace slughorn 
 
 oh said ron looking disappointed we thought 
 
 hermione flashed a warning look at ron and ron changed tack at top speed 
 
 we thought be something like that 
 
 you did said harry amused 
 
 yeah yeah now umbridge has left obviously we need a new defense against the dark arts teacher we so er he like 
 
 he looks a bit like a walrus and he used to be head of slytherin said harry something wrong hermione 
 
 she was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any moment she rearranged her features hastily in an unconvincing smile 
 
 no of course not so um did slughorn seem like be a good teacher 
 
 dunno said harry he be worse than umbridge can he 
 
 i know someone worse than umbridge said a voice from the doorway younger sister slouched into the room looking irritable hi harry 
 
 up with you ron asked 
 
 her said ginny plonking herself down on bed driving me mad 
 
 she done now asked hermione sympathetically 
 
 the way she talks to me think i was about three 
 
 i know said hermione dropping her voice so full of herself 
 
 harry was astonished to hear hermione talking about mrs weasley like this and could not blame ron for saying angrily you two lay off her for five seconds 
 
 oh right defend her snapped ginny we all know you get enough of her 
 
 this seemed an odd comment to make about mother starting to feel that he was missing something harry said who are you 
 
 but his question was answered before he could finish it the bedroom door flew open again and harry instinctively yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that hermione and ginny slid off the bed onto the floor 
 
 a young woman was standing in the doorway a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless she was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint silvery glow to complete this vision of perfection she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray 
 
 arry she said in a throaty voice eet as been too long 
 
 as she swept over the threshold toward him mrs weasley was revealed bobbing along in her wake looking rather cross 
 
 there was no need to bring up the tray i was just about to do it myself 
 
 eet was no trouble said fleur delacour setting the tray across knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek he felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn i ave been longing to see im you remember my seester gabrielle she never stops talking about arry potter she will be delighted to see you again 
 
 oh is she here too harry croaked 
 
 no no silly boy said fleur with a tinkling laugh i mean next summer when we but do you not know 
 
 her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at mrs weasley who said we got around to telling him yet 
 
 fleur turned back to harry swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped mrs weasley across the face 
 
 bill and i are going to be married 
 
 oh said harry blankly he could not help noticing how mrs weasley hermione and ginny were all determinedly avoiding one gaze wow er congratulations 
 
 she swooped down upon him and kissed him again 
 
 bill is very busy at ze moment working very ard and i only work at gringotts for my eenglish so he brought me ere for a few days to get to know is family properly i was so pleased to ear you would be coming zere much to do ere unless you like cooking and chickens well enjoy your breakfast arry 
 
 with these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room closing the door quietly behind her 
 
 mrs weasley made a noise that sounded like tchah 
 
 mum hates her said ginny quietly 
 
 i do not hate her said mrs weasley in a cross whisper i just think hurried into this engagement all 
 
 known each other a year said ron who looked oddly groggy and was staring at the closed door 
 
 well not very long i know why happened of course all this uncertainty with coming back people think they might be dead tomorrow so rushing all sorts of decisions normally take time over it was the same last time he was powerful people eloping left right and center 
 
 including you and dad said ginny slyly 
 
 yes well your father and i were made for each other what was the point in waiting said mrs weasley whereas bill and fleur well what have they really got in common a hardworking sort of person whereas 
 
 a cow said ginny nodding but not that a he he likes a bit of adventure a bit of glamour i expect why gone for phlegm 
 
 stop calling her that ginny said mrs weasley sharply as harry and hermione laughed well better get on eat your eggs while warm harry 
 
 looking careworn she left the room ron still seemed slightly he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water 
 
 you get used to her if staying in the same house harry asked 
 
 well you do said ron but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly like then 
 
 pathetic said hermione furiously striding away from ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had reached the wall 
 
 you really want her around forever ginny asked ron incredulously when he merely shrugged she said well going to put a stop to it if she can i bet you anything 
 
 she going to manage that asked harry 
 
 she keeps trying to get tonks round for dinner i think hoping bill will fall for tonks instead i hope he does much rather have her in the family 
 
 yeah work said ron sarcastically listen no bloke in his right going to fancy tonks when around i mean tonks is when she doing stupid things to her hair and her nose but 
 
 a damn sight nicer than phlegm said ginny 
 
 and more intelligent an auror said hermione from the corner 
 
 not stupid she was good enough to enter the triwizard tournament said harry 
 
 not you as well said hermione bitterly 
 
 i suppose you like the way phlegm says arry do you asked ginny scornfully 
 
 no said harry wishing he spoken i was just saying phlegm i mean fleur 
 
 much rather have tonks in the family said ginny at least a laugh 
 
 she been much of a laugh lately said ron every time seen her looked more like moaning myrtle 
 
 not fair snapped hermione she still got over what happened you know i mean he was her cousin 
 
 heart sank they had arrived at sirius he picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation 
 
 tonks and sirius barely knew each other said ron sirius was in azkaban half her life and before that their families never met 
 
 not the point said hermione she thinks it was her limit he died 
 
 how does she work that one out asked harry in spite of himself 
 
 well she was fighting bellatrix lestrange she i think she feels that if only she had finished her off bellatrix have killed sirius 
 
 stupid said ron 
 
 guilt said hermione i know tried to talk her round but still really down actually having trouble with her metamorphosing 
 
 with her 
 
 she change her appearance like she used to explained hermione i think her powers must have been affected by shock or something 
 
 i know that could happen said harry 
 
 nor did i said hermione but i suppose if really depressed 
 
 the door opened again and mrs weasley popped her head in ginny she whispered come downstairs and help me with the lunch 
 
 talking to this lot said ginny outraged 
 
 now said mrs weasley and withdrew 
 
 she only wants me there so she have to be alone with phlegm said ginny crossly she swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina 
 
 you lot had better come down quickly too she said as she left 
 
 harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast hermione was peering into fred and boxes though every now and then she cast sideways looks at harry ron who was now helping himself to toast was still gazing dreamily at the door 
 
 this hermione asked eventually holding up what looked like a small telescope 
 
 dunno said ron but if fred and george left it here probably not ready for the joke shop yet so be careful 
 
 your mum said the going well said harry said fred and george have got a real flair for business 
 
 an understatement said ron raking in the galleons i wait to see the place we been to diagon alley yet because mum says got to be there for extra security and been really busy at work but it sounds excellent 
 
 and what about percy asked harry the weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family is he talking to your mum and dad again 
 
 nope said ron 
 
 but he knows your dad was right all along now about voldemort being back 
 
 dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right said hermione i heard him telling your mum ron 
 
 sounds like the sort of mental thing dumbledore would say said ron 
 
 going to be giving me private lessons this year said harry conversationally 
 
 ron choked on his bit of toast and hermione gasped 
 
 you kept that quiet said ron 
 
 i only just remembered said harry honestly he told me last night in your broom shed 
 
 blimey private lessons with dumbledore said ron looking impressed i wonder why 
 
 his voice tailed away harry saw him and hermione exchange looks harry laid down his knife and fork his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed dumbledore had said to do it why not now he fixed his eyes on his fork which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap and said i know exactly why going to be giving me lessons but i think it must be because of the prophecy 
 
 neither ron nor hermione spoke harry had the impression that both had frozen he continued still speaking to his fork you know the one they were trying to steal at the ministry 
 
 nobody knows what it said though said hermione quickly it got smashed 
 
 although the prophet says began ron but hermione said shh 
 
 the prophets got it right said harry looking up at them both with a great effort hermione seemed frightened and ron amazed that glass ball that smashed the only record of the prophecy i heard the whole thing in office he was the one the prophecy was made to so he could tell me from what it said harry took a deep breath it looks like the one got to finish off voldemort at least it said neither of us could live while the other survives 
 
 the three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment then there was a loud bang and hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke 
 
 hermione shouted harry and ron the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash 
 
 hermione emerged coughing out of the smoke clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye 
 
 i squeezed it and it it punched me she gasped 
 
 and sure enough they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope 
 
 worry said ron who was plainly trying not to laugh fix that good at healing minor injuries 
 
 oh well never mind that now said hermione hastily harry oh harry 
 
 she sat down on the edge of his bed again 
 
 we wondered after we got back from the ministry obviously we want to say anything to you but from what lucius malfoy said about the prophecy how it was about you and voldemort well we thought it might be something like this oh harry she stared at him then whispered are you scared 
 
 not as much as i was said harry when i first heard it i was but now it seems as though i always knew have to face him in the end 
 
 when we heard dumbledore was collecting you in person we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy said ron eagerly and we were kind of right we he be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner waste his time he must think got a chance 
 
 true said hermione i wonder what teach you harry really advanced defensive magic probably powerful countercurses 
 
 harry did not really listen a warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving he knew that ron and hermione were more shocked than they were letting on but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him speaking bracing words of comfort not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous was worth more than he could ever tell them 
 
 and evasive enchantments generally concluded hermione well at least you know one lesson be having this year one more than ron and me i wonder when our results will come 
 
 be long now been a month said ron 
 
 hang on said harry as another part of last conversation came back to him i think dumbledore said our results would be arriving today 
 
 today shrieked hermione today but why you oh my god you should have said 
 
 she leapt to her feet 
 
 going to see whether any owls have come 
 
 but when harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray it was to find hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation while mrs weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda 
 
 it just budge mrs weasley was saying anxiously standing over hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of the helpmate open at bruises cuts and abrasions this has always worked before i just understand it 
 
 be fred and idea of a funny joke making sure it come off said ginny 
 
 but got to come off squeaked hermione i go around looking like this forever 
 
 you dear find an antidote worry said mrs weasley soothingly 
 
 bill told me ow fred and george are very amusing said fleur smiling serenely 
 
 yes i can hardly breathe for laughing snapped hermione 
 
 she jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen twisting her fingers together 
 
 mrs weasley quite quite sure no owls have arrived this morning 
 
 yes dear have noticed said mrs weasley patiently but barely nine still plenty of time 
 
 i know i messed up ancient runes muttered hermione feverishly i definitely made at least one serious mistranslation and the defense against the dark arts practical was no good at all i thought transfiguration went all right at the time but looking back 
 
 hermione will you shut up not the only one nervous barked ron and when got your eleven outstanding 
 
 said hermione flapping her hands hysterically i know failed everything 
 
 what happens if we fail harry asked the room at large but it was again hermione who answered 
 
 we discuss our options with our head of house i asked professor mcgonagall at the end of last term 
 
 stomach squirmed he wished he had eaten less breakfast 
 
 at beauxbatons said fleur complacently we ad a different way of doing things i think eet was better we sat our examinations after six years of study not five and then 
 
 words were drowned in a scream hermione was pointing through the kitchen window three black specks were clearly visible in the sky growing larger all the time 
 
 definitely owls said ron hoarsely jumping up to join hermione at the window 
 
 and there are three of them said harry hastening to her other side 
 
 one for each of us said hermione in a terrified whisper oh no oh no oh no 
 
 she gripped both harry and ron tightly around the elbows 
 
 the owls were flying directly at the burrow three handsome tawnies each of which it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house was carrying a large square envelope 
 
 oh no squealed hermione 
 
 mrs weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window one two three the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line all three of them lifted their right legs 
 
 harry moved forward the letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle he untied it with fumbling fingers to his left ron was trying to detach his own results to his right hands were shaking so much she was making her whole owl tremble 
 
 nobody in the kitchen spoke at last harry managed to detach the envelope he slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside 
 
 ordinary wizarding level results

 harry read the parchment through several times his breathing becoming easier with each reading it was all right he had always known that he would fail divination and he had had no chance of passing history of magic given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination but he had passed everything else he ran his finger down the grades he had passed well in transfiguration and herbology he had even exceeded expectations at potions and best of all he had achieved outstanding at defense against the dark arts 
 
 he looked around hermione had her back to him and her head bent but ron was looking delighted 
 
 only failed divination and history of magic and who cares about them he said happily to harry here swap 
 
 harry glanced down grades there were no outstandings there 
 
 knew be top at defense against the dark arts said ron punching harry on the shoulder done all right we 
 
 well done said mrs weasley proudly ruffling hair seven more than fred and george got together 
 
 hermione said ginny tentatively for hermione still turned around how did you do 
 
 inot bad said hermione in a small voice 
 
 oh come off it said ron striding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand yep ten outstandings and one exceeds expectations at defense against the dark arts he looked down at her actually disappointed you 
 
 hermione shook her head but harry laughed 
 
 well students now grinned ron mum are there any more sausages 
 
 harry looked back down at his results they were as good as he could have hoped for he felt just one tiny twinge of regret this was the end of his ambition to become an auror he had not secured the required potions grade he had known all along that he but he still felt a sinking in his stomach as he looked again at that small black e 
 
 it was odd really seeing that it had been a death eater in disguise who had first told harry he would make a good auror but somehow the idea had taken hold of him and he really think of anything else he would like to be moreover it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago neither can live while the other survives he be living up to the prophecy and giving himself the best chance of survival if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill voldemort

 the half blood prince

 hagrid 
 
 harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of metal and leather that surrounded him his hands sank into inches of muddy water as he tried to stand he could not understand where voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the darkness at any moment something hot and wet was trickling down his chin and from his forehead he crawled out of the pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was hagrid 
 
 hagrid hagrid talk to me c 
 
 but the dark mass did not stir 
 
 whos there is it potter are you harry potter 
 
 harry did not recognize the mans voice then a woman shouted theyve crashed ted crashed in the garden 
 
 harrys head was swimming 
 
 hagrid he repeated stupidly and his knees buckled 
 
 the next thing he knew he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm his missing tooth had been regrown the scar on his forehead was still throbbing 
 
 hagrid 
 
 he opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar lamplit sitting room his rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away wet and muddy a man was watching harry anxiously 
 
 hagrids fine son said the man the wifes seeing to him now how are you feeling anything else broken ive fixed your ribs your tooth and your arm im ted by the way ted tonks c doras father 
 
 harry sat up too quickly lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy 
 
 voldemort c 
 
 easy now said ted tonks placing a hand on harrys shoulder and pushing him back against the cushions that was a nasty crash you just had what happened anyway something go wrong with the bike arthur weasley overstretch himself again him and his muggle contraptions 
 
 no said harry as his scar pulsed like an open wound death eaters loads of them c we were chased c 
 
 death eaters said ted sharply what dyou mean death eaters i thought they didnt know you were being moved tonight i thought c 
 
 they knew said harry 
 
 ted tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above 
 
 well we know our protective charms hold then dont we they shouldnt be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any direction 
 
 now harry understood why voldemort had vanished it had been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the orders charms he only hoped they would continue to work he imagined voldemort a hundred yards above them as they spoke looking for a way to penetrate what harry visualized as a great transparent bubble 
 
 he swung his legs off the sofa he needed to see hagrid with his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive he had barely stood up however when a door opened and hagrid squeezed through it his face covered in mud and blood limping a little but miraculously alive 
 
 harry 
 
 knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra he covered the floor between them in two strides and pulled harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs blimey harry how did yeh get out o that i thought we were both goners 
 
 yeah me too i cant believe c 
 
 harry broke off he had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind hagrid 
 
 you he shouted and he thrust his hand into his pocket but it was empty 
 
 your wands here son said ted tapping it on harrys arm it fell right beside you i picked it upand thats my wife youre shouting at 
 
 oh im c im sorry 
 
 as she moved forward into the room mrs tonkss resemblance to her sister bellatrix became much less pronounced her hair was a light soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder nevertheless she looked a little haughty after harrys exclamation 
 
 what happened to our daughter she asked hagrid said you were ambushed where is nymphadora 
 
 i dont know said harry we dont know what happened to anyone else 
 
 she and ted exchanged looks a mixture of fear and guilt gripped harry at the sight of their expressions if any of the others had died it was his fault all his fault he had consented to the plan given them his hair 
 
 the portkey he said remembering all of a sudden weve got to get back to the burrow and find out c then well be able to send you word or c or tonks will once shes c 
 
 dorall be ok dromeda said ted she knows her stuff shes been in plenty of tight spots with the aurors the portkeys through here he added to harry its supposed to leave in three minutes if you want to take it 
 
 yeah we do said harry he seized his rucksack swung it onto his shoulders i c 
 
 he looked at mrs tonks wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for which he felt so terribly responsible but no words occurred to him that he did not seem hollow and insincere 
 
 ill tell tonks c dora c to send word when she thanks for patching us up thanks for everything i c 
 
 he was glad to leave the room and follow ted tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom hagrid came after them bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel 
 
 there you go son thats the portkey 
 
 mr tonks was pointing to a small hairbrush lying on the dressing table 
 
 thanks said harry reaching out to place a finger on it ready to leave 
 
 wait a moment said hagrid looking around harry wheres hedwig 
 
 she she got hit said harry 
 
 the realization crashed over him he felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes the owl had been his companion his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to return to the dursleys 
 
 hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder 
 
 never mind he said gruffly never mind she had a great old life c 
 
 hagrid said ted tonks warningly as the hairbrush glowed bright blue and hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time 
 
 with a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward harry was pulled into nothingness spinning uncontrollably his finger glued to the portkey as he and hagrid hurtled away from mr tonks second later harrys feet slammed onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the burrow he heard screams throwing aside the no longer glowing hairbrush harry stood up swaying slightly and saw mrs weasley and ginny running down the steps by the back door as hagrid who had also collapsed on landing clambered laboriously to his feet 
 
 harry you are the real harry what happened where are the others cried mrs weasley 
 
 what dyou mean isnt anyone else back harry panted 
 
 the answer was clearly etched in mrs weasleys pale face 
 
 the death eaters were waiting for us harry told her we were surrounded the moment we took off c they knew it was tonight c i dont know what happened to anyone else four of them chased us it was all we could do to get away and then voldemort caught up with us c 
 
 he could hear the note in his voice the plea for her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her sons but c 
 
 thank goodness youre all right she said pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved 
 
 havent go any brandy have yeh molly asked hagrid a little shakily fer medicinal purposes 
 
 she could have summoned it by magic but as she hurried back toward the crooked house harry knew that she wanted to hide her face he turned to ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for information at once 
 
 ron and tonks should have been back first but they missed their portkey it came back without them she said pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby and that one she pointed at an ancient sneaker should have been dad and freds they were supposed to be second you and hagrid were third and she checked her watch if they made it george and lupin aught to be back in about a minute 
 
 mrs weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy which she handed to hagrid he uncorked it and drank it straight down in one 
 
 mum shouted ginny pointing to a spot several feet away 
 
 a blue light had appeared in the darkness it grew larger and brighter and lupin and george appeared spinning and then falling harry knew immediately that there was something wrong lupin was supporting george who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood 
 
 harry ran forward and seized georges legs together he and lupin carried george into the house and through the kitchen to the living room where they laid him on the sofa as the lamplight fell across georges head ginny gasped and harrys stomach lurched one of georges ears was missing the side of his head and neck were drenched in wet shockingly scarlet blood 
 
 no sooner had mrs weasley bent over her son that lupin grabbed harry by the upper arm and dragged him none too gently back into the kitchen where hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door 
 
 oi said hagrid indignantly le go of him le go of harry 
 
 lupin ignored him 
 
 what creature sat in the corner the first time that harry potter visited my office at hogwarts he said giving harry a small shake answer me 
 
 a c a grindylow in a tank wasnt it 
 
 lupin released harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard 
 
 wha was tha about roared hagrid 
 
 im sorry harry but i had to check said lupin tersely weve been betrayed voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were directly involved in the plan you might have been an impostor 
 
 so why aren you checkin me panted hagrid still struggling with the door 
 
 youre said lupin looking up at hagrid the polyjuice potion is designed for human use only 
 
 none of the order would have told voldemort we were moving tonight said harry the idea was dreadful to him he could not believe it of any of them voldemort only caught up with me toward the end he didnt know which one i was in the beginning if hed been in on the plan hed have known from the start i was the one with hagrid 
 
 voldemort caught up with you said lupin sharply what happened how did you escape 
 
 harry explained how the death eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true harry how they had abandoned the chase how they must have summoned voldemort who had appeared just before he and hagrid had reached the sanctuary of tonkss parents 
 
 they recognized you but how what had you done 
 
 i harry tried to remember the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion i saw stan shunpike you know the bloke who was the conductor on the knight bus and i tried to disarm him instead of c well he doesnt know what hes doing does he he must be imperiused 
 
 lupin looked aghast 
 
 harry the time for disarming is past these people are trying to capture and kill you at least stun if you arent prepared to kill 
 
 we were hundreds of feet up stans not himself and if i stunned him and hed fallen hed have died the same as if id used avada kedavra expelliarmus saved me from voldemort two years ago harry added defiantly lupin was reminding him of the sneering hufflepuff zacharias smith who had jeered at harry for wanting to teach dumbledores army how to disarm 
 
 yes harry said lupin with painful restraint and a great number of death eaters witnessed that happening forgive me but it was a very unusual move then under the imminent threat of death repeating it tonight in front of death eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal 
 
 so you think i should have killed stan shunpike said harry angrily 
 
 of course not said lupin but the death eaters c frankly most people c would have expected you to attack back expelliarmus is a useful spell harry but the death eaters seem to think it is your signature move and i urge you not to let it become so 
 
 lupin was making harry feel idiotic and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him 
 
 i wont blast people out of my way just because theyre there said harry thats voldemorts job 
 
 lupins retort was lost finally succeeding in squeezing through the door hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down it collapsed beneath him ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies harry addressed lupin again 
 
 will george be okay 
 
 all lupins frustration with harry seemed to drain away at the question 
 
 i think so although theres no chance of replacing his ear not when its been cursed off c 
 
 there was a scuffling from outside lupin dived for the back door harry leapt over hagrids legs and sprinted into the yard 
 
 two figures had appeared in the yard and as harry ran toward them he realized they were hermione now returning to her normal appearance and kingsley both clutching a bent coat hanger hermione flung herself into harrys arms but kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of any of them over hermiones shoulder harry saw him raise his wand and point it at lupins chest 
 
 the last words albus dumbledore spoke to the pair of us 
 
 harry is the best hope we have trust him said lupin calmly 
 
 kingsley turned his wand on harry but lupin said its him ive checked 
 
 all right all right said kingsley stowing his wand back beneath his cloak but somebody betrayed us they knew they knew it was tonight 
 
 so it seems replied lupin but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven harrys 
 
 small comfort snarled kingsley who else is back 
 
 only harry hagrid george and me 
 
 hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand 
 
 what happened to you lupin asked kingsley 
 
 followed by five injured two mightve killed one kingsley reeled off and we saw as well he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly remus he can c 
 
 fly supplied harry i saw him too he came after hagrid and me 
 
 so thats why he left to follow you said kingsley i couldnt understand why hed vanished but what made him change targets 
 
 harry behaved a little too kindly to stan shunpike said lupin 
 
 stan repeated hermione but i thought he was in azkaban 
 
 kingsley let out a mirthless laugh 
 
 hermione theres obviously been a mass breakout which the ministry has hushed up traverss hood fell off when i cursed him hes supposed to be inside too but what happened to you remus wheres george 
 
 he lost an ear said lupin 
 
 lost an c repeated hermione in a high voice 
 
 snapes work said lupin 
 
 snape shouted harry you didnt say c 
 
 he lost his hood during the chase sectumsempra was always a specialty of snapes i wish i could say id paid him back in kind but it was all i could do to keep george on the broom after he was injured he was losing so much blood 
 
 silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky there was no sign of movement the stars stared back unblinking indifferent unobscured by flying friends where was ron where were fred and mr weasley where were bill fleur tonks and mundungus 
 
 harry give us a hand called hagrid hoarsely from the door in which he was stuck again glad of something to do harry pulled him free the headed through the empty kitchen and back into the sitting room where mrs weasley and ginny were still tending to george mrs weasley had staunched his bleeding now and by the lamplight harry saw a clean gaping hole where georges ear had been 
 
 how is he 
 
 mrs weasley looked around and said i cant make it grow back not when its been removed by dark magic but it couldve been so much worse hes alive 
 
 yeah said harry thank god 
 
 did i hear someone else in the yard ginny asked 
 
 hermione and kingsley said harry 
 
 thank goodness ginny whispered they looked at each other harry wanted to hug her hold on to her he did not even care much that mrs weasley was there but before he could act on the impulse there was a great crash from the kitchen 
 
 ill prove who i am kingsley after ive seen my son now back off if you know whats good for you 
 
 harry had never heard mr weasley shout like that before he burst into the living room his bald patch gleaming with sweat his spectacles askew fred right behind him both pale but uninjured 
 
 arthur sobbed mrs weasley oh thank goodness 
 
 how is he 
 
 mr weasley dropped to his knees beside george for the first time since harry had known him fred seemed to be lost for words he gaped over the back of the sofa at his twins wound as if he could not believe what he was seeing 
 
 perhaps roused by the sound of fred and their fathers arrival george stirred 
 
 how do you feel georgie whispered mrs weasley 
 
 georges fingers groped for the side of his head 
 
 saintlike he murmured 
 
 whats wrong with him croaked fred looking terrified is his mind affected 
 
 saintlike repeated george opening his eyes and looking up at his brother you see im holy holey fred geddit 
 
 mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever color flooded freds pale face 
 
 pathetic he told george pathetic with the whole wide world of humor before you you go for holey 
 
 ah well said george grinning at his mother youll be able to tell us apart now anyway mum 
 
 he looked around 
 
 hi harry c you are harry right 
 
 yeah i am said harry moving closer to the sofa 
 
 well at least we got you back okay said george why arent ron and bill huddled round my sickbed 
 
 theyre not back yet george said mrs weasley georges grin faded harry glanced at ginny and motioned to her to accompany him back outside as they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice 
 
 ron and tonks should be back by now they didnt have a long journey auntie muriels not that far from here 
 
 harry said nothing he had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the burrow but now it enveloped him seeming to crawl over his skin throbbing in his chest clogging his throat as they walked down the back steps into the dark yard ginny took his hand 
 
 kingsley was striding backward and forward glancing up at the sky every time he turned harry was reminded of uncle vernon pacing the living room a million years ago hagrid hermione and lupin stood shoulder to shoulder gazing upward in silence none of them looked around when harry and ginny joined their silent vigil 
 
 the minutes stretched into what might as well have been years the slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing order members might leap unscathed from its leaves c 
 
 and then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground c 
 
 its them screamed hermione 
 
 tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere 
 
 remus tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into lupins arms his face was set and white he seemed unable to speak ron tripped dazedly toward harry and hermione 
 
 youre okay he mumbled before hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly 
 
 i thought c i thought c 
 
 m all right said ron patting her on the back m fine 
 
 ron was great said tonks warmly relinquishing her hold on lupin wonderful stunned one of the death eaters straight to the head and when youre aiming at a moving target from a flying broom c 
 
 you did said hermione gazing up at ron with her arms still around his neck 
 
 always the tone of surprise he said a little grumpily breaking free are we the last back 
 
 no said ginny were still waiting for bill and fleur and and mundungus im going to tell mum and dad youre okay ron c 
 
 she ran back inside 
 
 so what kept you what happened lupin sounded almost angry at tonks 
 
 bellatrix said tonks she wants me quite as much as she wants harry remus she tried very hard to kill me i just wish id got her i owe bellatrix but we definitely injured rodolphus then we got to rons auntie muriels and we missed our portkey and she was fussing over us c 
 
 a muscle was jumping in lupins jaw he nodded but seemed unable to say anything else 
 
 so what happened to you lot tonks asked turning to harry hermione and kingsley 
 
 they recounted the stories of their own journeys but all the time the continued absence of bill fleur and mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost its icy bite harder and harder to ignore 
 
 im going to have to get back to downing street i should have been there an hour ago said kingsley finally after a last sweeping gaze at the sky let me know when theyre back 
 
 lupin nodded with a wave to the others kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the gate harry thought he heard the faintest pop as kingsley disapparated just beyond the burrows boundaries 
 
 mr and mrs weasley came racing down the back steps ginny behind them both parents hugged ron before turning to lupin and tonks 
 
 thank you said mrs weasley for our sons 
 
 dont be silly molly said tonks at once 
 
 hows george asked lupin 
 
 whats wrong with him piped up ron 
 
 hes lost c 
 
 but the end of mrs weasleys sentence was drowned in a general outcry a thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few feet from them bill and fleur slid from its back windswept but unhurt 
 
 bill thank god thank god c 
 
 mrs weasley ran forward but the hug bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory looking directly at his father he said dead 
 
 nobody spoke nobody moved harry felt as though something inside him was falling falling through the earth leaving him forever 
 
 we saw it said bill fleur nodded tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window it happened just after we broke out of the circle and dung were close by us they were heading north too voldemort c he can fly c went straight for them dung panicked i heard him cry out tried to stop him but he disapparated voldemorts curse hit full in the face he fell backward off his broom and c there was nothing we could do nothing we had half a dozen of them on our own tail c 
 
 bills voice broke 
 
 of course you couldnt have done anything said lupin 
 
 they all stood looking at each other harry could not quite comprehend it dead it could not be so tough so brave the consummate survivor 
 
 at last it seemed to dawn on everyone though nobody said it that there was no point of waiting in the yard anymore and in silence they followed mr and mrs weasley back into the burrow and into the living room where fred and george were laughing together 
 
 whats wrong said fred scanning their faces as they entered whats happened whos c 
 
 said mr weasley dead 
 
 the twins grins turned to grimaces of shock nobody seemed to know what to do tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief she had been close to harry knew his favorite and his protge at the ministry of magic hagrid who had sat down on the floor in the corner where he had most space was dabbing at his eyes with his handkerchief 
 
 bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of and some glasses 
 
 here he said and with a wave of his wand eh sent twelve full glasses soaring through the room to each of them holding the thirteenth aloft 
 
 they all said and drank 
 
 echoed hagrid a little late with a hiccup the firewhisky seared harrys throat it seemed to burn feeling back into him dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality firing him with something that was like courage 
 
 so mundungus disappeared said lupin who had drained his own glass in one 
 
 the atmosphere changed at once everybody looked tense watching lupin both wanting him to go on it seemed to harry and slightly afraid of what they might hear 
 
 i know what youre thinking said bill and i wondered that too on the way back here because they seemed to be expecting us didnt they but mundungus cant have betrayed us they didnt know there would be seven harrys that confused them the moment we appeared and in case youve forgotten it was mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery why wouldnt he have told them the essential point i think dung panicked its as simple as that he didnt want to come in the first place but made him and went straight for them it was enough to make anyone panic 
 
 acted exactly as expected him to sniffed tonks said hed expect the real harry to be with the toughest most skilled aurors he chased first and when mundungus gave them away he switched to kingsley 
 
 yes and zat eez all very good snapped fleur but still eet does not explain ow zey know we were moving arry tonight does eet somebody must ave been careless somebody let slip ze date to an outsider it is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze ole plan 
 
 she glared around at them all tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face silently daring any of them to contradict her nobody did the only sound to break the silence was that of hagrid hiccupping from behind his handkerchief harry glanced at hagrid who had just risked his own life to save harrys c hagrid whom he loved whom he trusted who had once been tricked into giving voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragons egg 
 
 no harry said aloud and they all looked at him surprised the firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice i mean if somebody made a mistake harry went on and let something slip i know they didnt mean to do it its not their fault he repeated again a little louder than he would usually have spoken weve got to trust each other i trust all of you i dont think anyone in this room would ever sell me to voldemort 
 
 more silence followed his words they were all looking at him harry felt a little hot again and drank some more firewhisky for something to do as he drank he thought of had always been scathing about dumbledores willingness to trust people 
 
 well said harry said fred unexpectedly 
 
 year ear ear said george with half a glance at fred the corner of whose mouth twitched 
 
 lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at harry it was close to pitying 
 
 you think im a fool demanded harry 
 
 no i think youre like james said lupin who would have regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends 
 
 harry knew what lupin was getting at that his father had been betrayed by his friend peter pettigrew he felt irrationally angry he wanted to argue but lupin had turned away from him set down his glass upon a side table and addressed bill theres work to do i can ask kingsley whether c 
 
 no said bill at once ill do it ill come 
 
 where are you going said tonks and fleur together 
 
 body said lupin we need to recover it 
 
 cant it c began mrs weasley with an appealing look at bill 
 
 wait said bill not unless youd rather the death eaters took it 
 
 nobody spoke lupin and bill said good bye and left 
 
 the rest of them now dropped into chairs all except for harry who remained standing the suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence 
 
 ive got to go too said harry 
 
 ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him 
 
 dont be silly harry said mrs weasley what are you talking about 
 
 i cant stay here 
 
 he rubbed his forehead it was prickling again he had not hurt like this for more than a year 
 
 youre all in danger while im here i dont want c 
 
 but dont be so silly said mrs weasley the whole point of tonight was to get you here safely and thank goodness it worked and fleurs agreed to get married here rather than in france weve arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you c 
 
 she did not understand she was making him feel worse not better 
 
 if voldemort finds out im here c 
 
 but why should he asked mrs weasley 
 
 there are a dozen places you might be now harry said mr weasley hes got no way of knowing which safe house youre in 
 
 its not me im worried for said harry 
 
 we know that said mr weasley quietly but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left 
 
 yer not goin anywhere growled hagrid blimey harry after all we wen through ter get you here 
 
 yeah what about my bleeding ear said george hoisting himself up on his cushions 
 
 i know that c 
 
 wouldnt want c 
 
 i know harry bellowed 
 
 he felt beleaguered and blackmailed did they think he did not know what they had done for him didnt they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now before they had to suffer any more on his behalf there was a long and awkward silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb and which was broken at last by mrs weasley 
 
 wheres hedwig harry she said coaxingly we can put her up with pidwidgeon and give her something to eat 
 
 his insides clenched like a fist he could not tell her the truth he drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering 
 
 wait till it gets out yeh did it again harry said hagrid escaped him fought him off when he was right on top of yeh 
 
 it wasnt me said harry flatly it was my wand my wand acted of its own accord 
 
 after a few moments hermione said gently but thats impossible harry you mean that you did magic without meaning to you reacted instinctively 
 
 no said harry the bike was falling i couldnt have told you where voldemort was but my wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him and it wasnt even a spell i recognized ive never made gold flames appear before 
 
 often said mr weasley when youre in a pressured situation you can produce magic you never dreamed of small children often find before theyre trained c 
 
 it wasnt like that said harry through gritted teeth his scar was burning he felt angry and frustrated he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match voldemorts 
 
 no one said anything he knew that they did not believe him now that he came to think of it he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before 
 
 his scar seared with pain it was all he could do not to moan aloud muttering about fresh air he set down his glass and left the room 
 
 as he crossed the yard the great skeletal thestral looked up c rustled its enormous batlike wings then resumed its grazing harry stopped at the gate into the garden staring out at its overgrown plants rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of dumbledore 
 
 dumbledore would have believed him he knew it dumbledore would have known how and why harrys wand had acted independently because dumbledore always had the answers he had known about wands had explained to harry the strange connection that existed between his wand and voldemorts but dumbledore like like sirius like his parents like his poor owl all were gone where harry could never talk to them again he felt a burning in his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky 
 
 and then out of nowhere the pain in his scar peaked as he clutched his forehead and closed his eyes a voice screamed inside his head 
 
 you told me the problem would be solved by using anothers wand 
 
 and into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying in rags upon a stone floor screaming a horrible scream a scream of unendurable agony 
 
 no no i beg you i beg you 
 
 you lied to lord voldemort ollivander 
 
 i did not i swear i did not 
 
 you sought to help potter to help him escape me 
 
 i swear i did not i believed a different wand would work 
 
 explain then what happened luciuss wand is destroyed 
 
 i cannot understand the connection exists only between your two wands 
 
 lies 
 
 please i beg you 
 
 and harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt voldemorts surge of vicious anger saw the frail old main on the floor writhe in agony c 
 
 harry 
 
 it was over as quickly as it had come harry stood shaking in the darkness clutching the gate into the garden his heart racing his scar still tingling it was several moments before he realized that ron and hermione were at his side 
 
 harry come back in the house hermione whispered you arent still thinking of leaving 
 
 yeah youve got to stay mate said ron thumping harry on the back 
 
 are you all right hermione asked close enough now to look into harrys face you look awful 
 
 well said harry shakily i probably look better than ollivander 
 
 when he had finished telling them what he had seen ron looked appalled but hermione downright terrified 
 
 but it was supposed to have stopped your scar c it wasnt supposed to do this anymore you mustnt let that connection open up again c dumbledore wanted you to close your mind 
 
 when he did not reply she gripped his arm 
 
 harry hes taking over the ministry and the newspapers and half the wizarding world dont let him inside your head too 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 a story from the 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 this story is from the or of jutland but it 
 does not begin there in the north but far away in the south in spain the wide sea is the highroad from nation to nation journey in thought then to sunny spain it is warm and beautiful there 
 the fiery pomegranate flowers peep from among dark laurels a cool 
 refreshing breeze from the mountains blows over the orange gardens 
 over the moorish halls with their golden cupolas and coloured walls 
 
 children go through the streets in procession with candles and 
 waving banners and the sky lofty and clear with its glittering 
 stars rises above them sounds of singing and castanets can be heard and youths and maidens dance upon the flowering acacia trees while even the beggar sits upon a block of marble refreshing himself with a juicy melon and dreamily enjoying life it all seems like a beautiful dream 
 
 here dwelt a newly married couple who completely gave themselves 
 up to the charm of life indeed they possessed every good thing they 
 could desire health and happiness riches and honour 
 
 we are as happy as human beings can be said the young couple 
 from the depths of their hearts they had indeed only one step 
 higher to mount on the ladder of happiness they hoped that god 
 would give them a child a son like them in form and spirit the happy 
 little one was to be welcomed with rejoicing to be cared for with 
 love and tenderness and enjoy every advantage of wealth and luxury 
 that a rich and influential family can give so the days went by 
 like a joyous festival 
 
 life is a gracious gift from god almost too great a gift for 
 us to appreciate said the young wife yet they say that fulness 
 of joy for ever and ever can only be found in the future life i 
 cannot realise it 
 
 the thought arises perhaps from the arrogance of men said the 
 husband it seems a great pride to believe that we shall live for 
 ever that we shall be as gods were not these the words of the 
 serpent the father of lies 
 
 surely you do not doubt the existence of a future life 
 exclaimed the young wife it seemed as if one of the first shadows 
 passed over her sunny thoughts 
 
 faith realises it and the priests tell us so replied her 
 husband but amid all my happiness i feel that it is arrogant to 
 demand a continuation of it another life after this has not so 
 much been given us in this world that we ought to be we must be 
 contented with it 
 
 yes it has been given to us said the young wife but this 
 life is nothing more than one long scene of trial and hardship to many 
 thousands how many have been cast into this world only to endure 
 poverty shame illness and misfortune if there were no future life 
 everything here would be too unequally divided and god would not be the personification of justice 
 
 the beggar there said her husband has joys of his own which 
 seem to him great and cause him as much pleasure as a king would find in the magnificence of his palace and then do you not think that 
 the beast of burden which suffers blows and hunger and works 
 itself to death suffers just as much from its miserable fate the 
 dumb creature might demand a future life also and declare the law 
 unjust that excludes it from the advantages of the higher creation 
 christ said in my house are many mansions she 
 answered heaven is as boundless as the love of our creator the dumb animal is also his creature and i firmly believe that no life will be lost but each will receive as much happiness as he can enjoy which will be sufficient for him 
 
 this world is sufficient for me said the husband throwing 
 his arm round his beautiful wife he sat by her side 
 on the open balcony smoking a cigarette in the cool air which was 
 loaded with the sweet scent of carnations and orange blossoms 
 sounds of music and the clatter of castanets came from the road 
 beneath the stars shone above then and two eyes full of affection 
 those of his wife looked upon him with the expression of undying 
 love such a moment he said makes it worth while to be born to 
 die and to be annihilated he smiled the young wife raised her hand 
 in gentle reproof and the shadow passed away from her mind and 
 they were happy quite happy 
 
 everything seemed to work together for their good they advanced 
 in honour in prosperity and in happiness a change came certainly 
 but it was only a change of place and not of circumstances 
 the young man was sent by his sovereign as ambassador to the 
 russian court this was an office of high dignity but his birth and 
 his acquirements entitled him to the honour he possessed a large 
 fortune and his wife had brought him wealth equal to his own for she 
 was the daughter of a rich and respected merchant one of this 
 largest and finest ships was to be sent that year to 
 stockholm and it was arranged that the dear young couple the 
 daughter and the should travel in it to st petersburg 
 all the arrangements on board were princely and silk and luxury on 
 every side 
 
 in an old war song called the king of son it says 
 farewell he said and sailed away 
 and many recollect that day 
 the ropes were of silk the anchor of gold 
 and everywhere riches and wealth untold 
 these words would aptly describe the vessel from spain for here 
 was the same luxury and the same parting thought naturally arose 
 god grant that we once more may meet 
 in sweet unclouded peace and joy 
 there was a favourable wind blowing as they left the spanish 
 coast and it would be but a short journey for they hoped to reach 
 their destination in a few weeks but when they came out upon the wide ocean the wind dropped the sea became smooth and shining and the stars shone brightly many festive evenings were spent on board at last the travellers began to wish for wind for a favourable breeze but their wish was useless not a breath of air stirred or if it 
 did arise it was contrary weeks passed by in this way two whole 
 months and then at length a fair wind blew from the the 
 ship sailed on the high seas between scotland and jutland then the 
 wind increased just as it did in the old song of the king of 
 son 
 mid storm and wind and pelting hail 
 their efforts were of no avail 
 the golden anchor forth they threw 
 towards denmark the west wind blew 
 this all happened a long time ago king christian vii who sat 
 on the danish throne was still a young man much has happened since then much has altered or been changed sea and moorland have been turned into green meadows stretches of heather have become arable land and in the shelter of the cottages and grow though they certainly require much care as the sharp west wind blows upon them in west jutland one may go back in thought to old times farther back than the days when christian vii ruled the purple heather still extends for miles with its barrows and aerial spectacles intersected with sandy uneven roads just as it did then towards the west where broad streams run into the bays are marshes and meadows encircled by lofty sandy hills which like a chain of alps raise their pointed summits near the sea they are only broken by high ridges of clay from which the sea year by year bites out great mouthfuls so that the overhanging banks fall down as if by the shock of an earthquake thus it is there today and thus it was long ago when the happy pair were sailing in the beautiful ship 
 it was a sunday towards the end of september the sun was 
 shining and the chiming of the church bells in the bay of nissum 
 was carried along by the breeze like a chain of sounds the churches 
 there are almost entirely built of hewn blocks of stone each like a 
 piece of rock the north sea might foam over them and they would not be disturbed nearly all of them are without steeples and the bells 
 are hung outside between two beams the service was over and the 
 congregation passed out into the churchyard where not a tree or 
 bush was to be seen no flowers were planted there and they had not 
 placed a single wreath upon any of the graves it is just the same 
 now rough mounds show where the dead have been buried and rank grass tossed by the wind grows thickly over the whole churchyard here and there a grave has a sort of monument a block of wood rudely cut in the shape of a coffin the blocks are brought from the forest of west jutland but the forest is the sea itself and the inhabitants find beams and planks and fragments which the waves have cast upon the beach one of these blocks had been placed by loving hands on a grave and one of the women who had come out of the church walked up to it she stood there her eyes resting on the memorial and a few moments afterwards her husband joined her they were both silent but he took her hand and they walked together across the purple heath over moor and meadow towards the sandhills for a long time they went on without speaking 
 
 it was a good sermon the man said at last if we had 
 not god to trust in we should have nothing 
 
 yes replied the woman he sends joy and sorrow and he has a 
 right to send them our little son would have been five 
 years old if we had been permitted to keep him 
 
 it is no use fretting wife said the man the boy is well 
 provided for he is where we hope and pray to go to 
 
 they said nothing more but went out towards their houses among 
 the all at once in front of one of the houses where the 
 sea grass did not keep the sand down with its twining roots what 
 seemed to be a column of smoke rose up a gust of wind rushed 
 between the hills hurling the particles of sand high into the air 
 another gust and the strings of fish hung up to dry flapped and 
 beat violently against the walls of the cottage then everything was 
 quiet once more and the sun shone with renewed heat 
 
 the man and his wife went into the cottage they had soon taken 
 off their sunday clothes and come out again hurrying over the dunes 
 which stood there like great waves of sand suddenly arrested in 
 their course while the sandweeds and dune grass with its bluish 
 stalks spread a changing colour over them a few neighbours also 
 came out and helped each other to draw the boats higher up on the 
 beach the wind now blew more keenly it was chilly and cold and when they went back over the sand and little sharp stones 
 blew into their faces the waves rose high crested with white foam 
 and the wind cut off their crests scattering the foam far and wide 
 evening came there was a swelling roar in the air a wailing or 
 moaning like the voices of despairing spirits that sounded above 
 the thunder of the waves the little cottage was on the 
 very margin and the sand rattled against the window panes every 
 now and then a violent gust of wind shook the house to its foundation 
 
 it was dark but about midnight the moon would rise later on the 
 air became clearer but the storm swept over the perturbed sea with 
 undiminished fury the fisher folks had long since gone to bed but in 
 such weather there was no chance of closing an eye presently there 
 was a tapping at the window the door was opened and a voice said 
 a large ship stranded on the farthest reef 
 
 in a moment the fisher people sprung from their beds and hastily 
 dressed themselves the moon had risen and it was light enough to 
 make the surrounding objects visible to those who could open their 
 eyes in the blinding clouds of sand the violence of the wind was 
 terrible and it was only possible to pass among the if one 
 crept forward between the gusts the salt spray flew up from the sea 
 like down and the ocean foamed like a roaring cataract towards the 
 beach only a practised eye could discern the vessel out in the 
 offing she was a fine brig and the waves now lifted her over the 
 reef three or four cables length out of the usual channel she drove 
 towards the shore struck on the second reef and remained fixed 
 it was impossible to render assistance the sea rushed in upon the 
 vessel making a clean breach over her those on shore thought they 
 heard cries for help from those on board and could plainly 
 distinguish the busy but useless efforts made by the stranded sailors 
 now a wave came rolling onward it fell with enormous force on the 
 bowsprit tearing it from the vessel and the stern was lifted high 
 above the water two people were seen to embrace and plunge together into the sea and the next moment one of the largest waves that rolled towards the threw a body on the beach it was a woman the sailors said that she was quite dead but the women thought they saw signs of life in her so the stranger was carried across the to the cottage how beautiful and fair she was 
 
 she must be a great lady they said 
 
 they laid her upon the humble bed there was not a yard of linen 
 on it only a woollen coverlet to keep the occupant warm 
 life returned to her but she was delirious and knew nothing of 
 what had happened or where she was and it was better so for 
 everything she loved and valued lay buried in the sea the same 
 thing happened to her ship as to the one spoken of in the song about 
 the king of son 
 alas how terrible to see 
 the gallant bark sink rapidly 
 fragments of the wreck and pieces of wood were washed ashore they were all that remained of the vessel the wind still blew violently on the coast 
 
 for a few moments the strange lady seemed to rest but she awoke 
 in pain and uttered cries of anguish and fear she opened her 
 wonderfully beautiful eyes and spoke a few words but nobody 
 understood her and lo as a reward for the sorrow and suffering 
 she had undergone she held in her arms a babe the child 
 that was to have rested upon a magnificent couch draped with silken 
 curtains in a luxurious home it was to have been welcomed with joy 
 to a life rich in all the good things of this world and now heaven 
 had ordained that it should be born in this humble retreat that it 
 should not even receive a kiss from its mother for when the 
 wife laid the child upon the bosom it rested 
 on a heart that beat no more she was dead 
 
 the child that was to have been reared amid wealth and luxury 
 was cast into the world washed by the sea among the to 
 share the fate and hardships of the poor 
 
 here we are reminded again of the song about the king of 
 son for in it mention is made of the custom prevalent at 
 the time when knights and squires plundered those who had been 
 saved from shipwreck the ship had stranded some distance south of 
 nissum bay and the cruel inhuman days when as we have just said 
 the inhabitants of jutland treated the shipwrecked people so crudely 
 were past long ago affectionate sympathy and for 
 the unfortunate existed then just as it does in our own time in 
 many a bright example the dying mother and the unfortunate child 
 would have found kindness and help wherever they had been cast by 
 the winds but nowhere would it have been more sincere than in the 
 cottage of the poor wife who had stood only the day 
 before beside her grave who would have been five years old 
 that day if god had spared it to her 
 
 no one knew who the dead stranger was they could not even form 
 a conjecture the fragments of wreckage gave no clue to the matter 
 no tidings reached spain of the fate of the daughter and 
 they did not arrive at their destination and violent 
 storms had raged during the past weeks at last the verdict was given 
 foundered at sea all lost but in the cottage among the 
 near hunsby there lived a little scion of the rich spanish 
 family 
 
 where heaven sends food for two a third can manage to find a 
 meal and in the depth of the sea there is many a dish of fish for the 
 hungry 
 
 they called the boy jurgen 
 
 it must certainly be a jewish child its skin is so dark the 
 people said 
 
 it might be an italian or a spaniard remarked the clergyman 
 but to the wife these nations seemed all the same and 
 she consoled herself with the thought that the child was baptized as a 
 christian 
 
 the boy throve the noble blood in his veins was warm and he 
 became strong on his homely fare he grew apace in the humble cottage and the danish dialect spoken by the west jutes became his language 
 
 the pomegranate seed from spain became a hardy plant on the coast of west jutland thus may circumstances alter the course of a life 
 
 to this home he clung with affection he was to experience cold and hunger and the misfortunes and hardships that surround the poor but he also tasted of their joys 
 
 childhood has bright days for every one and the memory of them 
 shines through the whole the boy had many sources of 
 pleasure and enjoyment the coast for miles and miles was full of 
 playthings for it was a mosaic of pebbles some red as coral or 
 yellow as amber and others again white and rounded like birds eggs 
 and smoothed and prepared by the sea even the bleached fishes 
 skeletons the water plants dried by the wind and seaweed white 
 and shining long bands waving between the stones all these 
 seemed made to give pleasure and occupation for the thoughts 
 and he had an intelligent mind many great talents lay dormant in him 
 how readily he remembered stories and songs that he heard and how 
 dexterous he was with his fingers with stones and he 
 could put together pictures and ships with which one could decorate 
 the room and he could make wonderful things from a stick his 
 said although he was still so young and little he 
 had a sweet voice and every melody seemed to flow naturally from 
 his lips and in his heart were hidden chords which might have 
 sounded far out into the world if he had been placed anywhere else 
 than in the hut by the north sea 
 
 one day another ship was wrecked on the coast and among other 
 things a chest filled with valuable flower bulbs was washed ashore 
 some were put into saucepans and cooked for they were thought to be fit to eat and others lay and shrivelled in the sand they did not 
 accomplish their purpose or unfold their magnificent colours would 
 jurgen fare better the flower bulbs had soon played their part but 
 he had years of apprenticeship before him neither he nor his 
 friends noticed in what a monotonous uniform way one day followed 
 another for there was always plenty to do and see the ocean itself 
 was a great and it unfolded a new leaf each day of calm 
 or storm the crested wave or the smooth surface 
 
 the visits to the church were festive occasions but among the 
 house one was especially looked forward to this was in 
 fact the visit of the brother of the 
 from fjaltring near bovbjerg he came twice a year in a 
 cart painted red with blue and white tulips upon it and full of 
 eels it was covered and locked like a box two dun oxen drew it 
 and jurgen was allowed to guide them 
 
 the was a witty fellow a merry guest and brought a 
 measure of brandy with him they all received a small glassful or a 
 cupful if there were not enough glasses even jurgen had about a 
 thimbleful that he might digest the fat eel as the said 
 he always told one story over and over again and if his hearers 
 laughed he would immediately repeat it to them jurgen while still a 
 boy and also when he was older used phrases from the 
 story on various occasions so it will be as well for us to listen 
 to it it runs thus 
 
 the eels went into the bay and the young ones begged leave to go 
 a little farther out go too far said their mother the ugly 
 might come and snap you all up but they went too far 
 and of eight daughters only three came back to the mother and these 
 wept and said we only went a little way out and the ugly 
 came immediately and stabbed five of our sisters to 
 death come back again said the mother eel oh no 
 exclaimed the daughters for he skinned them cut them in two and 
 fried them oh come back again the mother eel 
 persisted no replied the daughters for he ate them up 
 come back again repeated the mother eel but he drank brandy 
 after them said the daughters ah then never come back 
 said the mother and she burst out crying the brandy that 
 buries the eels 
 
 and therefore said the in conclusion it is always 
 the proper thing to drink brandy after eating eels 
 this story was the tinsel thread the most humorous recollection 
 of life he also wanted to go a little way farther out and up 
 the bay that is to say out into the world in a ship but his 
 mother said like the there are so many bad people 
 eel spearers he wished to go a little way past the out 
 into the dunes and at last he did four happy days the brightest 
 of his childhood fell to his lot and the whole beauty and 
 splendour of jutland all the happiness and sunshine of his home were concentrated in these he went to a festival but it was a burial 
 feast 
 
 a rich relation of the family had died the farm was 
 situated far eastward in the country and a little towards the north 
 foster parents went there and he also went with them from 
 the dunes over heath and moor where the skjaerumaa takes its 
 course through green meadows and contains many eels mother eels 
 live there with their daughters who are caught and eaten up by wicked 
 people but do not men sometimes act quite as cruelly towards their 
 own was not the knight sir bugge murdered by wicked 
 people and though he was well spoken of did he not also wish to kill the architect who built the castle for him with its thick walls and 
 tower at the point where the skjaerumaa falls into the bay jurgen 
 and his parents now stood there the wall and the ramparts still 
 remained and red crumbling fragments lay scattered around here it 
 was that sir bugge after the architect had left him said to one of 
 his men go after him and say master the tower shakes if he 
 turns round kill him and take away the money i paid him but if he 
 does not turn round let him go in peace the man did as he was 
 told the architect did not turn round but called back the tower 
 does not shake in the least but one day a man will come from the west in a blue cloak he will cause it to shake and so indeed it happened a hundred years later for the north sea broke in and cast down the tower but predbjorn gyldenstjerne the man who then possessed the castle built a new castle higher up at the end of the meadow and that one is standing to this day and is called 
 
 jurgen and his foster parents went past this castle they had told 
 him its story during the long winter evenings and now he saw the 
 stately edifice with its double moat and trees and bushes the wall 
 covered with ferns rose within the moat but the lofty 
 were the most beautiful of all they grew up to the highest windows 
 and the air was full of their sweet fragrance in a 
 corner of the garden stood a great bush full of blossom like winter 
 snow amid the green it was a juniper bush the first that 
 jurgen had ever seen in bloom he never forgot it nor the 
 the soul treasured up these memories of beauty and fragrance 
 to gladden the old man 
 
 from where the juniper blossomed the journey 
 became more pleasant for they met some other people who were also 
 going to the funeral and were riding in waggons our travellers had to 
 sit all together on a little box at the back of the waggon but even 
 this they thought was better than walking so they continued their 
 journey across the rugged heath the oxen which drew the waggon 
 stopped every now and then where a patch of fresh grass appeared amid the heather the sun shone with considerable heat and it was 
 wonderful to behold how in the far distance something like smoke 
 seemed to be rising yet this smoke was clearer than the air it was 
 transparent and looked like rays of light rolling and dancing afar 
 over the heath 
 
 that is lokeman driving his sheep said some one 
 and this was enough to excite imagination he felt as 
 if they were now about to enter fairyland though everything was still 
 real how quiet it was the heath stretched far and wide around them 
 like a beautiful carpet the heather was in blossom and the 
 and fresh oak saplings rose like bouquets from the 
 earth an inviting place for a frolic if it had not been for the 
 number of poisonous adders of which the travellers spoke they also 
 mentioned that the place had formerly been infested with wolves and 
 that the district was still called wolfsborg for this reason the 
 old man who was driving the oxen told them that in the lifetime of his 
 father the horses had many a hard battle with the wild beasts that 
 were now exterminated one morning when he himself had gone out to bring in the horses he found one of them standing with its forefeet 
 on a wolf it had killed but the savage animal had torn and 
 lacerated the brave legs 
 
 the journey over the heath and the deep sand was only too 
 quickly at an end they stopped before the house of mourning where 
 they found plenty of guests within and without waggon after waggon 
 stood side by side while the horses and oxen had been turned out to 
 graze on the scanty pasture great like those at home by 
 the north sea rose behind the house and extended far and wide how had they come here so many miles inland they were as large and high as those on the coast and the wind had carried them there there was also a legend attached to them 
 
 psalms were sung and a few of the old people shed tears with 
 this exception the guests were cheerful enough it seemed to 
 jurgen and there was plenty to eat and drink there were eels of 
 the fattest requiring brandy to bury them as the said 
 and certainly they did not forget to carry out his maxim here 
 jurgen went in and out the house and on the third day he felt 
 as much at home as he did in the cottage among the 
 where he had passed his early days here on the heath were riches unknown to him until now for flowers blackberries and 
 bilberries were to be found in profusion so large and sweet that when 
 they were crushed beneath the tread of the heather was 
 stained with their red juice here was a barrow and yonder another 
 then columns of smoke rose into the still air it was a heath fire 
 they told him how brightly it blazed in the dark evening 
 the fourth day came and the funeral festivities were at an end 
 they were to go back from the to the 
 ours are better said the old fisherman 
 these have no strength 
 
 and they spoke of the way in which the had come inland 
 and it seemed very easy to understand this is how they explained it 
 a dead body had been found on the coast and the peasants buried 
 it in the churchyard from that time the sand began to fly about and 
 the sea broke in with violence a wise man in the district advised 
 them to open the grave and see if the buried man was not lying sucking his thumb for if so he must be a sailor and the sea would not rest until it had got him back the grave was opened and he really was found with his thumb in his mouth so they laid him upon a cart and harnessed two oxen to it and the oxen ran off with the sailor over heath and moor to the ocean as if they had been stung by an adder 
 
 then the sand ceased to fly inland but the hills that had been 
 piled up still remained 
 
 all this jurgen listened to and treasured up in his memory of 
 the happiest days of his childhood the days of the burial feast 
 how delightful it was to see fresh places and to mix with 
 strangers and he was to go still farther for he was not yet fourteen 
 years old when he went out in a ship to see the world he 
 encountered bad weather heavy seas unkindness and hard men such were his experiences for he became cold nights bad living and blows had to be endured then he felt his noble spanish blood boil within him and bitter angry words rose to his lips but he gulped them down it was better although he felt as the eel must feel when it is skinned cut up and put into the 
 i shall get over it said a voice within him 
 
 he saw the spanish coast the native land of his parents he 
 even saw the town where they had lived in joy and prosperity but he 
 knew nothing of his home or his relations and his relations knew just 
 as little about him 
 
 the poor ship boy was not permitted to land but on the last day 
 of their stay he managed to get ashore there were several purchases 
 to be made and he was sent to carry them on board 
 
 jurgen stood there in his shabby clothes which looked as if they 
 had been washed in the ditch and dried in the chimney he who had 
 always dwelt among the now saw a great city for the 
 first time how lofty the houses seemed and what a number of people there were in the streets some pushing this way some that a perfect maelstrom of citizens and peasants monks and soldiers the jingling of bells on the trappings of asses and mules the chiming of church bells calling shouting hammering and knocking all going on at once every trade was located in the basement of the houses or in 
 the side thoroughfares and the sun shone with such heat and the 
 air was so close that one seemed to be in an oven full of beetles 
 cockchafers bees and flies all humming and buzzing together 
 jurgen scarcely knew where he was or which way he went then he saw just in front of him the great doorway of a cathedral the lights were gleaming in the dark aisles and the fragrance of incense was wafted towards him even the poorest beggar ventured up the steps into the sanctuary jurgen followed the sailor he was with into the church and stood in the sacred edifice coloured pictures gleamed from their golden background and on the altar stood the figure of the virgin with the child jesus surrounded by lights and flowers priests in festive robes were chanting and choir boys in dazzling attire swung 
 silver censers what splendour and magnificence he saw there it 
 streamed in upon his soul and overpowered him the church and the 
 faith of his parents surrounded him and touched a chord in his 
 heart that caused his eyes to overflow with tears 
 
 they went from the church to the here a quantity 
 of provisions were given him to carry the way to the harbour was 
 long and weary and overcome with various emotions he rested for a 
 few moments before a splendid house with marble pillars statues and broad steps here he rested his burden against the wall then a porter in livery came out lifted up a cane and drove him away him the grandson of that house but no one knew that and he just as little as any one then he went on board again and once more encountered rough words and blows much work and little was his experience of life they say it is good to suffer in 
 young days if age brings something to make up for it 
 
 his period of service on board the ship came to an end and the 
 vessel lay once more at ringkjobing in jutland he came ashore and 
 went home to the near hunsby but his had 
 died during his absence 
 
 a hard winter followed this summer swept over land 
 and sea and there was difficulty in getting from one place to 
 another how unequally things are distributed in this world here 
 there was bitter cold and while in spain there was 
 burning sunshine and oppressive heat yet when a clear frosty day 
 came and jurgen saw the swans flying in numbers from the sea 
 towards the land across to it seemed to him that 
 people could breathe more freely here the summer also in this part of 
 the world was splendid in imagination he saw the heath blossom and 
 become purple with rich juicy berries and the and 
 at norre vosborg in flower he made up his mind to go there again 
 
 spring came and the fishing began jurgen was now an active 
 helper in this for he had grown during the last year and was quick 
 at work he was full of life and knew how to swim to tread water 
 and to turn over and tumble in the strong tide they often warned 
 him to beware of the sharks which seize the best swimmer draw him 
 down and devour him but such was not to be fate 
 
 at a house in the dunes there was a boy named 
 martin with whom jurgen was on very friendly terms and they both 
 took service in the same ship to norway and also went together to 
 holland they never had a quarrel but a person can be easily 
 excited to quarrel when he is naturally hot tempered for he often 
 shows it in many ways and this is just what jurgen did one day when 
 they fell out about the merest trifle they were sitting behind the 
 cabin door eating from a delft plate which they had placed between 
 them jurgen held his in his hand and raised it towards 
 martin and at the same time became ashy pale and his eyes had an 
 ugly look martin only said ah ah you are one of that sort are 
 you fond of using the knife 
 
 the words were scarcely spoken when hand sank down he 
 did not answer a syllable but went on eating and afterwards returned 
 to his work when they were resting again he walked up to martin and 
 said 
 
 hit me in the face i deserve it but sometimes i feel as if i 
 had a pot in me that boils over 
 there let the thing rest replied martin 
 
 and after that they were almost better friends than ever when 
 afterwards they returned to the dunes and began telling their 
 adventures this was told among the rest martin said that jurgen 
 was certainly passionate but a good fellow after all 
 
 they were both young and healthy and strong but 
 jurgen was the cleverer of the two 
 
 in norway the peasants go into the mountains and take the cattle 
 there to find pasture on the west coast of jutland huts have been 
 erected among the they are built of pieces of wreck and 
 thatched with turf and heather there are sleeping places round the 
 walls and here the fishermen live and sleep during the early 
 spring every fisherman has a female helper or manager as she is 
 called who baits his hooks prepares warm beer for him when he 
 comes ashore and gets the dinner cooked and ready for him by the time he comes back to the hut tired and hungry besides this the managers bring up the fish from the boats cut them open prepare them and have generally a great deal to do 
 
 jurgen his father and several other fishermen and their managers 
 inhabited the same hut martin lived in the next one 
 one of the girls whose name was else had known jurgen from 
 childhood they were glad to see each other and were of the same 
 opinion on many points but in appearance they were entirely opposite for he was dark and she was pale and fair and had flaxen hair and eyes as blue as the sea in sunshine 
 
 as they were walking together one day jurgen held her hand very 
 firmly in his and she said to him 
 
 jurgen i have something i want to say to you let me be your 
 manager for you are like a brother to me but martin whose 
 housekeeper i am he is my lover but you need not tell this to the 
 others 
 
 it seemed to jurgen as if the loose sand was giving way under 
 his feet he did not speak a word but nodded his head and that meant yes it was all that was necessary but he suddenly felt in his 
 heart that he hated martin and the more he thought the more he felt 
 convinced that martin had stolen away from him the only being he 
 ever loved and that this was else he had never thought of else in 
 this way before but now it all became plain to him 
 
 when the sea is rather rough and the fishermen are coming home in 
 their great boats it is wonderful to see how they cross the reefs 
 one of them stands upright in the bow of the boat and the others 
 watch him sitting with the oars in their hands outside the reef it 
 looks as if the boat was not approaching land but going back to sea 
 then the man who is standing up gives them the signal that the great 
 wave is coming which is to float them across the reef the boat is 
 lifted high into the air so that the keel is seen from the shore the 
 next moment nothing can be seen mast keel and people are all 
 hidden it seems as though the sea had devoured them but in a few 
 moments they emerge like a great sea animal climbing up the waves and the oars move as if the creature had legs the second and third reef are passed in the same manner then the fishermen jump into the 
 water and push the boat towards the shore every wave helps them 
 and at length they have it drawn up beyond the reach of the breakers 
 
 a wrong order given in front of the reef the slightest hesitation and the boat would be lost then it would be all over with me and martin too this thought passed through mind one day while they 
 were out at sea where his had been taken suddenly 
 ill the fever had seized him they were only a few oars strokes from 
 the reef and jurgen sprang from his seat and stood up in the bow 
 me come he said and he glanced at martin and across 
 the waves every oar bent with the exertions of the rowers as the 
 great wave came towards them and he saw his pale face and 
 dared not obey the evil impulse that had shot through his brain the 
 boat came safely across the reef to land but the evil thought 
 remained in his heart and roused up every little fibre of 
 bitterness which he remembered between himself and martin since they had known each other but he could not weave the fibres together nor did he endeavour to do so he felt that martin had robbed him and this was enough to make him hate his former friend several of the fishermen saw this but martin did not he remained as obliging and talkative as ever in fact he talked rather too much 
 
 took to his bed and it became his for he died a week afterwards and now jurgen was heir to the little house behind the it was small certainly but still it was something and martin had nothing of the kind 
 
 you will not go to sea again jurgen i suppose observed one of 
 the old fishermen you will always stay with us now 
 but this was not intention he wanted to see something of 
 the world the of fjaltring had an uncle at old skjagen 
 who was a fisherman but also a prosperous merchant with ships upon the sea he was said to be a good old man and it would not be a bad thing to enter his service old skjagen lies in the extreme north of jutland as far away from the hunsby dunes as one can travel in that country and this is just what pleased jurgen for he did not want 
 to remain till the wedding of martin and else which would take 
 place in a week or two 
 
 the old fisherman said it was foolish to go away for now that 
 jurgen had a home else would very likely be inclined to take him 
 instead of martin 
 
 jurgen gave such a vague answer that it was not easy to make out 
 what he meant the old man brought else to him and she said 
 you have a home now you ought to think of that 
 
 and jurgen thought of many things 
 
 the sea has heavy waves but there are heavier waves in the 
 human heart many thoughts strong and weak rushed through brain and he said to else 
 
 if martin had a house like mine which of us would you rather 
 have 
 but martin has no house and cannot get one 
 suppose he had one 
 well then i would certainly take martin for that is what my 
 heart tells me but one cannot live upon love 
 
 jurgen turned these things over in his mind all night something 
 was working within him he hardly knew what it was but it was even 
 stronger than his love for else and so he went to and 
 what he said and did there was well considered he let the house to 
 martin on most liberal terms saying that he wished to go to sea 
 again because he loved it and else kissed him when she heard of 
 it for she loved martin best 
 
 jurgen proposed to start early in the morning and on the 
 evening before his departure when it was already getting rather late 
 he felt a wish to visit martin once more he started and among the 
 dunes met the old fisherman who was angry at his leaving the place 
 
 the old man made jokes about martin and declared there must be some magic about that fellow of whom the girls were so fond 
 jurgen did not pay any attention to his remarks but said 
 to the old man and went on towards the house where martin dwelt 
 he heard loud talking inside martin was not alone and this made 
 jurgen waver in his determination for he did not wish to see else 
 again on second thoughts he decided that it was better not to hear 
 any more thanks from martin and so he turned back 
 
 on the following morning before the sun rose he fastened his 
 knapsack on his back took his wooden provision box in his hand and went away among the towards the coast path this way was more pleasant than the heavy sand road and besides it was shorter and he intended to go first to fjaltring near bovbjerg where the lived to whom he had promised a visit 
 
 the sea lay before him clear and blue and the mussel shells 
 and pebbles the playthings of his childhood crunched over his 
 feet while he thus walked on his nose suddenly began to bleed it was a trifling occurrence but trifles sometimes are of great 
 importance a few large drops of blood fell upon one of his sleeves 
 
 he wiped them off and stopped the bleeding and it seemed to him as if this had cleared and lightened his brain the bloomed here 
 and there in the sand as he passed he broke off a spray and stuck 
 it in his hat he determined to be merry and for he was 
 going out into the wide world a little way out beyond the bay 
 as the young eels had said beware of bad people who will catch 
 you and skin you and put you in the he repeated in 
 his mind and smiled for he thought he should find his way through 
 the world good courage is a strong weapon 
 
 the sun was high in the heavens when he approached the narrow 
 entrance to nissum bay he looked back and saw a couple of horsemen galloping a long distance behind him and there were other people with them but this did not concern him 
 
 the was on the opposite side of the bay jurgen 
 called to the and the latter came over with his boat 
 jurgen stepped in but before he had got across the men whom he had seen riding so hastily came up hailed the and commanded him to return in the name of the law jurgen did not 
 understand the reason of this but he thought it would be best to turn 
 back and therefore he himself took an oar and returned as soon as 
 the boat touched the shore the men sprang on board and before he was aware of it they had bound his hands with a rope 
 
 this wicked deed will cost you your life they said it is a 
 good thing we have caught you 
 
 he was accused of nothing less than murder martin had been 
 found dead with his throat cut one of the fishermen late on the 
 previous evening had met jurgen going towards house this 
 was not the first time jurgen had raised his knife against martin 
 so they felt sure that he was the murderer the prison was in a town 
 at a great distance and the wind was contrary for going there by sea 
 but it would not take half an hour to get across the bay and 
 another quarter of an hour would bring them to the 
 great castle with ramparts and moat one of captors was a 
 fisherman a brother of the keeper of the castle and he said it might 
 be managed that jurgen should be placed for the present in the dungeon at vosborg where long martha the gipsy had been shut up till her execution they paid no attention to defence the few drops of blood on his bore heavy witness against him 
 
 but he was conscious of his innocence and as there was no chance of clearing himself at present he submitted to his fate 
 
 the party landed just at the place where sir castle had 
 stood and where jurgen had walked with his after the 
 burial feast during the four happiest days of his childhood he 
 was led by the path over the meadow to vosborg once 
 more the elders were in bloom and the lofty gave forth 
 sweet fragrance and it seemed as if it were but yesterday that he had 
 last seen the spot in each of the two wings of the castle there was a 
 staircase which led to a place below the entrance from whence there 
 is access to a low vaulted cellar in this dungeon long martha had 
 been imprisoned and from here she was led away to the scaffold she had eaten the hearts of five children and had imagined that if she 
 could obtain two more she would be able to fly and make herself 
 invisible in the middle of the roof of the cellar there was a 
 little narrow but no window the flowering lime trees 
 could not breathe refreshing fragrance into that abode where 
 everything was dark and mouldy there was only a rough bench in the cell but a good conscience is a soft pillow and therefore jurgen 
 could sleep well 
 
 the thick oaken door was locked and secured on the outside by 
 an iron bar but the goblin of superstition can creep through a 
 keyhole into a castle just as easily as it can into a 
 cottage and why should he not creep in here where jurgen sat thinking of long martha and her wicked deeds her last thoughts on the night before her execution had filled this place and the magic that tradition asserted to have been practised here in sir 
 time came into mind and made him shudder but a sunbeam a refreshing thought from without penetrated his heart 
 even here it was the remembrance of the flowering elder and the sweet smelling 
 
 he was not left there long they took him away to the town of 
 ringkjobing where he was imprisoned with equal severity 
 those times were not like ours the common people were treated 
 harshly and it was just after the days when farms were converted into 
 knights estates when coachmen and servants were often made 
 magistrates and had power to sentence a poor man for a small 
 offence to lose his property and to corporeal punishment judges of 
 this kind were still to be found and in jutland so far from the 
 capital and from the enlightened head of the 
 government the law was still very loosely administered sometimes the smallest grievance jurgen could expect was that his case should be delayed 
 
 his dwelling was cold and comfortless and how long would he be 
 obliged to bear all this it seemed his fate to suffer misfortune 
 and sorrow innocently he now had plenty of time to reflect on the 
 difference of fortune on earth and to wonder why this fate had been 
 allotted to him yet he felt sure that all would be made clear in 
 the next life the existence that awaits us when this life is over 
 his faith had grown strong in the poor cottage the 
 light which had never shone into his mind in all the 
 richness and sunshine of spain was sent to him to be his comfort in 
 poverty and distress a sign of that mercy of god which never fails 
 the spring storms began to blow the rolling and moaning of the 
 north sea could be heard for miles inland when the wind was blowing and then it sounded like the rushing of a thousand waggons over a hard road with a mine underneath jurgen heard these sounds in his prison and it was a relief to him no music could have touched his heart as did these sounds of the sea the rolling sea the boundless 
 sea on which a man can be borne across the world before the wind 
 carrying his own house with him wherever he goes just as the snail 
 carries its home even into a strange country 
 
 he listened eagerly to its deep murmur and then the thought arose 
 free free how happy to be free even barefooted and in ragged 
 clothes sometimes when such thoughts crossed his mind the fiery 
 nature rose within him and he beat the wall with his clenched fists 
 weeks months a whole year had gone by when niels the thief 
 called also a was arrested and now better times came 
 and it was seen that jurgen had been wrongly accused 
 
 on the afternoon before departure from home and before 
 the murder niels the thief had met martin at a in the 
 neighbourhood of ringkjobing a few glasses were drank not enough to cloud the brain but enough to loosen tongue he began to boast and to say that he had obtained a house and intended to marry and when niels asked him where he was going to get the money he slapped his pocket proudly and said 
 
 the money is here where it ought to be 
 this boast cost him his life for when he went home niels followed 
 him and cut his throat intending to rob the murdered man of the 
 gold which did not exist 
 all this was circumstantially explained but it is enough for us 
 to know that jurgen was set free but what compensation did he get for having been imprisoned a whole year and shut out from all 
 communication with his fellow creatures they told him he was 
 fortunate in being proved innocent and that he might go the 
 burgomaster gave him two dollars for travelling expenses and many 
 citizens offered him provisions and beer there were still good 
 people they were not all hard and pitiless but the best thing of all 
 was that the merchant bronne of skjagen into whose service jurgen 
 had proposed entering the year before was just at that time on 
 business in the town of ringkjobing bronne heard the whole story 
 he was and understood what jurgen must have felt and 
 suffered therefore he made up his mind to make it up to the poor lad and convince him that there were still kind folks in the world 
 so jurgen went forth from prison as if to paradise to find 
 freedom affection and trust he was to travel this path now for 
 no goblet of life is all bitterness no good man would pour out such a 
 draught for his and how should he do it who is love 
 personified 
 
 let everything be buried and forgotten said bronne the 
 merchant let us draw a thick line through last year we will even 
 burn the almanack in two days we will start for dear friendly 
 peaceful skjagen people call it an corner but it is a 
 good warm and its windows open toward every part of the world 
 
 what a journey that was it was like taking fresh breath out of 
 the cold dungeon air into the warm sunshine the heather bloomed in 
 pride and beauty and the sat on a barrow and blew his 
 pipe which he had carved for himself out of a sheep bone fata 
 morgana the beautiful aerial phenomenon of the wilderness appeared 
 with hanging gardens and waving forests and the wonderful cloud 
 called lokeman driving his sheep also was seen 
 
 up towards skjagen they went through the land of the wendels 
 whence the men with long beards the longobardi or lombards had 
 emigrated in the reign of king snio when all the children and old 
 people were to have been killed till the noble dame gambaruk proposed that the young people should emigrate jurgen knew all this he had some little knowledge and although he did not know the land of the lombards beyond the lofty alps he had an idea that it must be 
 there for in his boyhood he had been in the south in spain he 
 thought of the plenteousness of the southern fruit of the red 
 pomegranate flowers of the humming buzzing and toiling in the great beehive of a city he had seen but home is the best place after all and home was denmark 
 
 at last they arrived at vendilskaga as skjagen is called in old 
 norwegian and icelandic writings at that time old skjagen with the 
 eastern and western town extended for miles with sand hills and 
 arable land as far as the lighthouse near grenen then as now 
 the houses were strewn among the a 
 wilderness in which the wind sports with the sand and where the voice of the and wild swan strikes harshly on the ear 
 
 
 in the a mile from grenen lies old skjagen 
 merchant bronne dwelt here and this was also to be home 
 for the future the was tarred and all the small 
 had been put together from pieces of wreck there was no fence for indeed there was nothing to fence in except the long rows of fishes which were hung upon lines one above the other to dry in the wind the entire coast was strewn with spoiled herrings for there were so many of these fish that a net was scarcely thrown into the sea before it was filled they were caught by carloads and many of them were either thrown back into the sea or left to lie on the beach 
 
 the old wife and daughter and his servants also came to meet 
 him with great rejoicing there was a great squeezing of hands and 
 talking and questioning and the daughter what a sweet face and 
 bright eyes she had 
 
 the inside of the house was comfortable and roomy fritters 
 that a king would have looked upon as a dainty dish were placed on 
 the table and there was wine from the skjagen vineyard that is 
 the sea for there the grapes come ashore ready pressed and prepared 
 in barrels and in bottles 
 
 when the mother and daughter heard who jurgen was and how 
 innocently he had suffered they looked at him in a still more 
 friendly way and pretty eyes had a look of especial 
 interest as she listened to his story jurgen found a happy home in 
 old skjagen it did his heart good for it had been sorely tried he 
 had drunk the bitter goblet of love which softens or hardens the 
 heart according to circumstances heart was still soft it 
 was young and therefore it was a good thing that miss clara was going in three weeks time to christiansand in norway in her ship to visit an aunt and to stay there the whole winter 
 on the sunday before she went away they all went to church to the 
 
 holy communion the church was large and handsome and had been built centuries before by scotchmen and dutchmen it stood some little way out of the town it was rather ruinous certainly and the road to it was heavy through deep sand but the people gladly surmounted these difficulties to get to the house of god to sing psalms and to hear the sermon the sand had heaped itself up round the walls of the church but the graves were kept free from it 
 it was the largest church north of the limfjorden the virgin 
 mary with a golden crown on her head and the child jesus in her arms stood lifelike on the altar the holy apostles had been carved in 
 the choir and on the walls there were portraits of the old 
 burgomasters and councillors of skjagen the pulpit was of carved 
 work the sun shone brightly into the church and its radiance fell on 
 the polished brass chandelier and on the little ship that hung from 
 the vaulted roof 
 
 jurgen felt overcome by a holy childlike feeling like that which 
 possessed him when as a boy he stood in the splendid spanish 
 cathedral but here the feeling was different for he felt conscious 
 of being one of the congregation 
 
 after the sermon followed holy communion he partook of the 
 bread and wine and it so happened that he knelt by the side of miss 
 clara but his thoughts were so fixed upon heaven and the holy 
 sacrament that he did not notice his neighbour until he rose from 
 his knees and then he saw tears rolling down her cheeks 
 
 she left skjagen and went to norway two days later he remained 
 behind and made himself useful on the farm and at the fishery he 
 went out fishing and in those days fish were more plentiful and 
 larger than they are now the shoals of the mackerel glittered in 
 the dark nights and indicated where they were swimming the 
 gurnards snarled and the crabs gave forth pitiful yells when they 
 were chased for fish are not so mute as people say 
 
 every sunday jurgen went to church and when his eyes rested on 
 the picture of the virgin mary over the altar as he sat there they 
 often glided away to the spot where they had knelt side by side 
 autumn came and brought rain and snow with it the water rose 
 up right into the town of skjagen the sand could not suck it all 
 in one had to wade through it or go by boat the storms threw 
 vessel after vessel on the fatal reefs there were and 
 the sand flew up to the houses blocking the entrances 
 so that people had to creep up through the chimneys that was 
 nothing at all remarkable here it was pleasant and cheerful 
 indoors where peat fuel and fragments of wood from the wrecks 
 blazed and crackled upon the hearth merchant bronne read aloud 
 from an old chronicle about prince hamlet of denmark who had come over from england landed near bovbjerg and fought a battle close by ramme was his grave only a few miles from the place where the lived hundreds of barrow rose there from the heath forming as it were an enormous churchyard merchant bronne had himself been at grave they spoke about old times and about their neighbours the english and the scotch and jurgen sang the air of the king of son and of his splendid ship and its outfit 
 in the hour of peril when most men fear 
 he clasped the bride that he held so dear 
 and proved himself the son of a king 
 of his courage and valour let us sing 
 this verse jurgen sang with so much feeling that his eyes 
 beamed and they were black and sparkling since his infancy 
 there was wealth comfort and happiness even among the domestic 
 animals for they were all well cared for and well kept the 
 kitchen looked bright with its copper and tin utensils and white 
 plates and from the rafters hung hams beef and winter stores in 
 plenty this can still be seen in many rich farms on the west coast of 
 jutland plenty to eat and drink clean prettily decorated rooms 
 active minds cheerful tempers and hospitality can be found there as 
 in an tent 
 
 jurgen had never spent such a happy time since the famous burial 
 feast and yet miss clara was absent except in the thoughts and 
 memory of all 
 
 in april a ship was to start for norway and jurgen was to sail in 
 it he was full of life and spirits and looked so sturdy and well 
 that dame bronne said it did her good to see him 
 
 and it does one good to look at you also old wife said the 
 merchant jurgen has brought fresh life into our winter evenings and 
 into you too mother you look younger than ever this year and seem 
 well and cheerful but then you were once the prettiest girl in 
 viborg and that is saying a great deal for i have always found the 
 viborg girls the prettiest of any 
 
 jurgen said nothing but he thought of a certain maiden of 
 skjagen whom he was soon to visit the ship set sail for 
 christiansand in norway and as the wind was favourable it soon 
 arrived there 
 
 one morning merchant bronne went out to the lighthouse which 
 stands a little way out of old skjagen not far from grenen the 
 light was out and the sun was already high in the heavens when he 
 mounted the tower the extend a whole mile from the 
 shore beneath the water outside these banks many ships could be 
 seen that day and with the aid of his telescope the old man thought 
 he descried his own ship the karen bronne yes certainly there 
 she was sailing homewards with clara and jurgen on board 
 
 clara sat on deck and saw the gradually appearing in 
 the distance the church and lighthouse looked like a heron and a swan rising from the blue waters if the wind held good they might reach home in about an hour so near they were to home and all its near to death and all its terrors a plank in the ship gave way 
 and the water rushed in the crew flew to the pumps and did their 
 best to stop the leak a signal of distress was hoisted but they were 
 still fully a mile from the shore some fishing boats were in sight 
 but they were too far off to be of any use the wind blew towards 
 the land the tide was in their favour but it was all useless the 
 ship could not be saved 
 
 jurgen threw his right arm round clara and pressed her to him 
 with what a look she gazed up into his face as with a prayer to god 
 for help he breasted the waves which rushed over the sinking ship 
 she uttered a cry but she felt safe and certain that he would not 
 leave her to sink and in this hour of terror and danger jurgen felt 
 as the son did as told in the old song 
 in the hour of peril when most men fear 
 he clasped the bride that he held so dear 
 how glad he felt that he was a good swimmer he worked his way 
 onward with his feet and one arm while he held the young girl up 
 firmly with the other he rested on the waves he trod the water in 
 fact did everything he could think of in order not to fatigue 
 himself and to reserve strength enough to reach land he heard 
 clara sigh and felt her shudder convulsively and he pressed her more closely to him now and then a wave rolled over them the current lifted them the water although deep was so clear that for a 
 moment he imagined he saw the shoals of mackerel glittering or 
 leviathan himself ready to swallow them now the clouds cast a 
 shadow over the water then again came the playing sunbeams flocks of loudly screaming birds passed over him and the plump and lazy wild ducks which allow themselves to be drifted by the waves rose up 
 terrified at the sight of the swimmer he began to feel his strength 
 decreasing but he was only a few cable lengths distance from the 
 shore and help was coming for a boat was approaching him at this 
 moment he distinctly saw a white staring figure under the water a 
 wave lifted him up and he came nearer to the figure he felt a 
 violent shock and everything became dark around him 
 
 on the sand reef lay the wreck of a ship which was covered with 
 water at high tide the white figure head rested against the anchor 
 the sharp iron edge of which rose just above the surface jurgen had 
 come in contact with this the tide had driven him against it with 
 great force he sank down stunned with the blow but the next wave 
 lifted him and the young girl up again some fishermen coming with 
 a boat seized them and dragged them into it the blood streamed 
 down over face he seemed dead but still held the young girl 
 so tightly that they were obliged to take her from him by force she 
 was pale and lifeless they laid her in the boat and rowed as quickly 
 as possible to the shore they tried every means to restore clara to 
 life but it was all of no avail jurgen had been swimming for some 
 distance with a corpse in his arms and had exhausted his strength for 
 one who was dead 
 
 jurgen still breathed so the fishermen carried him to the nearest 
 house upon the where a smith and general dealer lived 
 who knew something of surgery and bound up wounds in a 
 temporary way until a surgeon could be obtained from the nearest 
 town the next day the injured brain was affected and in his 
 delirium he uttered wild cries but on the third day he lay quiet 
 and weak upon his bed his life seemed to hang by a thread and the 
 physician said it would be better for him if this thread broke let 
 us pray that god may take him he said for he will never be the 
 same man again 
 
 but life did not depart from him the thread would not break 
 but the thread of memory was severed the thread of his mind had 
 been cut through and what was still more grievous a body remained a living healthy body that wandered about like a troubled spirit 
 
 jurgen remained in merchant house he was hurt while 
 endeavouring to save our child said the old man and now he is 
 our son people called jurgen insane but that was not exactly the 
 correct term he was like an instrument in which the strings are loose 
 and will give no sound only occasionally they regained their power 
 for a few minutes and then they sounded as they used to do he 
 would sing snatches of songs or old melodies pictures of the past 
 would rise before him and then disappear in the mist as it were but 
 as a general rule he sat staring into vacancy without a thought we 
 may conjecture that he did not suffer but his dark eyes lost their 
 brightness and looked like clouded glass 
 
 poor mad jurgen said the people and this was the end of a life 
 whose infancy was to have been surrounded with wealth and splendour had his parents lived all his great mental abilities had been lost nothing but hardship sorrow and disappointment had been his fate 
 he was like a rare plant torn from its native soil and tossed upon 
 the beach to wither there and was this one of creatures 
 fashioned in his own likeness to have no better fate was he to be 
 only the plaything of fortune no the creator would 
 certainly repay him in the life to come for what he had suffered and 
 lost here the lord is good to all and his mercy is over all his 
 works the pious old wife of the merchant repeated these words from the psalms of david in patience and hope and the prayer of her 
 heart was that jurgen might soon be called away to enter into 
 eternal life 
 
 in the churchyard where the walls were surrounded with sand 
 clara lay buried jurgen did not seem to know this it did not enter 
 his mind which could only retain fragments of the past every 
 sunday he went to church with the old people and sat there 
 silently staring vacantly before him one day when the psalms were 
 being sung he sighed deeply and his eyes became bright they were 
 fixed upon a place near the altar where he had knelt with his friend 
 who was dead he murmured her name and became deadly pale and 
 tears rolled down his cheeks they led him out of church he told 
 those standing round him that he was well and had never been ill he 
 who had been so grievously afflicted the outcast thrown upon the 
 world could not remember his sufferings the lord our creator is wise and full of loving kindness who can doubt it 
 
 in spain where balmy breezes blow over the moorish cupolas and 
 gently stir the orange and myrtle groves where singing and the 
 sound of the castanets are always heard the richest merchant in the 
 place a childless old man sat in a luxurious house while children 
 marched in procession through the streets with waving flags and 
 lighted tapers if he had been able to press his children to his 
 heart his daughter or her child that had perhaps never seen the 
 light of day far less the kingdom of heaven how much of his wealth 
 would he not have given poor child yes poor child a child still 
 yet more than thirty years old for jurgen had arrived at this age 
 in old skjagen 
 
 the shifting sands had covered the graves in the courtyard 
 quite up to the church walls but still the dead must be buried among 
 their relatives and the dear ones who had gone before them merchant 
 bronne and his wife now rested with their children under the white 
 sand 
 
 it was in the spring the season of storms the sand from the 
 dunes was whirled up in clouds the sea was rough and flocks of birds flew like clouds in the storm screaming across the 
 shipwreck followed upon shipwreck on the reefs between old skagen and the hunsby dunes 
 
 one evening jurgen sat in his room alone all at once his mind 
 seemed to become clearer and a restless feeling came over him such 
 as had often in his younger days driven him out to wander over the 
 or on the heath home home he cried no one heard 
 him he went out and walked towards the dunes sand and stones blew into his face and whirled round him he went in the direction of 
 the church the sand was banked up the walls half covering the 
 windows but it had been cleared away in front of the door and the 
 entrance was free and easy to open so jurgen went into the church 
 
 the storm raged over the town of skjagen there had not been 
 such a terrible tempest within the memory of the inhabitants nor such 
 a rough sea but jurgen was in the temple of god and while the 
 darkness of night reigned outside a light arose in his soul that 
 was never to depart from it the heavy weight that pressed on his 
 brain burst asunder he fancied he heard the organ but it was only 
 the storm and the moaning of the sea he sat down on one of the seats and lo the candies were lighted one by one and there was 
 brightness and grandeur such as he had only seen in the spanish 
 cathedral the portraits of the old citizens became alive stepped 
 down from the walls against which they had hung for centuries and 
 took seats near the church door the gates flew open and all the dead people from the churchyard came in and filled the church while 
 beautiful music sounded then the melody of the psalm burst forth 
 like the sound of the waters and jurgen saw that his foster parents 
 from the hunsby dunes were there also old merchant bronne with his 
 wife and their daughter clara who gave him her hand they both went up to the altar where they had knelt before and the priest joined 
 their hands and united them for life then music was heard again it 
 was wonderfully sweet like a voice full of joy and 
 expectation swelling to the powerful tones of a full organ sometimes 
 soft and sweet then like the sounds of a tempest delightful and 
 elevating to hear yet strong enough to burst the stone tombs of the 
 dead then the little ship that hung from the roof of the choir was 
 let down and looked wonderfully large and beautiful with its silken 
 sails and rigging 
 the ropes were of silk the anchor of gold 
 and everywhere riches and pomp the old song says 
 
 the young couple went on board accompanied by the whole 
 congregation for there was room and enjoyment for them all then 
 the walls and arches of the church were covered with flowering 
 junipers and lime trees breathing forth fragrance the branches waved 
 creating a pleasant coolness they bent and parted and the ship 
 sailed between them through the air and over the sea every candle 
 in the church became a star and the wind sang a hymn in which they 
 all joined through love to glory no life is lost the future is 
 full of blessings and happiness hallelujah these were the last 
 words jurgen uttered in this world for the thread that bound his 
 immortal soul was severed and nothing but the dead body lay in the 
 dark church while the storm raged outside covering it with loose 
 sand 
 
 the next day was sunday and the congregation and their pastor 
 went to the church the road had always been heavy but now it was 
 almost unfit for use and when they at last arrived at the church a 
 great heap of sand lay piled up in front of them the whole church was completely buried in sand the clergyman offered a short prayer and said that god had closed the door of his house here and that the 
 congregation must go and build a new one for him somewhere else so they sung a hymn in the open air and went home again 
 
 jurgen could not be found anywhere in the town of skjagen nor 
 on the dunes though they searched for him everywhere they came to the conclusion that one of the great waves which had rolled far up 
 on the beach had carried him away but his body lay buried in a 
 great sepulchre the church itself the lord had thrown down a 
 covering for his grave during the storm and the heavy mound of sand 
 lies upon it to this day the drifting sand had covered the vaulted 
 roof of the church the arched cloisters and the stone aisles the 
 white thorn and the dog rose now blossom above the place where the 
 church lies buried but the spire like an enormous monument over a 
 grave can be seen for miles round no king has a more splendid 
 memorial nothing disturbs the peaceful sleep of the dead i was the 
 first to hear this story for the storm sung it to me among the

 int cellblock five nd tier night 
 brooks hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell the 
 rolling library he finds red waiting for him red slips the 
 wrapped in a towel through the bars and onto the 
 cart next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage 
 red 
 dufresne 
 brooks nods never missing a beat he rolls his cart to cell mutters through the bars 
 brooks 
 middle shelf wrapped in a towel 
 hand snakes through the bars and makes the object disappear the hand comes back and deposits a small slip of folded paper along with more cigarettes brooks turns his cart around and goes back he pauses sorting his books long enough for red to snag the slip of paper brooks continues on scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket 
 int cell night 
 red unfolds the slip of paper penciled neatly on it is a single word thanks 
 int prison laundry day 
 we are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line 
 andy is doing his job getting good at it 
 bob 
 dufresne low on hexlite 
 head on back and fetch us up some 
 andy nods he leaves the line weaving his way through the laundry room and into 
 int back area day 
 a dark tangled maze of rooms and corridors boilers and furnaces sump pumps old washing machines pallets of cleaning supplies and detergents you name it andy hefts a cardboard drum of hexlite off the stack turns around 
 and finds bogs diamond in the aisle blocking his way rooster looms from the shadows to his right pete verness on the left a frozen beat andy slams the hexlite to the floor rips off the top and scoops out a double handful 
 andy 
 you get this in your eyes it blinds you 
 bogs 
 honey hush 
 andy backs up holding them at bay trying to maneuver through the maze the sisters keep coming tense and guarded eyes riveted and gauging his every move trying to outflank him andy trips on some old gaint sugglies all it takes on him in an instant kicking and stomping 
 andy gets yanked to his feet bogs applies a chokehold from behind they propel him across the room and slam him against an old machine bending him over it rooster jams a rag into mouth and secures it with a steel pipe like a horse bit andy kicks and struggles but rooster and pete have his arms firmly pinned bogs whispers in ear 
 bogs 
 it fight better that way 
 andy starts screaming muffled by the rag camera pulls back slowly widening the big washex blocks our view all we see is screaming face and the men holding him down 
 and camera drifts from the room leaving the dark place and the dingy act up empty corridors past 
 concrete walls and steel pipes 
 red 
 i wish i could tell you that andy fought the good fight and the sisters let him be i wish i could tell you that but prison is no world 
 we emerge into the prison laundry past a guard widening for 
 a final view of the line the giant steel mangler is slapping down in brutal rhythm the sound is deafening 
 red 
 he never said who did we all knew 
 prison montage through 
 andy plods through his days working eating chipping and 
 shaping his rocks after 
 red 
 things went on like that for a while prison life consists of routine and then more routine 
 andy walks the yard face swollen and bruised 
 red 
 every so often andy would show up with fresh bruises 
 andy eats breakfast a few tables over bogs blows him a kiss 
 red 
 the sisters kept at him sometimes he was able to fight them off 
 sometimes not 
 andy backs into a corner in some dingy part of the prison wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors 
 red 
 he always fought what i remember he fought because he knew if he fight it would make it that much easier not to fight 
 the next time 
 the rake connects snapping off over skull they beat the hell out of him 
 red 
 half the time it landed him in the infirmary 
 int solitary confinement the hole night 
 a stone closet no bed sink or lights just a toilet with no seat andy sits on bare concrete bruised face lit by a faint ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door 
 red 
 the other half it landed him in solitary warden grain 
 drain vacation bread water and all the privacy you could want 
 int prison laundry day 
 andy is working the line 
 red 
 and how it went for andy that was his routine i do believe those first two years were the worst for him and i also believe if things had gone on that way this place would have got the best of him but then in the spring of the decided that 
 ext prison yard day 
 warden norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn 
 norton 
 the roof of the factory needs resurfacing i need a dozen volunteers for a work gonna be taking names in this steel bucket here 
 red glances around at his friends andy also catches his eye 
 red 
 it was outdoor detail and may is one damn fine month to be workin 
 outdoors 
 ext prison yard day 
 cons shuffle past dropping slips of paper into a bucket 
 red 
 more than a hundred men volunteered for the job 
 red saunters to a guard named tim youngblood mutters 
 discreetly in his ear 
 ext prison yard day 
 youngblood is pulling names and reading them off red exchanges grins with andy and the others 
 red 
 you know it me and some fellas i know were among the names called 
 int prison corridor night 
 red slips youngblood six packs of cigarettes 
 red 
 only cost us a pack of smokes per man i made my usual twenty 
 percent of course 
 ext license plate factory day 
 a bubbles and smokes two cons dip up a bucket of 
 tar and tie a rope to the handle the rope goes taught camera 
 follows the bucket of tar up the side of the building to 
 the roof 
 where it is relayed to the work detail the men are dipping big padd brushes and spreading the tar anglz over to byron hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards

 statesman 
 
 by plato 
 
 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue theodorus socrates the eleatic 
 stranger the younger socrates 
 socrates i owe you many thanks indeed theodorus for the 
 acquaintance both of theaetetus and of the stranger 
 
 theodorus and in a little while socrates you will owe me three 
 times as many when they have completed for you the 
 delineation of the statesman and of the philosopher as well as of the sophist 
 
 soc sophist statesman philosopher o my dear theodorus do my 
 ears truly witness that this is the estimate formed of them by the 
 great calculator and geometrician 
 
 theod what do you mean socrates 
 
 soc i mean that you rate them all at the same value whereas they 
 are really separated by an interval which no geometrical ratio can 
 express 
 
 theod by ammon the god of cyrene socrates that is a very fair 
 hit and shows that you have not forgotten your geometry i will 
 retaliate on you at some other time but i must now ask the 
 stranger who will not i hope tire of his goodness to us 
 to proceed either with the statesman or with the philosopher whichever he prefers 
 
 stranger that is my duty theodorus having begun i must 
 go on and not leave the work unfinished but what shall be done with 
 theaetetus 
 theod in what respect 
 
 str shall we relieve him and take his companion the young 
 socrates instead of him what do you advise 
 
 theod yes give the other a turn as you propose the young 
 always do better when they have intervals of rest 
 
 soc i think stranger that both of them may be said to be in 
 some way related to me for the one as you affirm has the cut of 
 my ugly face the other is called by my name and we should always 
 be on the to recognize a kinsman by the style of his 
 conversation i myself was discoursing with theaetetus yesterday 
 and i have just been listening to his answers my namesake i have 
 not yet examined but i must another time will do for me 
 let him answer you 
 
 str very good young socrates do you hear what the elder 
 socrates is proposing 
 
 young socrates i do 
 
 str and do you agree to his proposal 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str as you do not object still less can i after the sophist 
 then i think that the statesman naturally follows next in the order 
 of enquiry and please to say whether he too should be 
 ranked among those who have science 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str then the sciences must be divided as before 
 
 y soc i dare say 
 
 str but yet the division will not be the same 
 
 y soc how then 
 
 str they will be divided at some other point 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str where shall we discover the path of the statesman we 
 must find and separate off and set our seal upon this and we will 
 set the mark of another class upon all diverging paths thus the soul 
 will conceive of ail kinds of knowledge under two classes 
 
 y soc to find the path is your business stranger and not mine 
 
 str yes socrates but the discovery when once made 
 must be yours as well as mine 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str well and are not arithmetic and certain other kindred arts 
 merely abstract knowledge wholly separated from action 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but in the art of carpentering and all other handicrafts the 
 knowledge of the workman is merged in his work he not only 
 knows but he also makes things which previously did not exist 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str then let us divide sciences in general into those which are 
 practical and those which intellectual 
 
 y soc let us assume these two divisions of science which is one 
 whole 
 
 str and are statesman king master or householder one 
 and the same or is there a science or art answering to each of 
 these names or rather allow me to put the matter in another way 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str if any one who is in a private station has the skill to 
 advise one of the public physicians must not he also be called a 
 physician 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and if any one who is in a private station is able to advise 
 the ruler of a country may not he be said to have the 
 knowledge which the ruler himself ought to have 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but surely the science of a true king is royal science 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and will not he who possesses this knowledge whether he 
 happens to be a ruler or a private man when regarded only in 
 reference to his art be truly called royal 
 
 y soc he certainly ought to be 
 
 str and the householder and master are the same 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str again a large household may be compared to a small 
 they differ at all as far as government is concerned 
 
 y soc they will not 
 
 str then returning to the point which we were just now 
 discussing do we not clearly see that there is one science of all of them and this science may be called either royal or political or 
 economical we will not quarrel with any one about the name 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str this too is evident that the king cannot do much with his 
 hands or with his whole body towards the maintenance of his 
 empire compared with what he does by the intelligence and 
 strength of his mind 
 
 y soc clearly not 
 
 str then shall we say that the king has a greater affinity to 
 knowledge than to manual arts and to practical life in general 
 
 y soc certainly he has 
 
 str then we may put all together as one and the 
 and the kingly science and the king 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str and now we shall only be proceeding in due order if 
 we go on to divide the sphere of knowledge 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str think whether you can find any joint or parting in knowledge 
 
 y soc tell me of what sort 
 
 str such as this you may remember that we made an art of 
 calculation 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str which was unmistakably one of the arts of knowledge 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and to this art of calculation which discerns the differences 
 of numbers shall we assign any other function except to pass 
 judgment on their differences 
 
 y soc how could we 
 
 str you know that the does not work himself but 
 is the ruler of workmen 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str he contributes knowledge not manual labour 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and may therefore be justly said to share in theoretical 
 science 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str but he ought not like the calculator to regard his 
 functions as at and when he has formed a must assign to the individual workmen their appropriate task until they have 
 completed the work 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str are not all such sciences no less than arithmetic and the 
 like subjects of pure knowledge and is not the difference between 
 the two classes that the one sort has the power of judging only 
 and the other of ruling as well 
 
 y soc that is evident 
 
 str may we not very properly say that of all knowledge there 
 are there are two which rules and the other which 
 judges 
 
 y soc i should think so 
 
 str and when men have anything to do in common that they 
 should be of one mind is surely a desirable thing 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then while we are at unity among ourselves we need not mind 
 about the fancies of others 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str and now in which of these divisions shall we place the 
 he a judge and a kind of spectator or shall we 
 assign to him the art of he is a ruler 
 
 y soc the latter clearly 
 str then we must see whether there is any mark of division in the 
 art of command too i am inclined to think that there is a 
 distinction similar to that of manufacturer and retail dealer which 
 parts off the king from the herald 
 
 y soc how is this 
 
 str why does not the retailer receive and sell over again the 
 productions of others which have been sold before 
 
 y soc certainly he does 
 
 str and is not the herald under command and does he not receive 
 orders and in his turn give them to others 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then shall we mingle the kingly art in the same class with 
 the art of the herald the interpreter the boatswain the prophet 
 and the numerous kindred arts which exercise command or as in the 
 preceding comparison we spoke of manufacturers or sellers for 
 themselves and of too that the class of supreme 
 rulers or rulers for themselves is almost we make a 
 word following the same analogy and refer kings to a supreme or 
 science leaving the rest to receive a name from 
 some one else for we are seeking the ruler and our enquiry is not 
 concerned with him who is not a ruler 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str thus a very fair distinction has been attained between the 
 man who gives his own commands and him who gives and now let us see if the supreme power allows of any further division 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str i think that it does and please to assist me in making the 
 division 
 
 y soc at what point 
 
 str may not all rulers be supposed to command for the sake of 
 producing something 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str nor is there any difficulty in dividing the things produced 
 into two classes 
 
 y soc how would you divide them 
 
 str of the whole class some have life and some are without life 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and by the help of this distinction we may make if we 
 please a subdivision of the section of knowledge which commands 
 
 y soc at what point 
 
 str one part may be set over the production of lifeless the 
 other of living objects and in this way the whole will be divided 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str that division then is complete and now we may leave one 
 half and take up the other which may also be divided into two 
 
 y soc which of the two halves do you men 
 
 str of course that which exercises command about animals for 
 surely the royal science is not like that of a a 
 science presiding over lifeless king has a nobler 
 function which is the management and control of living beings 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the breeding and tending of living beings may be observed 
 to be sometimes a tending of the individual in other cases a 
 common care of creatures in flocks 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but the statesman is not a tender of like the 
 driver or groom of a single ox or horse he is rather to be compared 
 with the keeper of a drove of horses or oxen 
 
 y soc yes i see thanks to you 
 
 str shall we call this art of tending many animals together the 
 art of managing a herd or the art of collective management 
 
 y soc no suggests itself to us in the course 
 of conversation 
 
 str very good socrates and if you continue to be not too 
 particular about names you will be all the richer in wisdom when 
 you are an old man and now as you say leaving the 
 discussion of the name can you see a way in which a person by showing the art of herding to be of two kinds may cause that which is now sought amongst twice the number of things to be then sought amongst half that number 
 
 y soc i will appears to me to be one management of 
 men and another of beasts 
 
 str you have certainly divided them in a most straightforward and 
 manly style but you have fallen into an error which hereafter i think 
 that we had better avoid 
 
 y soc what is the error 
 
 str i think that we had better not cut off a single small portion 
 which is not a species from many larger portions the part should 
 be a species to separate off at once the subject of investigation is 
 a most excellent plan if only the separation be rightly 
 made and you were under the impression that you were right because you saw that you would come to man and this led you to hasten the steps but you should not chip off too small a piece my friend the safer way is to cut through the middle which is also the more likely way of finding classes attention to this principle makes all the difference in a process of enquiry 
 
 y soc what do you mean stranger 
 
 str i will endeavour to speak more plainly out of love to 
 your good parts socrates and although i cannot at present entirely explain myself i will try as we proceed to make my meaning a little 
 clearer 
 
 y soc what was the error of which as you say we were guilty in 
 our recent division 
 
 str the error was just as if some one who wanted to divide the 
 human race were to divide them after the fashion which prevails in 
 this part of the world here they cut off the hellenes as 
 one species and all the other species of mankind which are innumerable and have no ties or common language they include under the single name of barbarians and because they have one name they are supposed to be of one species also or suppose that in dividing numbers you were to cut off ten thousand from all the rest and make of it one species comprehending the first under another separate name you might say that here too was a single class because you had given it a single name whereas you would make a much better and more equal and logical classification of numbers if you divided them into odd and even or of the human species if you divided them into male and female and only separated off lydians or phrygians or any other tribe and arrayed them against the rest of the world when you could no longer make a division into parts which were also classes 
 
 y soc very true but i wish that this distinction between a part 
 and a class could still be made somewhat plainer 
 
 str o socrates best of men you are imposing upon me a very 
 difficult task we have already digressed further from our original 
 intention than we ought and you would have us wander still further 
 away but we must now return to our subject and hereafter 
 when there is a leisure hour we will follow up the other track at the 
 same time i wish you to guard against imagining that you ever heard me declare 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str that a class and a part are distinct 
 
 y soc what did i hear then 
 
 str that a class is necessarily a part but there is no similar 
 necessity that a part should be a dass that is the view which i 
 should always wish you to attribute to me socrates 
 
 y soc so be it 
 
 str there is another thing which i should like to know 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str the point at which we digressed for if i am not 
 mistaken the exact place was at the question where you would divide the management of herds to this you appeared rather too ready to answer that them were two species of animals man being one and all brutes making up the other 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str i thought that in taking away a part you imagined that the 
 remainder formed a class because you were able to call them by the 
 common name of brutes 
 
 y soc that again is true 
 
 str suppose now o most courageous of dialecticians that 
 some wise and understanding creature such as a crane is reputed to 
 be were in imitation of you to make a similar division and set up cranes against all other animals to their own special glorification at the same time jumbling together all the others including man under the appellation of would be the sort of error which we must try to avoid 
 
 y soc how can we be safe 
 
 str if we do not divide the whole class of animals we shall be 
 less likely to fall into that error 
 
 y soc we had better not take the whole 
 
 str yes there lay the source of error in our former division 
 
 y soc how 
 
 str you remember how that part of the art of knowledge which was 
 concerned with command had to do with the rearing of living 
 mean with animals in herds 
 y soc yes 
 
 str in that case there was already implied a division of all 
 animals into tame and wild those whose nature can be tamed 
 are called tame and those which cannot be tamed are called wild 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the political science of which we are in search is and 
 ever was concerned with tame animals and is also confined to 
 gregarious animals 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but then ought not to divide as we did taking the 
 whole class at once neither let us be in too great haste to arrive 
 quickly at the political science for this mistake has already brought upon us the misfortune of which the proverb speaks 
 
 y soc what misfortune 
 
 str the misfortune of too much haste which is too little speed 
 
 y soc and all the better got what we deserved 
 
 str very well let us then begin again and endeavour to 
 divide the collective rearing of animals for probably the completion of the argument will best show what you are so anxious to know tell me then 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str have you ever heard as you very likely i do not 
 suppose that you ever actually visited the preserves 
 of fishes in the nile and in the ponds of the great king or you may have seen similar preserves in wells at home 
 
 y soc yes to be sure i have seen them and i have often heard 
 the others described 
 
 str and you may have heard also and may have by 
 report although you have not travelled in those regions of 
 nurseries of geese and cranes in the plains of thessaly 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str i asked you because here is a new division of the management 
 of herds into the management of land and of water herds 
 
 y soc there is 
 
 str and do you agree that we ought to divide the collective rearing 
 of herds into two corresponding parts the one the rearing of water 
 and the other the rearing of land herds 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str there is surely no need to ask which of these two contains 
 the royal art for it is evident to everybody 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str any one can divide the herds which feed on dry land 
 
 y soc how would you divide them 
 
 str i should distinguish between those which fly and those which 
 walk 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str and where shall we look for the political animal might not 
 an idiot so to speak know that he is a pedestrian 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str the art of managing the walking animal has to be further 
 divided just as you might have an even number 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str let me note that here appear in view two ways to that part or 
 class which the argument aims at one is speedier way 
 which cuts off a small portion and leaves a large the other agrees 
 better with the principle which we were laying down that as 
 far as we can we should divide in the middle but it is longer we can take either of them whichever we please 
 
 y soc cannot we have both ways 
 
 str together what a thing to ask but if you take them in turn 
 you clearly may 
 
 y soc then i should like to have them in turn 
 
 str there will be no difficulty as we are near the end if we 
 had been at the beginning or in the middle i should have 
 demurred to your request but now in accordance with your desire let us begin with the longer way while we are fresh we shall get on better and now attend to the division 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str the tame walking herding animals are distributed by 
 nature into two classes 
 
 y soc upon what principle 
 
 str the one grows horns and the other is without horns 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str suppose that you divide the science which manages pedestrian 
 animals into two corresponding parts and define them for if you 
 try to invent names for them you will find the intricacy too great 
 
 y soc how must i speak of them then 
 
 str in this way let the science of managing pedestrian animals 
 be divided into two parts and one part assigned to the 
 horned herd and the other to the herd that has no horns 
 
 y soc all that you say has been abundantly proved and may 
 therefore be assumed 
 
 str the king is clearly the shepherd a polled herd who have no 
 horns 
 
 y soc that is evident 
 
 str shall we break up this hornless herd into sections and 
 endeavour to assign to him what is his 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str shall we distinguish them by their having or not having 
 cloven feet or by their mixing or not mixing the breed you 
 know what i mean 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str i mean that horses and asses naturally breed from one another 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but the remainder of the hornless herd of tame 
 animals will not mix the breed 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and of which has the statesman the mixed or of the 
 unmixed race 
 
 y soc clearly of the unmixed 
 
 str i suppose that we must divide this again as before 
 
 y soc we must 
 
 str every tame and herding animal has now been split up with the 
 exception of two species for i hardly think that dogs should be 
 reckoned among gregarious animals 
 
 y soc certainly not but how shall we divide the two remaining 
 species 
 
 str there is a measure of difference which may be appropriately 
 employed by you and theaetetus who are students of geometry 
 
 y soc what is that 
 
 str the diameter and again the diameter of a diameter 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str how does man walk but as a diameter whose power is two feet 
 
 y soc just so 
 
 str and the power of the remaining kind being the power of twice 
 two feet may be said to be the diameter of our diameter 
 
 y soc certainly and now i think that i pretty nearly understand 
 you 
 
 str in these divisions socrates i descry what would make 
 another famous jest 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str human beings have come out in the same class with the freest 
 and airiest of creation and have been running a race with them 
 
 y soc i remark that very singular coincidence 
 
 str and would you not expect the slowest to arrive last 
 
 y soc indeed i should 
 
 str and there is a still more ridiculous consequence 
 that the king is found running about with the herd and in close 
 competition with the who of all mankind is most of an adept at the airy life 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str then here socrates is still clearer evidence of the truth 
 of what was said in the enquiry about the sophist 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str that the dialectical method is no respecter of persons and 
 does not set the great above the small but always arrives in her 
 own way at the truest result 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str and now i will not wait for you to ask the but will 
 of my own accord take you by the shorter road to the definition of a king 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str i say that we should have begun at first by dividing land 
 animals into biped and quadruped and since the winged herd and 
 that alone comes out in the same class with man should 
 divide bipeds into those which have feathers and those which have not and when they have been divided and the art of the management of mankind is brought to light the time will have come to produce our statesman and ruler and set him like a charioteer in his place and hand over to him the reins of state for that too is a vocation which belongs to him 
 
 y soc very good you have paid me the mean that you have 
 completed the argument and i suppose that you added the 
 digression by way of interest 
 
 str then now let us go back to the beginning and join the 
 links which together make the definition of the name of the 
 art 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str the science of pure knowledge had as we said originally a 
 part which was the science of rule or command and from this was 
 derived another part which was called on the 
 analogy of an important section of this was the 
 management of living animals and this again was further limited to 
 the manage merit of them in herds and again in herds of pedestrian 
 animals the chief division of the latter was the art of managing 
 pedestrian animals which are without horns this again has a part 
 which can only be comprehended under one term by joining together 
 three animals the only further 
 subdivision is the art of man has to do with bipeds 
 and is what we were seeking after and have now found being at once 
 the royal and political 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str and do you think socrates that we really have done as you 
 say 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str do you think i mean that we have really fulfilled our 
 has been a sort of discussion and yet the 
 investigation seems to me not to be perfectly worked out this is 
 where the enquiry fails 
 
 y soc i do not understand 
 
 str i will try to make the thought which is at this 
 moment present in my mind clearer to us both 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str there were many arts of shepherding and one of them was the 
 political which had the charge of one particular herd 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and this the argument defined to be the art of rearing not 
 horses or other brutes but the art of rearing man collectively 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str note however a difference which distinguishes the king from 
 all other shepherds 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str i want to ask whether any one of the other herdsmen has a 
 rival who professes and claims to share with him in the management 
 of the herd 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that merchants husbandmen providers of 
 food and also and physicians will all contend with the herdsmen of humanity whom we call statesmen declaring that they themselves have the care of rearing of managing mankind and 
 that they rear not only the common herd but also the rulers themselves 
 
 y soc are they not right in saying so 
 
 str very likely they may be and we will consider their claim 
 but we are certain of no one will raise a similar claim 
 as against the herdsman who is allowed on all hands to be the sole 
 and only feeder and physician of his herd he is also their 
 matchmaker and accoucheur no one else knows that department of science and he is their and musician as far as their nature is susceptible of such influences and no one can console and soothe his own herd better than he can either with the natural tones of 
 his voice or with instruments and the same may be said of tenders 
 of animals in general 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str but if this is as you say can our argument about the king be 
 true and unimpeachable were we right in selecting him out of ten 
 thousand other claimants to be the shepherd and rearer of the human 
 flock 
 
 y soc surely not 
 
 str had we not reason just to now apprehend that although we may 
 have described a sort of royal form we have not as yet accurately 
 worked out the true image of the statesman and that we cannot 
 reveal him as he truly is in his own nature until we have 
 disengaged and separated him from those who bang about him and claim to share in his prerogatives 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and that socrates is what we must do if we do not mean to 
 bring disgrace upon the argument at its close 
 
 y soc we must certainly avoid that 
 
 str then let us make a new beginning and travel by a different 
 road 
 
 y soc what road 
 
 str i think that we may have a little amusement there is a 
 famous tale of which a good portion may with advantage be 
 interwoven and then we may resume our series of divisions and proceed in the old path until we arrive at the desired summit shall we do as i say 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str listen then to a tale which a child would love to hear and 
 you are not too old for childish amusement 
 
 y soc let me hear 
 
 str there did really happen and will again happen like 
 many other events of which ancient tradition has preserved the record the portent which is traditionally said to have occurred in the 
 quarrel of atreus and thyestes you have heard no doubt and remember what they say happened at that time 
 
 y soc i suppose you to mean the token of the birth of the golden 
 lamb 
 
 str no not that but another part of the story which tells how 
 the sun and the stars once rose in the west and set in the east 
 and that the god reversed their motion and gave them that which 
 they now have as a testimony to the right of atreus 
 
 y soc yes there is that legend also 
 
 str again we have been often told of the reign of cronos 
 
 y soc yes very often 
 
 str did you ever hear that the men of former times were 
 earthborn and not begotten of one another 
 
 y soc yes that is another old tradition 
 
 str all these stories and ten thousand others which are 
 still more wonderful have a common origin many of them have been lost in the lapse of ages or are repeated only in a disconnected form but the origin of them is what no one has told and may as well be told now for the tale is suited to throw light on the nature of the king 
 
 y soc very good and i hope that you will give the whole story 
 and leave out nothing 
 
 str listen then there is a time when god himself guides 
 and helps to roll the world in its course and there is a time on the 
 completion of a certain cycle when he lets go and the world being 
 a living creature and having originally received intelligence from 
 its author and creator turns about and by an inherent necessity 
 revolves in the opposite direction 
 
 y soc why is that 
 
 str why because only the most divine things of all remain ever 
 unchanged and the same and body is not included in this 
 class heaven and the universe as we have termed them although they have been endowed by the creator with many glories partake of a bodily nature and therefore cannot be entirely free from perturbation but their motion is as far as possible single and in the same place and of the same kind and is therefore only subject to a reversal which is the least alteration possible for the lord of all moving things is alone able to move of himself and to think that he moves them at one time in one direction and at another time in another is blasphemy 
 hence we must not say that the world is either always or 
 all made to go round by god in two opposite courses or that 
 two gods 
 having opposite purposes make it move round but as i have already 
 said and this is the only remaining alternative the world is 
 guided at one time by an external power which is divine and receives 
 fresh life and immortality from the renewing hand of the creator 
 and again when let go moves spontaneously being set free at such 
 a time as to have during infinite cycles of years a reverse 
 movement this is due to its perfect balance to its vast 
 size and to the fact that it turns on the smallest pivot 
 
 y soc your account of the world seems to be very reasonable 
 indeed 
 
 str let us now reflect and try to gather from what has been said 
 the nature of the phenomenon which we affirmed to be the cause of 
 all these wonders it is this 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str the reversal which takes place from time to time of the 
 motion of the universe 
 
 y soc how is that the cause 
 
 str of all changes of the heavenly motions we may 
 consider this to be the greatest and most complete 
 
 y soc i should imagine so 
 
 str and it may be supposed to result in the greatest 
 changes to the human beings who are the inhabitants of the world at the time 
 
 y soc such changes would naturally occur 
 
 str and animals as we know survive with difficulty great and 
 serious changes of many different kinds when they come upon them at once 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str hence there necessarily occurs a great destruction of them 
 which extends also life of man few survivors of the race are 
 left and those who remain become the subjects of several novel and 
 remarkable phenomena and of one in particular which takes place at 
 the time when the transition is made to the cycle opposite to that 
 in which we are now living 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str the life of all animals first came to a standstill and the 
 mortal nature ceased to be or look older and was then reversed and 
 grew young and delicate the white locks of the aged darkened again 
 and the cheeks the bearded man became smooth and recovered their 
 former bloom the bodies of youths in their prime grew softer and 
 smaller continually by day and night returning and becoming 
 assimilated to the nature of a child in mind as well as 
 body in the succeeding stage they wasted away and wholly 
 disappeared 
 and the bodies of those who died by violence at that time quickly 
 passed through the like changes and in a few days were no more seen 
 
 y soc then how stranger were the animals created in those 
 days and in what way were they begotten of one another 
 
 str it is evident socrates that there was no such thing in the 
 then order of nature as the procreation of animals from one another 
 the race of which we hear in story was the one which 
 existed in those rose again from the ground and of this 
 tradition which is often unduly discredited our 
 ancestors who were nearest in point of time to the end of the last 
 period and came into being at the beginning of this are to us the 
 heralds and mark how consistent the sequel of the tale is after 
 the return of age to youth follows the return of the dead who are 
 lying in the earth to life simultaneously with the reversal of the 
 world the wheel of their generation has been turned back 
 and they are put together and rise and live in the opposite order unless god has carried any of them away to some other lot according to this tradition they of necessity sprang from the earth and have the name of and so the above legend clings to them 
 
 y soc certainly that is quite consistent with what has preceded 
 but tell me was the life which you said existed in the reign of 
 cronos in that cycle of the world or in this for the change in the 
 course of the stars and the sun must have occurred in both 
 
 str i see that you enter into my that blessed and 
 spontaneous life does not belong to the present cycle of the world 
 but to the previous one in which god superintended the whole 
 revolution of the universe and the several parts the universe were 
 distributed under the rule certain inferior deities as is the way in some places still there were demigods who were the shepherds of the various species and herds of animals and each one was in 
 all respects sufficient for those of whom he was the shepherd neither was there any violence or devouring of one another or war or quarrel among them and i might tell of ten thousand other blessings 
 which belonged to that dispensation the reason why the life of man was as tradition says spontaneous is as follows in those days god himself was their shepherd and ruled over them just as man over them who is by comparison a divine being still rules over the lower animals under him there were no forms of government or separate possession of women and children for all men rose again from the earth having no memory of the past and although they had nothing of this sort the earth gave them fruits in abundance which grew on trees and shrubs unbidden and were not planted by the hand of man and they dwelt naked and mostly in the open air for the temperature of their seasons was mild and they had no beds but lay on soft couches of grass which grew plentifully out of the earth such was the life of man in the days of cronos socrates the character of our present life which is said to be under zeus you know from your own 
 experience can you and will you determine which of them you deem the happier 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str then shall i determine for you as well as i can 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str suppose that the nurslings of cronos having this boundless 
 leisure and the power of holding intercourse not only with men 
 but with the brute creation had used all these advantages 
 with a view to philosophy conversing with the brutes as well as with 
 one another and learning of every nature which was gifted with any special power and was able to contribute some special experience to 
 the store of wisdom there would be no difficulty in deciding that they would be a thousand times happier than the men of our own day or 
 again if they had merely eaten and drunk until they were full and 
 told stories to one another and to the stories as are now attributed to this case also as i should imagine the answer would be easy but until some satisfactory witness can be found of the love of that age for knowledge and discussion we had better let the matter drop and give the reason why we have unearthed this tale 
 and then we shall be able to get on in the fulness of time when the change was to take place and the race had all perished and every soul had completed its proper cycle of births and been sown in the earth her appointed number of times the pilot of the universe let the helm go and retired to his place of view and then fate and innate desire reversed the motion of the world then also all the inferior deities who share the rule of the supreme power being informed of what was happening let go the parts of the world which were under their control and the world turning round with a sudden shock being impelled in an opposite direction from beginning to end was shaken by a mighty earthquake which wrought a new destruction of all manner of animals 
 afterwards when sufficient time had elapsed the tumult and confusion and earthquake ceased and the universal creature once more at peace attained to a calm and settle down into his own orderly and accustomed course having the charge and rule of himself and of all the creatures which are contained in him and executing as far as 
 he remembered them the instructions of his father and creator more 
 precisely at first but afterwords with less exactness the reason 
 of the falling off was the admixture of matter in him this was 
 inherent in the primal nature which was full of disorder until 
 attaining to the present order from god the constructor the world 
 received all that is good in him but from a previous state came 
 elements of evil and unrighteousness which thence derived first 
 of all passed into the world and were then transmitted to the 
 animals while the world was aided by the pilot in nurturing the 
 animals the evil was small and great the good which he 
 produced but after the separation when the world was let go at first all proceeded well enough but as time went there was more and more forgetting and the old discord again held sway and burst forth in full glory and at last small was the good and great was the 
 admixture of evil and there was a danger of universal ruin to the 
 world and the things contained in him wherefore god the orderer 
 of all in his tender care seeing that the world was in great 
 straits and fearing that all might be dissolved in the storm and 
 disappear in infinite chaos again seated himself at the helm and 
 bringing back the elements which had fallen into dissolution and 
 disorder to the motion which had prevailed under his dispensation 
 he set them in order and restored them and made the world 
 imperishable and immortal 
 and this is the whole tale of which the first part will suffice 
 to illustrate the nature of the king for when the world turned 
 towards the present cycle of generation the age of man again stood 
 still and a change opposite to the previous one was the result the 
 small creatures which had almost disappeared grew in and stature 
 and the children of the earth became grey and 
 died and sank into the earth again all things changed imitating and following the condition of the universe and of necessity agreeing with that in their mode of conception and generation and nurture for 
 no animal was any longer allowed to come into being in the earth through the agency of other creative beings but as the world was ordained to be the lord of his own progress in like manner the parts were ordained to grow and generate and give nourishment as far as they could of themselves impelled by a similar movement and so we have arrived at the real end of this discourse for although there might be much to tell of the lower animals and of the condition out of which they changed and of the causes of the change about men there is not much and that little is more to the purpose deprived of the care of god who had possessed and tended them they were left 
 helpless and defenceless and were torn in pieces by the beasts who were naturally fierce and had now grown wild and in the first ages they were still without skill or resource the food which once grew 
 spontaneously had failed and as yet they knew not how to procure 
 it because never felt the pressure of necessity for all 
 these reasons they were in a great strait wherefore also the gifts 
 spoken of in the old tradition were imparted to man by the gods 
 together with so much teaching and education as was indispensable 
 fire was given to them by prometheus the arts by hephaestus and his 
 athene seeds and plants by others from these is 
 derived all that has helped to frame human life since the 
 care of the gods as i was saying had now failed men and they had to order their course of life for themselves and were their own masters just like the universal creature whom they imitate and follow ever changing as he changes and ever living and growing at one time in one manner and at another time in another enough of the story which may be of use in showing us how greatly we erred in the delineation of the king and the statesman in our previous discourse 
 
 y soc what was this great error of which you speak 
 
 str there were two the first a lesser one the other was an 
 error on a much larger and grander scale 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i mean to say that when we were asked about a king and 
 statesman of the present and generation we told of a shepherd of a 
 human flock who belonged to the other cycle and of one who was a 
 god when he ought to have been a man and this a great error again 
 we declared him to be the ruler of the entire state without 
 explaining how this was not the whole truth nor very intelligible 
 but still it was true and therefore the second error was not so 
 great as the first 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str before we can expect to have a perfect description of the 
 statesman we must define the nature of his office 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and the myth was introduced in order to show not 
 only that all others are rivals of true shepherd who is the object of our search but in order that we might have a clearer view of him who is alone worthy to receive this appellation because he alone of 
 shepherds and herdsmen according to the image which we have employed has the care of human beings 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and i cannot help thinking socrates that the form of the 
 divine shepherd is even higher than that of a king whereas the 
 statesmen who are now on earth seem to be much more like their 
 subjects in character and which more nearly to partake of their 
 breeding and education 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str still they must be investigated all the same to see whether 
 like the divine shepherd they are above their subjects or on a 
 level with them 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str to you remember that we spoke of a 
 exercised over animals not singly but 
 collectively which we called the art of rearing a herd 
 
 y soc yes i remember 
 
 str there somewhere lay our error for we never included or 
 mentioned the statesman and we did not observe that he had no place in our nomenclature 
 
 y soc how was that 
 
 str all other herdsmen rear their herds but this is not a 
 suitable term to apply to the statesman we should use a 
 name which is common to them all 
 
 y soc true if there be such a name 
 
 str why is not care of herds applicable to all for 
 this implies no feeding or any special duty if we say either tending 
 the herds or managing the herds or having the care of them the same word will include all and then we may wrap up the statesman with the rest as the argument seems to require 
 
 y soc quite right but how shall we take step in the 
 division 
 
 str as before we divided the art of rearing herds accordingly 
 as they were land or water herds winged and wingless mixing or not 
 mixing the breed horned and hornless so we may divide by these 
 same differences the teading of herds comprehending in our 
 definition the kingship of and the rule of cronos 
 
 y soc that is clear but i still ask what is to follow 
 
 str if the word had been managing herds instead of feeding or 
 rearing them no one would have argued that there was no care of men in the case of the politician although it was justly contended 
 that there was no human art of feeding them which was worthy of the 
 name or at least if there were many a man had a prior and greater 
 right to share in such an art than any king 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but no other art or science will have a prior or better right 
 than the royal science to care for human society and to rule over 
 men in general 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str in the next place socrates we must surely notice 
 that a great error was committed at the end of our analysis 
 
 y soc what was it 
 
 str why supposing we were ever so sure that there is such an art 
 as the art of rearing or feeding bipeds there was no reason why we 
 should call this the royal or political art as though there were no 
 more to be said 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str our first duty as we were saying was to remodel the name 
 so as to have the notion of care rather than of feeding and then to 
 divide for there may be still considerable divisions 
 
 y soc how can they be made 
 
 str first by separating the divine shepherd from the human 
 guardian or manager 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the art of management which is assigned to man would 
 again have to be subdivided 
 
 y soc on what principle 
 
 str on the principle of voluntary and compulsory 
 
 y soc why 
 
 str because if i am not mistaken there has been an error here 
 for our simplicity led us to rank king and tyrant together whereas 
 they are utterly distinct like their modes of government 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str then now as i said let us make the correction and divide 
 human care into two parts on the principle of voluntary and 
 compulsory 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and if we call the management of violent rulers tyranny and 
 the voluntary management of herds of voluntary bipeds 
 politics may we not further assert that he who has this latter art of management is the true king and statesman 
 
 y soc i think stranger that we have now completed the 
 account of the statesman 
 
 str would that we had socrates but i have to satisfy myself as 
 well as you and in my judgment the figure of the king is not yet 
 perfected like statuaries who in their too great haste having 
 overdone the several parts of their work lose time in cutting them 
 down so too we partly out of haste partly out of haste partly 
 out of a magnanimous desire to expose our former error and also 
 because we imagined that a king required grand illustrations have 
 taken up a marvellous lump of fable and have been obliged 
 to use more than was necessary this made us discourse at large and nevertheless the story never came to an end and our 
 discussion might be compared to a picture of some living being which had been fairly drawn in outline but had not yet attained the life and clearness which is given by the blending of colours now to intelligent persons a living being had better be delineated by language and discourse than by any painting or work of art to the duller sort by works of art 
 
 y soc very true but what is the imperfection which 
 still remains i wish that you would tell me 
 
 str the higher ideas my dear friend can hardly be set forth 
 except through the medium of examples every man seems to know all things in a dreamy sort of way and then again to wake up and to 
 know nothing 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i fear that i have been unfortunate in raising a question about 
 our experience of knowledge 
 
 y soc why so 
 
 str why because my example requires the assistance of another 
 example 
 
 y soc proceed you need not fear that i shall tire 
 
 str i will proceed finding as i do such a ready 
 listener in you when children are beginning to know their letters 
 
 y soc what are you going to say 
 
 str that they distinguish the several letters well enough in very 
 short and easy syllables and are able to tell them correctly 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str whereas in other syllables they do not recognize them and 
 think and speak falsely of them 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str will not the best and easiest way of bringing them to a 
 knowledge of what they do not as yet know be 
 
 y soc be what 
 
 str to refer them first of all to cases in which they judge 
 correctly about the letters in question and then to compare these 
 with the cases in which they do not as yet know and to show 
 them that the letters are the same and have the same character in both 
 combination until all cases in which they are right have been 
 placed side by side with all cases in which they are wrong in this 
 way they have examples and are made to learn that each letter in 
 every combination is always the same and not another and is always 
 called by the same name 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str are not examples formed in this manner we take a thing and 
 compare it with another distinct instance of the same thing of 
 which we have a right conception and out of the comparison there 
 arises one true notion which includes both of them 
 
 y soc exactly 
 
 str can we wonder then that the soul has the same uncertainty 
 about the alphabet of things and sometimes and in some cases is 
 firmly fixed by the truth in each particular and then again in 
 other cases is altogether at sea having somehow or other a 
 correction of combinations but when the elements are transferred into the long and difficult language syllables of facts is again ignorant of them 
 
 y soc there is nothing wonderful in that 
 
 str could any one my friend who began with false opinion ever 
 expect to arrive even at a small portion of truth and to attain 
 wisdom 
 
 y soc hardly 
 
 str then you and i will not be far wrong in trying to see the 
 nature of example in general in a small and particular instance 
 afterwards from lesser things we intend to pass to the royal class 
 which is the highest form of the same nature and endeavour to 
 discover by rules of art what the management of cities is and then 
 the dream will become a reality to us 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then once more let us resume the previous argument and as 
 there were innumerable rivals of the royal race who claim to have 
 the care of states let us part them all off and leave him alone 
 and as i was saying a model or example of this process has first 
 to be framed 
 
 y soc exactly 
 
 str what model is there which is small and yet has any analogy 
 with the political occupation suppose socrates that if we have no 
 other example at hand we choose weaving or more precisely 
 weaving of will be quite enough without taking 
 the whole of weaving to illustrate our meaning 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str why should we not apply to weaving the same processes of 
 division and subdivision which we have already applied to other 
 classes going once more as rapidly as we can through all the steps 
 until we come to that which is needed for our purpose 
 
 y soc how do you mean 
 
 str i shall reply by actually performing the process 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str all things which we make or acquire are either creative or 
 preventive of the preventive class are antidotes divine and human 
 and also defences and defences are either military weapons or 
 protections and protections are veils and also shields against 
 heat and cold and shields against heat and cold are shelters and 
 coverings and coverings are blankets and garments and garments are 
 some of them in one piece and others of them are made in several 
 parts and of these latter some are stitched others are fastened 
 and not stitched and of the not stitched some are made of 
 the sinews of plants and some of hair and of these again some are cemented with water and earth and others are fastened together by 
 themselves and these last defences and coverings which are fastened 
 together by themselves are called clothes and the art which 
 superintends them we may call from the nature of the operation the 
 art of clothing just as before the art of the statesman was derived 
 from the state and may we not say that the art of weaving at least 
 that largest portion of it which was concerned with the making of 
 clothes differs only in name from this art of clothing in the same 
 way that in the previous case the royal science differed from the 
 political 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str in the next place let us make the reflection that the art 
 of weaving clothes which an incompetent person might fancy to have 
 been sufficiently described has been separated off from several 
 others which are of the same family but not from the 
 arts 
 
 y soc and which are the kindred arts 
 
 str i see that i have not taken you with me so i think 
 that we had better go backwards starting from the end we just now parted off from the weaving of clothes the making of blankets which 
 differ from each other in that one is put under and the other is put around and these are what i termed kindred arts 
 
 y soc i understand 
 
 str and we have subtracted the manufacture of all articles made 
 of flax and cords and all that we just now metaphorically termed 
 the sinews of plants and we have also separated off the process of 
 felting and the putting together of materials by stitching 
 and sewing of which the most important part is the art 
 
 y soc precisely 
 str then we separated off the art which prepared 
 coverings in entire pieces and the art of sheltering and 
 subtracted the various arts of making which are employed 
 in building and in general in carpentering and in other crafts 
 and all such arts as furnish impediments to thieving and acts of 
 violence and are concerned with making the lids of boxes and the 
 fixing of doors being divisions of the art of joining and we also 
 cut off the manufacture of arms which is a section of the great and 
 manifold art of making defences and we originally began by parting 
 off the whole of the magic art which is concerned with antidoter 
 and have left as would appear the very art of which we were in 
 search the art of protection against winter cold which fabricates 
 woollen defences and has the name of weaving 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str yes my boy but that is not all for the first process to 
 which the material is subjected is the opposite of weaving 
 
 y soc how so 
 
 str weaving is a sort of uniting 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but the first process is a separation of the clotted 
 and matted fibres 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i mean the work of the art for we cannot say that 
 carding is weaving or that the carder is a weaver 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str again if a person were to say that the art of making the 
 warp and the woof was the art of weaving he would say what was 
 paradoxical and false 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str shall we say that the whole art of the fuller or of the 
 mender has nothing to do with the care and treatment clotes 
 or are we to regard all these as arts of weaving 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str and yet surely all these arts will maintain that they are 
 concerned with the treatment and production of clothes they will 
 dispute the exclusive prerogative of weaving and though assigning a 
 larger sphere to that will still reserve a considerable field for 
 themselves 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str besides these there are the arts which make tools and 
 instruments of weaving and which will claim at least to be 
 cooperative causes in every work of the weaver 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str well then suppose that we define weaving or rather 
 that part of it which has been selected by us to be the greatest and 
 noblest of arts which are concerned with woollen we be right is not the definition although true wanting in clearness and 
 completeness for do not all those other arts require to be first 
 cleared away 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str then the next thing will be to separate them in 
 order that the argument may proceed in a regular manner 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str let us consider in the first place that there are two kinds 
 of arts entering into everything which we do 
 
 y soc what are they 
 
 str the one kind is the conditional or cooperative the other the 
 principal cause 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str the arts which do not manufacture the actual thing but which 
 furnish the necessary tools for the manufacture without which the 
 several arts could not fulfil their appointed work are 
 but those which make the things themselves are causal 
 
 y soc a very reasonable distinction 
 
 str thus the arts which make spindles combs and other 
 instruments of the production of clothes may be called and those which treat and fabricate the things themselves causal 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str the arts of washing and mending and the other 
 preparatory arts which belong to the causal class and form a division of the great art of adornment may be all comprehended under what we call the art 
 
 y soc very good

 book 
 
 str carding and spinning threads and all the parts of the process 
 which are concerned with the actual manufacture of a woollen garment form a single art which is one of thow universally art of working in wool 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str of working in wool again there are two divisions and both 
 these are parts of two arts at once 
 
 y soc how is that 
 
 str carding and one half of the use of the comb and the other 
 processes of which separate the composite may 
 be classed together as belonging both to the art of woolworking and also to one of the two great arts which are of universal art of composition and the art of division 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str to the latter belong carding and the other processes 
 of which i was just now speaking the art of discernment or division in wool and yarn which is effected in one manner with the comb and in another with the hands is variously described under all the names which i just now mentioned 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str again let us take some process of woolworking which is also 
 a portion of the art of composition and dismissing the elements of 
 division which we found there make two halves one on the principle 
 of composition and the other on the principle of division 
 
 y soc let that be done 
 
 str and once more socrates we must divide the part which 
 belongs at once both to woolworking and composition if we 
 are ever to discover satisfactorily the aforesaid art of weaving 
 
 y soc we must 
 
 str yes certainly and let us call one part of the art the art 
 of twisting threads the other the art of combining them 
 
 y soc do i understand you in speaking of twisting to be 
 referring to manufacture of the warp 
 
 str yes and of the woof too how if not by twisting is the 
 woof made 
 
 y soc there is no other way 
 
 str then suppose that you define the warp and the woof 
 for i think that the definition will be of use to you 
 
 y soc how shall i define them 
 
 str as thus a piece of carded wool which is drawn out lengthwise 
 and is said to be pulled out 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and the wool thus prepared when twisted by the spindle and 
 made into a firm thread is called the warp and the art which 
 regulates these operations the art of spinning the warp 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and the threads which are more loosely spun having a 
 softness proportioned to the intertexture of the warp and to the 
 degree of force used in dressing the threads which are 
 thus spun are called the woof and the art which is set over them 
 may be called the art of spinning the woof 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and now there can be no mistake about the nature of the 
 part of weaving which we have undertaken to define for when 
 that part of the art of composition which is employed in the working of wool forms a web by the regular intertexture of warp and woof the entire woven substance is called by us a woollen garment and the art which presides over this is the art of weaving 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str but why did we not say at once that weaving is the art of 
 entwining warp and woof instead of making a long and 
 useless circuit 
 
 y soc i thought stranger that there was nothing useless in 
 what was said 
 
 str very likely but you may not always think so my sweet 
 friend and in case any feeling of dissatisfaction should hereafter 
 arise in your mind as it very well may let me lay down a principle 
 which will apply to arguments in general 
 
 y soc proceed 
 
 str let us begin by considering the whole nature of excess and 
 defect and then we shall have a rational ground on which we may 
 praise or blame too much length or too much shortness in discussions of this kind 
 
 y soc let us do so 
 
 str the points on which i think that we ought to dwell are the 
 following 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str length and shortness excess and defect with all of 
 these the art of measurement is conversant 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and the art of measurement has to be divided into two parts 
 with a view to our present purpose 
 
 y soc where would you make the division 
 
 str as thus i would make two parts one having regard to the 
 relativity of greatness and smallness to each other and there is 
 another without which the existence of production would be 
 impossible 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str do you not think that it is only natural for the greater to 
 be called greater with reference to the less alone and the less 
 reference to the greater alone 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str well but is there not also something exceeding and 
 exceeded by the principle of the mean both in speech and action and is not this a reality and the chief mark of difference between good and bad men 
 
 y soc plainly 
 
 str then we must suppose that the great and small exist and are 
 discerned in both these ways and not as we were saying before 
 only relatively to one another but there must also be another 
 comparison of them with the mean or ideal standard would you like 
 to hear the reason why 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str if we assume the greater to exist only in relation to 
 the less there will never be any comparison of either with the mean 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and would not this doctrine be the ruin of all the arts and 
 their creations would not the art of the statesman and the 
 aforesaid art of weaving disappear for all these arts are on the 
 watch against excess and defect not as unrealities but as real 
 evils which occasion a difficulty in action and the excellence of 
 beauty of every work of art is due to this observance of measure 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str but if the science of the statesman disappears the search 
 for the royal science will be impossible 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str well then as in the case of the sophist we extorted the 
 inference that had an existence because here was the 
 point at which the argument eluded our grasp so in this we must 
 endeavour to show that the greater and less are not only to be 
 measured with one another but also have to do with the production 
 of the mean for if this is not admitted neither a statesman nor 
 any other man of action can be an undisputed master of his science 
 
 y soc yes we must certainly do again what we did then 
 
 str but this socrates is a greater work than the other of 
 which we only too well remember the length i think however that 
 we may fairly assume something of this sort 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str that we shall some day require this notion of a mean with a 
 view to the demonstration of absolute truth meanwhile the argument 
 that the very existence of the arts must be held to depend on the 
 possibility of measuring more or less not only with one another 
 but also with a view to the attainment of the mean seems to afford 
 a grand support and satisfactory proof of the doctrine which we are 
 maintaining for if there are arts there is a standard of measure 
 and if there is a standard of measure there are arts but if either 
 is wanting there is neither 
 
 y soc true and what is the next step 
 
 str the next step clearly is to divide the art of measurement 
 into two parts all we have said already and to place in 
 the one part all the arts which measure number length depth breadth swiftness with their opposites and to have another part in which they are measured with the mean and the fit and the opportune and the due and with all those words in short which denote a mean or standard removed from the extremes 
 
 y soc here are two vast divisions embracing two very different 
 spheres 
 
 str there are many accomplished men socrates who say believing 
 themselves to speak wisely that the art of measurement is 
 universal and has to do with all things and this means what we are 
 now saying for all things which come within the province of art do 
 certainly in some sense partake of measure but these 
 persons because they are not accustomed to distinguish classes according to real forms jumble together two widely different things relation to one another and to a standard under the idea that they are the same and also fall into the converse error of dividing other things not according to their real parts whereas the right way is if a man 
 has first seen the unity of things to go on with the enquiry and 
 not desist until he has found all the differences contained in it 
 which form distinct classes nor again should he be able to rest 
 contented with the manifold diversities which are seen in a 
 multitude of things until he has comprehended all of them that have 
 any affinity within the bounds of one similarity and embraced them 
 within the reality of a single kind but we have said enough on this 
 head and also of excess and defect we have only to bear in 
 mind that two divisions of the art of measurement have been discovered which are concerned with them and not forget what they are 
 y soc we will not forget 
 
 str and now that this discussion is completed let us go on to 
 consider another question which concerns not this argument only but 
 the conduct of such arguments in general 
 
 y soc what is this new question 
 
 str take the case of a child who is engaged in learning his 
 letters when he is asked what letters make up a word should we say 
 that the question is intended to improve his grammatical knowledge 
 of that particular word or of all words 
 
 y soc clearly in order that he may have a better 
 knowledge of all words 
 
 str and is our enquiry about the statesman intended only 
 to improve our knowledge of politics or our power of reasoning generally 
 
 y soc clearly as in the former example the purpose is general 
 str still less would any rational man seek to analyse the 
 notion of weaving for its own sake but people seem to forget that some things have sensible images which are readily known and can be easily pointed out when any one desires to answer an enquirer without any trouble or argument whereas the greatest and highest truths have no outward image of themselves visible to man which he who wishes to satisfy the soul of the enquirer can adapt to the eye of sense and therefore we ought to train ourselves to give and accept a rational account of them for immaterial things which are the noblest and greatest are shown only in thought and idea and in no 
 other way and all that we are now saying is said for the sake of them moreover there is always less difficulty in fixing the mind on small matters than on great 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str let us call to mind the bearing of all this 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str i wanted to get rid of any impression of tediousness which we 
 may have experienced in the discussion about weaving and 
 the reversal of the universe and in the discussion concerning the sophist and the being of i know that they were felt to be too long and i reproached myself with this fearing that they might be not only tedious but irrelevant and all that i have now said is only 
 designed to prevent the recurrence of any such disagreeables for the 
 future 
 
 y soc very good will you proceed 
 
 str then i would like to observe that you and i remembering what 
 has been said should praise or blame the length or shortness of 
 discussions not by comparing them with one another but with what 
 is fitting having regard to the part of measurement which as we 
 said was to be borne in mind 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and yet not everything is to be judged even with a view to 
 what is fitting for we should only want such a length as is 
 suited to give pleasure if at all as a secondary matter and reason tells us that we should be contented to make the ease or rapidity of an enquiry not our first but our second object the first and highest 
 of all being to assert the great method of division according to 
 the discourse be shorter or longer is not to the 
 point no offence should be taken at length but the longer and 
 shorter are to be employed indifferently according as either of 
 them is better calculated to sharpen the wits of the auditors 
 reason would also say to him who censures the length of discourses 
 on such occasions and cannot away with their circumlocution that he 
 should not be in such a hurry to have done with them when 
 he can only complain that they are tedious but he should prove that if they had been shorter they would have made those who took part in them better dialecticians and more capable of expressing the truth of things about any other praise and blame he need not trouble should pretend not to hear them but we have had enough of this as you will probably agree with me in thinking let us return to our 
 statesman and apply to his case the aforesaid example of weaving 
 
 y soc very us do as you say 
 
 str the art of the king has been separated from the similar arts of 
 shepherds and indeed from all those which have to do with herds 
 at all there still remain however of the causal and 
 arts those which are immediately concerned with states and 
 which must first be distinguished from one another 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str you know that these arts cannot easily be divided into two 
 halves the reason will be very evident as we proceed 
 
 y soc then we had better do so 
 
 str we must carve them like a victim into members or limbs since 
 we cannot bisect them for we certainly should divide everything 
 into as few parts as possible 
 
 y soc what is to be done in this case 
 
 str what we did in the example of those arts which 
 furnish the tools were regarded by us as 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str so now and with still more reason all arts which make any 
 implement in a state whether great or small may be 
 regarded by us as for without them neither state nor statesmanship would be possible and yet we are not inclined to say that any of them is a product of the kingly art 
 
 y soc no indeed 
 
 str the task of separating this class from others is not an easy 
 one for there is plausibility in saying that anything in 
 the world is the instrument of doing something but there is another dass of possessions in a city of which i have a word to say 
 
 y soc what class do you mean 
 
 str a class which may be described as not having this power that 
 is to say not like an instrument framed for production 
 but designed for the preservation of that which is produced 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str to the class of vessels as they are comprehensively termed 
 which are constructed for the preservation of things moist 
 and dry of things prepared in the fire or out of the fire this is a very large class and has if i am not mistaken literally nothing to 
 do with the royal art of which we are in search 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str there is also a third class of possessions to be noted 
 different from these and very extensive moving or resting on land 
 or water honourable and also dishonourable the whole of this class 
 has one name because it is intended to be sat upon being always a 
 seat for something 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str a vehicle which is certainly not the work of the statesman 
 but of the carpenter potter and coppersmith 
 
 y soc i understand 
 
 str and is there not a fourth class which is again different and 
 in which most of the things formerly mentioned are 
 kind of dress most sorts of arms walls and enclosures whether of 
 earth or stone and ten thousand other thing all of which being 
 made for the sake of defence may be truly called defences and are 
 for the most part to be regarded as the work of the builder or of 
 the weaver rather than of the statesman 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str shall we add a fifth class of ornamentation and drawing and 
 of the imitations produced by drawing and music which are designed for amusement only and may be fairly comprehended under one name 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str plaything is the name 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str that one name may be fitly predicated of all of them for 
 none of these things have a serious is their sole 
 aim 
 
 y soc that again i understand 
 
 str then there is a class which provides materials for all these 
 out of which and in which the arts already mentioned fabricate their 
 manifold class i say which is the creation and 
 offspring of many other arts may i not rank sixth 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i am referring to gold silver and other metals and all 
 that and shearing of every sort provides for the art of 
 carpentry and plaiting and there is the process of barking and 
 stripping the cuticle of plants and the art which strips 
 off the skins of animals and other similar arts which manufacture 
 corks and papyri and cords and provide for the manufacture of 
 composite species out of simple whole class may be termed 
 the primitive and simple possession of man and with this the kingly 
 science has no concern at all 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the provision of food and of all other things which mingle 
 their particles with the particles of the human body and minister 
 to the body will form a seventh class which may be called by the 
 general term of nourishment unless you have any better name 
 to however appertains rather to the husbandman 
 huntsman trainer doctor cook and is not to be assigned to the art 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str these seven classes include nearly every description of 
 property with the exception of tame animals was 
 the original material which ought to have been placed first next 
 come instruments vessels vehicles defences playthings 
 nourishment small things which may under one 
 of for example coins seals and stamps are omitted for they have not in them the character of any larger kind which includes 
 them but some of them may with a little forcing be placed among ornaments and others may be made to harmonize with the class of implements the art of herding which has been already divided into parts will include all property in tame animals except slaves 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str the class of slaves and ministers only remains and i suspect 
 that in this the real aspirants for the throne who are the rivals 
 of the king in the formation of the political web will be 
 discovered just as spinners carders and the rest of them were the rivals of the weaver all the others who were termed have been got rid of among the occupations already mentioned and 
 separated from the royal and political science 
 
 y soc i agree 
 
 str let us go a little nearer in order that we may be 
 more certain of the complexion of this remaining class 
 
 y soc let us do so 
 
 str we shall find from our present point of view that the 
 greatest servants are in a case and condition which is the reverse 
 of what we anticipated 
 
 y soc who are they 
 
 str those who have been purchased and have so become 
 possessions these are unmistakably slaves and certainly do 
 not claim royal science 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str again freemen who of their own accord become the servants of 
 the other classes in a state and who exchange and equalise the 
 products of husbandry and the other arts some sitting in the 
 others going from city to city by land or sea and 
 giving money in exchange for money or for other 
 the merchant the the retailer will not 
 put in any claim to statecraft or politics 
 
 y soc no unless indeed to the politics of commerce 
 
 str but surely men whom we see acting as hirelings and serfs and 
 too happy to turn their hand to anything will not profess 
 to share in royal science 
 
 y soc certainly not 
 
 str but what would you say of some other serviceable officials 
 
 y soc who are they and what services do they perform 
 
 str there are heralds and scribes perfected by practice and 
 divers others who have great skill in various sorts of business 
 connected with the government of shall we call them 
 
 y soc they are the officials and servants of the rulers as you 
 just now called them but not themselves rulers 
 
 str there may be something strange in any servant pretending to 
 be a ruler and yet i do not think that i could have been dreaming 
 when i imagined that the principal claimants to political science 
 would be found somewhere in this neighbourhood 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str well let us draw nearer and try the claims of some who have 
 not yet been tested in the first place there are diviners who 
 have a portion of servile or ministerial science and are thought to 
 be the interpreters of the gods to men 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str there is also the priestly class who as the law declares 
 know how to give the gods gifts from men in the form of sacrifices 
 which are acceptable to them and to ask on our behalf blessings in 
 return from them now both these are branches of the servile or 
 ministerial art 
 
 y soc yes clearly 
 
 str and here i think that we seem to be getting on the 
 right track for the priest and the diviner are swollen with pride and 
 prerogative and they create an awful impression of themselves by the magnitude of their enterprises in egypt the king himself is not allowed to reign unless he have priestly powers and if he should be of another class and has thrust himself in he must get enrolled in the 
 priesthood in many parts of hellas the duty of offering the most 
 solemn propitiatory sacrifices is assigned to the highest 
 magistracies and here at athens the most solemn and 
 national of the ancient sacrifices are supposed to be celebrated by him who has been chosen by lot to be the king archon 
 
 y soc precisely 
 
 str but who are these other kings and priests elected by lot who 
 now come into view followed by their retainers and a vast throng as 
 the former class disappears and the scene changes 
 
 y soc whom can you mean 
 
 str they are a strange crew 
 
 y soc why strange 
 
 str a minute ago i thought that they were animals of every tribe 
 for many of them are like lions and centaurs and many more like 
 satyrs and such weak and shifty shapes quickly 
 changing into one forms and natures and now socrates i 
 begin to see who they are 
 
 y soc who are they you seem to be gazing on some strange vision 
 
 str yes every one looks strange when you do not know 
 him and just now i myself fell into this first sight coming suddenly upon him i did not recognize the politician and his troop 
 
 y soc who is he 
 
 str the chief of sophists and most accomplished of wizards who 
 must at any cost be separated from the true king or statesman if we 
 are ever to see daylight in the present enquiry 
 
 y soc that is a hope not lightly to be renounced 
 
 str never if i can help it and first let me ask you a 
 question 
 
 y soc what 
 
 str is not monarchy a recognized form of government 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and after monarchy next in order comes the government of 
 the few 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str is not the third form of government the rule of the 
 multitude which is called by the name of democracy 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and do not these three expand in a manner into five 
 producing out of themselves two other names y soc what are they 
 
 y soc what are they 
 
 str there is a criterion of voluntary and involuntary poverty 
 and riches law and the absence of law which men apply 
 to them the two first they subdivide accordingly and ascribe to 
 monarchy two forms and two corresponding names royalty and tyranny 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and the government of the few they distinguish by the names 
 of aristocracy and oligarchy 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str democracy alone whether rigidly observing the laws 
 or not and whether the multitude rule over the men of property with 
 their consent or against their consent always in ordinary language has the same name 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but do you suppose that any form of government which 
 is defined by these characteristics of the one the few or the many of 
 poverty or wealth of voluntary or compulsory submission of written 
 law or the absence of law can be a right one 
 
 y soc why not 
 
 str reflect and follow me 
 
 y soc in what direction 
 
 str shall we abide by what we said at first or shall we retract 
 our words 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str if i am not mistaken we said that royal power was a science 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and a science of a peculiar kind which was selected 
 out of the rest as having a character which is at once judicial and 
 authoritative 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and there was one kind of authority over lifeless things and 
 another other living animals and so we proceeded in the 
 division step by step up to this point not losing the idea of science but unable as yet to determine the nature of the particular science 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str hence we are led to observe that the distinguishing principle 
 of the state cannot be the few or many the voluntary or 
 involuntary poverty or riches but some notion of science must 
 enter into it if we are to be consistent with what has preceded 
 
 y soc and we must be consistent 
 
 str well then in which of these various forms of states may the 
 science of government which is among the greatest of all 
 sciences and most difficult to acquire be supposed to reside that we must discover and then we shall see who are the false politicians who pretend to be politicians but are not although they persuade many and shall separate them from the wise king 
 
 y soc that as the argument has already intimated will be our 
 duty 
 str do you think that the multitude in a state can attain 
 politicals science 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str but perhaps in a city of a thousand men there would be a 
 hundred or say fifty who could 
 
 y soc in that case political science would certainly be the 
 easiest of all sciences there could not be found in a city of that 
 number as many really if judged by the 
 standard of the rest of hellas and there would certainly not be as 
 many kings for kings we may truly call those who possess royal 
 science whether they rule or not as was shown in the previous 
 argument 
 
 str thank you for reminding me and the consequence is that any 
 true form of government can only be supposed to be the government of one two or at any rate of a few 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and these whether they rule with the will or 
 against the will of their subjects with written laws or without written laws and whether they are poor or rich and whatever be the nature of their rule must be supposed according to our present view to 
 rule on some scientific principle just as the physician whether he cures us against our will or with our will and whatever be his mode of 
 burning or the infliction of some other 
 he practises out of a book or not out of a book and 
 whether he be rich or poor whether he purges or reduces in 
 some other way or even fattens his patients is a physician all the same so long as he exercises authority over them according to rules 
 of art if he only does them good and heals and saves them and this we lay down to be the only proper test of the art of medicine or of any other art of command 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str then that can be the only true form of government in which 
 the governors are really found to possess science and are not mere 
 pretenders whether they rule according to law or without law 
 or unwilling subjects and are rich or poor 
 of these things can with any propriety be included 
 in the notion of the ruler 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and whether with a view to the public good they purge 
 the state by killing some or exiling some whether they reduce the size of the body corporate by sending out from the hive swarms of citizens or by introducing persons from without increase it while they act according to the rules of wisdom and justice and use their 
 power with a view to the general security and improvement the city over which they rule and which has these characteristics may be described as the only true state all other governments are not genuine or real but only imitations of this and some of them are better and some of them are worse the better are said to be well governed but they are mere imitations like the others 
 
 y soc i agree stranger in the greater part of what you say 
 but as to their ruling without expression has a harsh sound 
 
 str you have been too quick for me socrates i was just going to 
 ask you whether you objected to any of my statements and now i see that we shall have to consider this notion of there being good 
 government without laws 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str there can be no doubt that legislation is in a manner the 
 business of a king and yet the best thing of all is not that the 
 law should rule but that a man should rule supposing him to have 
 wisdom and royal power do you see why this is 
 
 y soc why 
 
 str because the law does not perfectly comprehend what is noblest 
 and most just for all and therefore cannot enforce what is best the 
 differences of men and actions and the endless irregular 
 movements of human things do not admit of any universal and simple rule and no art whatsoever can lay down a rule which will last for all time 
 
 y soc of course not 
 
 str but the law is always striving to make an obstinate 
 and ignorant tyrant who will not allow anything to be done contrary 
 to his appointment or any question to be even in sudden 
 changes of circumstances when something happens to be better than 
 what he commanded for some one 
 
 y soc certainly the law treats us all precisely in the manner 
 which you describe 
 
 str a perfectly simple principle can never be applied to 
 a state of things which is the reverse of simple 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str then if the law is not the perfection of right why are we 
 compelled to make laws at all the reason of this has next to be 
 investigated 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str let me ask whether you have not meetings for gymnastic 
 contests in your city such as there are in other cities at 
 which men compete in running wrestling and the like 
 
 y soc yes they are very common among us 
 
 str and what are the rules which are enforced on their pupils by 
 professional trainers or by others having similar authority can you 
 remember 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str the do not issue minute rules for 
 individuals or give every individual what is exactly suited to his constitution they think that they ought to go more roughly to work and to prescribe generally the regimen which will benefit the majority 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and therefore they assign equal amounts of exercise to them 
 all they send them forth together and let them rest together from 
 their running wrestling or whatever the form of bodily exercise 
 may be 
 
 y so true 
 
 str and now observe that the legislator who has to 
 preside over the herd and to enforce justice in their dealings with one another will not be able in enacting for the general good to 
 provide exactly what is suitable for each particular case 
 
 y soc he cannot be expected to do so 
 
 str he will lay down laws in a general form for the majority 
 roughly meeting the cases of individuals and some of them he will 
 deliver in writing and others will be unwritten and these last 
 will be traditional customs of the country 
 
 y soc he will be right 
 
 str yes quite right for how can he sit at every side all 
 through his life prescribing for him the exact particulars of his 
 duty who socrates would be equal to such a task no one who 
 really had the royal science if he had been able to do this would 
 have imposed upon himself the restriction of a written law 
 
 y soc so i should infer from what has now been said 
 
 str or rather my good friend from what is going to be said 
 
 y soc and what is that 
 
 str let us put to ourselves the case of a physician or trainer 
 who is about to go into a far country and is expecting to be a long 
 time away from his that his instructions 
 will not be remembered unless they are written down he will leave notes of them for the use of his pupils or patients 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str but what would you say if he came back sooner than he had 
 intended and owing to an unexpected change of the winds or other 
 celestial influences something else happened to be better for 
 he not venture to suggest this new remedy although not 
 contemplated in his former prescription would he persist in 
 observing the original law neither himself giving any few 
 commandments nor the patient daring to do otherwise than was prescribed under the idea that this course only was healthy and medicinal all others noxious and heterodox viewed in the light of science and true art would not all such enactments be utterly ridiculous 
 
 y soc utterly 
 
 str and if he who gave laws written or unwritten 
 determining what was good or bad honourable or dishonourable just or unjust to the tribes of men who flock together in their several cities and are governed accordance with them if i say the wise legislator were suddenly to come again or another like to him is he to be prohibited from changing not this prohibition be in reality quite as ridiculous as the other 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str do you know a plausible saying of the common people 
 which is in point 
 
 y soc i do not recall what you mean at the moment 
 
 str they say that if any one knows how the ancient laws may be 
 improved he must first persuade his own state of the 
 improvement and then he may legislate but not otherwise 
 
 y soc and are they not right 
 
 str i dare say but supposing that he does use some 
 gentle violence for their good what is this violence to be called or rather 
 before you answer let me ask the same question in reference to our 
 previous instances 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str suppose that a skilful physician has a patient of 
 whatever sex or age whom he compels against his will to do something for his good which is contrary to the written rules what is this compulsion to be called would you ever dream of calling it a violation of the art or a breach of the laws of health nothing could be more unjust than for the patient to whom such violence is applied to charge the physician who practises the violence with wanting skill or aggravating his disease 
 
 y soc most true 
 
 str in the political art error is not called disease but evil 
 or disgrace or injustice 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str and when the citizen contrary to law and custom is 
 compelled to do what is juster and better and nobler than he did 
 before the last and most absurd thing which he could say about such 
 violence is that he has incurred disgrace or evil or injustice at 
 the hands of those who compelled him 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str and shall we say that the violence if exercised by a 
 rich just and if by a poor man unjust may not any man rich or poor with or without laws with the will of the citizens or against 
 the will of the citizens do what is for their interest is not this 
 the true principle of government according to which the 
 wise and good man will order the affairs of his subjects as the pilot by watching continually over the interests of the ship and of the 
 by laying down rules but by making his art a 
 the lives of his even and in the way may 
 there not be a true form of polity created by those who are able to 
 govern in a similar spirit and who show a strength of art which is 
 superior to the law nor can wise rulers ever err while they 
 observing the one great rule of distributing justice to the citizens 
 with intelligence and skill are able to preserve them and 
 as far as may be to make them better from being worse 
 
 y soc no one can deny what has been now said 
 
 str neither if you consider can any one deny the other 
 statement 
 
 y soc what was it 
 
 str we said that no great number of persons whoever they may be 
 can attain political knowledge or order a state wisely but that 
 the true government is to be found in a small body or in an 
 individual and that other states are but imitations of this as we 
 said a little while ago some for the better and some for the worse 
 
 y soc what do you mean i cannot have understood your previous 
 remark about imitations 
 
 str and yet the mere suggestion which i hastily threw out 
 is highly important even if we leave the question where it is and do not seek by the discussion of it to expose the error which prevails in 
 this matter 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str the idea which has to be grasped by us is not easy or 
 familiar but we may attempt to express it the government of which i have been speaking to be the only true model then the others must use the written laws of no other can they be saved they will have to do what is now generally approved although not the best thing in the world 
 
 y soc what is this 
 
 str no citizen should do anything contrary to the laws and any 
 infringement of them should be punished with death and the most 
 extreme penalties and this is very right and good when regarded as 
 the second best thing if you set aside the first of which 
 i was just now speaking shall i explain the nature of what call the 
 second best 
 
 y soc by all means 
 
 str i must again have recourse to my favourite images through 
 them and them alone can i describe kings and rulers 
 
 y soc what images 
 
 str the noble pilot and the wise physician who is worth many 
 another the similitude of these let us endeavour to discover 
 some image of the king 
 
 y soc what sort of image 
 
 str well such as man will reflect that he suffers 
 strange things at the hands of both of them the physician saves 
 any whom he wishes to save and any whom he wishes to maltreat he 
 or burning them and at the same time 
 requiring thems to bring him patients which are a sort of tribute of which little or nothing is spent upon the sick man and the greater part is consumed by him and his domestics and the finale is that he receives money from the relations of the sick man or from some enemy of his and puts him out of the way and the pilots of ships are guilty of numberless evil deeds of the same kind they intentionally play false and leave you ashore when the hour of sailing arrives or they cause mishaps at sea and cast away their freight and are guilty of 
 other rogueries now suppose that we bearing all this in mind were 
 to determine after consideration that neither of these arts shall 
 any longer be allowed to exercise absolute control either 
 over freemen or over slaves but that we will summon an assembly either of all the people or of the rich only that anybody who likes whatever may be his calling or even if he have no calling may offer an opinion either about seamanship or about as to the manner in which physic or surgical instruments are to be applied to the patient or again about the vessels and the nautical implements 
 which are required in navigation and how to meet the 
 dangers of winds and waves which are incidental to the voyage how to behave when encountering pirates and what is to be done with the old fashioned galleys if they have to fight with others of a similar that whatever shall be decreed by the multitude on these 
 points upon the advice of persons skilled or unskilled shall be written down on triangular tablets and columns or enacted although unwritten to be national customs and that in all future time vessels shall be navigated and remedies administered to the patient after 
 this fashion 
 
 y soc what a strange notion 
 
 str suppose further that the pilots and physicians are appointed 
 annually either out of the rich or out of the whole people and that 
 they are elected by lot and that after their election they navigate 
 vessels and heal the sick according to the written rules 
 
 y soc worse and worse 
 
 str but hear what the year of office has 
 expired the pilot or physician has to come before a court of review in which the judges are either selected from the wealthy classes or chosen by lot out of the whole people and anybody who pleases may be their accuser and may lay to their charge that during the past year they have not navigated their vessels or healed their patients 
 according to the letter of the law and the ancient customs of their and if either of them is condemned some of the judges must fix what he is to suffer or pay 
 y soc he who is willing to take a command under such conditions 
 deserves to suffer any penalty 
 
 str yet once more we shall have to enact that if any one is 
 detected enquiring into piloting and navigation or into health and 
 the true nature of medicine or about the winds or other conditions 
 of the atmosphere contrary to the written rules and has any 
 ingenious notions about such matters he is not to be called a pilot 
 or physician but a cloudy prating on the ground 
 that he is a corrupter of the young who would persuade them to 
 follow the art of medicine or piloting in an unlawful manner and to 
 exercise an arbitrary rule over their patients or ships any one who 
 is qualified by law may inform against him and indict him in some 
 court and then if he is found to be persuading any whether young 
 or old to act contrary to the written law he is to be punished 
 with the utmost rigour for no one should presume to be 
 wiser than the laws and as touching healing and health and piloting and navigation the nature of them is known to all for anybody may 
 learn the written laws and the national customs if such were the mode 
 of procedure socrates about these sciences and about generalship 
 and any branch of hunting or about painting or imitation in 
 general or carpentry or any sort of handicraft or husbandry or 
 planting or if we were to see an art of rearing horses or tending 
 herds or divination or any ministerial service or or any science conversant with number whether simple or square or cube or comprising say if all these things were done in this way according to written regulations and not according to art what would be the result 
 
 y soc all the arts would utterly perish and could never be 
 recovered because enquiry would be unlawful and human 
 life which is bad enough already would then become utterly unendurable 
 
 str but what if while compelling all these operations to be 
 regulated by written law we were to appoint as the guardian of the 
 laws some one elected by a show of hands or by lot and he caring 
 nothing about the laws were to act contrary to them from motives of 
 interest or favour and without not this be a still 
 worse evil than the former 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str to go against the laws which are based upon long experience 
 and the wisdom of counsellors who have graciously 
 recommended them and persuaded the multitude to pass them would be a far greater and more ruinous error than any adherence to written law 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str therefore as there is a danger of this the next 
 best thing in legislating is not to allow either the individual or the multitude to break the law in any respect whatever 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the laws would be copies of the true particulars of action as 
 far as they admit of being written down from the lips of those who 
 have knowledge 
 
 y soc certainly they would 
 
 str and as we were saying he who has knowledge and is a true 
 statesman will do many things within his own sphere of action by 
 his art without regard to the laws when he is of opinion that 
 something other than that which he has written down and 
 enjoined to be observed during his absence would be better 
 
 y soc yes we said so 
 
 str and any individual or any number of men having fixed laws 
 in acting contrary to them with a view to something better 
 would only be acting as far as they are able like the true statesman 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str if they had no knowledge of what they were doing they would 
 imitate the truth and they would always imitate ill but if they 
 had knowledge the imitation would be the perfect truth and an 
 imitation no longer 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str and the principle that no great number of men are able to 
 acquire a knowledge of any art has been already admitted by us 
 
 y soc yes it has 
 
 str then the royal or political art if there be such an art 
 will never be attained either by the wealthy or by the other mob 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str then the nearest approach which these lower forms of 
 government can ever make to the true government of the one scientific ruler is to do nothing contrary to their own written laws and 
 national customs 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str when the rich imitate the true form such a government is 
 called aristocracy and when they are regardless of the laws 
 oligarchy 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str or again when an individual rules according to law in 
 imitation of him who knows we call him a king and if he rules 
 according to law we give him the same name whether he rules with 
 opinion or with knowledge 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str and when an individual truly possessing knowledge rules his 
 name will surely be the will be called a king and thus the 
 five names of governments as they are now reckoned become one 
 
 y soc that is true 
 
 str and when an individual ruler governs neither by law nor by 
 custom but following in the steps of the true man of 
 science pretends that he can only act for the best by violating the laws while in reality appetite and ignorance are the motives of the imitation may not such an one be called a tyrant 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and this we believe to be the origin of the tyrant and the 
 king of oligarchies and aristocracies and men 
 are offended at the one monarch and can never be made to 
 believe that any one can be worthy of such authority or is able and 
 willing in the spirit of virtue and knowledge to act justly and holily to all they fancy that he will be a despot who will wrong and harm and slay whom he pleases of us for if there could be such a despot as we 
 describe they would acknowledge that we ought to be too glad to 
 have him and that he alone would be the happy ruler of a true and 
 perfect state 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str but then as the state is not like a beehive and has no 
 natural head who is at once recognized to be the superior 
 both in body and in mind mankind are obliged to meet and make laws and endeavour to approach as nearly as they can to the true form of government 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and when the foundation of politics is in the letter only and 
 in custom and knowledge is divorced from action can we wonder 
 socrates at the miseries which there are and always will be in 
 states any other art built on such a foundation and thus 
 conducted would ruin all that it touched ought we not rather to 
 wonder at the natural strength of the political bond for states 
 have endured all this time out of mind and yet some of them still 
 remain and are not overthrown though many of them like 
 ships at sea founder from time to time and perish and have perished and will hire after perish through the badness of their pilots and crews who have the worst sort of ignorance of the highest mean to say that they are wholly unaquainted with politics of which above all other sciences they believe themselves to have acquired the 
 most perfect knowledge 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str then the question of these untrue forms of 
 government is the least oppressive to their subjects though they 
 are all oppressive and which is the worst of them here is a 
 consideration which is beside our present purpose and yet having 
 regard to the whole it seems to influence all our actions we must 
 examine it 
 
 y soc yes we must 
 
 str you may say that of the three forms the same is at once the 
 hardest and the easiest 
 
 y soc what do you mean 
 
 str i am speaking of the three forms of government which i 
 mentioned at the beginning of this the rule of 
 the few and the rule of the many 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str if we divide each of these we shall have six from which the 
 true one may be distinguished as a seventh 
 
 y soc how would you make the division 
 
 str monarchy divides into royalty and tyranny the rule of the 
 few into aristocracy which has an auspicious name and 
 oligarchy and democracy or the rule of the many which before was one must now be divided 
 
 y soc on what principle of division 
 
 str on the same principle as before although the name is now 
 discovered to have a twofold the distinction of ruling 
 with law or without applies to this as well as to the rest 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str the division made no difference when we were looking for the 
 perfect state as we showed before but now that this has been 
 separated off and as we said the others alone are left for us 
 the principle of law and the absence of law will bisect them all 
 
 y soc that would seem follow from what has been said 
 
 str then monarchy when bound by good prescriptions or 
 laws is the best of all the six and when lawless is the most bitter and 
 oppressive to the subject 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the government of the few which is intermediate 
 between that of the one and many is also intermediate in good and evil but the government of the many is in every respect weak and unable to do either any great good or any great evil when compared with the others because the offices are too minutely subdivided and too many hold them and this therefore is the worst of all lawful 
 governments and the best of all lawless ones if they are 
 all without the restraints of law democracy is the form in which to 
 live is best if they are well ordered then this is the last which you should choose as royalty the first form is the best with the 
 exception of the seventh for that excels them all and is among states what god is among men 
 
 y soc you are quite right and we should choose that above all 
 
 str the members of all these states with the exception of the 
 one which has knowledge may be set aside as being not statesmen but of the most monstrous idols and 
 themselves being the greatest imitators and magicians they are also the greatest of sophists 
 
 y soc the name of sophist after many windings in the argument 
 appears to have been most justly fixed upon the politicians as they 
 are termed 
 
 str and so our satyric drama has been played out and the troop 
 of centaurs and satyrs however unwilling to leave the stage have 
 at last been separated from the political science 
 
 y soc so i perceive 
 
 str there remain however natures still more troublesome 
 because they are more nearly akin to the king and more difficult to 
 discern the examination of them may be compared to the process of 
 refining gold 
 
 y soc what is your meaning 
 
 str the workmen begin by sifting away the earth and stones and 
 the like there remain in a confused mass the valuable clements akin 
 to gold which can only be separated by silver 
 and other precious metals these are at last refined away by the use of tests until the gold is left quite pure 
 
 y soc yes that is the way in which these things are said to be 
 done 
 
 str in like manner all alien and uncongenial matter has been 
 separated from political science and what is precious and of a 
 kindred nature has been left there remain the nobler arts of the 
 general and the judge and the higher sort of oratory which 
 is an ally of the royal art and persuades men to do justice and assists in guiding the helm of can we best clear away all these 
 leaving him whom we seek alone and unalloyed 
 
 y soc that is obviously what has in some way to be attempted 
 
 str if the attempt is all that is wanting he shall certainly be 
 brought to light and i think that the illustration of music may 
 assist in exhibiting him please to answer me a question 
 
 y soc what question 
 
 str there is such a thing as learning music or handicraft arts in 
 general 
 
 y soc there is 
 
 str and is there any higher art or science having power to 
 decide which of these arts are and are not to be do 
 you say 
 
 y soc i should answer that there is 
 
 str and do we acknowledge this science to be different from the 
 others 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str and ought the other sciences to be superior to this or no 
 single science to any other or ought this science to be the 
 overseer and governor of all the others 
 
 y soc the latter 
 
 str you mean to say that the science which judges whether we 
 ought to learn or not must be superior to the science which is 
 learned or which teaches 
 
 y soc far superior 
 
 str and the science which determines whether we ought to persuade 
 or not must be superior to the science which is able to persuade 
 
 y soc of course 
 
 str very good and to what science do we assign the power of 
 persuading a multitude by a pleasing tale and not by teaching 
 
 y soc that power i think must clearly be assigned to rhetoric 
 
 str and to what science do we give the power of 
 determining whether we are to employ persuasion or force towards any one or to refrain altogether 
 
 y soc to that science which governs the arts of speech and 
 persuasion 
 
 str which if i am not mistaken will be politics 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str rhetoric seems to be quickly distinguished from 
 politics being a different species yet ministering to it 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str but what would you think of another sort of power or science 
 
 y soc what science 
 
 str the science which has to do with military operations against 
 our that to be regarded as a science or not 
 
 y soc how can generalship and military tactics be regarded as 
 other than a science 
 
 str and is the art which is able and knows how to advise when we 
 are to go to war or to make peace the same as this or different 
 
 y soc if we are to be consistent we must say different 
 
 str and we must also suppose that this rules the other if we are 
 not to give up our former notion 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and considering how great and terrible the whole art of war 
 is can we imagine any which is superior to it but the truly royal 
 
 y soc no other 
 
 str the art of the general is only ministerial and therefore not 
 political 
 
 y soc exactly 
 
 str once more let us consider the nature of the righteous judge 
 
 y soc very good 
 
 str does he do anything but decide the dealings of men with one 
 another to be just or unjust in accordance with the standard which 
 he receives from the king and his own peculiar 
 virtue only in this that he is not perverted by gifts or fears or 
 pity or by any sort of favour or enmity into deciding the suits of 
 men with one another contrary to the appointment of the legislator 
 
 y soc no his office is such as you describe 
 
 str then the inference is that the power of the judge is 
 not only the power of a guardian of the law which ministers to the royal power 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the review of all these sciences shows that none of them is 
 political or royal for the truly royal ought not itself to act but 
 to rule over those who are able to act the king ought to 
 know what is and what is not a fitting opportunity for taking the initiative in matters of the greatest importance whilst others should execute his orders 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and therefore the arts which we have described as they 
 have no authority over themselves or one another but are 
 each of them concerned with some special action of their own have as they ought to have special names corresponding to their several actions 
 y soc i agree 
 
 str and the science which is over them all and has charge of the 
 laws and of all matters affecting the state and truly weaves them 
 all into one if we would describe under a name characteristic of 
 their common nature most truly we may call politics 
 
 y soc exactly so 
 
 str then now that we have discovered the various classes in a 
 state shall i analyse politics after the pattern which weaving 
 supplied 
 
 y soc i greatly wish that you would 
 
 str then i must describe the nature of the royal web and show 
 how the various threads are woven into one piece 
 
 y soc clearly 
 
 str a task has to be accomplished which although difficult 
 appears to be necessary 
 
 y soc certainly the attempt must be made 
 
 str to assume that one part of virtue differs in kind 
 from a position easily assailable by contentious disputants who appeal to popular opinion 
 
 y soc i do not understand 
 
 str let me put the matter in another way i suppose that you 
 would consider courage to be a part of virtue 
 
 y soc certainly i should 
 
 str and you would think temperance to be different from courage 
 and likewise to be a part of virtue 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str i shall venture to put forward a strange theory about them 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str that they are two principles which thoroughly hate one 
 another and are antagonistic throughout a great part of nature 
 
 y soc how singular 
 
 str yes all the parts of virtue are commonly said to be 
 friendly to one another 
 
 y soc yes 
 
 str then let us carefully investigate whether this is universally 
 true or whether there are not parts of virtue which are at war with 
 their kindred in some respect 
 
 y soc tell me how we shall consider that question 
 
 str we must extend our enquiry to all those things which we 
 consider beautiful and at the same time place in two 
 opposite classes 
 
 y soc explain what are they 
 
 str acuteness and quickness whether in body or soul or in the 
 movement of sound and the imitations of them which painting 
 and music 
 supply you must have praised yourself before now or been present 
 when others praised them 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and do you remember the terms in which they are praised 
 
 y soc i do not 
 
 str i wonder whether i can explain to you in words the thought 
 which is passing in my mind 
 
 y soc why not 
 
 str you fancy that this is all so easy well let us 
 consider these notions with reference to the opposite classes of action under which they fall when we praise quickness and energy and acuteness whether of mind or body or sound we express our praise of the quality which we admire by one word and that one word is manliness or courage 
 
 y soc how 
 
 str we speak of an action as energetic and brave quick and 
 manly and vigorous too and when we apply the name of which i speak as the common attribute of all these natures we certainly praise 
 them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str and do we not often praise the quiet strain of action also 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str and do we not then say the opposite of what we said of the 
 other 
 
 y soc how do you mean 
 
 str we exclaim how calm how temperate in admiration of the slow 
 and quiet working of the intellect and of steadiness and gentleness 
 in action of smoothness and depth of voice and of all rhythmical 
 movement and of music in general when these have a proper 
 solemnity of all such actions we predicate not courage but a name 
 indicative of order 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str but when on the other hand either of these is out of place 
 the names of either are changed into terms of censure 
 
 y soc how so 
 
 str too great sharpness or quickness or hardness is 
 termed violence or madness too great slowness or gentleness is called cowardice or sluggishness and we may observe that for the most part these qualities and the temperance and manliness of the opposite characters are arrayed as enemies on opposite sides and do not mingle with one another in their respective actions and if we 
 pursue the enquiry we shall find that men who have these different 
 qualities of mind differ from one another 
 
 y soc in what respect 
 
 str in respect of all the qualities which i mentioned and very 
 likely of many others according to their respective affinities to 
 either class of actions they distribute praise and 
 to the actions which are akin to their own blame to those of the opposite out of this many quarrels and occasions of quarrel arise among them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str the difference between the two classes is often a trivial 
 concern but in a state and when affecting really important 
 matters becomes of all disorders the most hateful 
 
 y soc to what do you refer 
 
 str to nothing short of the whole regulation of human 
 life for the orderly class are always ready to lead a peaceful life quietly doing their own business this is their manner of behaving with all men at home and they are equally ready to find some way of keeping the peace with foreign states and on account of this fondness of theirs for peace which is often out of season where their influence prevails they become by degrees unwarlike and bring up their young men to be like themselves they are at the mercy of their enemies whence in a few years they and their children and the whole 
 city often pass imperceptibly from the condition of freemen into that of slaves 
 y soc what a cruel fate 
 
 str and now think of what happens with the more 
 courageous natures are they not always inciting their country to go to war owing to their excessive love of the military life they raise up enemies against themselves many and mighty and either utterly ruin their native land or enslave and subject it to its foes 
 
 y soc that again is true 
 
 str must we not admit then that where these two classes exist 
 they always feel the greatest antipathy and antagonism towards one 
 another 
 
 y soc we cannot deny it 
 
 str and returning to the enquiry with which we began have we not 
 found that considerable portions of virtue are at variance with one 
 another and give rise to a similar opposition in the characters who 
 are endowed with them 
 
 y soc true 
 
 str let us consider a further point 
 
 y soc what is it 
 
 str i want to know whether any constructive art will make any 
 even the most trivial thing out of bad and good materials 
 indifferently if this can be helped does not all art rather reject 
 the bad as far as possible and accept the good and fit 
 materials and from these elements whether like or unlike gathering them all into one work out some nature or idea 
 
 y soc to be sure 
 
 str then the true and natural art of statesmanship will 
 never allow any state to be formed by a combination of good and bad men if this can be avoided but will begin by testing human natures in play and after testing them will entrust them to proper teachers who are the ministers of her will herself give orders and maintain authority just as the art of weaving continually gives orders and maintains authority over the carders and all the others who prepare the material for the work commanding the subsidiary arts to execute the works which she deems necessary for making the web 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str in like manner the royal science appears to me to be the 
 mistress of all lawful educators and instructors and having this 
 queenly power will not permit them to train men in what will 
 produce characters unsuited to the political constitution which she 
 desires to create but only in what will produce such as are 
 suitable those which have no share of manliness and temperance or any other virtuous inclination and from the necessity of an evil nature are violently carried away to godlessness and insolence and 
 injustice she gets rid of by death and exile and punishes them with the greatest of disgraces 
 
 y soc that is commonly said 
 
 str but those who are wallowing in ignorance and baseness she 
 bows under the yoke of slavery 
 
 y soc quite right 
 
 str the rest of the citizens out of whom if they have 
 education something noble may be made and who are capable of being united by the statesman the kingly art blends and weaves together taking on the one hand those whose natures tend rather to courage which is the stronger element and may be regarded as the warp and on the other hand those which incline to order and gentleness and which are represented in the figure as spun thick and soft after the manner of the which are naturally opposed she seeks to bind and weave together in the following manner 
 
 y soc in what manner 
 
 str first of all she takes the eternal element of the soul and 
 binds it with a divine cord to which it is akin and then the 
 animal nature and binds that with human cords 
 
 y soc i do not understand what you mean 
 
 str the meaning is that the opinion about the honourable and the 
 just and good and their opposites which is true and confirmed by 
 reason is a divine principle and when implanted in the soul is 
 implanted as i maintain in a nature of heavenly birth 
 
 y soc yes what else should it be 
 
 str only the statesman and the good legislator having the 
 inspiration of the royal muse can implant this opinion and he 
 only in the rightly educated whom we were just now describing 
 
 y soc likely enough 
 
 str but him who cannot we will not designate by any of the names 
 which are the subject of the present which are the subject of the 
 present enquiry 
 
 y soc very right 
 
 str the courageous soul when attaining this truth becomes 
 civilized and rendered more capable of partaking of 
 justice but when not partaking is inclined to brutality is not that true 
 
 y soc certainly 
 
 str and again the peaceful and orderly nature if sharing in these 
 opinions becomes temperate and wise as far as this may be in a 
 state but if not deservedly obtains the ignominious name of 
 silliness 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str can we say that such a connection as this will lastingly 
 unite the evil with one another or with the good or that any 
 science would seriously think of using a bond of this kind to join 
 such materials 
 
 y soc impossible 
 
 str but in those who were originally of a noble nature and who 
 have been nurtured in noble ways and in those only may we not say 
 that union is implanted by law and that this is the medicine which 
 art prescribes for them and of all the bonds which unite the 
 dissimilar and contrary parts of virtue is not this as i was 
 saying the divinest 
 
 y soc very true 
 
 str where this divine bond exists there is no difficulty in 
 imagining or when you have imagined in creating the other bonds 
 which are human only 
 
 y soc how is that and what bonds do you mean 
 
 str rights of intermarriage and ties which are formed between 
 states by giving and taking children in marriage or between 
 individuals by private betrothals and espousals for most persons 
 form marriage connection without due regard to what is best for the 
 procreation of children 
 
 y soc in what way 
 
 str they seek after wealth and power which in matrimony are 
 objects not of a serious censure 
 
 y soc there is no need to consider them at all 
 
 str more reason to consider the practice of 
 those who make family their chief aim and to indicate their error 
 
 y soc quite true 
 
 str they act on no true principle at all they seek their ease 
 and receive with open arms those are like themselves and hate those 
 who are unlike them being too much influenced by feelings 
 of dislike 
 
 y soc how so 
 
 str the quiet orderly class seek for natures like their 
 own and as far as they can they marry and give in marriage exclusively in this class and the courageous do the same they seek natures like their own whereas they should both do precisely the opposite 
 
 y soc how and why is that 
 
 str because courage when untempered by the gentler nature during 
 many generations may at first bloom and strengthen but at last 
 bursts forth into downright madness 
 
 y soc like enough 
 
 str and then again the soul which is of 
 modesty and has no element of courage in many successive generations is apt to grow too indolent and at last to become utterly paralyzed and useless 
 
 y soc that again is quite likely 
 
 str it was of these bonds i said that there would be no 
 difficulty in creating them if only both classes originally held 
 the same opinion about the honourable and in 
 this single work the whole process of royal weaving is to allow temperate natures to be separated from the brave but to weave them together like the warp and the woof by common sentiments and honours and reputation and by the giving of pledges to one another and out of them forming one smooth and even web to entrust to them the offices of state 
 y soc how do you mean 
 str where one officer only is needed you must choose a ruler who has both these many you must mingle some of each 
 for the temperate ruler is very careful and just and safe but is 
 wanting in thoroughness and go 
 
 y soc certainly that is very true 
 
 str the character of the courageous on the other hand 
 falls short of the former in justice and caution but has the power of 
 action in a remarkable degree and where either of these two qualities 
 is wanting there cities cannot altogether prosper either in their public or private life 
 
 y soc certainly they cannot 
 
 str this then we declare to be the completion of the web of 
 political action which is created by a direct intertexture of the 
 brave and temperate natures whenever the royal science has drawn 
 the two minds into communion with one another by unanimity and 
 friendship and having perfected the noblest and best of all the 
 webs which political life admits and enfolding therein all other 
 inhabitants of cities whether slaves or freemen binds them in one 
 fabric and governs and presides over them and in so far as to be 
 happy is vouchsafed to a city in no particular fails to secure 
 their happiness 
 
 y soc your picture stranger of the king and statesman no less 
 than of the sophist is quite perfect
