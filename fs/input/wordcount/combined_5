 chapter viii 
 
 the friends were silent neither cared to begin talking pierre continually glanced at prince andrew prince andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand 
 let us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the door 
 they entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining room everything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on his face began to talk as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out 
 never never marry my dear fellow my advice never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake marry when you are old and good for nothing or all that is good and noble in you will be lost it will all be wasted on trifles yes yes yes look at me with such surprise if you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future you will feel at every step that for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing room where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot but the good and he waved his arm 
 pierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different and the expression still more apparent and gazed at his friend in amazement 
 my wife continued prince andrew is an excellent woman one of those rare women with whom a honor is safe but o god what would i not give now to be unmarried you are the first and only one to whom i mention this because i like you 
 as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkonski who had lolled in anna easy chairs and with eyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation 
 you understand why i say this he continued but it is the whole story of life you talk of bonaparte and his career said he though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte but bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal he was free he had nothing but his aim to consider and he reached it but tie yourself up with a woman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom and all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and triviality these are the enchanted circle i cannot escape from i am now going to the war the greatest war there ever was and i know nothing and am fit for nothing i am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued prince andrew and at anna they listen to me and that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist and those women if you only knew what those society women are and women in general my father is right selfish vain stupid trivial in everything what women are when you see them in their true colors when you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them but nothing nothing nothing no marry my dear fellow marry concluded prince andrew 
 it seems funny to me said pierre that you you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life you have everything before you everything and you 
 he did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future 
 how can he talk like that thought pierre he considered his friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked and which might be best described as strength of will pierre was always astonished at prince calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memory his extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and had an opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for work and study and if pierre was often struck by lack of capacity for philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength 
 even in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise and commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly 
 my part is played out said prince andrew the use of talking about me let us talk about you he added after a silence smiling at his reassuring thoughts 
 that smile was immediately reflected on face 
 but what is there to say about me said pierre his face relaxing into a careless merry smile what am i an illegitimate son he suddenly blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this without a name and without means and it really but he did not say what it really was for the present i am free and am all right only i the least idea what i am to do i wanted to consult you seriously 
 prince andrew looked kindly at him yet his glance friendly and affectionate as it was expressed a sense of his own superiority 
 i am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among our whole set yes all right choose what you will all the same be all right anywhere but look here give up visiting those kuragins and leading that sort of life it suits you so badly all this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it 
 what would you have my dear fellow answered pierre shrugging his shoulders women my dear fellow women 
 i understand it replied prince andrew women who are comme il faut a different matter but the kuragins set of women women and wine i understand 
 pierre was staying at prince vasili and sharing the dissipated life of his son anatole the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to prince sister 
 do you know said pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thought seriously i have long been thinking of it leading such a life i decide or think properly about anything head aches and one spends all money he asked me for tonight but i go 
 you give me your word of honor not to go 
 on my honor

 chapter 
 
 on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock was born we were busy with the hay in a far away field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran 
 oh such a grand bairn she panted out the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says been in a consumption these many months i heard him tell mr hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and be dead before winter you must come home directly to nurse it nelly to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis 
 but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet 
 i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man out of her head for joy such a beauty if i were her certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of kenneth i was fairly mad at him dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up then the old croaker steps forward and says he earnshaw a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son when she came i felt convinced we keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her take on and fret about it too much it be helped and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass 
 and what did the master answer i inquired 
 i think he swore but i mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for sake he had room in his heart only for two wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i conceive how he would bear the loss 
 when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby 
 nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile 
 and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says 
 damn the doctor he interrupted reddening frances is quite right be perfectly well by this time next week are you going upstairs will you tell her that come if promise not to talk i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she her mr kenneth says she must be quiet 
 i delivered this message to mrs earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily 
 i hardly spoke a word there he has gone out twice crying well say i promise i speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him 
 poor soul till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he put him to further expense by attending her he retorted 
 i know you need does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool 
 he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up tomorrow a fit of coughing took very slight raised her in his arms she put her two hands about his neck her face changed and she was dead 
 as the girl had anticipated the child hareton fell wholly into my hands mr earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove 
 the bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity i could not half tell what an infernal house we had the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless edgar visits to miss cathy might be an exception at fifteen she was the queen of the countryside she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature i own i did not like her after her infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young linton with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace it used to hang on one side and his on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was can you make that out 
 mrs dean raised the candle and i discerned a face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression it formed a sweet picture the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eyes were large and serious the figure almost too graceful i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw 
 a very agreeable portrait i observed to the housekeeper is it like 
 yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general 
 catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive anyone in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise mr edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly he had a terror of reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery that sounds but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility she did bring herself finally to confess and confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser 
 mr hindley had gone from home one afternoon and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning his sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr earnshaw was faded away he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level then personal appearance sympathized with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance 
 catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him on the occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr edgar of her absence and was then preparing to receive him 
 cathy are you busy this afternoon asked heathcliff are you going anywhere 
 no it is raining she answered 
 why have you that silk frock on then he said nobody coming here i hope 
 not that i know of stammered miss but you should be in the field now heathcliff it is an hour past dinner time i thought you were gone 
 hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy not work any more today stay with you 
 oh but joseph will tell she suggested better go 
 joseph is loading lime on the farther side of pennistow crag it will take him till dark and never know 
 so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down catherine reflected an instant with knitted found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a silence as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good 
 order ellen to say you are engaged cathy he persisted turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours on the point sometimes of complaining that not 
 that they what cried catherine gazing at him with a troubled countenance oh nelly she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands combed my hair quite out of curl enough let me alone what are you on the point of complaining about heathcliff 
 look at the almanac on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me do you see marked every day 
 foolish as if i took notice replied catherine in a peevish tone and where is the sense of that 
 to show that i do take notice said heathcliff 
 and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated what good do i get what do you talk about you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either 
 you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company cathy exclaimed heathcliff in much agitation 
 no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered 
 her companion rose up but he time to express his feelings further for a feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect 
 he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do less gruff than we talk here and softer 
 not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser 
 no answered catherine what are you doing there nelly 
 my work miss i replied mr hindley had given me directions to make a third parry in any private visits linton chose to pay 
 she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are 
 a good opportunity now that the master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence sure mr edgar will excuse me 
 i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff 
 sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation 
 she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and not going to bear it 
 i touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze 
 that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her 
 she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water 
 catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed 
 leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over 
 little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest he drew back in consternation i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip 
 right i said to myself take warning and begone a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition 
 where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door 
 he swerved aside and attempted to pass 
 you must not go she exclaimed energetically 
 i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice 
 no she persisted grasping the handle not yet edgar linton sit down you shall not leave me in that temper i should be miserable all night and i be miserable for you 
 can i stay after you have struck me asked linton catherine was mute 
 made me afraid and ashamed of you he continued not come here again 
 her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle and you told a deliberate untruth he said 
 i she cried recovering her speech i did nothing deliberately well go if you away and now cry myself sick 
 she dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court there he lingered i resolved to encourage him 
 miss is dreadfully wayward sir i called out as bad as any marred child better be riding home or else she will be sick only to grieve us 
 the soft thing looked askance through the window he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half eaten ah i thought there will be no saving him doomed and flies to his fate and so it was he turned abruptly hastened into the house again shut the door behind him and when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home rabid drunk ready to pull the whole place about our ears his ordinary frame of mind in that condition i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful timidity and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship and confess themselves lovers 
 intelligence of mr arrival drove linton speedily to his horse and catherine to her chamber i went to hide little hareton and to take the shot out of the which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked or even attracted his notice too much and i had hit upon the plan of removing it that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun

 chapter eight 
 
 girls where are you going asked amy coming into their room one saturday afternoon and finding them getting ready to go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity 
 never mind little girls ask questions returned jo sharply 
 now if there is anything mortifying to out feelings when we are young it is to be told that and to be bidden to run away dear is still more trying to us amy bridled up at this insult and determined to find out the secret if she teased for an hour turning to meg who never refused her anything very long she said coaxingly do tell me i should think you might let me go too for beth is fussing over her piano and i got anything to do and am so lonely 
 i dear because you invited began meg but jo broke in impatiently now meg be quiet or you will spoil it all you go amy so be a baby and whine about it 
 you are going somewhere with laurie i know you are you were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night and you stopped when i came in you going with him 
 yes we are now do be still and stop bothering 
 amy held her tongue but used her eyes and saw meg slip a fan into her pocket 
 i know i know going to the theater to see the seven castles she cried adding resolutely and i shall go for mother said i might see it and got my rag money and it was mean not to tell me in time 
 just listen to me a minute and be a good child said meg soothingly mother wish you to go this week because your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this fairy piece next week you can go with beth and hannah and have a nice time 
 i like that half as well as going with you and laurie please let me been sick with this cold so long and shut up dying for some fun do meg be ever so good pleaded amy looking as pathetic as she could 
 suppose we take her i believe mother would mind if we bundle her up well began meg 
 if she goes i and if i laurie like it and it will be very rude after he invited only us to go and drag in amy i should think hate to poke herself where she wanted said jo crossly for she disliked the trouble of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself 
 her tone and manner angered amy who began to put her boots on saying in her most aggravating way i shall go meg says i may and if i pay for myself laurie anything to do with it 
 you sit with us for our seats are reserved and you sit alone so laurie will give you his place and that will spoil our pleasure or get another seat for you and that proper when you asked you stir a step so you may just stay where you are scolded jo crosser than ever having just pricked her finger in her hurry 
 sitting on the floor with one boot on amy began to cry and meg to reason with her when laurie called from below and the two girls hurried down leaving their sister wailing for now and then she forgot her ways and acted like a spoiled child just as the party was setting out amy called over the banisters in a threatening tone be sorry for this jo march see if you 
 fiddlesticks returned jo slamming the door 
 they had a charming time for the seven castles of the diamond lake was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish but in spite of the comical red imps sparkling elves and the gorgeous princes and princesses pleasure had a drop of bitterness in it the fairy yellow curls reminded her of amy and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her sorry for it she and amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly roused amy teased jo and jo irritated amy and semioccasional explosions occurred of which both were much ashamed afterward although the oldest jo had the least and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble her anger never lasted long and having humbly confessed her fault she sincerely repented and tried to do better her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get jo into a fury because she was such an angel afterward poor jo tried desperately to be good but her bosom enemy was always ready to flame up and defeat her and it took years of patient effort to subdue it 
 when they got home they found amy reading in the parlor she assumed an injured air as they came in never lifted her eyes from her book or asked a single question perhaps curiosity might have conquered resentment if beth had not been there to inquire and receive a glowing description of the play on going up to put away her best hat first look was toward the bureau for in their last quarrel amy had soothed her feelings by turning top drawer upside down on the floor everything was in its place however and after a hasty glance into her various closets bags and boxes jo decided that amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs 
 there jo was mistaken for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest meg beth and amy were sitting together late in the afternoon when jo burst into the room looking excited and demanding breathlessly has anyone taken my book 
 meg and beth said no at once and looked surprised amy poked the fire and said nothing jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute 
 amy got it 
 no i 
 you know where it is then 
 no i 
 a fib cried jo taking her by the shoulders and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than amy 
 it i got it know where it is now and care 
 you know something about it and better tell at once or make you and jo gave her a slight shake 
 scold as much as you like never see your silly old book again cried amy getting excited in her turn 
 why not 
 i burned it up 
 what my little book i was so fond of and worked over and meant to finish before father got home have you really burned it said jo turning very pale while her eyes kindled and her hands clutched amy nervously 
 yes i did i told you make you pay for being so cross yesterday and i have so 
 amy got no farther for hot temper mastered her and she shook amy till her teeth chattered in her head crying in a passion of grief and anger 
 you wicked wicked girl i never can write it again and never forgive you as long as i live 
 meg flew to rescue amy and beth to pacify jo but jo was quite beside herself and with a parting box on her ear she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret and finished her fight alone 
 the storm cleared up below for mrs march came home and having heard the story soon brought amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister book was the pride of her heart and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great promise it was only half a dozen little fairy tales but jo had worked over them patiently putting her whole heart into her work hoping to make something good enough to print she had just copied them with great care and had destroyed the old manuscript so that bonfire had consumed the loving work of several years it seemed a small loss to others but to jo it was a dreadful calamity and she felt that it never could be made up to her beth mourned as for a departed kitten and meg refused to defend her pet mrs march looked grave and grieved and amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon for the act which she now regretted more than any of them 
 when the tea bell rang jo appeared looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all courage to say meekly 
 please forgive me jo very very sorry 
 i never shall forgive you was stern answer and from that moment she ignored amy entirely 
 no one spoke of the great trouble not even mrs march for all had learned by experience that when jo was in that mood words were wasted and the wisest course was to wait till some little accident or her own generous nature softened resentment and healed the breach it was not a happy evening for though they sewed as usual while their mother read aloud from bremer scott or edgeworth something was wanting and the sweet home peace was disturbed they felt this most when singing time came for beth could only play jo stood dumb as a stone and amy broke down so meg and mother sang alone but in spite of their efforts to be as cheery as larks the flutelike voices did not seem to chord as well as usual and all felt out of tune 
 as jo received her kiss mrs march whispered gently my dear let the sun go down upon your anger forgive each other help each other and begin again tomorrow 
 jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom and cry her grief and anger all away but tears were an unmanly weakness and she felt so deeply injured that she really quite forgive yet so she winked hard shook her head and said gruffly because amy was listening it was an abominable thing and she deserve to be forgiven 
 with that she marched off to bed and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night 
 amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been repulsed and began to wish she had not humbled herself to feel more injured than ever and to plume herself on her superior virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating jo still looked like a thunder cloud and nothing went well all day it was bitter cold in the morning she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter aunt march had an attack of the fidgets meg was sensitive beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home and amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet even try when other people set them a virtuous example everybody is so hateful ask laurie to go skating he is always kind and jolly and will put me to rights i know said jo to herself and off she went 
 amy heard the clash of skates and looked out with an impatient exclamation 
 there she promised i should go next time for this is the last ice we shall have but no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me 
 say that you were very naughty and it is hard to forgive the loss of her precious little book but i think she might do it now and i guess she will if you try her at the right minute said meg go after them say anything till jo has got with laurie than take a quiet minute and just kiss her or do some kind thing and sure be friends again with all her heart 
 try said amy for the advice suited her and after a flurry to get ready she ran after the friends who were just disappearing over the hill 
 it was not far to the river but both were ready before amy reached them jo saw her coming and turned her back laurie did not see for he was carefully skating along the shore sounding the ice for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap 
 go on to the first bend and see if all right before we begin to race amy heard him say as he shot away looking like a young russian in his coat and cap 
 jo heard amy panting after her run stamping her feet and blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on but jo never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river taking a bitter unhappy sort of satisfaction in her troubles she had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession of her as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at once as laurie turned the bend he shouted back 
 keep near the shore it safe in the middle jo heard but amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word jo glanced over her shoulder and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear 
 no matter whether she heard or not let her take care of herself 
 laurie had vanished round the bend jo was just at the turn and amy far behind striking out toward the the smoother ice in the middle of the river for a minute jo stood still with a strange feeling in her heart then she resolved to go on but something held and turned her round just in time to see amy throw up her hands and go down with a sudden crash of rotten ice the splash of water and a cry that made heart stand still with fear she tried to call laurie but her voice was gone she tried to rush forward but her feet seemed to have no strength in them and for a second she could only stand motionless staring with a face at the little blue hood above the black water something rushed swiftly by her and voice cried out 
 bring a rail quick quick 
 how she did it she never knew but for the next few minutes she worked as if possessed blindly obeying laurie who was quite and lying flat held amy up by his arm and hockey stick till jo dragged a rail from the fence and together they got the child out more frightened than hurt 
 now then we must walk her home as fast as we can pile our things on her while i get off these confounded skates cried laurie wrapping his coat round amy and tugging away at the straps which never seemed so intricate before 
 shivering dripping and crying they got amy home and after an exciting time of it she fell asleep rolled in blankets before a hot fire during the bustle jo had scarcely spoken but flown about looking pale and wild with her things half off her dress torn and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles when amy was comfortably asleep the house quiet and mrs march sitting by the bed she called jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands 
 are you sure she is safe whispered jo looking remorsefully at the golden head which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice 
 quite safe dear she is not hurt and even take cold i think you were so sensible in covering and getting her home quickly replied her mother cheerfully 
 laurie did it all i only let her go mother if she should die it would be my fault and jo dropped down beside the bed in a passion of penitent tears telling all that had happened bitterly condemning her hardness of heart and sobbing out her gratitude for being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her my dreadful temper i try to cure it i think i have and then it breaks out worse than ever oh mother what shall i do what shall i do cried poor jo in despair 
 watch and pray dear never get tired of trying and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault said mrs march drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek so tenderly that jo cried even harder 
 you know you guess how bad it is it seems as if i could do anything when in a passion i get so savage i could hurt anyone and enjoy it afraid i shall do something dreadful some day and spoil my life and make everybody hate me oh mother help me do help me 
 i will my child i will cry so bitterly but remember this day and resolve with all your soul that you will never know another like it jo dear we all have our temptations some far greater than yours and it often takes us all our lives to conquer them you think your temper is the worst in the world but mine used to be just like it 
 yours mother why you are never angry and for the moment jo forgot remorse in surprise 
 been trying to cure it for forty years and have only succeeded in controlling it i am angry nearly every day of my life jo but i have learned not to show it and i still hope to learn not to feel it though it may take me another forty years to do so 
 the patience and the humility of the face she loved so well was a better lesson to jo than the wisest lecture the sharpest reproof she felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her the knowledge that her mother had a fault like hers and tried to mend it made her own easier to bear and strengthened her resolution to cure it though forty years seemed rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen 
 mother are you angry when you fold your lips tight together and go out of the room sometimes when aunt march scolds or people worry you asked jo feeling nearer and dearer to her mother than ever before 
 yes learned to check the hasty words that rise to my lips and when i feel that they mean to break out against my will i just go away for a minute and give myself a little shake for being so weak and wicked answered mrs march with a sigh and a smile as she smoothed and fastened up disheveled hair 
 how did you learn to keep still that is what troubles me for the sharp words fly out before i know what about and the more i say the worse i get till a pleasure to hurt feelings and say dreadful things tell me how you do it marmee dear 
 my good mother used to help me 
 as you do us interrupted jo with a grateful kiss 
 but i lost her when i was a little older than you are and for years had to struggle on alone for i was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else i had a hard time jo and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures for in spite of my efforts i never seemed to get on then your father came and i was so happy that i found it easy to be good but when i had four little daughters round me and we were poor then the old trouble began again for i am not patient by nature and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything 
 poor mother what helped you then 
 your father jo he never loses patience never doubts or complains but always hopes and works and waits so cheerfully that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him he helped and comforted me and showed me that i must try to practice all the virtues i would have my little girls possess for i was their example it was easier to try for your sakes than for my own a startled or surprised look from one of you when i spoke sharply rebuked me more than any words could have done and the love respect and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward i could receive for my efforts to be the woman i would have them copy 
 oh mother if ever half as good as you i shall be satisfied cried jo much touched 
 i hope you will be a great deal better dear but you must keep watch over your bosom enemy as father calls it or it may sadden if not spoil your life you have had a it and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today 
 i will try mother i truly will but you must help me remind me and keep me from flying out i used to see father sometimes put his finger on his lips and look at you with a very kind but sober face and you always folded your lips tight and went away was he reminding you then asked jo softly 
 yes i asked him to help me so and he never forgot it but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture and kind look 
 jo saw that her eyes filled and her lips trembled as she spoke and fearing that she had said too much she whispered anxiously was it wrong to watch you and to speak of it i mean to be rude but so comfortable to say all i think to you and feel so safe and happy here 
 mu jo you may say anything to your mother for it is my greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me and know how much i love them 
 i thought grieved you 
 no dear but speaking of father reminded me how much i miss him how much i owe him and how faithfully i should watch and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him 
 yet you told him to go mother and cry when he went and never complain now or seem as if you needed any help said jo wondering 
 i gave my best to the country i love and kept my tears till he was gone why should i complain when we both have merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in the end if i seem to need help it is because i have a better friend even than father to comfort and sustain me my child the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your heavenly father as you do that of your earthly one the more you love and trust him and the less you will depend on human power and wisdom his love and care never tire or change can never be taken from you but my become the source of lifelong peace happiness and strength believe this heartily and go to god with all your little cares and hopes and sins and sorrows as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother 
 only answer was to hold her mother close and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words for in that sad yet happy hour she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair but the sweetness of and and led by her hand she had drawn nearer to the friend who always welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father tenderer than that of any mother 
 amy stirred and sighed in her sleep and as if eager to begin at once to mend her fault l jo looked up with an expression on her face which it had never worn before 
 i let the sun go down on my anger i forgive her and today if it been for laurie it might have been too late how could i be so wicked said jo half aloud as she leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on the pillow 
 as if she heard amy opened her eyes and held out her arms with a smile that went straight to heart neither said a word but they hugged one another close in spite of the blankets and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss

 manageri think fit in here 
 lesteri have fast food experience 
 manageryes like twenty years ago 
 lesterwell sure there have been amazing technological advancements in the industry but surely you have some sort of training process it seems unfair to presume i be able to learn 
 the manger frowns unconvinced 
 lester you choose not to hire me i have to assume because of my age which i can only interpret as discrimination and would have to take up with my attorney 
 the manager sighs and runs an hand through his greasy hair wondering what he could possibly have done to deserve this

 int room 
 across the room a dark figure stares out the tall 
 windows veiled with decaying lace he turns and his 
 smile lights up the room 
 morpheus 
 at last 
 he wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible 
 behind circular mirrored glasses 
 he strides to neo and they shake hands 
 morpheus 
 welcome neo as you no doubt have guessed i am morpheus 
 neo 
 an honor 
 morpheus 
 please come sit 
 he nods to trinity 
 morpheus 
 thank you trinity 
 she bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an 
 adjacent room 
 they sit across from one another in cracked burgundy 
 leather chairs 
 morpheus 
 i imagine right now you must be feeling a bit like alice tumbling 
 down the rabbit hole 
 neo 
 you could say that 
 morpheus 
 i can see it in your eyes you have the look of a man who accepts 
 what he sees because he is expecting to wake up 
 a smile curls the corner of his lips 
 morpheus 
 ironically this is not far from the truth but getting ahead 
 of myself can you tell me neo why are you here 
 neo 
 morpheus a legend most hackers would die to meet 
 you 
 morpheus 
 yes thank you but i think we both know more to it than 
 that do you believe in fate neo 
 neo 
 no 
 morpheus 
 why not 
 neo 
 because i like the idea that not in control of my life 
 morpheus 
 i know exactly what you mean 
 again that smile that could cut glass 
 morpheus 
 let me tell you why you are here you are here because you have the gift 
 neo 
 what gift 
 morpheus 
 watched you neo you do not use a computer like a tool you 
 use it like it was part of yourself what you can do inside 
 a computer is not normal i know seen it what you do is 
 magic 
 neo shrugs 
 neo 
 not magic 
 morpheus 
 but it is neo it is how else would you describe what has been 
 happening to you 
 he leans forward 
 morpheus 
 we are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and 
 logical have you ever wondered why 
 neo shakes his head 
 morpheus 
 as children we do not separate the possible from the impossible 
 which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a 
 mind like yours can be very difficult 
 neo 
 free from what 
 morpheus 
 from the matrix 
 neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself 
 morpheus 
 do you want to know what it is neo 
 neo swallows and nods his head 
 morpheus 
 that feeling you have had all your life that feeling that 
 something was wrong with the world you know what it is 
 but there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad 
 driving you to me but what is it 
 the leather creaks as he leans back 
 morpheus 
 the matrix is everywhere all around us here even in this room 
 you can see it out your window or on your television you feel it 
 when you go to work or go to church or pay your taxes it is 
 the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from 
 the truth 
 neo 
 what truth 
 morpheus 
 that you are a slave neo that you like everyone else was born 
 into bondage 
 kept inside a prison that you cannot smell taste or touch a 
 prison for your mind 
 outside the wind batters a loose pane of glass 
 morpheus 
 unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is you have to 
 see it for yourself 
 neo 
 how 
 morpheus 
 hold out your hands 
 in right hand morpheus drops a red pill 
 morpheus 
 this is your last chance after this there is no going back 
 in his left a blue pill 
 morpheus 
 you take the blue pill and the story ends you wake in your bed 
 and you believe whatever you want to believe 
 the pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses 
 morpheus 
 you take the red pill and you stay in wonderland and i show you how deep the goes 
 neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules with the 
 moisture growing in his palms 
 morpheus 
 remember that all i am offering is the truth nothing more 
 neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill the 
 cheshire smile returns 
 morpheus 
 follow me 
 he leads neo into the other room which is cramped with 
 equipment glowing and electric green 
 from the racks of monitors 
 trinity apoc and cypher look up as they enter 
 cypher 
 shit 
 trinity 
 i knew he would 
 cypher saddles up to morpheus talking in a hushed tone 
 away from neo 
 cypher 
 morpheus i know what you believe but i think this is a mistake 
 rushing him old afraid he might pop 
 morpheus 
 i always told you cypher not to let fear control your life 
 apoc are we 
 neo recognizes the large man from the el train 
 apoc 
 almost 
 he and trinity are working quickly hardwiring a complex 
 system of monitors modules and drives 
 neo 
 apoc you wrote the four horsemen virus 
 apoc 
 right 
 morpheus 
 neo time is always against us will you take a seat there 
 in the center of the room sits a chair near the chair 
 is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked 
 morpheus 
 i imagine you know sonething about virtual reality 
 neo sits and trinity begins gently fixing white electrode 
 disks to his head arns and the back of his neck 
 neo 
 a little 
 morpheus 
 tell me about it 
 neo 
 essentially a hardware system that uses an apparatus 
 headgear gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a 
 computer program 
 morpheus 
 if the virtual reality apparatus as you called it was wired to all 
 of your senses and controlled them completely would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world 
 neo 
 you might not no 
 morpheus 
 no you 
 neo whispers to trinity 
 neo 
 you did all this 
 she nods placing a set of headphones over his ears 
 they are wired to an old hotel phone 
 morpheus 
 the pill you took is part of a trace program going to make 
 things feel a bit strange 
 distantly through the ear phones he hears apoc pounding 
 on a keyboard sweat beads his face his eyes blink and 
 twitch when he notices the mirror 
 he stares as it begins to heal itself a 
 webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the 
 mirror were becoming liquid 
 neo 
 shit 
 cypher works with apoc checking reams of phosphorescent 
 data trinity monitors electric vital signs 
 neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers 
 disappear beneath the rippling surface 
 quickly he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror 
 stretches in long rubbery strands like 
 stuck to his fingertips 
 neo 
 what is this mescaline 
 morpheus 
 just relax neo 
 the strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away 
 until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break 
 with the tinkling of glass shimmering snowflakes 
 of mercury fall hit the ground and 
 fade 
 he looks at his hand fingers distended into mirrored 
 icicles that begin to melt rapidly dripping running 
 like wax down his fingers spreading across his palms 
 where he sees his face reflected 
 neo 
 
 trinity 
 going into replication 
 morpheus 
 apoc 
 apoc 
 still nothing 
 morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number 
 morpheus 
 tank going to need the signal soon stay calm neo 
 the mirror gel seems to come to life racing crawling up 
 his arns like hundreds of insects 
 neo 
 cold 
 the mirror creeps up his neck as neo begins to panic 
 tipping his head as though he were sinking into the 
 mirror trying to keep his mouth up 
 neo 
 all over me 
 morpheus is right next to him with the phone 
 trinity 
 i got a fibrillation 
 cypher 
 i knew it i knew it 
 morpheus 
 shit apoc 
 streams of mercury run from nose 
 apoc 
 targeting almost there 
 an alarm on monitor erupts 
 trinity 
 going into arrest 
 cypher 
 gonna pop 
 apoc 
 lock i got him 
 morpheus 
 now tank now 
 his eyes tear with mirror rolling up and closing as a 
 electric scream erupts in the headphones 
 it is a piercing shriek like a computer calling to 
 another computer 
 body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were 
 pulled into the holes of the phone 
 sucked into his scream and swallowed by darkness

lionfish nov chapter eight the deathday partycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 october arrived spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle madam pomfrey the nurse was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students her pepperup potion worked instantly though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward ginny weasley who had been looking pale was bullied into taking some by percy the steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end the lake rose the flower beds turned into muddy streams and pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds oliver enthusiasm for regular training sessions however was not dampened which was why harry was to be found late one stormy saturday afternoon a few days before halloween returning to gryffindor tower drenched to the skin and splattered with mud 
 
 even aside from the rain and wind it been a happy practice session fred and george who had been spying on the slytherin team had seen for themselves the speed of those new nimbus two thousand and ones they reported that the slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs shooting through the air like missiles as harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was nearly headless nick the ghost of gryffindor tower was staring morosely out of a window muttering under his breath fulfill their requirements half an inch if that 
 
 hello nick said harry 
 
 hello hello said nearly headless nick starting and looking round he wore a dashing plumed hat on his long curly hair and a tunic with a ruff which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed he was pale as smoke and harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside 
 
 you look troubled young potter said nick folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet 
 
 so do you said harry 
 
 ah nearly headless nick waved an elegant hand a matter of no importance not as though i really wanted to join thought apply but apparently i fulfill requirements 
 
 in spite of his airy tone there was a look of great bitterness on his face 
 
 but you would think you he erupted suddenly pulling the letter back out of his pocket that getting hit times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the headless hunt 
 
 oh yes said harry who was obviously supposed to agree 
 
 i mean nobody wishes more than i do that it had all been quick and clean and my head had come off properly i mean it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule however nearly headless nick shook his letter open and read furiously 
 
 we can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies you will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as horseback and head polo it is with the greatest regret therefore that i must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements with very best wishes sir patrick 
 
 fuming nearly headless nick stuffed the letter away 
 
 half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on harry most people would think good and beheaded but oh no not enough for sir properly 
 
 nearly headless nick took several deep breaths and then said in a far calmer tone so bothering you anything i can do 
 
 no said harry not unless you know where we can get seven free nimbus two thousand and ones for our match against sly 
 
 the rest of sentence was drowned out by a mewling from somewhere near his ankles he looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of yellow eyes it was mrs norris the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker argus filch as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students 
 
 better get out of here harry said nick quickly filch in a good mood got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five been cleaning all morning and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place 
 
 right said harry backing away from the accusing stare of mrs norris but not quickly enough drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat argus filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to right wheezing and looking wildly about for the there was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head and his nose was unusually purple 
 
 filth he shouted his jowls aquiver his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from quidditch robes mess and muck everywhere had enough of it i tell you follow me potter 
 
 so harry waved a gloomy to nearly headless nick and followed filch back downstairs doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor harry had never been inside office before it was a place most students avoided the room was dingy and windowless lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling a faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls from their labels harry could see that they contained details of every pupil filch had ever punished fred and george weasley had an entire drawer to themselves a highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind desk it was common knowledge that he was always begging dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling 
 
 filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment 
 
 dung he muttered furiously great sizzling dragon bogies frog brains rat intestines had enough of it make an example the form yes 
 
 he retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him dipping his long black quill into the ink pot 
 
 name harry potter crime 
 
 it was only a bit of mud said harry 
 
 only a bit of mud to you boy but to me an extra hour scrubbing shouted filch a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose crime befouling the castle suggested sentence 
 
 dabbing at his streaming nose filch squinted unpleasantly at harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall 
 
 but as filch lowered his quill there was a great bang on the ceiling of the office which made the oil lamp rattle 
 
 peeves filch roared flinging down his quill in a transport of rage have you this time have you 
 
 and without a backward glance at harry filch ran from the office mrs norris streaking alongside him 
 
 peeves was the school poltergeist a grinning airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress harry much like peeves but help feeling grateful for his timing hopefully whatever peeves had done and it sounded as though wrecked something very big this time would distract filch from harry 
 
 thinking that he should probably wait for filch to come back harry sank into a chair next to the desk there was only one thing on it apart from his form a large glossy purple envelope with silver lettering on the front with a quick glance at the door to check that filch on his way back harry picked up the envelope and read 
 
 kwikspell 
 
 a correspondence course in 
 
 intrigued harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside more curly silver writing on the front page said 
 
 
 feel out of step in the world of modern magic find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork 
 
 there is an answer 
 
 kwikspell is an course hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the kwikspell method 
 
 madam z nettles of topsham writes 
 
 i had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke now after a kwikspell course i am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my scintillation solution 
 
 warlock d j prod of didsbury says 
 
 my wife used to sneer at my feeble charms but one month into your fabulous kwikspell course and i succeeded in turning her into a yak thank you kwikspell 
 
 fascinated harry thumbed through the rest of the contents why on earth did filch want a kwikspell course did this mean he a proper wizard harry was just reading lesson one holding your wand some useful tips when shuffling footsteps outside told him filch was coming back stuffing the parchment back into the envelope harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened 
 
 filch was looking triumphant 
 
 that vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable he was saying gleefully to mrs norris have peeves out this time my sweet 
 
 his eyes fell on harry and then darted to the kwikspell envelope which harry realized too late was lying two feet away from where it had started 
 
 pasty face went brick red harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury filch hobbled across to his desk snatched up the envelope and threw it into a drawer 
 
 have you did you read he sputtered 
 
 no harry lied quickly 
 
 knobbly hands were twisting together 
 
 if i thought read my private not that mine for a friend be that as it may however 
 
 harry was staring at him alarmed filch had never looked madder his eyes were popping a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks and the tartan scarf help 
 
 very well go and breathe a word not that however if you read go now i have to write up go 
 
 amazed at his luck harry sped out of the office up the corridor and back upstairs to escape from office without punishment was probably some kind of school record 
 
 harry harry did it work 
 
 nearly headless nick came gliding out of a classroom behind him harry could see the wreckage of a large cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height 
 
 i persuaded peeves to crash it right over office said nick eagerly thought it might distract him 
 
 was that you said harry gratefully yeah it worked i even get detention thanks nick 
 
 they set off up the corridor together nearly headless nick harry noticed was still holding sir rejection letter 
 
 i wish there was something i could do for you about the headless hunt harry said nearly headless nick stopped in his tracks and harry walked right through him he wished he it was like stepping through an icy shower 
 
 but there is something you could do for me said nick excitedly harry would i be asking too much but no you want 
 
 what is it said harry well this halloween will be my five hundredth deathday said nearly headless nick drawing himself up and looking dignified 
 
 oh said harry not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this right 
 
 holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons friends will be coming from all over the country it would be such an honor if you would attend mr weasley and miss granger would be most welcome too of course but i daresay rather go to the school feast he watched harry on tenterhooks 
 
 no said harry quickly come 
 
 my dear boy harry potter at my deathday party and he hesitated looking excited do you think you could possibly mention to sir patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me 
 
 of of course said harry 
 
 nearly headless nick beamed at him 
 
 a deathday party said hermione keenly when harry had changed at last and joined her and ron in the common room i bet there many living people who can say been to one of those be fascinating 
 
 why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died said ron who was halfway through his potions homework and grumpy sounds dead depressing to me 
 
 rain was still lashing the windows which were now inky black but inside all looked bright and cheerful the firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading talking doing homework or in the case of fred and george weasley trying to find out what would happen if you fed a filibuster firework to a salamander fred had rescued the brilliant orange lizard from a care of magical creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people 
 
 harry was at the point of telling ron and hermione about filch and the kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room the sight of percy bellowing himself hoarse at fred and george the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the mouth and its escape into the fire with accompanying explosions drove both filch and the kwikspell envelope from mind 
 
 by the time halloween arrived harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party the rest of the school was happily anticipating their halloween feast the great hall had been decorated with the usual live bats vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in and there were rumors that dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment 
 
 a promise is a promise hermione reminded harry bossily you said go to the deathday party 
 
 so at seven harry ron and hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed great hall which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons 
 
 the passageway leading to nearly headless party had been lined with candles too though the effect was far from cheerful these were long thin tapers all burning bright blue casting a dim ghostly light even over their own living faces the temperature dropped with every step they took as harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard 
 
 is that supposed to be music ron whispered they turned a corner and saw nearly headless nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes 
 
 my dear friends he said mournfully welcome welcome so pleased you could come 
 
 he swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside 
 
 it was an incredible sight the dungeon was full of hundreds of translucent people mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor waltzing to the dreadful quavering sound of thirty musical saws played by an orchestra on a raised platform a chandelier overhead blazed with a thousand more black candles their breath rose in a mist before them it was like stepping into a freezer 
 
 shall we have a look around harry suggested wanting to warm up his feet 
 
 careful not to walk through anyone said ron nervously and they set off around the edge of the dance floor they passed a group of gloomy nuns a ragged man wearing chains and the fat friar a cheerful hufflepuff ghost who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead harry surprised to see that the bloody baron a gaunt staring slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts 
 
 oh no said hermione stopping abruptly turn back turn back i want to talk to moaning myrtle 
 
 who said harry as they backtracked quickly 
 
 she haunts one of the toilets in the on the first floor said hermione 
 
 she haunts a toilet 
 
 yes been all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place i never went in there anyway if i could avoid it awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you 
 
 look food said ron 
 
 on the other side of the dungeon was a long table also covered in black velvet they approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks horrified the smell was quite disgusting large rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters cakes burned were heaped on salvers there was a great maggoty haggis a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and in pride of place an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone with icing forming the words 
 
 sir nicholas de 
 
 died st october 
 
 harry watched amazed as a portly ghost approached the table crouched low and walked through it his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon 
 
 can you taste it if you walk though it harry asked him 
 
 almost said the ghost sadly and he drifted away 
 
 i expect let it rot to give it a stronger flavor said hermione knowledgeably pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis 
 
 can we move i feel sick said ron 
 
 they had barely turned around however when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them 
 
 hello peeves said harry cautiously 
 
 unlike the ghosts around them peeves the poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent he was wearing a bright orange party hat a revolving bow tie and a broad grin on his wide wicked face 
 
 nibbles he said sweetly offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus 
 
 no thanks said hermione 
 
 heard you talking about poor myrtle said peeves his eyes dancing rude you was about poor myrtle he took a deep breath and bellowed oy myrtle 
 
 oh no peeves tell her what i said be really upset hermione whispered frantically i mean it i mind her er hello myrtle 
 
 the squat ghost of a girl had glided over she had the glummest face harry had ever seen behind lank hair and thick pearly spectacles 
 
 what she said sulkily 
 
 how are you myrtle said hermione in a falsely bright voice nice to see you out of the toilet 
 
 myrtle sniffed 
 
 miss granger was just talking about you said peeves slyly in ear just saying 
 
 just saying saying how nice you look tonight said hermione glaring at peeves 
 
 myrtle eyed hermione suspiciously 
 
 making fun of me she said silver tears welling rapidly in her small eyes 
 
 no honestly i just say how nice looking said hermione nudging harry and ron painfully in the ribs 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 she did 
 
 lie to me myrtle gasped tears now flooding down her face while peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder think i know what people call me behind my back fat myrtle ugly myrtle miserable moaning moping myrtle 
 
 forgotten pimply peeves hissed in her ear 
 
 moaning myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon peeves shot after her pelting her with moldy peanuts yelling pimply pimply 
 
 oh dear said hermione sadly 
 
 nearly headless nick now drifted toward them through the crowd 
 
 enjoying yourselves 
 
 oh yes they lied 
 
 not a bad turnout said nearly headless nick proudly the wailing widow came all the way up from kent nearly time for my speech better go and warn the orchestra 
 
 the orchestra however stopped playing at that very moment they and everyone else in the dungeon fell silent looking around in excitement as a hunting horn sounded 
 
 oh here we go said nearly headless nick bitterly 
 
 through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses each ridden by a headless horseman the assembly clapped wildly harry started to clap too but stopped quickly at the sight of face 
 
 the horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted rearing and plunging at the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm from which position he was blowing the horn the ghost leapt down lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd everyone laughed and strode over to nearly headless nick squashing his head back onto his neck 
 
 nick he roared how are you head still hanging in there 
 
 he gave a hearty guffaw and clapped nearly headless nick on the shoulder 
 
 welcome patrick said nick stiffly 
 
 live uns said sir patrick spotting harry ron and hermione and giving a huge fake jump of astonishment so that his head fell off again the crowd howled with laughter 
 
 very amusing said nearly headless nick darkly 
 
 mind nick shouted sir head from the floor still upset we let him join the hunt but i mean to say look at the fellow 
 
 i think said harry hurriedly at a meaningful look from nick very frightening and er 
 
 ha yelled sir head 
 
 bet he asked you to say that 
 
 if i could have attention time for my speech said nearly headless nick loudly striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight 
 
 my late lamented lords ladies and gentlemen it is my great sorrow 
 
 but nobody heard much more sir patrick and the rest of the headless hunt had just started a game of head hockey and the crowd were turning to watch nearly headless nick tried vainly to recapture his audience but gave up as sir head went sailing past him to loud cheers 
 
 harry was very cold by now not to mention hungry 
 
 i stand much more of this ron muttered his teeth chattering as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor 
 
 go harry agreed 
 
 they backed toward the door nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles 
 
 pudding might not be finished yet said ron hopefully leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall 
 
 and then harry heard it 
 
 rip tear kill 
 
 it was the same voice the same cold murderous voice he had heard in office 
 
 he stumbled to a halt clutching at the stone wall listening with all his might looking around squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway 
 
 harry you 
 
 that voice again shut up a minute 
 
 soo hungry for so long 
 
 listen said harry urgently and ron and hermione froze watching him 
 
 kill time to kill 
 
 the voice was growing fainter harry was sure it was moving away moving upward a mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling how could it be moving upward was it a phantom to whom stone ceilings matter 
 
 this way he shouted and he began to run up the stairs into the entrance hall it was no good hoping to hear anything here the babble of talk from the halloween feast was echoing out of the great hall harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor ron and hermione clattering behind him 
 
 harry we 
 
 shh 
 
 harry strained his ears distantly from the floor above and growing fainter still he heard the voice i smell blood i smell blood 
 
 his stomach lurched 
 
 going to kill someone he shouted and ignoring and bewildered faces he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor ron and hermione panting behind him not stopping until they turned a corner into the last deserted passage 
 
 harry what was that all about said ron wiping sweat off his face i hear anything 
 
 but hermione gave a sudden gasp pointing down the corridor 
 
 look 
 
 something was shining on the wall ahead they approached slowly squinting through the darkness words had been daubed on the wall between two windows shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches 
 
 the chamber of secrets has been 
 
 opened enemies of the heir beware 
 
 that thing hanging underneath said ron a slight quiver in his voice 
 
 as they edged nearer harry almost slipped there was a large puddle of water on the floor ron and hermione grabbed him and they inched toward the message eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it all three of them realized what it was at once and leapt backward with a splash 
 
 mrs norris the cat was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket she was stiff as a board her eyes wide and staring 
 
 for a few seconds they move then ron said get out of here 
 
 we try and help harry began awkwardly 
 
 trust me said ron we want to be found here 
 
 but it was too late a rumble as though of distant thunder told them that the feast had just ended from either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs and the loud happy talk of people next moment students were crashing into the passage from both ends 
 
 the chatter the bustle the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat harry ron and hermione stood alone in the middle of the corridor as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight 
 
 then someone shouted through the quiet 
 
 enemies of the heir beware be next mudbloods 
 
 it was draco malfoy he had pushed to the front of the crowd his cold eyes alive his usually bloodless face flushed as he grinned at the sight of the hanging immobile cat 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight flight of the fat ladycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 in no time at all defense against the dark arts had become most favorite class only draco malfoy and his gang of slytherins had anything bad to say about professor lupin 
 
 look at the state of his robes malfoy would say in a loud whisper as professor lupin passed he dresses like our old house elf 
 
 but no one else cared that professor robes were patched and frayed his next few lessons were just as interesting as the first after boggarts they studied red caps nasty little creatures that lurked wherever there had been bloodshed in the dungeons of castles and the potholes of deserted battlefields waiting to bludgeon those who had gotten lost from red caps they moved on to kappas creepy that looked like scaly monkeys with webbed hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds 
 
 harry only wished he was as happy with some of his other classes worst of all was potions snape was in a particularly vindictive mood these days and no one was in any doubt why the story of the boggart assuming shape and the way that neville had dressed it in his clothes had traveled through the school like wildfire snape seem to find it funny his eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of professor name and he was bullying neville worse than ever 
 
 harry was also growing to dread the hours he spent in professor stifling tower room deciphering lopsided shapes and symbols trying to ignore the way professor enormous eyes filled with tears every time she looked at him he like professor trelawney even though she was treated with respect bordering on reverence by many of the class parvati patil and lavender brown had taken to haunting professor tower room at lunch times and always returned with annoyingly superior looks on their faces as though they knew things the others they had also started using hushed voices whenever they spoke to harry as though he were on his deathbed 
 
 nobody really liked care of magical creatures which after the first class had become extremely dull hagrid seemed to have lost his confidence they were now spending lesson after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms which had to be some of the most boring creatures in existence 
 
 why would anyone bother looking after them said ron after yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobberworms throats 
 
 at the start of october however harry had something else to occupy him something so enjoyable it more than made up for his unsatisfactory classes the quidditch season was approaching and wood captain of the gryffindor team called a meeting on thursday evening to discuss tactics for the new season 
 
 there were seven people on a quidditch team three chasers whose job it was to score goals by putting the quaffle a red ball through one of the hoops at each end of the field two beaters who were equipped with heavy bats to repel the bludgers two heavy black balls that zoomed around trying to attack the players a keeper who defended the goal posts and the seeker who had the hardest job of all that of catching the golden snitch a tiny winged ball whose capture ended the game and earned the team an extra one hundred and fifty points 
 
 oliver wood was a burly now in his seventh and final year at hogwarts there was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly locker rooms on the edge of the darkening quidditch field 
 
 this is our last chance my last chance to win the quidditch cup he told them striding up and down in front of them be leaving at the end of this year never get another shot at it 
 
 gryffindor won for seven years now okay so had the worst luck in the world injuries then the tournament getting called off last year wood swallowed as though the memory still brought a lump to his throat but we also know got the best ruddy team in the school he said punching a fist into his other hand the old manic glint back in his eye got three superb chasers 
 
 wood pointed at alicia spinner angelina johnson and katie bell 
 
 got two unbeatable beaters 
 
 stop it oliver embarrassing us said fred and george weasley together pretending to blush 
 
 and got a seeker who has never failed to win us a match wood rumbled glaring at harry with a kind of furious pride and me he added as an afterthought 
 
 we think very good too oliver said george 
 
 spanking good keeper said fred 
 
 the point is wood went on resuming his pacing the quidditch cup should have had our name on it these last two years ever since harry joined the team thought the thing was in the bag but we got it and this the last chance get to finally see our name on the thing 
 
 wood spoke so dejectedly that even fred and george looked sympathetic 
 
 oliver this our year said fred 
 
 do it oliver said angelina 
 
 definitely said harry 
 
 full of determination the team started training sessions three evenings a week the weather was getting colder and wetter the nights darker but no amount of mud wind or rain could tarnish wonderful vision of finally winning the huge silver quidditch cup 
 
 harry returned to the gryffindor common room one evening after training cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had gone to find the room buzzing excitedly 
 
 happened he asked ron and hermione who were sitting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some star charts for astronomy 
 
 first hogsmeade weekend said ron pointing at a notice that had appeared on the battered old bulletin board end of october halloween 
 
 excellent said fred who had followed harry through the portrait hole i need to visit nearly out of stink pellets 
 
 harry threw himself into a chair beside ron his high spirits ebbing away hermione seemed to read his mind 
 
 harry sure be able to go next time she said bound to catch black soon been sighted once already 
 
 not fool enough to try anything in hogsmeade said ron ask mcgonagall if you can go this time harry the next one might not be for ages 
 
 ron said hermione supposed to stay in school 
 
 he be the only third year left behind said ron ask mcgonagall go on harry 
 
 yeah i think i will said harry making up his mind 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to argue but at that moment crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap a large dead spider was dangling from his mouth 
 
 does he have to eat that in front of us said ron scowling 
 
 clever crookshanks did you catch that all by yourself said hermione 
 
 crookshanks slowly chewed up the spider his yellow eyes fixed insolently on ron 
 
 just keep him over there all said ron irritably turning back to his star chart got scabbers asleep in my bag 
 
 harry yawned he really wanted to go to bed but he still had his own star chart to complete he pulled his bag toward him took out parchment ink and quill and started work 
 
 you can copy mine if you like said ron labeling his last star with a flourish and shoving the chart toward harry 
 
 hermione who disapproved of copying pursed her lips but say anything crookshanks was still staring unblinkingly at ron flicking the end of his bushy tail then without warning he pounced 
 
 oy ron roared seizing his bag as crookshanks sank four sets of claws deep inside it and began tearing ferociously get off you stupid animal 
 
 ron tried to pull the bag away from crookshanks but crookshanks clung on spitting and slashing 
 
 ron hurt him squealed hermione the whole common room was watching ron whirled the bag around crookshanks still clinging to it and scabbers came flying out of the top 
 
 catch that cat ron yelled as crookshanks freed himself from the remnants of the bag sprang over the table and chased after the terrified scabbers 
 
 george weasley made a lunge for crookshanks but missed scabbers streaked through twenty pairs of legs and shot beneath an old chest of drawers crookshanks skidded to a halt crouched low on his bandy legs and started making furious swipes beneath it with his front paw 
 
 ron and hermione hurried over hermione grabbed crookshanks around the middle and heaved him away ron threw himself onto his stomach and with great difficulty pulled scabbers out by the tail 
 
 look at him he said furiously to hermione dangling scabbers in front of her skin and bone you keep that cat away from him 
 
 crookshanks understand wrong said hermione her voice shaking all cats chase rats ron 
 
 something funny about that animal said ron who was trying to persuade a frantically wiggling scabbers back into his pocket it heard me say that scabbers was in my bag 
 
 oh what rubbish said hermione impatiently crookshanks could smell him ron how else think 
 
 that got it in for scabbers said ron ignoring the people around him who were starting to giggle and scabbers was here first and ill 
 
 ron marched through the common room and out of sight up the stairs to the boys dormitories 
 
 
 
 ron was still in a bad mood with hermione next day he barely talked to her all through herbology even though he harry and hermione were working together on the same puffapod 
 
 scabbers hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a wooden pail 
 
 hiding at the bottom of my bed shaking said ron angrily missing the pail and scattering beans over the greenhouse floor 
 
 careful weasley careful cried professor sprout as the beans burst into bloom before their very eyes 
 
 they had transfiguration next harry who had resolved to ask professor mcgonagall after the lesson whether he could go into hogsmeade with the rest joined the line outside the class trying to decide how he was going to argue his case he was distracted however by a disturbance at the front of the line 
 
 lavender brown seemed to be crying parvati had her arm around her and was explaining something to seamus finnigan and dean thomas who were looking very serious 
 
 the matter lavender said hermione anxiously as she harry and ron went to join the group 
 
 she got a letter from home this morning parvati whispered her rabbit binky been killed by a fox 
 
 oh said hermione sorry lavender 
 
 i should have known said lavender tragically you know what day it is 
 
 er 
 
 the sixteenth of october that thing dreading it will happen on the sixteenth of october remember she was right she was right 
 
 the whole class was gathered around lavender now seamus shook his head seriously hermione hesitated then she said you you were dreading binky being killed by a fox 
 
 well not necessarily by a fox said lavender looking up at hermione with streaming eyes but i was obviously dreading him dying i 
 
 oh said hermione she paused again then 
 
 was binky an old rabbit 
 
 n no sobbed lavender h he was only a baby 
 
 parvati tightened her arm around shoulders 
 
 but then why would you dread him dying said hermione 
 
 parvati glared at her 
 
 well look at it logically said hermione turning to the rest of the group i mean binky even die today did he lavender just got the news today lavender wailed loudly c and she have been dreading it because come as a real shock 
 
 mind hermione lavender said ron loudly she think other pets matter very much 
 
 professor mcgonagall opened the classroom door at that moment which was perhaps lucky hermione and ron were looking daggers at each other and when they got into class they seated themselves on either side of harry and talk to each other for the whole class 
 
 harry still decided what he was going to say to professor mcgonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson but it was she who brought up the subject of hogsmeade first 
 
 one moment please she called as the class made to leave as all in my house you should hand hogsmeade permission forms to me before halloween no form no visiting the village so forget 
 
 neville put up his hand 
 
 please professor i i think lost 
 
 your grandmother sent yours to me directly longbottom said professor mcgonagall she seemed to think it was safer well all you may leave 
 
 ask her now ron hissed at harry 
 
 oh but hermione began 
 
 go for it harry said ron stubbornly 
 
 harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear then headed nervously for professor desk 
 
 yes potter harry took a deep breath 
 
 professor my aunt and uncle er forgot to sign my form he said 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked over her square spectacles at him but say anything 
 
 so er think it would be all right mean will it be okay if i if i go to hogsmeade 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked down and began shuffling papers on her desk 
 
 afraid not potter she said you heard what i said no form no visiting the village the rule 
 
 but professor my aunt and uncle you know muggles they really understand about about hogwarts forms and stuff harry said while ron egged him on with vigorous nods if you said i could go 
 
 but i say so said professor mcgonagall standing up and piling her papers neatly into a drawer the form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission she turned to look at him with an odd expression on her face was it pity sorry potter but my final word you had better hurry or be late for your next lesson 
 
 
 
 there was nothing to be done ron called professor mcgonagall a lot of names that greatly annoyed hermione hermione assumed an expression that made ron even angrier and harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and happily about what they were going to do first once they got into hogsmeade 
 
 always the feast said ron in an effort to cheer harry up you know the halloween feast in the evening 
 
 yeah said harry gloomily great 
 
 the halloween feast was always good but it would taste a lot better if he was coming to it after a day in hogsmeade with everyone else nothing anyone said made him feel any better about being left behind dean thomas who was good with a quill had offered to forge uncle signature on the form but as harry had already told professor mcgonagall he had it signed that was no good ron halfheartedly suggested the invisibility cloak but hermione stamped on that one reminding ron what dumbledore had told them about the dementors being able to see through them percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort 
 
 they make a fuss about hogsmeade but i assure you harry not all cracked up to be he said seriously all right the rather good and joke frankly dangerous and yes the shrieking always worth a visit but really harry apart from that not missing anything 
 
 
 
 on halloween morning harry awoke with the rest and went down to breakfast feeling thoroughly depressed though doing his best to act normally 
 
 bring you lots of sweets back from honeydukes said hermione looking desperately sorry for him 
 
 yeah loads said ron he and hermione had finally forgotten their squabble about crookshanks in the face of difficulties 
 
 worry about me said harry in what he hoped was at offhand voice see you at the feast have a good time 
 
 he accompanied them to the entrance hall where filch the caretaker was standing inside the front doors checking off names against a long list peering suspiciously into every face and making sure that no one was sneaking out who be going 
 
 staying here potter shouted malfoy who was standing in line with crabbe and goyle scared of passing the dementors 
 
 harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble staircase through the deserted corridors and back to gryffindor tower 
 
 password said the fat lady jerking out of a doze 
 
 fortuna major said harry listlessly 
 
 the portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into the common room it was full of chattering and a few older students who had obviously visited hogsmeade so often the novelty had worn off 
 
 harry harry hi harry 
 
 it was colin creevey a second year who was deeply in awe of harry and never missed an opportunity to speak to him 
 
 you going to hogsmeade harry why not hey colin looked eagerly around at his friends you can come and sit with us if you like harry 
 
 er no thanks colin said harry who in the mood to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead i got to go to the library got to get some work done 
 
 after that he had no choice but to turn right around and head back out of the portrait hole again 
 
 what was the point of waking me up the fat lady called grumpily after him as he walked away 
 
 harry wandered dispiritedly toward the library but halfway there he changed his mind he feel like working he turned around and came with filch who had obviously just seen off the last of the hogsmeade visitors 
 
 what are you doing filch snarled suspiciously 
 
 nothing said harry truthfully 
 
 nothing spat filch his jowls quivering unpleasantly a likely story sneaking around on your own why you in hogsmeade buying stink pellets and belch powder and whizzing worms like the rest of your nasty little friends 
 
 harry shrugged 
 
 well get back to your common room where you belong snapped filch and he stood glaring until harry had passed out of sight 
 
 but harry go back to the common room he climbed a staircase thinking vaguely of visiting the owlery to see hedwig and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said harry 
 
 harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met professor lupin looking around his office door 
 
 what are you doing said lupin though in a very different voice from filch where are ron and hermione 
 
 hogsmeade said harry in a casual voice 
 
 ah said lupin he considered harry for a moment why you come in just taken delivery of a grindylow for our next lesson 
 
 a what said harry 
 
 he followed lupin into his office in the corner stood a very large tank of water a sickly green creature with sharp little horns had its face pressed against the glass pulling faces and flexing its long spindly fingers 
 
 water demon said lupin surveying the grindylow thoughtfully we have much difficulty with him not after the kappas the trick is to break his grip you notice the abnormally long fingers strong but very brittle 
 
 the grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a tangle of weeds in a corner 
 
 cup of tea lupin said looking around for his kettle i was just thinking of making one 
 
 all right said harry awkwardly 
 
 lupin tapped the kettle with his wand and a blast of steam issued suddenly from the spout 
 
 sit down said lupin taking the lid off a dusty tin only got teabags afraid but i daresay had enough of tea leaves 
 
 harry looked at him eyes were twinkling 
 
 how did you know about that harry asked 
 
 professor mcgonagall told me said lupin passing harry a chipped mug of tea not worried are you 
 
 no said harry 
 
 he thought for a moment of telling lupin about the dog seen in magnolia crescent but decided not to he want lupin to think he was a coward especially since lupin already seemed to think he cope with a boggart 
 
 something of thoughts seemed to have shown on his face because lupin said anything worrying you harry 
 
 no harry lied he drank a bit of tea and watched the grindylow brandishing a fist at him yes he said suddenly putting his tea down on desk you know that day we fought the boggart 
 
 yes said lupin slowly 
 
 why you let me fight it said harry abruptly 
 
 lupin raised his eyebrows 
 
 i would have thought that was obvious harry he said sounding surprised 
 
 harry who had expected lupin to deny that done any such thing was taken aback 
 
 why he said again 
 
 well said lupin frowning slightly i assumed that if the boggart faced you it would assume the shape of lord voldemort 
 
 harry stared not only was this the last answer expected but lupin had said name the only person harry had ever heard say the name aloud apart from himself was professor dumbledore 
 
 clearly i was wrong said lupin still frowning at harry but i think it a good idea for lord voldemort to materialize in the staffroom i imagined that people would panic 
 
 i think of voldemort said harry honestly i i remembered those dementors 
 
 i see said lupin thoughtfully well impressed he smiled slightly at the look of surprise on face that suggests that what you fear most of all is fear very wise harry 
 
 harry know what to say to that so he drank some more tea 
 
 so been thinking that i believe you capable of fighting the boggart said lupin shrewdly 
 
 wellyeah said harry he was suddenly feeling a lot happier professor lupin you know the dementors 
 
 he was interrupted by a knock on the door 
 
 come in called lupin 
 
 the door opened and in came snape he was carrying a goblet which was smoking faintly and stopped at the sight of harry his black eyes narrowing 
 
 ah severus said lupin smiling thanks very much could you leave it here on the desk for me 
 
 snape set down the smoking goblet his eyes wandering between harry and lupin 
 
 i was just showing harry my grindylow said lupin pleasantly pointing at the tank 
 
 fascinating said snape without looking at it you should drink that directly lupin 
 
 yes yes i will said lupin 
 
 i made an entire cauldronful snape continued if you need more 
 
 i should probably have some again tomorrow thanks very much severus 
 
 not at all said snape but there was a look in his eye harry like he backed out of the room unsmiling and watchful 
 
 harry looked curiously at the goblet lupin smiled 
 
 professor snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me he said i have never been much of a and this one is particularly complex he picked up the goblet and sniffed it pity sugar makes it useless he added taking a sip and shuddering 
 
 why harry began lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question 
 
 been feeling a bit he said this potion is the only thing that helps i am very lucky to be working alongside professor snape there many wizards who are up to making it 
 
 professor lupin took another sip and harry had a crazy urge to knock the goblet out of his hands 
 
 professor very interested in the dark arts he blurted out 
 
 really said lupin looking only mildly interested as he took another gulp of potion 
 
 some people reckon harry hesitated then plunged recklessly on some people reckon do anything to get the defense against the dark arts job 
 
 lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face 
 
 disgusting he said well harry better get back to work see you at the feast later 
 
 right said harry putting down his empty teacup 
 
 the empty goblet was still smoking 
 
 
 
 there you go said ron we got as much as we could carry 
 
 a shower of brilliantly colored sweets fell into lap it was dusk and ron and hermione had just turned up in the common room from the cold wind and looking as though had the time of their lives 
 
 thanks said harry picking up a packet of tiny black pepper imps hogsmeade like where did you go 
 
 by the sound of it everywhere dervish and banges the wizarding equipment shop joke shop into the three broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer and many places besides 
 
 the post office harry about two hundred owls all sitting on shelves all depending on how fast you want your letter to get there 
 
 honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge they were giving out free samples a bit look 
 
 we think we saw an ogre honestly they get all sorts at the three broomsticks 
 
 wish we could have brought you some butterbeer really warms you up 
 
 what did you do said hermione looking anxious did you get any work done 
 
 no said harry lupin made me a cup of tea in his office and then snape came in 
 
 he told them all about the goblet mouth fell open 
 
 lupin drank it he gasped is he mad 
 
 hermione checked her watch 
 
 better go down you know the be starting in five minutes they hurried through the portrait hole and into the crowd still discussing snape 
 
 but if he you know hermione dropped her voice glancing nervously around if he was trying to to poison lupin he have done it in front of harry 
 
 yeah maybe said harry as they reached the entrance hall and crossed into the great hall it had been decorated with hundreds and hundreds of pumpkins a cloud of fluttering live bats and many flaming orange streamers which were swimming lazily across the stormy ceiling like brilliant watersnakes 
 
 the food was delicious even hermione and ron who were full to bursting with honeydukes sweets managed second helpings of everything harry kept glancing at the staff table professor lupin looked cheerful and as well as he ever did he was talking animatedly to tiny little professor flitwick the charms teacher harry moved his eyes along the table to the place where snape sat was he imagining it or were eyes flickering toward lupin more often than was natural 
 
 the feast finished with an entertainment provided by the hogwarts ghosts they popped out of the walls and tables to do a bit of formation gliding nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched beheading 
 
 it had been such a pleasant evening that good mood even be spoiled by malfoy who shouted through the crowd as they all left the hall the dementors send their love potter 
 
 harry ron and hermione followed the rest of the gryffindors along the usual path to gryffindor tower but when they reached the corridor that ended with the portrait of the fat lady they found it jammed with students 
 
 why anyone going in said ron curiously 
 
 harry peered over the heads in front of him the portrait seemed to be closed 
 
 let me through please came voice and he came bustling importantly through the crowd the holdup here you all have forgotten the password excuse me head boy 
 
 and then a silence fell over the crowd from the front first so that a chill seemed to spread down the corridor they heard percy say in a suddenly sharp voice somebody get professor dumbledore quick 
 
 heads turned those at the back were standing on tiptoe 
 
 going on said ginny who had just arrived 
 
 a moment later professor dumbledore was there sweeping toward the portrait the gryffindors squeezed together to let him through and harry ron and hermione moved closer to see what the trouble was 
 
 oh my hermione grabbed arm 
 
 the fat lady had vanished from her portrait which had been slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor great chunks of it had been torn away completely dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and turned his eyes somber to see professors mcgonagall lupin and snape hurrying toward him 
 
 we need to find her said dumbledore professor mcgonagall please go to mr filch at once and tell him to search every painting in the castle for the fat lady

 clutching their purchases mr weasley in the lead they all hurried into the wood following the trail they could hear the sounds of thousands of people moving around them shouts and laughter snatches of singing the atmosphere of feverish excitement was highly infectious harry stop grinning they walked through the wood for twenty minutes talking and joking loudly until at last they emerged on the other side and found themselves in the shadow of a gigantic stadium though harry could see only a fraction of the immense gold walls surrounding the field he could tell that ten cathedrals would fit comfortably inside it 
 
 seats a hundred thousand said mr weasley spotting the awestruck look on face ministry task force of five hundred have been working on it all year muggle repelling charms on every inch of it every time muggles have got anywhere near here all year suddenly remembered urgent appointments and had to dash away againbless them he added fondly leading the way toward the nearest entrance which was already surrounded by a swarm of shouting witches and wizards 
 
 prime seats said the ministry witch at the entrance when she checked their tickets top box straight upstairs arthur and as high as you can go 
 
 the stairs into the stadium were carpeted in rich purple they clambered upward with the rest of the crowd which slowly filtered away through doors into the stands to their left and right mr party kept climbing and at last they reached the top of the staircase and found themselves in a small box set at the highest point of the stadium and situated exactly halfway between the golden goal posts about twenty chairs stood in two rows here and harry filing into the front seats with the weasleys looked down upon a scene the likes of which he could never have imagined 
 
 a hundred thousand witches and wizards were taking their places in the seats which rose in levels around the long oval field everything was suffused with a mysterious golden light which seemed to come from the stadium itself the field looked smooth as velvet from their lofty position at either end of the field stood three goal hoops fifty feet high right opposite them almost at eye level was a gigantic blackboard gold writing kept dashing across it as though an invisible hand were scrawling upon the blackboard and then wiping it off again watching it harry saw that it was flashing advertisements across the field 
 
 the bluebottle a broom for all the family safe reliable and with buzzermrs all purpose magical mess remover no pain no wizardwear london paris hogsmeade 
 harry tore his eyes away from the sign and looked over his shoulder to see who else was sharing the box with them so far it was empty except for a tiny creature sitting in the second from last seat at the end of the row behind them the creature whose legs were so short they stuck out in front of it on the chair was wearing a tea towel draped like a toga and it had its face hidden in its hands yet those long batlike ears were oddly familiar 
 
 dobby said harry incredulously 
 
 the tiny creature looked up and stretched its fingers revealing enormous brown eyes and a nose the exact size and shape of a large tomato it dobby it was however unmistakably a as friend dobby had been harry had set dobby free from his old owners the malfoy family 
 
 did sir just call me dobby squeaked the elf curiously from between its fingers its voice was higher even than had been a teeny quivering squeak of a voice and harry suspected though it was very hard to tell with a that this one might just be female ron and hermione spun around in their seats to look though they had heard a lot about dobby from harry they had never actually met him even mr weasley looked around in interest 
 
 sorry harry told the elf i just thought you were someone i knew 
 
 but i knows dobby too sir squeaked the elf she was shielding her face as though blinded by light though the top box was not brightly lit my name is winky sir and you sir her dark brown eyes widened to the size of side plates as they rested upon scar you is surely harry potter 
 
 yeah i am said harry 
 
 but dobby talks of you all the time sir she said lowering her hands very slightly and looking awestruck 
 
 how is he said harry freedom suiting him 
 
 ah sir said winky shaking her head ah sir meaning no disrespect sir but i is not sure you did dobby a favor sir when you is setting him free 
 
 why said harry taken aback wrong with him 
 
 freedom is going to head sir said winky sadly ideas above his station sir get another position sir 
 
 why not said harry 
 
 winky lowered her voice by a and whispered he is wanting paying for his work sir 
 
 paying said harry blankly well why he be paid 
 
 winky looked quite horrified at the idea and closed her fingers slightly so that her face was again 
 
 is not paid sir she said in a muffled squeak no no no i says to dobby i says go find yourself a nice family and settle down dobby he is getting up to all sorts of high jinks sir what is unbecoming to a you goes racketing around like this dobby i says and next thing i hear up in front of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures like some common goblin 
 
 well about time he had a bit of fun said harry 
 
 is not supposed to have fun harry potter said winky firmly from behind her hands does what they is told i is not liking heights at all harry potter she glanced toward the edge of the box and gulped but my master sends me to the top box and i comes sir 
 
 he sent you up here if he knows you like heights said harry frowning 
 
 master master wants me to save him a seat harry potter he is very busy said winky tilting her head toward the empty space beside her winky is wishing she is back in tent harry potter but winky does what she is told winky is a good 
 
 she gave the edge of the box another frightened look and hid her eyes completely again harry turned back to the others 
 
 so a ron muttered weird things they 
 
 dobby was weirder said harry fervently 
 
 ron pulled out his omnioculars and started testing them staring down into the crowd on the other side of the stadium 
 
 wild he said twiddling the replay knob on the side i can make that old bloke down there pick his nose againand againand again 
 
 hermione meanwhile was skimming eagerly through her velvetcovered tasseled program 
 
 a display from the team mascots will precede the match she read aloud 
 
 oh always worth watching said mr weasley national teams bring creatures from their native land you know to put on a bit of a show 
 
 the box filled gradually around them over the next half hour mr weasley kept shaking hands with people who were obviously very important wizards percy jumped to his feet so often that he looked as though he were trying to sit on a hedgehog when cornelius fudge the minister of magic himself arrived percy bowed so low that his glasses fell off and shattered highly embarrassed he repaired them with his wand and thereafter remained in his seat throwing jealous looks at harry whom cornelius fudge had greeted like an old friend they had met before and fudge shook hand in a fatherly fashion asked how he was and introduced him to the wizards on either side of him 
 
 harry potter you know he told the bulgarian minister loudly who was wearing splendid robes of black velvet trimmed with gold and seem to understand a word of english harry potteroh come on now you know who he isthe boy who survived do know who he is 
 
 the bulgarian wizard suddenly spotted scar and started gabbling loudly and excitedly pointing at it 
 
 knew get there in the end said fudge wearily to harry no great shakes at languages i need barty crouch for this sort of thing ah i see his saving him a job too these bulgarian blighters have been trying to cadge all the best placesah and lucius 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned quickly edging along the second row to three seats right behind mr weasley were none other than dobby the former owners lucius malfoy his son draco and a woman harry supposed must be mother 
 
 harry and draco malfoy had been enemies ever since their very first journey to hogwarts a pale boy with a pointed face and hair draco greatly resembled his father his mother was blonde too tall and slim she would have been if she been wearing a look that suggested there was a nasty smell under her nose 
 
 ah fudge said mr malfoy holding out his hand as he reached the minister of magic how are you i think met my wife narcissa or our son draco 
 
 how do you do how do you do said fudge smiling and bowing to mrs malfoy and allow me to introduce you to mr oblansk obalonsk mr well the bulgarian minister of magic and he understand a word saying anyway so never mind and see who else you know arthur weasley i daresay 
 
 it was a tense moment mr weasley and mr malfoy looked at each other and harry vividly recalled the last time they had come it had been in flourish and blotts bookshop and they had had a fight mr cold gray eyes swept over mr weasley and then up and down the row 
 
 good lord arthur he said softly what did you have to sell to get seats in the top box surely your house have fetched this much 
 
 fudge who listening said lucius has just given a very generous contribution to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries arthur here as my guest 
 
 how how nice said mr weasley with a very strained smile 
 
 mr eyes had returned to hermione who went slightly pink but stared determinedly back at him harry knew exactly what was making mr lip curl like that the malfoys prided themselves on being purebloods in other words they considered anyone of muggle descent like hermione however under the gaze of the minister of magic mr malfoy dare say anything he nodded sneeringly to mr weasley and continued down the line to his seats draco shot harry ron and hermione one contemptuous look then settled himself between his mother and father 
 
 slimy gits ron muttered as he harry and hermione turned to face the field again next moment ludo bagman charged into the box 
 
 everyone ready he said his round face gleaming like a great excited edam minister ready to go 
 
 ready when you are ludo said fudge comfortably 
 
 ludo whipped out his wand directed it at his own throat and said sonorus and then spoke over the roar of sound that was now filling the packed stadium his voice echoed over them booming into every corner of the stands 
 
 ladies and gentlemenwelcome welcome to the final of the four hundred and quidditch world cup 
 
 the spectators screamed and clapped thousands of flags waved adding their discordant national anthems to the racket the huge blackboard opposite them was wiped clear of its last message bertie every flavor beans a risk with every mouthful and now showed bulgaria ireland 
 
 and now without further ado allow me to introducethe bulgarian national team mascots 
 
 the side of the stands which was a solid block of scarlet roared its approval 
 
 i wonder what brought said mr weasley leaning forward in his seat aaah he suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes veela 
 
 what are veel 
 
 but a hundred veela were now gliding out onto the field and question was answered for him veela were womenthe most beautiful women harry had ever seenexcept that they they be human this puzzled harry for a moment while he tried to guess what exactly they could be what could make their skin shine like that or their hair fan out behind them without windbut then the music started and harry stopped worrying about them not being human in fact he stopped worrying about anything at all 
 
 the veela had started to dance and mind had gone completely and blissfully blank all that mattered in the world was that he kept watching the veela because if they stopped dancing terrible things would happen 
 
 and as the veela danced faster and faster wild thoughts started chasing through dazed mind he wanted to do something very impressive right now jumping from the box into the stadium seemed a good ideabut would it be good enough 
 
 harry what are you doing said voice from a long way off 
 
 the music stopped harry blinked he was standing up and one of his legs was resting on the wall of the box next to him ron was frozen in an attitude that looked as though he were about to dive from a springboard 
 
 angry yells were filling the stadium the crowd want the veela to go harry was with them he would of course be supporting bulgaria and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest ron meanwhile was absentmindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat mr weasley smiling slightly leaned over to ron and tugged the hat out of his hands 
 
 be wanting that he said once ireland have had their say 
 
 huh said ron staring openmouthed at the veela who had now lined up along one side of the field 
 
 hermione made a loud tutting noise she reached up and pulled harry back into his seat honestly she said 
 
 and now roared ludo voice kindly put your wands in the airfor the irish national team mascots 
 
 next moment what seemed to be a great comet came zooming into the stadium it did one circuit of the stadium then split into two smaller comets each hurtling toward the goal posts a rainbow arced suddenly across the field connecting the two balls of light the crowd oooohed and aaaaahed as though at a fireworks display now the rainbow faded and the balls of light reunited and merged they had formed a great shimmering shamrock which rose up into the sky and began to soar over the stands something like golden rain seemed to be falling from it 
 
 excellent yelled ron as the shamrock soared over them and heavy gold coins rained from it bouncing off their heads and seats squinting up at the shamrock harry realized that it was actually comprised of thousands of tiny little bearded men with red vests each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green 
 
 leprechauns said mr weasley over the tumultuous applause of the crowd many of whom were still fighting and rummaging around under their chairs to retrieve the gold 
 
 there you go ron yelled happily stuffing a fistful of gold coins into hand for the omnioculars now got to buy me a christmas present ha 
 
 the great shamrock dissolved the leprechauns drifted down onto the field on the opposite side from the veela and settled themselves to watch the match 
 
 and now ladies and gentlemen kindly welcome the bulgarian national quidditch team i give you dimitrov 
 
 a figure on a broomstick moving so fast it was blurred shot out onto the field from an entrance far below to wild applause from the bulgarian supporters 
 
 ivanova 
 
 a second player zoomed out 
 
 zograf levski vulchanov volkov aaaaaaand krum 
 
 him him yelled ron following krum with his omnioculars harry quickly focused his own 
 
 viktor krum was thin dark and with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows he looked like an overgrown bird of prey it was hard to believe he was only eighteen 
 
 and now please greet the irish national quidditch team yelled bagman presenting connolly ryan troy mullet moran quigley aaaaaand lynch 
 
 seven green blurs swept onto the field harry spun a small dial on the side of his omnioculars and slowed the players down enough to read the word firebolt on each of their brooms and see their names embroidered in silver upon their backs 
 
 and here all the way from egypt our referee acclaimed chairwizard of the international association of quidditch hassan mostafa 
 
 a small and skinny wizard completely bald but with a mustache to rival uncle wearing robes of pure gold to match the stadium strode out onto the field a silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache and he was carrying a large wooden crate under one arm his broomstick under the other harry spun the speed dial on his omnioculars back to normal watching closely as mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open four balls burst into the air the scarlet quaffle the two black bludgers and harry saw it for the briefest moment before it sped out of sight the minuscule winged golden snitch with a sharp blast on his whistle mostafa shot into the air after the balls 
 
 off screamed bagman and mullet troy moran dimitrov back to mullet troy levski moran 
 
 it was quidditch as harry had never seen it played before he was pressing his omnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his nose the speed of the players was incredible the chasers were throwing the quaffle to one another so fast that bagman only had time to say their names harry spun the slow dial on the right of his omnioculars again pressed the button on the top and he was immediately watching in slow motion while glittering purple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise of the crowd pounded against his eardrums 
 
 hawkshead attacking formation he read as he watched the three irish chasers zoom closely together troy in the center slightly ahead of mullet and moran bearing down upon the bulgarians porskoff ploy flashed up next as troy made as though to dart upward with the quaffle drawing away the bulgarian chaser ivanova and dropping the quaffle to moran one of the bulgarian beaters volkov swung hard at a passing bludger with his small club knocking it into path moran ducked to avoid the bludger and dropped the quaffle and levski soaring beneath caught it troy scores roared bagman and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause and cheers ten zero to ireland 
 
 what harry yelled looking wildly around through his omnioculars but got the quaffle 
 
 harry if not going to watch at normal speed going to miss things shouted hermione who was dancing up and down waving her arms in the air while troy did a lap of honor around the field harry looked quickly over the top of his omnioculars and saw that the leprechauns watching from the sidelines had all risen into the air again and formed the great glittering shamrock across the field the veela were watching them sulkily 
 
 furious with himself harry spun his speed dial back to normal as play resumed 
 
 harry knew enough about quidditch to see that the irish chasers were superb they worked as a seamless team their movements so well coordinated that they appeared to be reading one minds as they positioned themselves and the rosette on chest kept squeaking their names troy mullet moran and within ten minutes ireland had scored twice more bringing their lead to and causing a thunderous tide of roars and applause from the supporters 
 
 the match became still faster but more brutal volkov and vulchanov the bulgarian beaters were whacking the bludgers as fiercely as possible at the irish chasers and were starting to prevent them from using some of their best moves twice they were forced to scatter and then finally ivanova managed to break through their ranks dodge the keeper ryan and score first goal 
 
 fingers in your ears bellowed mr weasley as the veela started to dance in celebration harry screwed up his eyes too he wanted to keep his mind on the game after a few seconds he chanced a glance at the field the veela had stopped dancing and bulgaria was again in possession of the quaffle 
 
 dimitrov levski dimitrov ivanova oh i say roared bagman 
 
 one hundred thousand wizards gasped as the two seekers krum and lynch plummeted through the center of the chasers so fast that it looked as though they had just jumped from airplanes without parachutes harry followed their descent through his omnioculars squinting to see where the snitch was 
 
 going to crash screamed hermione next to harry 
 
 she was half right at the very last second viktor krum pulled out of the dive and spiraled off lynch however hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium a huge groan rose from the irish seats 
 
 fool moaned mr weasley krum was feinting 
 
 yelled voice as trained mediwizards hurry onto the field to examine aidan lynch 
 
 be okay he only got ploughed charlie said reassuringly to ginny who was hanging over the side of the box looking which is what krum was after of course 
 
 harry hastily pressed the replay and buttons on his omnioculars twiddled the speed dial and put them back up to his eyes 
 
 he watched as krum and lynch dived again in slow motion wronski defensive feint dangerous seeker diversion read the shining purple lettering across his lenses he saw face contorted with concentration as he pulled out of the dive just in time while lynch was flattened and he understood krum seen the snitch at all he was just making lynch copy him harry had never seen anyone fly like that krum hardly looked as though he was using a broomstick at all he moved so easily through the air that he looked unsupported and weightless harry turned his omnioculars back to normal and focused them on krum he was now circling high above lynch who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion harry focusing still more closely upon face saw his dark eyes darting all over the ground a hundred feet below he was using the time while lynch was revived to look for the snitch without interference 
 
 lynch got to his feet at last to loud cheers from the supporters mounted his firebolt and kicked back off into the air his revival seemed to give ireland new heart when mostafa blew his whistle again the chasers moved into action with a skill unrivaled by anything harry had seen so far 
 
 after fifteen more fast and furious minutes ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals they were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten and the game was starting to get dirtier 
 
 as mullet shot toward the goal posts yet again clutching the quaffle tightly under her arm the bulgarian keeper zograf flew out to meet her whatever happened was over so quickly harry catch it but a scream of rage from the irish crowd and long shrill whistle blast told him it had been a foul 
 
 and mostafa takes the bulgarian keeper to task for cobbing excessive use of elbows bagman informed the roaring spectators and yes a penalty to ireland 
 
 the leprechauns who had risen angrily into the air like a swarm of glittering hornets when mullet had been fouled now darted together to form the words ha ha ha 
 
 the veela on the other side of the field leapt to their feet tossed their hair angrily and started to dance again 
 
 as one the weasley boys and harry stuffed their fingers into their ears but hermione who bothered was soon tugging on arm he turned to look at her and she pulled his fingers impatiently out of his ears 
 
 look at the referee she said giggling 
 
 harry looked down at the field hassan mostafa had landed right in front of the dancing veela and was acting very oddly indeed he was flexing his muscles and smoothing his mustache excitedly 
 
 now we have that said ludo bagman though he sounded highly amused somebody slap the referee 
 
 a mediwizard came tearing across the field his fingers stuffed into his own ears and kicked mostafa hard in the shins mostafa seemed to come to himself harry watching through the omnioculars again saw that he looked exceptionally embarrassed and had started shouting at the veela who had stopped dancing and were looking mutinous 
 
 and unless much mistaken mostafa is actually attempting to send off the bulgarian team mascots said voice now something we seen beforeoh this could turn nasty 
 
 it did the bulgarian beaters volkov and vulchanov landed on either side of mostafa and began arguing furiously with him gesticulating toward the leprechauns who had now gleefully formed the words hee hee hee mostafa was not impressed by the bulgarians arguments however he was jabbing his finger into the air clearly telling them to get flying again and when they refused he gave two short blasts on his whistle 
 
 two penalties for ireland shouted bagman and the bulgarian crowd howled with anger and volkov and vulchanov had better get back on those broomsyesthere they goand troy takes the quaffle 
 
 play now reached a level of ferocity beyond anything they had yet seen the beaters on both sides were acting without mercy volkov and vulchanov in particular seemed not to care whether their clubs made contact with bludger or human as they swung them violently through the air dimitrov shot straight at moran who had the quaffle nearly knocking her off her broom 
 
 foul roared the irish supporters as one all standing up in a great wave of green 
 
 foul echoed ludo magically magnified voice dimitrov skins moran deliberately flying to collide there and got to be another penalty yes the whistle 
 
 the leprechauns had risen into the air again and this time they formed a giant hand which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field at this the veela lost control instead of dancing they launched themselves across the field and began throwing what seemed to be handfuls of fire at the leprechauns watching through his omnioculars harry saw that they look remotely beautiful now on the contrary their faces were elongating into sharp bird heads and long scaly wings were bursting from their shoulders 
 
 and that boys yelled mr weasley over the tumult of the crowd below is why you should never go for looks alone 
 
 ministry wizards were flooding onto the field to separate the veela and the leprechauns but with little success meanwhile the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above harry turned this way and that staring through his omnioculars as the quaffie changed hands with the speed of a bullet 
 
 levski dimitrov moran troy mullet ivanova moran again moran moran scores 
 
 but the cheers of the irish supporters were barely heard over the shrieks of the veela the blasts now issuing from the ministry members wands and the furious roars of the bulgarians the game recommenced immediately now levski had the quaffle now dimitrov 
 
 the irish beater quigley swung heavily at a passing bludger and hit it as hard as possible toward krum who did not duck quickly enough it hit him full in the face 
 
 there was a deafening groan from the crowd nose looked broken there was blood everywhere but hassan mostafa blow his whistle he had become distracted and harry blame him one of the veela had thrown a handful of fire and set his broom tail alight 
 
 harry wanted someone to realize that krum was injured even though he was supporting ireland krum was the most exciting player on the field ron obviously felt the same 
 
 ah come on he play like that look at him 
 
 look at lynch harry yelled 
 
 for the irish seeker had suddenly gone into a dive and harry was quite sure that this was no wronski feint this was the real thing 
 
 seen the snitch harry shouted seen it look at him go 
 
 half the crowd seemed to have realized what was happening the irish supporters rose in another great wave of green screaming their seeker onbut krum was on his tail how he could see where he was going harry had no idea there were flecks of blood flying through the air behind him but he was drawing level with lynch now as the pair of them hurtled toward the ground again 
 
 going to crash shrieked hermione 
 
 not roared ron 
 
 lynch is yelled harry 
 
 and he was right for the second time lynch hit the ground with tremendous force and was immediately stampeded by a horde of angry veela 
 
 the snitch the snitch bellowed charlie along the row 
 
 got it got it all over shouted harry 
 
 krum his red robes shining with blood from his nose was rising gently into the air his fist held high a glint of gold in his hand 
 
 the scoreboard was flashing bulgaria ireland across the crowd who seem to have realized what had happened then slowly as though a great jumbo jet were revving up the rumbling from the ireland supporters grew louder and louder and erupted into screams of delight 
 
 ireland wins bagman shouted who like the irish seemed to be taken aback by the sudden end of the match 
 
 krum gets the snitch but ireland wins good lord i think any of us were expecting that 
 
 what did he catch the snitch for ron bellowed even as he jumped up and down applauding with his hands over his head he ended it when ireland were a hundred and sixty points ahead the idiot 
 
 he knew they were never going to catch up harry shouted back over all the noise also applauding loudly the irish chasers were too goodhe wanted to end it on his terms all 
 
 he was very brave he hermione said leaning forward to watch krum land as a swarm of mediwizards blasted a path through the battling leprechauns and veela to get to him he looks a terrible mess 
 
 harry put his omnioculars to his eyes again it was hard to see what was happening below because leprechauns were zooming delightedly all over the field but he could just make out krum surrounded by mediwizards he looked surlier than ever and refused to let them mop him up his team members were around him shaking their heads and looking dejected a short way away the irish players were dancing gleefully in a shower of gold descending from their mascots flags were waving all over the stadium the irish national anthem blared from all sides the veela were shrinking back into their usual beautiful selves now though looking dispirited and forlorn 
 
 vell ve fought bravely said a gloomy voice behind harry he looked around it was the bulgarian minister of magic 
 
 you can speak english said fudge sounding outraged and been letting me mime everything all day 
 
 veil it vos very funny said the bulgarian minister shrugging 
 
 and as the irish team performs a lap of honor flanked by their mascots the quidditch world cup itself is brought into the top box roared bagman 
 
 eyes were suddenly dazzled by a blinding white light as the top box was magically illuminated so that everyone in the stands could see the inside squinting toward the entrance he saw two panting wizards carrying a vast golden cup into the box which they handed to cornelius fudge who was still looking very disgruntled that been using sign language all day for nothing 
 
 have a really loud hand for the gallant losers bulgaria bagman shouted 
 
 and up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated bulgarian players the crowd below was applauding appreciatively harry could see thousands and thousands of omniocular lenses flashing and winking in their direction 
 
 one by one the bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box and bagman called out the name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with fudge krum who was last in line looked a real mess two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face he was still holding the snitch harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground he was slightly and distinctly but when name was announced the whole stadium gave him a resounding earsplitting roar 
 
 and then came the irish team aidan lynch was being supported by moran and connolly the second crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused but he grinned happily as troy and quigley lifted the cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval hands were numb with clapping 
 
 at last when the irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms aidan lynch on the back of clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a bemused sort of way bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered quietus 
 
 be talking about this one for years he said hoarsely a really unexpected twist it have lasted yesyes i owe much 
 
 for fred and george had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front of ludo bagman with broad grins on their faces their hands outstretched 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight the hearingcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry gasped he could not help himself the large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar he had not only seen it before he had been here before this was the place he had visited inside pensieve the place where he had watched the lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in azkaban 
 
 the walls were made of dark stone dimly lit by torches empty benches rose on either side of him but ahead in the highest benches of all were many shadowy figures they had been talking in low voices but as the heavy door swung closed behind harry an ominous silence fell 
 
 a cold male voice rang across the courtroom 
 
 late 
 
 sorry said harry nervously ii know the time had been changed 
 
 that is not the fault said the voice an owl was sent to you this morning take your seat 
 
 harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the centre of the room the arms of which were covered in chains he had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them his footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor when he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked threateningly but did not bind him feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the bench above 
 
 there were about fifty of them all as far as he could see wearing robes with an elaborately worked silver w on the side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him some with very austere expressions others looks of frank curiosity 
 
 in the very middle of the front row sat cornelius fudge the minister for magic fudge was a portly man who often sported a bowler hat though today he had dispensed with it he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to harry a broad witch with very short grey hair sat on fudges left she wore a monocle and looked forbidding on fudges right was another witch but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow 
 
 very well said fudge the accused being presentfinallylet us begin are you ready he called down the row 
 
 yes sir said an eager voice harry knew brother percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench harry looked at percy expecting some sign of recognition from him but none came eyes behind his glasses were fixed on his parchment a quill poised in his hand 
 
 disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of august said fudge in a ringing voice and percy began taking notes at once into offences committed under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and the international statute of secrecy by harry james potter resident at number four privet drive little whinging surrey 
 
 interrogators cornelius oswald fudge minister for magic amelia susan bones head of the department of magical law enforcement dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister court scribe percy ignatius weasley 
 
 witness for the defence albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore said a quiet voice from behind harry who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck 
 
 dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long robes and a perfectly calm expression his long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight as he drew level with harry and looked up at fudge through the spectacles that rested halfway down his very crooked nose 
 
 the members of the wizengamot were muttering all eyes were now on dumbledore some looked annoyed others slightly frightened two elderly witches in the back row however raised their hands and waved in welcome 
 
 a powerful emotion had risen in chest at the sight of dumbledore a fortified hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him he wanted to catch eye but dumbledore was not looking his way he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered fudge 
 
 ah said fudge who looked thoroughly disconcerted dumbledore yes youergot ourer message that the time anderplace of the hearing had been changed then 
 
 i must have missed it said dumbledore cheerfully however due to a lucky mistake i arrived at the ministry three hours early so no harm done 
 
 yeswelli suppose need another chairiweasley could you 
 
 not to worry not to worry said dumbledore pleasantly he took out his wand gave it a little flick and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to harry dumbledore sat down put the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed fudge over them with an expression of polite interest the wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly only when fudge spoke again did they settle down 
 
 yes said fudge again shuffling his notes well then so the charges yes 
 
 he extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him took a deep breath and read out the charges against the accused are as follows that he did knowingly deliberately and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions having received a previous written warning from the ministry of magic on a similar charge produce a patronus charm in a area in the presence of a muggle on the second of august at minutes past nine which constitutes an offence under paragraph c of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and also under section of the international confederation of warlocks statute of secrecy 
 
 you are harry james potter of number four privet drive little whinging surrey fudge said glaring at harry over the top of his parchment 
 
 yes harry said 
 
 you received an official warning from the ministry for using illegal magic three years ago did you not 
 
 yes but 
 
 and yet you conjured a patronus on the night of the second of august said fudge 
 
 yes said harry but 
 
 knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen 
 
 yes but 
 
 knowing that you were in an area full of muggles 
 
 yes but 
 
 fully aware that you were in close proximity to a muggle at the time 
 
 yes said harry angrily but i only used it because we were 
 
 the witch with the monocle cut across him in a booming voice 
 
 you produced a patronus 
 
 yes said harry because 
 
 a corporeal patronus 
 
 awhat said harry 
 
 your patronus had a clearly defined form i mean to say it was more than vapour or smoke 
 
 yes said harry feeling both impatient and slightly desperate a stag always a stag 
 
 always boomed madam bones you have produced a patronus before now 
 
 yes said harry been doing it for over a year 
 
 and you are fifteen years old 
 
 yes and 
 
 you learned this at school 
 
 yes professor lupin taught me in my third year because of the 
 
 impressive said madam bones staring down at him a true patronus at his age very impressive indeed 
 
 some of the wizards and witches around her were muttering again a few nodded but others were frowning and shaking their heads 
 
 not a question of how impressive the magic was said fudge in a testy voice in fact the more impressive the worse it is i would have thought given that the boy did it in plain view of a muggle 
 
 those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement but it was the sight of sanctimonious little nod that goaded harry into speech 
 
 i did it because of the dementors he said loudly before anyone could interrupt him again 
 
 he had expected more muttering but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before 
 
 dementors said madam bones after a moment her thick eyebrows rising until her monocle looked in danger of falling out what do you mean boy 
 
 i mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin 
 
 ah said fudge again smirking unpleasantly as he looked around at the wizengamot as though inviting them to share the joke yes yes i thought be hearing something like this 
 
 dementors in little whinging madam bones said in a tone of great surprise i understand 
 
 you amelia said fudge still smirking let me explain been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story very nice indeed muggles see dementors can they boy highly convenient highly convenient so just your word and no witnesses 
 
 not lying said harry loudly over another outbreak of muttering from the court there were two of them coming from opposite ends of the alley everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it 
 
 enough enough said fudge with a very supercilious look on his face sorry to interrupt what sure would have been a very story 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat the wizengamot fell silent again 
 
 we do in fact have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway he said other than dudley dursley i mean 
 
 plump face seemed to slacken as though somebody had let air out of it he stared down at dumbledore for a moment or two then with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together said we got time to listen to more tarradiddles afraid dumbledore i want this dealt with quickly 
 
 i may be wrong said dumbledore pleasantly but i am sure that under the wizengamot charter of rights the accused has the right to present witnesses for his or her case that the policy of the department of magical law enforcement madam bones he continued addressing the witch in the monocle 
 
 true said madam bones perfectly true 
 
 oh very well very well snapped fudge where is this person 
 
 i brought her with me said dumbledore just outside the door should i 
 
 noweasley you go fudge barked at percy who got up at once ran down the stone steps from the balcony and hurried past dumbledore and harry without glancing at them 
 
 a moment later percy returned followed by mrs figg she looked scared and more batty than ever harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slippers 
 
 dumbledore stood up and gave mrs figg his chair conjuring a second one for himself 
 
 full name said fudge loudly when mrs figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat 
 
 arabella doreen figg said mrs figg in her quavery voice 
 
 and who exactly are you said fudge in a bored and lofty voice 
 
 a resident of little whinging close to where harry potter lives said mrs figg 
 
 we have no record of any witch or wizard living in little whinging other than harry potter said madam bones at once that situation has always been closely monitored given given past events 
 
 a squib said mrs figg so you have me registered would you 
 
 a squib eh said fudge eyeing her closely be checking that leave details of your parentage with my assistant weasley incidentally can squibs see dementors he added looking left and right along the bench 
 
 yes we can said mrs figg indignantly 
 
 fudge looked back down at her his eyebrows raised very well he said aloofly what is your story 
 
 i had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of wisteria walk around about nine on the evening of the second of august gabbled mrs figg at once as though she had learned what she was saying by heart when i heard a disturbance down the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk on approaching the mouth of the alleyway i saw dementors running 
 
 running said madam bones sharply dementors run they glide 
 
 what i meant to say said mrs figg quickly patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks gliding along the alley towards what looked like two boys 
 
 what did they look like said madam bones narrowing her eyes so that the edge of the monocle disappeared into her flesh 
 
 well one was very large and the other one rather skinny 
 
 no no said madam bones impatiently the dementors describe them 
 
 oh said mrs figg the pink flush creeping up her neck now they were big big and wearing cloaks 
 
 harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach whatever mrs figg might say it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like the eerie way they moved hovering inches over the ground or the rotting smell of them or that terrible rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air 
 
 in the second row a dumpy wizard with a large black moustache leaned close to whisper in the ear of his neighbour a witch she smirked and nodded 
 
 big and wearing cloaks repeated madam bones coolly while fudge snorted derisively i see anything else 
 
 yes said mrs figg i felt them everything went cold and this was a very warm night mark you and i felt as though all happiness had gone from the world and i remembered dreadful things 
 
 her voice shook and died 
 
 madam eyes widened slightly harry could see red marks under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it 
 
 what did the dementors do she asked and harry felt a rush of hope 
 
 they went for the boys said mrs figg her voice stronger and more confident now the pink flush ebbing away from her face one of them had fallen the other was backing away trying to repel the dementor that was harry he tried twice and produced only silver vapour on the third attempt he produced a patronus which charged down the first dementor and then with his encouragement chased the second one away from his cousin and that that is what happened mrs figg finished somewhat lamely 
 
 madam bones looked down at mrs figg in silence fudge was not looking at her at all but fidgeting with his papers finally he raised his eyes and said rather aggressively what you saw is it 
 
 that is what happened mrs figg repeated 
 
 very well said fudge you may go 
 
 mrs figg cast a frightened look from fudge to dumbledore then got up and shuffled off towards the door harry heard it thud shut behind her 
 
 not a very convincing witness said fudge loftily 
 
 oh i know said madam bones in her booming voice she certainly described the effects of a dementor attack very accurately and i imagine why she would say they were there if they 
 
 but dementors wandering into a muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard snorted fudge the odds on that must be very very long even bagman have bet 
 
 oh i think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence said dumbledore lightly 
 
 the witch sitting to the right of fudge with her face in shadow moved slightly but everyone else was quite still and silent 
 
 and what is that supposed to mean fudge asked icily 
 
 it means that i think they were ordered there said dumbledore 
 
 i think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through little whinging barked fudge 
 
 not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the ministry of magic these days said dumbledore calmly i have already given you my views on this matter cornelius 
 
 yes you have said fudge forcefully and i have no reason to believe that your views are anything other than bilge dumbledore the dementors remain in place in azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to 
 
 then said dumbledore quietly but clearly we must ask ourselves why somebody within the ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of august 
 
 in the complete silence that greeted these words the witch to the right of fudge leaned forwards so that harry saw her for the first time 
 
 he thought she looked just like a large pale toad she was rather squat with a broad flabby face as little neck as uncle vernon and a very wide slack mouth her eyes were large round and slightly bulging even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she was about to catch on a long sticky tongue 
 
 the chair recognises dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister said fudge 
 
 the witch spoke in a fluttery girlish voice that took harry aback he had been expecting a croak 
 
 sure i must have misunderstood you professor dumbledore she said with a simper that left her big round eyes as cold as ever so silly of me but it sounded for a teensy moment as though you were suggesting that the ministry of magic had ordered an attack on this boy 
 
 she gave a silvery laugh that made the hairs on the back of neck stand up a few other members of the wizengamot laughed with her it could not have been plainer that not one of them was really amused 
 
 if it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the ministry of magic and it is also true that two dementors attacked harry and his cousin a week ago then it follows logically that somebody at the ministry might have ordered the attacks said dumbledore politely of course these particular dementors may have been outside ministry control 
 
 there are no dementors outside ministry control snapped fudge who had turned brick red 
 
 dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow 
 
 then undoubtedly the ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from azkaban and why they attacked without authorisation 
 
 it is not for you to decide what the ministry of magic does or does not do dumbledore snapped fudge now a shade of magenta of which uncle vernon would have been proud 
 
 of course it said dumbledore mildly i was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated 
 
 he glanced at madam bones who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him frowning slightly 
 
 i would remind everybody that the behaviour of these dementors if indeed they are not figments of this imagination is not the subject of this hearing said fudge we are here to examine harry offences under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery 
 
 of course we are said dumbledore but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant clause seven of the decree states that magic may be used before muggles in exceptional circumstances and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself or any witches wizards or muggles present at the time of the 
 
 we are familiar with clause seven thank you very much snarled fudge 
 
 of course you are said dumbledore courteously then we are in agreement that use of the patronus charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describes 
 
 if there were dementors which i doubt 
 
 you have heard it from an eyewitness dumbledore interrupted 
 
 if you still doubt her truthfulness call her back question her again i am sure she would not object 
 
 ithatnot blustered fudge fiddling with the papers before him want this over with today dumbledore 
 
 but naturally you would not care how many times you heard from a witness if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice said dumbledore 
 
 serious miscarriage my hat said fudge at the top of his voice have you ever bothered to tot up the number of stories this boy has come out with dumbledore while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school i suppose forgotten the hover charm he used three years ago 
 
 that me it was a said harry 
 
 you see roared fudge gesturing flamboyantly in direction a in a muggle house i ask you 
 
 the in question is currently in the employ of hogwarts school said dumbledore i can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish 
 
 inoti got time to listen to anyway not the onlyhe blew up his aunt for sake fudge shouted banging his fist on the bench and upsetting a bottle of ink 
 
 and you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion accepting i presume that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions said dumbledore calmly as fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes 
 
 and i even started on what he gets up to at school 
 
 but as the ministry has no authority to punish hogwarts students for misdemeanours at school behaviour there is not relevant to this hearing said dumbledore as politely as ever but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his words 
 
 oho said fudge not our business what he does at school eh you think so 
 
 the ministry does not have the power to expel hogwarts students cornelius as i reminded you on the night of the second of august said dumbledore nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven again as i reminded you on the night of the second of august in your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld you appear inadvertently i am sure to have overlooked a few laws yourself 
 
 laws can be changed said fudge savagely 
 
 of course they can said dumbledore inclining his head and you certainly seem to be making many changes cornelius why in the few short weeks since i was asked to leave the wizengamot it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic 
 
 a few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce the toadlike witch on his right however merely gazed at dumbledore her face quite expressionless 
 
 as far as i am aware dumbledore continued there is no law yet in place that says this job is to punish harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed he has been charged with a specific offence and he has presented his defence all he and i can do now is to await your verdict 
 
 dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more fudge glared at him evidently incensed harry glanced sideways at dumbledore seeking reassurance he was not at all sure that dumbledore was right in telling the wizengamot in effect that it was about time they made a decision again however dumbledore seemed oblivious to attempt to catch his eye he continued to look up at the benches where the entire wizengamot had fallen into urgent whispered conversations 
 
 harry looked at his feet his heart which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size was thumping loudly under his ribs he had expected the hearing to last longer than this he was not at all sure that he had made a good impression he had not really said very much he ought to have explained more fully about the dementors about how he had fallen over about how both he and dudley had nearly been kissed 
 
 twice he looked up at fudge and opened his mouth to speak but his swollen heart was now constricting his air passages and both times he merely took a deep breath and looked back down at his shoes 
 
 then the whispering stopped harry wanted to look up at the judges but found that it was really much much easier to keep examining his laces 
 
 those in favour of clearing the witness of all charges said madam boness booming voice 
 
 head jerked upwards there were hands in the air many of them more than half breathing very fast he tried to count but before he could finish madam bones had said and those in favour of conviction 
 
 fudge raised his hand so did half a dozen others including the witch on his right and the wizard and the witch in the second row 
 
 fudge glanced around at them all looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat then lowered his own hand he took two deep breaths and said in a voice distorted by suppressed rage very well very well cleared of all charges 
 
 excellent said dumbledore briskly springing to his feel pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchairs to vanish well i must be getting along good day to you all 
 
 and without looking once at harry he swept from the dungeon 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight snape victoriouscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry could not move a muscle he lay there beneath the invisibility cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow hot and wet over his face listening to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond his immediate thought was that someone would surely check the compartments before the train departed again but at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment he would be neither seen nor heard his best hope was that somebody else would walk in and step on him 
 
 harry had never hated malfoy more than as he lay there like an absurd turtle on its back blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth what a stupid situation to have landed himself in and now the last few footsteps were dying away everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside he could hear the scraping of trunks and loud babble of talk 
 
 ron and hermione would think that he had left the train without them once they arrived at hogwarts and took their places in the great hall looked up and down the gryffindor table a few times and finally realized that he was not there he no doubt would be halfway back to london 
 
 he tried to make a sound even a grunt but it was impossible then he remembered that some wizards like dumbledore could perform spells without speaking so he tried to summon his wand which had fallen out of his hand by saying the words accio wand over and over again in his head but nothing happened 
 
 he thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake and the hoot of an owl but no hint of a search being made or even he despised himself slightly for hoping it panicked voices wondering where harry potter had gone a feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the convoy of carriages trundling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage malfoy was riding in where he could be recounting his attack on harry to crabbe goyle zabini and pansy parkinson 
 
 the train lurched causing harry to roll over onto his side now he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceiling the floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life the express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it 
 
 then he felt his invisibility cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said wotcher harry 
 
 there was a flash of red light and body unfroze he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position hastily wipe the blood off his bruised race with the back of his hand and raise his head to look up at tonks who was holding the invisibility cloak she had just pulled away 
 
 better get out of here quickly she said as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station come on jump 
 
 harry hurried after her into the corridor she pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum he followed her staggered a little on landing then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed round the corner and disappear from view 
 
 the cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose tonks was looking at him he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position silently she handed him back the invisibility cloak 
 
 who did it 
 
 draco malfoy said harry bitterly thanks for well 
 
 no problem said tonks without smiling from what harry could see in the darkness she was as and as she had been when he had met her at the burrow i can fix your nose if you stand still 
 
 harry did not think much of this idea he had been intending to visit madam pomfrey the matron in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to healing spells but it seemed rude to say this so he stayed and closed his eyes 
 
 episkey said tonks 
 
 nose felt very hot and then very cold he raised a hand and felt gingerly it seemed to be mended 
 
 thanks a lot 
 
 better put that cloak back on and we can walk up to the school said tonks still unsmiling as harry swung the cloak back over himself she waved her wand an immense silvery creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness 
 
 was that a patronus asked harry who had seen dumbledore send messages like this 
 
 yes sending word to the castle that got you or worry come on better not dawdle 
 
 they set off toward the lane that led to the school 
 
 how did you find me 
 
 i noticed you left the train and i knew you had that cloak i thought you might be hiding for some reason when i saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment i thought check 
 
 but what are you doing here anyway harry asked 
 
 stationed in hogsmeade now to give the school extra protection said tonks 
 
 is it just you stationed up here or 
 
 no proudfoot savage and dawlish are here too 
 
 dawlish that auror dumbledore attacked last year 
 
 right 
 
 they trudged up the dark deserted lane following the freshly made carriage tracks harry looked sideways at tonks under his cloak last year she had been inquisitive to the point of being a little annoying at times she had laughed easily she had made jokes now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful was this all the effect of what had happened at the ministry he reflected uncomfortably that hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about sirius to her that it been her fault at all but he bring himself to do it he was far from blaming her for death it was no more her fault than anyone and much less than his but he did not like talking about sirius if he could avoid it and so they tramped on through the cold night in silence long cloak whispering on the ground behind them 
 
 having always traveled there by carriage harry had never before appreciated just how far hogwarts was from hogsmeade station with great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates each topped with a winged boar he was cold he was hungry and he was quite keen to leave this new gloomy tonks behind but when he put out a hand to push open the gates he found them chained shut 
 
 alohomora he said confidently pointing his wand at the padlock but nothing happened 
 
 that work on these said tonks dumbledore bewitched them himself 
 
 harry looked around 
 
 i could climb a wall he suggested 
 
 no you said tonks flatly jinxes on all of them been tightened a hundredfold this summer 
 
 well then said harry starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness i suppose just have to sleep out here and wait for morning 
 
 coming down for you said tonks look 
 
 a lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews it was not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them and had pulled off his invisibility cloak so that he could be seen that he recognized with a rush of pure loathing the uplit hooked nose and long black greasy hair of severus snape 
 
 well well well sneered snape taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open nice of you to turn up potter although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would detract from your appearance 
 
 i change i have my harry began but snape cut across him 
 
 there is no need to wait nymphadora potter is quiteahsafe in my hands 
 
 i meant hagrid to get the message said tonks frowning 
 
 hagrid was late for the feast just like potter here so i took it instead and incidentally said snape standing back to allow harry to pass him i was interested to see your new patronus 
 
 he shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again so that they slithered clinking back into place 
 
 i think you were better off with the old one said snape the malice in his voice unmistakable the new one looks weak 
 
 as snape swung the lantern about harry saw fleetingly a look of shock and anger on face then she was covered in darkness once more 
 
 goodnight harry called to her over his shoulder as he began the walk up to the school with snape thanks for everything 
 
 see you harry 
 
 snape did not speak for a minute or so harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that snape could not feel them burning him he had loathed snape from their first encounter but snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of forgiveness by his attitude toward sirius whatever dumbledore said harry had had time to think over the summer and had concluded that snide remarks to sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the order of the phoenix were off fighting voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in sirius rushing off to the ministry the night that he had died harry clung to this notion because it enabled him to blame snape which felt satisfying and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that sirius was dead it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness 
 
 fifty points from gryffindor for lateness i think said snape and let me see another twenty for your muggle attire you know i believe any house has ever been in negative figures this early in the termwe even started pudding you might have set a record potter 
 
 the fury and hatred bubbling inside harry seemed to blaze but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to london than tell snape why he was late 
 
 i suppose you wanted to make an entrance did you snape continued and with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the great hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect 
 
 still harry remained silent though he thought his chest might explode he knew that snape had come to fetch him for this for the few minutes when he could needle and torment harry without anyone else listening 
 
 they reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the great hall harry wondered whether he could slip his invisibility cloak back on thereby gaining his seat at the long gryffindor table which inconveniently was the farthest from the entrance hall without being noticed 
 
 as though he had read mind however snape said no cloak you can walk in so that everyone sees you which is what you wanted sure 
 
 harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors anything to get away from snape the great hall with its four long house tables and its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual with floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow it was all a shimmering blur to harry however who walked so fast that he was passing the hufflepuff table before people really started to stare and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him he had spotted ron and hermione sped along the benches toward them and forced his way in between them 
 
 youblimey you done to your face said ron goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity 
 
 why wrong with it said harry grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection 
 
 covered in blood said hermione come here 
 
 she raised her wand said tergeo and siphoned off the dried blood 
 
 thanks said harry feeling his now clean face my nose looking 
 
 normal said hermoine anxiously why it harry what happened been terrified 
 
 tell you later said harry curtly he was very conscious that ginny neville dean and seamus were listening in even nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop 
 
 but said hermione 
 
 not now hermione said harry in a darkly significant voice he hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic preferably involving a couple of death eaters and a dementor of course malfoy would spread the story as wide as he could but there was always a chance it reach too many gryffindor ears 
 
 he reached across ron for a couple of chicken legs and a handful of chips but before he could take them they vanished to be replaced with puddings 
 
 you missed the sorting anyway said hermione as ron dived for a large chocolate gateau 
 
 hat say anything interesting asked harry taking a piece of treacle tart 
 
 more of the same really advising us all to unite in the face enemies you know 
 
 dumbledore mentioned voldemort at all 
 
 not yet but he always saves his proper speech for after the the feast he it be long now 
 
 snape said hagrid was late for the feast 
 
 seen snape how come said ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau 
 
 bumped into him said harry evasively 
 
 hagrid was only a few minutes late said hermione look waving at you harry 
 
 harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at hagrid who was indeed waving at him hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house the top of whose head came up to somewhere between elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting harry was surprised to see the divination teacher professor trelawney sitting on other side she rarely left her tower room and he had never seen her at the feast before she looked as odd as ever glittering with beads and trailing shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles having always considered her a bit of a fraud harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused lord voldemort to kill parents and attack harry himself the knowledge made him even less eager to find himself in her company thankfully this year he would be dropping divination her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction he hastily looked away toward the slytherin table draco malfoy was miming the shatterering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart his insides burning again what he would give to fight malfoy 
 
 so what did professor slughorn want hermione asked 
 
 to know what really happened at the ministry said harry 
 
 him and everyone else here sniffed hermione people were interrogating us about it on the train they ron 
 
 yeah said ron all wanting to know if you really are the chosen one 
 
 there has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts interrupted nearly headless nick inclining his barely connected head toward harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff i am considered something of a potter authority it is widely known that we are friendly i have assured the spirit community that i will not pester you for information however harry potter knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence i told them i would rather die than betray his trust 
 
 not saying much seeing as already dead ron observed 
 
 once again you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe said nearly headless nick in affronted tones and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the gryffindor table just as dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table the talk and laughter echoing around the hall died away almost instantly 
 
 the very best of evenings to you he said smiling broadly his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room 
 
 what happened to his hand gasped hermione 
 
 she was not the only one who had noticed right hand was as blackened and as it had been on the night he had come to fetch harry from the dursleys whispers swept the room dumbledore interpreting them correctly merely smiled and shook his sleeve over his injury 
 
 nothing to worry about he said airily now to our new students welcome to our old students welcome back another year full of magical education awaits you 
 
 his hand was like that when i saw him over the summer harry whispered to hermione i thought have cured it by now though or madam pomfrey done 
 
 it looks as if died said hermione with a nauseated expression but there are some injuries you cure old curses and there are poisons without antidotes 
 
 and mr filch our caretaker has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called weasleys wizard wheezes 
 
 those wishing to play for their house quidditch teams should give their names to their heads of house as usual we are also looking for new quidditch commentators who should do likewise 
 
 we are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year professor slughorn slughorn stood up his bald head gleaming in the candlelight his big waistcoated belly casting the table into shadow is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of potions master 
 
 potions 
 
 potions 
 
 the word echoed all over the hall as people wondered whether they had heard right 
 
 potions said ron and hermione together turning to stare harry but you said 
 
 professor snape meanwhile said dumbledore raising voice so that it carried over all the muttering will be taking the position of defense against the dark arts teacher 
 
 no said harry so loudly that many heads turned in his direction he did not care he was staring up at the staff table incensed how could snape be given the defense against the dark arts job after all this time it been widely known for years that dumbledore did not trust him to do it 
 
 but harry you said that slughorn was going to be teaching defense against the dark arts said hermione 
 
 i thought he was said harry racking his brains to remember when dumbledore had told him this but now that he came to think of it he was unable to recall dumbledore ever telling him what slughorn would be teaching 
 
 snape who was sitting on right did not stand up his mention of his name he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the slytherin table yet harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much 
 
 well one good thing he said savagely be gone by the end of the year 
 
 what do you mean asked ron 
 
 that jinxed no ones lasted more than a year quirrell actually died doing it personally going to keep my fingers crossed for another death 
 
 harry said hermione shocked and reproachful 
 
 he might just go back to teaching potions at the end of the year said ron reasonably that slughorn bloke might not want to stay moody 
 
 dumbledore cleared his throat harry ron and hermione were not the only ones who had been talking the whole hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that snape had finally achieved his desire seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointments but waited a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing 
 
 now as everybody in this hall knows lord voldemort and his followers are once more at large and gaining in strength 
 
 the silence seemed to tauten and strain as dumbledore spoke harry glanced at malfoy malfoy was not looking at dumbledore but making his fork hover in midair with his wand as though he found the words unworthy of his attention 
 
 i cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is and how much care each of us at hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe the magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer we are protected in new and more powerful ways but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff i urge you therefore to abide by any security restrictions that you teachers might impose upon you however irksome you might find themin particular the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours i implore you should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle to report it to a member of staff immediately i trust you to conduct yourselves always with the utmost regard for your own and others safety 
 
 blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more 
 
 but now your beds await as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish and i know that your top priority is to be for your lessons tomorrow let us therefore say good night pip pip 
 
 with the usual deafening scraping noise the benches moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the great hall toward their dormitories harry who was in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd nor to get near enough to malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the lagged behind pretending to retie the lace on his trainer allowing most of gryffindors to draw ahead of him hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her duty of shepherding the first years but ron remained with harry 
 
 what really happened to your nose he asked once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the hall and out of earshot of anyone else 
 
 harry told him it was a mark of the strength of their friendship that ron did not laugh 
 
 i saw malfoy miming something to do with a nose he said darkly 
 
 yeah well never mind that said harry bitterly listen to what he was saying before he found out i was there 
 
 harry had expected ron to be stunned by boasts with what harry considered pure pigheadedness however ron was unimpressed 
 
 come on harry he was just showing off for parkinson what kind of mission would have given him 
 
 how know voldemort need someone at hogwarts it be the first 
 
 i wish stop sayin tha name harry said a reproachful voice behind them harry looked over his shoulder to see hagtid shaking his head 
 
 dumbledore uses that name said harry stubbornly 
 
 yeah well dumbledore innit said hagrid mysteriously so how come yeh were late harry i was worried 
 
 got held up on the train said harry why were you late 
 
 i was with grawp said hagrid happily los track o the time got a new home up in the mountains now dumbledore fixed itnice big cave much happier than he was in the forest we were havin a good chat 
 
 really said harry taking care not to catch eye the last time he had met a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots his vocabulary had comprised five words two of which he was unable to pronounce properly 
 
 oh yeah really come on said hagrid proudly be amazed thinkin o trainin him up as me assistant 
 
 ron snorted loudly but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze they were now standing beside the oak front doors 
 
 anyway see yeh tomorrow firs straight after lunch come early an yeh can say hello ter buck i mean witherwings 
 
 raising an arm in cheery farewell he headed out of the doors into the darkness 
 
 harry and ron looked at each other harry could tell that ron was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself 
 
 not taking care of magical creatures are you 
 
 ron shook his head and not either are you 
 
 harry shook his head too 
 
 and hermione said ron not is she 
 
 harry shook his head again exactly what hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite students had given up his subject he did not like to think 
 
 rowling

 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter eight the weddingcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 three oclock on the following afternoon found harry ron fred and george standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests harry had taken a large dose of polyjuice potion and was now the double of a redheaded muggle boy from the local village ottery st catchpole from whom fred had stolen hairs using a summoning charm the plan was to introduce harry as cousin barny and trust to the great number of weasley relatives to camouflage him 
 
 all four of them were clutching seating plans so that they could help show people to the right seats a host of waiters had arrived an hour earlier along with a golden jacketed band and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot behind harry the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet the supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers fred and george had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where bill and fleur would shortly become husband and wife outside butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow harry was rather uncomfortable the muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summers day 
 
 when i get married said fred tugging at the collar of his own robes i wont be bothering with any of this nonsense you can all wear what you like and ill put a full body bird curse on mum until its all over 
 
 she wasnt too bad this morning considering said george cried a bit about percy not being here but who wants him oh blimey brace yourselves here they come look 
 
 brightly colored figures were appearing one by one out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard within minutes a procession had formed which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches hats while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards cravats a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent 
 
 excellent i think i see a few veela cousins said george craning his neck for a better look theyll need help understanding our english customs ill look after them 
 
 not so fast your holeyness said fred and darting past the gaggle of witches heading for the procession he said here c permetiez moi to assister vous to a pair of pretty french girls who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside george was left to deal with the witches and ron took charge of mr weasleys old perkins while a rather deaf old couple fell to harrys lot 
 
 wotcher said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found tonks and lupin at the front of the queue she had turned blonde for the occasion arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair sorry about last night she added in a whisper as harry led them up the aisle the ministrys being very at the museum and we thought our presence might not do you any favors 
 
 its fine i understand said harry speaking more to lupin than tonks lupin gave him a swift smile but as they turned away harry saw lupins face fall again into lines of misery he did not understand it but there was no time to dwell on the matter hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption having misunderstood freds directions as he had sat himself not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row but on five sets that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks 
 
 while mr weasley repaired the damage and hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen harry hurried back to the entrance to find ron with a most wizard slightly with white hair the texture of candyfloss he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an shade of yellow an odd symbol rather like a triangular eye glistened from a golden chain around his neck 
 
 xenophilius lovegood he said extending a hand to harry my daughter and i live just over the hill so kind of the good weasleys to invite us but i think you know my luna he added to ron 
 
 yes said ron isnt she with you 
 
 she lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes such a glorious infestation how few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes c or to give them their correct name the gernumbli gardensi 
 
 ours do know a lot of excellent swear words said ron but i think fred and george taught them those 
 
 he led a party of warlocks into the marquee as luna rushed up 
 
 hello harry she said 
 
 er c my names barry said harry flummoxed 
 
 oh have you changed that too she asked brightly 
 
 how did you know 
 
 oh just your expression she said 
 
 like her father luna was wearing bright yellow robes which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair once you get over the brightness of it all the general effect was quite pleasant at least there were no radishes dangling from her ears 
 
 xenophilius who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance had missed the exchange between luna and harry biding the wizard farewell he turned to his daughter who held up her finger and said daddy look c one of the gnomes actually bit me 
 
 how wonderful gnome saliva is enormously beneficial said mr lovegood seizing lunas outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks luna my love if you should feel any burgeoning talent today c perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims in mermish c do not repress it you may have been gifted by the gernumblies 
 
 ron passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort 
 
 ron can laugh said luna serenely as harry led her and xenophilius toward their seats but my father has done a lot of research on gernumbli magic 
 
 really said harry who had long since decided not to challenge luna or her fathers peculiar views are you sure you dont want to put anything on that bite though 
 
 oh its fine said luna sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking harry up and down you look smart i told daddy most people would probably wear dress robes but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding for luck you know 
 
 as she drifted off after her father ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm her beaky nose eyes and leathery pink hat gave her the look of a flamingo 
 
 and your hairs much too long ronald for a moment i thought you were ginevra merlins beard what is xenophilius lovegood wearing he looks like an omelet and who are you she barked at harry 
 
 oh yeah auntie muriel this is our cousin barny 
 
 another weasley you breed like gnomes isnt harry potter here i was hoping to meet him i thought he was a friend of yours ronald or have you merely been boasting 
 
 no c he couldnt come c 
 
 hmm made an excuse did he not as gormless as he looks in press photographs then ive just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara she shouted at harry you know and been in my family for centuries shes a girl but still c french well well find me a good seat ronald i am a hundred and seven and i ought not to be on my feet too long 
 
 ron gave harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time when next they met at the entrance harry had shown a dozen more people to their places the marquee was nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue outside 
 
 nightmare muriel is said ron mopping his forehead on his sleeve she used to come for christmas every year then thank god she took offense because fred and george set off a dungbomb under her chair at diner dad always says shell have written them out of her will c like they care theyre going to end up richer than anyone in the family rate theyre going wow he added blinking rather rapidly as hermione came hurrying toward them you look great 
 
 always the tone of surprise said hermione though she smiled she was wearing a floaty dress with matching high heels her hair was sleek and shiny your muriel doesnt agree i just met her upstairs while she was giving fleur the tiara she said oh dear is this the and then bad posture and skinny ankles 
 
 dont take it personally shes rude to everyone said ron 
 
 talking about muriel inquired george reemerging from the marquee with fred yeah shes just told me my ears are lopsided old bat i wish old uncle bilius was still with us though he was a right laugh at weddings 
 
 wasnt he the one who saw a grim and died hours later asked hermione 
 
 well yeah he went a bit odd toward the end conceded george 
 
 but before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party said fred he used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky then run onto the dance floor hoist up his robes and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his c 
 
 yes he sounds a real charmer said hermione while harry roared with laughter 
 
 never married for some reason said ron 
 
 you amaze me said hermione 
 
 they were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer a young man with a large curved nose and thick black eyebrows until he held out his invitation to ron and said with his eyes on hermione you look vunderful 
 
 viktor she shrieked and dropped her small beaded bag which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size as she scrambled blushing to pick it up she said i didnt know you were c goodness c its lovely to see c how are you 
 
 rons ears had turned bright red again after glancing at krums invitation as if he did not believe a word of it he said much too loudly how come youre here 
 
 fleur invited me said krum eyebrows raised 
 
 harry who had no grudge against krum shook hands then feeling that it would be prudent to remove krum from rons vicinity offered to show him his seat 
 
 your friend is not pleased to see me said krum as they entered the now packed marquee or is he a relative he added with a glance at harrys red curly hair 
 
 cousin harry muttered but krum was not really listening his appearance was causing a stir particularly amongst the veela cousins he was after all a famous quidditch player while people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him ron hermione fred and george came hurrying down the aisle 
 
 time to sit down fred told harry or were going to get run over by the bride 
 
 harry ron and hermione took their seats in the second row behind fred and george hermione looked rather pink and rons ears were still scarlet after a few moments he muttered to harry did you see hes grown a stupid little beard 
 
 harry gave a noncommittal grunt 
 
 a sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter mr and mrs weasley strolled up the aisle smiling and waving at relatives mrs weasley was wearing a set of amethyst colored robes with a matching hat 
 
 a moment later bill and charlie stood up at the front of the marquee both wearing dress robes with larger white roses in their buttonholes fred and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons 
 
 ooooh said hermione swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance 
 
 a great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as monsieur delacour and fleur came walking up the aisle fleur gliding monsieur delacour bouncing and beaming fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong silvery glow while her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison today it beautified everybody it fell upon ginny and gabrielle both wearing golden dresses looked even prettier than usual and once fleur had reached for him bill did not look as though he had ever met fenrit greyback 
 
 ladies and gentlemen said a slightly singsong voice and with a slight shock harry saw the same small wizard who had presided at dumbledores funeral now standing in front of bill and fleur we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls 
 
 yes my tiara set off the whole thing nicely said auntie muriel in a rather carrying whisper but i must say ginevras dress is far too low cut 
 
 ginny glanced around grinning winked at harry then quickly faced the front again harrys mind wandered a long way from the marquee back to the afternoons spent alone with ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds they seemed so long ago they had always seemed too good to be true as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal persons life a person without a scar on his forehead 
 
 do you william arthur take fleur isabelle 
 
 in the front row mrs weasley and madame delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that hagrid had taken out one of his own handkerchiefs hermione turned around and beamed at harry her eyes too were full of tears 
 
 then i declare you bonded for life 
 
 the wizard waved his hand high over the heads of bill and fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them spiraling around their now entwined figures as fred and george led a round of applause the golden balloons overhead burst birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them adding their songs and chimes to the din 
 
 ladies and gentlemen called the wizard if you would please stand up 
 
 they all did so auntie muriel grumbling audibly he waved his wand again the scars on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside next a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small tables which all floated gracefully back to earth round it and the hand trooped toward a podium 
 
 smooth said ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides some hearing silver trays of pumpkin juice butterbeer and firewhisky others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches 
 
 we should go and congratulate them said hermione standing on tiptoe to see the place where bill and fleur had vanished amid a crowd of 
 
 well have time later shrugged ron snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to harry hermione cop hold lets grab a table not there nowhere near muriel c 
 
 ron led the way across the empty dance floor glancing left and right as he went harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for krum by the time they had reached the other side of the marquee most of the tables were occupied the emptiest was the one where luna sat alone 
 
 all right if we join you asked ron 
 
 oh yes she said happily daddys just gone to give bill and fleur our present 
 
 what is it a lifetimes supply of gurdyroots asked ron 
 
 hermione aimed a kick at him under the table but caught harry instead eyes watering in pain harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments 
 
 the band had begun to play bill and fleur took to the dance floor first to great applause after a while mr weasley led madame delacour onto the floor followed by mr weasley and fleurs father 
 
 i like this song said luna swaying in time to the waltzlike tune and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor where she revolved on the spot quite alone eyes closed and waving her arms 
 
 shes great isnt she said ron admiringly always good value 
 
 but the smile vanished from his face at once viktor krum had dropped into lunas vacant seat hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time krum had not come to compliment her with a scowl on his face he said who is that man in the yellow 
 
 thats xenophilius lovegood hes the father of a friend of ours said ron his pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at xenophilius despite the clear provocation come and dance he added abruptly to hermione 
 
 she looked taken aback but pleased too and got up they vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor 
 
 ah they are together now asked krum momentarily distracted 
 
 er c sort of said harry 
 
 who are you krum asked 
 
 barny weasley 
 
 they shook hands 
 
 you barny c you know this man lovegood well 
 
 no i only met him today why 
 
 krum glowered over the top of his drink watching xenophilius who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor 
 
 because said krum if he vus not a guest of fleurs i vould dud him here and now for veering that filthy sign upon his chest 
 
 sign said harry looking over at xenophilius too the strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest why whats wrong with it 
 
 grindelvald that is grindelvalds sign 
 
 grindelwald the dark wizard dumbledore defeated 
 
 exactly 
 
 krums jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing then he said grindelvald killed many people my grandfather for instance of course he vos never powerful in this country they said he feared dumbledore c and rightly seeing how he vos finished but this c he pointed a finger at xenophilius c this is his symbol i recognized it at vunce grindelvald carved it into a vall at durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to shock make themselves impressive c until those of us who had lost family members to grindelvald taught them better 
 
 krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at xenophilius harry felt perplexed it seemed incredibly unlikely that lunas father was a supporter of the dark arts and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular finlike shape 
 
 are you c er c quite sure its grindelwalds 
 
 i am not mistaken said krum coldly i walked past that sign for several years i know it vell 
 
 well theres a chance said harry that xenophilius doesnt actually know what the symbol means the lovegoods are quite unusual he could have easily picked it up somewhere and think its a cross section of the head of a snorkack or something 
 
 the cross section of a vot 
 
 well i dont know what they are but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them 
 
 harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining luna and her father 
 
 thats her he said pointing at luna who was still dancing alone waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges 
 
 vy is she doing that asked krum 
 
 probably trying to get rid of a wrackspurt said harry who recognized the symptoms 
 
 krum did not seem to know whether or not harry was making fun of him he drew his hand from inside his robe and tapped it menacingly on his thighs sparks flew out of the end 
 
 gregorovitch said harry loudly and krum started but harry was too excited to care the memory had come back to him at the sight of krums wand ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the triwizard tournament 
 
 vot about him asked krum suspiciously 
 
 hes a wandmaker 
 
 i know that said krum 
 
 he made your wand thats why i thought c quidditch c 
 
 krum was looking more and more suspicious 
 
 how do you know gregorovitch made my wand 
 
 ii read it somewhere i think said harry in a c a fan magazine he improvised wildly and krum looked mollified 
 
 i had not realized i ever discussed my vand with fans he said 
 
 so er where is gregorowitch these days 
 
 krum looked puzzled 
 
 he retired several years ago i was one of the last to purchase a gregorovitch vand they are the best calthough i know of course that your britons set much store by ollivander 
 
 harry did not answer he pretended to watch the dancers like krum but he was thinking hard so voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and harry did not have to search far for a reason it was surely because of what harry wand had done on the night that voldemort pursued him across the skies the holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand some thing that ollivander had not anticipated or understood would gregorowitch know better was he truly more skilled than ollivander did he know secrets of wands that ollivander did not 
 
 this girl is very krum said recalling harry to his surroundings krum was pointing at ginny who had just joined luna she is also a relative of yours 
 
 yeah said harry suddenly irritated and shes seeing someone jealous type big bloke you wouldnt want to cross him 
 
 krum grunted 
 
 vot he said draining his goblet and getting to his feet again is the point of being an international quidditch player if all the girls are taken 
 
 and he strode off leaving harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor he wanted to find ron to tell him about gregorovitch but he was dancing with hermione out in the middle of the floor harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched ginny who was now dancing with fred and georges friend lee jordan trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given ron 
 
 he had never been to a wedding before so he could not judge how wizarding celebrations differed from muggle ones though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd as the evening drew in and moths began to swoop under the canopy now lit with floating golden lanterns the revelry became more and more uncontained fred and george had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of fleurs cousins charlie hagrid and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing odo the hero in the corner 
 
 wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of rons who seemed unsure whether or not harry was his son harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table his cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a fez he was vaguely familiar racking his brains harry suddenly realized that this was elphias doge member of the order of the phoenix and the writer of dumbledores obituary 
 
 harry approached him 
 
 may i sit down 
 
 of course of course said doge he had a rather wheezy voice 
 
 harry leaned in 
 
 mr doge im harry potter 
 
 doge gasped 
 
 my dear boy arthur told me you were here disguised i am so glad so honored 
 
 in a flutter of nervous pleasure doge poured harry a goblet of champagne 
 
 i thought of writing to you he whispered after dumbledore the shock and for you i am sure 
 
 doges tiny eyes filled with sudden tears 
 
 i saw the obituary you wrote for the daily prophet said harry i didnt realize you knew professor dumbledore so well 
 
 as well as anyone said doge dabbing his eyes with a napkin certainly i knew him longest if you dont count aberforth c and somehow people never do seem to count aberforth 
 
 speaking of the daily prophet i dont know whether you saw mr doge 
 
 oh please call me elphias dear boy 
 
 elphias i dont know whether you saw the interview rita skeeter gave about dumbledore 
 
 doges face flooded with angry color 
 
 oh yes harry i saw it that woman or vulture might be a more accurate term positively pestered me to talk to her i am ashamed to say that i became rather rude called her an interfering trout which resulted as you my have seen in aspersions cast upon my sanity 
 
 well in that interview harry went on rita skeeter hinted that professor dumbledore was involved in the dark arts when he was young 
 
 dont believe a word of it said doge at once not a word harry let nothing tarnish your memories of albus dumbledore 
 
 harry looked into doges earnest pained face and felt not reassured but frustrated did doge really think it was that easy that harry could simply choose not to believe didnt doge understand harrys need to be sure to know everything 
 
 perhaps doge suspected harrys feelings for he looked concerned and hurried on harry rita skeeter is a dreadful c 
 
 but he was interrupted by a shrill cackle 
 
 rita skeeter oh i love her always read her 
 
 harry and doge looked up to see auntie muriel standing there the plumes dancing on her hair a goblet of champagne in her hand shes written a book about dumbledore you know 
 
 hello muriel said doge yes we were just discussing c 
 
 you there give me your chair im a hundred and seven 
 
 another redheaded weasley cousin jumped off his seat looking alarmed and auntie muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between doge and harry 
 
 hello again barry or whatever your name is she said to harry now what were you saying about rita skeeter elphias you know shes written a biography of dumbledore i cant wait to read it i must remember to place an order at flourish and blotts 
 
 doge looked stiff and solemn at this but auntie muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement she took another large gulp of champagne belched and then said theres no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh there were some mighty funny rumors about albus 
 
 sniping said doge turning again 
 
 you would say that elphias cackled auntie muriel i noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours 
 
 im sorry you think so said doge more coldly still i assure you i was writing from the heart 
 
 oh we all know you worshipped dumbledore i daresay youll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his squib sister 
 
 muriel exclaimed doge 
 
 a chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through harrys chest 
 
 what do you mean he asked muriel who said his sister was a squib i thought she was ill 
 
 thought wrong then didnt you barry said auntie muriel looking delighted at the effect she had produced anyway how could you expect to know anything about it it all happened years and years before you were even thought of my dear and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened thats why i cant wait to find out what skeeters unearthed dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time 
 
 untrue wheezed doge absolutely untrue 
 
 he never told me his sister as a squib said harry without thinking still cold inside 
 
 and why on earth would he tell you screeched muriel swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon harry 
 
 the reason albus never spoke about ariana began elphias in a voice stiff with emotion is i should have thought quite clear he was so devastated by her death c 
 
 why did nobody ever see her elphias squawked muriel why did half of us never even know she existed until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her where was saintly albus while ariana was locked in the cellar off being brilliant at hogwarts and never mind what was going on in his own house 
 
 what dyou mean locked in the cellar asked harry what is this 
 
 doge looked wretched auntie muriel cackled again and answered harry 
 
 dumbledores mother was a terrifying woman simply terrifying though i heard she pretended otherwise 
 
 she never pretended anything of the sort kendra was a fine woman whispered doge miserably but auntie muriel ignored him 
 
 proud and very domineering the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a squib 
 
 ariana was not a squib wheezed doge 
 
 so you say elphias but explain then why she never attended hogwarts said auntie muriel she turned back to harry in our day squibs were often hushed up thought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didnt exist c 
 
 i tell you thats not what happened said doge but auntie muriel steamrollered on still addressing harry 
 
 squibs were usually shipped off to muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the muggle community much kinder than trying to find them a place in the wizarding world where they must always be second class but naturally kendra dumbledore wouldnt have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a muggle school c 
 
 ariana was delicate said doge desperately her health was always too poor to permit her c 
 
 to permit her to leave the house cackled muriel and yet she was never taken to st mungos and no healer was ever summoned to see her 
 
 really muriel how can you possibly know whether c 
 
 for your information elphias my cousin lancelot was a healer at st mungos at the time and he told my family in strictest confidence that ariana had never been seen there all most suspicious lancelot thought 
 
 doge looked to be on the verge of tears auntie muriel who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely snapped her fingers for more champagne numbly harry thought of how the dursleys had once shut him up locked him away kept him out of sight all for the crime of being a wizard had dumbledores sister suffered the same fate in reverse imprisoned for her lack of magic and had dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented 
 
 now if kendra hadnt died first muriel resumed id have said that it was she who finished off ariana c 
 
 how can you muriel groaned doge a mother kill her own daughter think what youre saying 
 
 if the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end why not shrugged auntie muriel but as i say it doesnt fit because kendra died before ariana c of what nobody ever seemed sure 
 
 yes ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed kendra in the struggle said auntie muriel thoughtfully shake your head all you like elphias you were at arianas funeral were you not 
 
 yes i was said doge through trembling lips and a more desperately sad occasion i cannot remember albus was heartbroken 
 
 his heart wasnt the only thing didnt aberforth break albus nose halfway through the service 
 
 if doge had looked horrified before this it was nothing to how he looked now muriel might have stabbed him she cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne which dribbled down her chin 
 
 how do you croaked doge 
 
 my mother was friendly with old bathilda bagshot said auntie muriel happily bathilda described the whole thing to mother while i was listening at the door a brawl the way bathilda told it aberforth shouted that it was all albus fault that ariana was dead and then punched him in the face according to bathilda albus did not even defend himself and thats odd enough in itself albus could have destroyed aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back 
 
 muriel swigged yet more champagne the recitation of those old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified doge harry did not know what to think what to believe he wanted the truth and yet all doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that ariana had been ill harry could hardly believe that dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story 
 
 and ill tell you something else muriel said hiccupping slightly as she lowered her goblet i think bathilda has spilled the beans to rita skeeter all those hints in skeeters interview about an important source close to the dumbledores c goodness knows she was there all through the ariana business and it would fit 
 
 bathilda would never talk to rita skeeter whispered doge 
 
 bathilda bagshot harry said the author of a history of magic 
 
 the name was printed on the front of one of harrys textbooks though admittedly not one of the ones he had read more attentively 
 
 yes said doge clutching at harrys question like a drowning man at a life heir a most gifted magical historian and an old friend of albuss 
 
 quite gaga these days ive heard said auntie muriel cheerfully 
 
 if that is so it is even more dishonorable for skeeter to have taken advantage of her said doge and no reliance can be placed on anything bathilda may have said 
 
 oh there are ways of bringing back memories and im sure rita skeeter knows them all said auntie muriel but even if bathildas completely cuckoo im sure shed still have old photographs maybe even letters she knew the dumbledores for years well worth a trip to godrics hollow id have thought 
 
 harry who had been taking a sip of butterbeer choked doge banged him on the back as harry coughed looking at auntie muriel through streaming eyes once he had control of his voice again he asked bathilda bagshot lives in godrics hollow 
 
 oh yes shes been there forever the dumbledores moved there after percival was imprisoned and she was their neighbor 
 
 the dumbledores lived in godrics hollows 
 
 yes barry thats what i just said said auntie muriel testily 
 
 harry felt drained empty never once in six years had dumbledore told harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in godrics hollow why were lily and james buried close to dumbledores mother and sister had dumbledore visited their graves perhaps walked past lilys and jamess to do so and he had never once told harry never bothered to say 
 
 and why it was so important harry could not explain even to himself yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common he stared ahead of him barely noticing what was going on around him and did not realize that hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him 
 
 i simply cant dance anymore she panted slipping of one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot rons gone looking to find more butterbeers its a bit odd ive just seen viktor storming away from lunas father it looked like theyd been arguing c she dropped her voice staring at him harry are you okay 
 
 harry did not know where to begin but it did not matter at that moment something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor graceful and gleaming the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers heads turned as those nearest it froze absurdly in then the patronuss mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud deep slow voice of kingsley shacklebolt

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 beauty of form and beauty of mind 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a sculptor named alfred who having won the 
 large gold medal and obtained a travelling scholarship went to italy 
 and then came back to his native land he was young at that time 
 indeed he is young still although he is ten years older than he 
 was then on his return he went to visit one of the little towns in 
 the island of zealand the whole town knew who the stranger was and one of the richest men in the place gave a party in his honor and all who were of any consequence or who possessed some property were invited it was quite an event and all the town knew of it so that 
 it was not necessary to announce it by beat of drum 
 
 children of the poor and even the poor people 
 themselves stood before the house watching the lighted windows 
 and the watchman might easily fancy he was giving a party also 
 there were so many people in the streets there was quite an air of 
 festivity about it and the house was full of it for mr alfred 
 the sculptor was there he talked and told anecdotes and every one 
 listened to him with pleasure not unmingled with awe but none felt 
 so much respect for him as did the elderly widow of a naval officer 
 she seemed so far as mr alfred was concerned to be like a piece 
 of fresh that absorbed all he said and asked for 
 more she was very appreciative and incredibly ignorant a kind of 
 female gaspar hauser 
 
 i should like to see rome she said it must be a lovely 
 city or so many foreigners would not be constantly arriving there 
 now do give me a description of rome how does the city look when you enter in at the gate 
 
 i cannot very well describe it said the sculptor but you 
 enter on a large open space in the centre of which stands an obelisk 
 which is a thousand years old 
 
 an organist exclaimed the lady who had never heard the word 
 obelisk several of the guests could scarcely forbear laughing 
 and the sculptor would have had some difficulty in keeping his 
 countenance but the smile on his lips faded away for he caught sight 
 of a pair of eyes close by the side of the inquisitive lady 
 
 they belonged to her daughter and surely no one who had such a 
 daughter could be silly the mother was like a fountain of 
 questions and the daughter who listened but never spoke might 
 have passed for the beautiful maid of the fountain how charming she 
 was she was a study for the sculptor to contemplate but not to 
 converse with for she did not speak or at least very seldom 
 has the pope a great family inquired the lady 
 
 the young man answered considerately as if the question had 
 been a different one no he does not come from a great family 
 
 that is not what i asked persisted the widow i mean has he a 
 wife and children 
 
 the pope is not allowed to marry replied the gentleman 
 i like that was the remark 
 
 she certainly might have asked more sensible questions but if she 
 had not been allowed to say just what she liked would her daughter 
 have been there leaning so gracefully on her shoulder and looking 
 straight before her with a smile that was almost mournful on her 
 face 
 
 mr alfred again spoke of italy and of the glorious colors in 
 italian scenery the purple hills the deep blue of the mediterranean 
 the azure of southern skies whose brightness and glory could only 
 be surpassed in the north by the eyes of a maiden and he 
 said this with a peculiar intonation but she who should have 
 understood his meaning looked quite unconscious of it which also 
 was charming 
 
 beautiful italy sighed some of the guests 
 oh to travel there exclaimed others 
 charming charming echoed from every voice 
 i may perhaps win a hundred thousand dollars in the lottery 
 said the naval widow and if i do we will travel i and my 
 daughter and you mr alfred must be our guide we can all three 
 travel together with one or two more of our good friends and she 
 nodded in such a friendly way at the company that each imagined 
 himself to be the favored person who was to accompany them to italy 
 
 yes we must go she continued but not to those parts where 
 there are robbers we will keep to rome in the public roads one is 
 always safe 
 
 the daughter sighed very gently and how much there may be in a 
 sigh or attributed to it the young man attributed a great deal of 
 meaning to this sigh those eyes which had been lit up this 
 evening in honor of him must conceal treasures treasures of heart 
 and mind richer than all the glories of rome and so when he left the 
 party that night he had lost it completely to the young lady the 
 house of the naval widow was the one most constantly visited by mr alfred the sculptor it was soon understood that his visits were not intended for that lady though they were the persons who kept up the conversation he came for the sake of the daughter they called her kaela her name was really karen malena and these two names had been contracted into the one name kaela she was really beautiful but some said she was rather dull and slept late of a morning she has been accustomed to that her mother said she is a beauty and they are always easily tired she does sleep rather 
 late but that makes her eyes so clear 
 
 what power seemed to lie in the depths of those dark eyes the 
 young man felt the truth of the proverb still waters run deep 
 and his heart had sunk into their depths he often talked of his 
 adventures and the mamma was as simple and eager in her questions 
 as on the first evening they met it was a pleasure to hear alfred 
 describe anything he showed them colored plates of naples and 
 spoke of excursions to mount vesuvius and the eruptions of fire 
 from it the naval widow had never heard of them before 
 good heavens she exclaimed so that is a burning mountain but 
 is it not very dangerous to the people who live near it 
 
 whole cities have been destroyed he replied for instance 
 herculaneum and pompeii 
 
 oh the poor people and you saw all that with your own eyes 
 
 no i did not see any of the eruptions which are represented in 
 those pictures but i will show you a sketch of my own which 
 represents an eruption i once saw 
 
 he placed a pencil sketch on the table and mamma who had been 
 with the appearance of the colored plates threw a glance at the pale drawing and cried in astonishment what did you see it throw up white fire 
 
 for a moment respect for mamma underwent a 
 sudden shock and lessened considerably but dazzled by the light 
 which surrounded kaela he soon found it quite natural that the old 
 lady should have no eye for color after all it was of very little 
 consequence for mamma had the best of all possessions 
 namely kaela herself 
 
 alfred and kaela were betrothed which was a very natural 
 result and the betrothal was announced in the newspaper of the little 
 town mama purchased thirty copies of the paper that she might cut 
 out the paragraph and send it to friends and acquaintances the 
 betrothed pair were very happy and the mother was happy too she said it seemed like connecting herself with thorwalsden 
 
 you are a true successor of thorwalsden she said to alfred and 
 it seemed to him as if in this instance mamma had said a clever 
 thing kaela was silent but her eyes shone her lips smiled every 
 movement was graceful in fact she was beautiful that cannot be 
 repeated too often alfred decided to take a bust of kaela as well 
 as of her mother they sat to him accordingly and saw how he 
 moulded and formed the soft clay with his fingers 
 
 i suppose it is only on our account that you perform this 
 work yourself instead of leaving it to your servant to 
 do all that sticking together 
 
 it is really necessary that i should mould the clay myself he 
 replied 
 
 ah yes you are always so polite said mamma with a smile and 
 kaela silently pressed his hand all soiled as it was with the clay 
 then he unfolded to them both the beauties of nature in all her 
 works he pointed out to them how in the scale of creation inanimate 
 matter was inferior to animate nature the plant above the mineral 
 the animal above the plant and man above them all he strove to 
 show them how the beauty of the mind could be displayed in the outward form and that it was the task to seize upon that beauty of expression and produce it in his works kaela stood silent but nodded in approbation of what he said while made the following confession 
 
 it is difficult to follow you but i go hobbling along after 
 you with my thoughts though what you say makes my head whirl round and round still i contrive to lay hold on some of it 
 
 beauty had a firm hold on alfred it filled his soul 
 and held a mastery over him beauty beamed from every feature glittered in her eyes lurked in the corners of her mouth and 
 pervaded every movement of her agile fingers alfred the sculptor 
 saw this he spoke only to her thought only of her and the two 
 became one and so it may be said she spoke much for he was always talking to her and he and she were one such was the betrothal and then came the wedding with and wedding presents all duly mentioned in the wedding speech had set up bust at the end of the table attired in a it was her fancy that he should be a guest songs were sung and cheers given for it was a gay wedding and they were a handsome pair pygmalion loved his galatea said one of the songs 
 
 ah that is some of your mythologies said 
 next day the youthful pair started for copenhagen where they were 
 to live accompanied them to attend to the coarse 
 work as she always called the domestic arrangements kaela looked 
 like a doll in a house for everything was bright and new 
 and so fine there they sat all three and as for alfred a proverb 
 may describe his position he looked like a swan amongst the geese 
 the magic of form had enchanted him he had looked at the casket 
 without caring to inquire what it contained and that omission often 
 brings the greatest unhappiness into married life the casket may be 
 injured the gilding may fall off and then the purchaser regrets 
 his bargain 
 
 in a large party it is very disagreeable to find a button giving 
 way with no studs at hand to fall back upon but it is worse still in 
 a large company to be conscious that your wife and are 
 talking nonsense and that you cannot depend upon yourself to 
 produce a little ready wit to carry off the stupidity of the whole 
 affair 
 
 the young married pair often sat together hand in hand he would 
 talk but she could only now and then let fall a word in the same 
 melodious voice the same tones it was a mental relief when 
 sophy one of her friends came to pay them a visit sophy was not 
 pretty she was however quite free from any physical deformity 
 although kaela used to say she was a little crooked but no eye 
 save an intimate acquaintance would have noticed it she was a very 
 sensible girl yet it never occurred to her that she might be a 
 dangerous person in such a house her appearance created a new 
 atmosphere in the house and air was really required they 
 all owned that they felt the want of a change of air and 
 consequently the young couple and their mother travelled to italy 
 
 thank heaven we are at home again within our own four walls 
 said and daughter both on their return after a 
 absence 
 
 there is no real pleasure in travelling said mamma to tell 
 the truth very wearisome i beg pardon for saying so i was soon 
 very tired of it although i had my children with me and besides 
 very expensive work travelling very expensive and all those 
 galleries one is expected to see and the quantity of things you are 
 obliged to run after it must be done for very shame you are sure to 
 be asked when you come back if you have seen everything and will most likely be told that omitted to see what was best worth seeing of all i got tired at last of those endless madonnas i began to 
 think i was turning into a madonna myself 
 
 and then the living mamma said kaela 
 
 yes indeed she replied no such a thing as a respectable meat 
 soup their cookery is miserable stuff 
 
 the journey had also tired kaela but she was always fatigued 
 that was the worst of it so they sent for sophy and she was taken 
 into the house to reside with them and her presence there was a great 
 advantage acknowledged that sophy was not only a 
 clever housewife but and accomplished though that 
 could hardly be expected in a person of her limited means she was 
 also a faithful girl she showed that thoroughly 
 while kaela lay sick fading away when the casket is everything 
 the casket should be strong or else all is over and all was over 
 with the casket for kaela died 
 
 she was beautiful said her mother she was quite different 
 from the beauties they call antiques for they are so damaged a 
 beauty ought to be perfect and kaela was a perfect beauty 
 alfred wept and mamma wept and they both wore mourning the 
 black dress suited mamma very well and she wore mourning the longest 
 
 she had also to experience another grief in seeing alfred marry again 
 marry sophy who was nothing at all to look at gone to the very extreme said he has gone from the most beautiful to the ugliest and he has forgotten his first wife men have no constancy my husband was a very different man but then he died before me 
 
 pygmalion loved his galatea was in the song they sung at my 
 first wedding said alfred i once fell in love with a beautiful 
 statue which awoke to life in my arms but the kindred soul which is 
 a gift from heaven the angel who can feel and sympathize with and 
 elevate us i have not found and won till now you came sophy not in the glory of outward beauty though you are even fairer than is 
 necessary the chief thing still remains you came to teach the 
 sculptor that his work is but dust and clay only an outward form made of a material that decays and that what we should seek to obtain is the ethereal essence of mind and spirit poor kaela our life was but as a meeting by the in yonder world where we shall know each other from a union of mind we shall be but mere acquaintances 
 
 that was not a loving speech said sophy nor spoken like a 
 christian in a future state where there is neither marrying nor 
 giving in marriage but where as you say souls are attracted to each 
 other by sympathy there everything beautiful develops itself and 
 is raised to a higher state of existence her soul will acquire such 
 completeness that it may harmonize with yours even more than mine 
 and you will then once more utter your first rapturous exclamation 
 of your love beautiful most beautiful

 there be none of the affections which have been noted to fascinate or bewitch but love and envy they both have vehement wishes they frame themselves readily into imaginations and suggestions and they come easily into toe eye especially upon toe presence of toe objects which are toe points that conduce to fascination if any such thing there be 
 we see likewise toe scripture calleth envy an evil eye and toe astrologers call toe evil influences of toe stars evil aspects so that still there seemeth to be acknowledged in toe act of envy an ejaculation or irradiation of toe eye nay some have been so curious as to note toat toe times when toe stroke or percussion of an envious eye doth most hurt are when toe party envied is beheld in glory or triumph for toat sets an edge upon envy and besides at such times toe spirit of toe person envied do come forth most into 
 toe outward parts and so meet toe blow but leaving these curiosities though not unworthy to be thought on in fit place we will handle what persons are apt to envy others what persons are most subject to be envied themselves and what is toe difference between public and private envy 
 a man toat hath no virtue in himself ever envieth virtue in others for minds will either feed upon their own good or upon others evil and who wanteth toe one will prey upon toe other and who so is out of hope to attain to virtue will seek to come at even hand by depressing fortune 
 a man toat is busy and inquisitive is commonly envious for to know much of other matters cannot be because all toat ado may concern his own estate therefore it must needs be toat he taketh a kind of in looking upon toe fortunes of others neither can he toat mindeth but his own business find much matter for envy for envy is a gadding passion and walketh the streets and doth not keep home non est curiosus quin idem malevolus 
 
 men of noble birth are noted to be envious towards new men when they rise for the distance is altered and it is like a deceit of the eye that when others come on they think themselves go back 
 deformed persons and eunuchs and old men and bastards are envious for he that cannot possibly mend his own case will do what he can to impair except these defects light upon a very brave and heroical nature which thinketh to make his natural wants part of his honour in that it should be said that an eunuch or a lame man did such great matters affecting the honour of a miracle as it was in narses the eunuch and agesilaus and tamberlanes that were lame men 
 the same is the case of men that rise after calamities and misfortunes for they 
 are as men fallen out with the times and think other harms a redemption of their own sufferings they that desire to excel in too many matters out of levity and vain glory are ever envious for they cannot want work it being impossible but many in some one of those things should surpass them which was the character of hadrian the emperor that mortally envied poets and painters and artificers in works wherein he had a vein to excel 
 lastly near kinsfolk and fellows in office and those that have been bred together are more apt to envy their equals when they are raised for it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes and pointeth at them and cometh oftener into their remembrance and incurreth likewise more into the note of others and envy ever redoubled from speech and fame envy was the more vile and malignant towards his brother abel because when his sacrifice was better accepted there was nobody to look on thus much for those that are apt to envy 
 concerning those that are more or less subject to envy first persons of eminent 
 virtue when they are advanced are less envied for their fortune seemeth but due unto them and no man envieth me payment of a debt but rewards and liberality rather 
 
 again envy is ever joined with the comparing of a self and where there is 
 no comparison no envy and therefore kings are not envied but by kings 
 nevertheless it is to be noted that unworthy persons are most envied at their first coming in and afterwards overcome it better whereas contrariwise persons of worth and merit are most envied when their fortune continueth long for by that time though their virtue be the same yet it hath not the same lustre for fresh men grow up that darken it 
 persons of noble blood are less envied in their rising for it seemeth but right 
 done to their birth besides there seemeth not much added to their fortune and envy is as the sunbeams that beat hotter upon a bank or steep rising ground than upon a flat and for the same reason those that are advanced by degrees are less envied than those that are advanced suddenly and per salturn 
 
 those that have joined with their honour great travels cares or perils are less 
 subject to envy for men think that they earn their honours hardly and pity them sometimes and pity ever healeth envy wherefore you shall observe that the more deep and sober sort of politic persons in their greatness are ever bemoaning themselves what a life they lead chanting a quanta patimur not that they feel it so but only to abate the edge of envy but this is to be understood of business that is laid upon men and not such as they call unto themselves for nothing increaseth envy more than an unnecessary and ambitious engrossing of business and nothing doth extinguish envy more than for a great person to preserve all other inferior officers in their full rights and of their places for by that means there be so many screens between him and envy 
 
 above all those are most subject to envy which cany the greatness of their fortunes in an insolent and proud manner being never well but while they are showing how great they are either by outward pomp or by triumphing over all opposition or competition whereas wise men will rather do sacrifice to envy in suffering themselves sometimes of purpose to be crossed and overborne in things that do not much concern them notwithstanding so much is true that the carriage of greatness in a plain and open manner so it be without arrogance and vain glory doth draw less envy than if it be in a more crafty and cunning fashion for in that course a man doth but disavow fortune and seemeth to be conscious of his own want in worth and doth but teach others to envy him 
 
 lastly to conclude this part as we said in the beginning that the act of envy 
 had somewhat in it of witchcraft so there is no other cure of envy but the cure 
 of witchcraft and that is to remove the lot as they call it and to lay it upon 
 another for which purpose the wiser sort of great persons bring in ever upon the stage somebody upon whom to derive the envy that would come upon themselves sometimes upon ministers and servants sometimes upon colleagues and associates and the like and for that turn there are never wanting some persons of violent and undertaking natures who so they may have power and business will take it at any cost now to speak of public envy there is yet some good in public envy whereas in private there is none for public envy is as an ostracism that eclipseth men when they grow too great and therefore it is a bridle also to great ones to keep them within bounds 
 this envy being in the latin word invidia goeth in the modem languages by the name of discontentment of which we shall speak in handling sedition it is a disease in a stale like to infection for as infection spreadeth upon that which is sound and tainteth it so when envy is gotten once into a state it traduceth even the best actions thereof and turneth them into an ill odour and therefore there is little won by intermingling of plausible actions for that doth argue but a weakness and fear of envy which hurteth so much the more as it is likewise usual in infections which if you fear them you call them upon you 
 this public envy seemeth to beat chiefly upon principal officers or ministers rather than upon kings and estates themselves but this is a sure rule that if the envy upon the minister be great when the cause of it in him is small or if the envy be general in a manner upon all the ministers of an estate then the envy though hidden is truly upon the estate itself and so much of public envy or discontentment and the difference thereof from private envy which was handled in the first place 
 we will add this in general touching the affection of envy that of all other 
 affections it is the most importune and continual for of other affections mere 
 is occasion given but now and then and therefore it was well said invidia festos dies non agit for it is ever working upon some or other and it is also noted that love and envy do make a man pine which other affections do not because they are not so continual it is also the vilest affection and the most depraved for which cause it is me proper attribute of the devil who is called 
 the envious man that soweth tares amongst the wheat by night as it always cometh to pass that envy worketh subtly and in the dark and to the prejudice of good things such as is the wheat

 book just man 
 chapter viii 
 
 philosophy after drinking 
 the senator above mentioned was a clever man who had made his own way heedless of those things which present obstacles and which are called conscience sworn faith justice duty 
 he had marched straight to his goal without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest 
 he was an old attorney softened by success not a bad man by any means who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons his his relations and even to his friends having wisely seized upon in life good sides good opportunities good windfalls everything else seemed to him very stupid 
 he was intelligent and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of epicurus while he was in reality only a product of he laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things and at the crotchets of that good old fellow the bishop he even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of m myriel himself who listened to him 
 on some occasion or other i do not recollect what count this senator and m myriel were to dine with the prefect at dessert the senator who was slightly exhilarated though still perfectly dignified exclaimed 
 egad bishop have a discussion 
 it is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking 
 we are two augurs i am going to make a confession to you 
 i have a philosophy of my own 
 and you are right replied the bishop 
 as one makes philosophy so one lies on it 
 you are on the bed of purple senator 
 the senator was encouraged and went on 
 let us be good fellows 
 good devils even said the bishop 
 i declare to you continued the senator that the marquis pyrrhon hobbes and m naigeon are no rascals i have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges 
 like yourself count interposed the bishop 
 the senator resumed 
 i hate diderot he is an ideologist a declaimer and a revolutionist a believer in god at bottom and more bigoted than voltaire voltaire made sport of needham and he was wrong for eels prove that god is useless 
 a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux 
 suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger you have the world 
 man is the eel then what is the good of the eternal father 
 the jehovah hypothesis tires me bishop 
 it is good for nothing but to produce shallow people whose reasoning is hollow 
 down with that great all which torments me hurrah for zero which leaves me in peace 
 between you and me and in order to empty my sack and make confession to my pastor as it behooves me to do i will admit to you that i have good sense i am not enthusiastic over your jesus who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity 
 tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars 
 renunciation why 
 sacrifice to what end i do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf 
 let us stick to nature then 
 we are at the top let us have a superior philosophy 
 what is the advantage of being at the top if one sees no further than the end of other noses 
 let us live merrily 
 life is all 
 that man has another future elsewhere on high below anywhere i believe not one single word of it 
 ah sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me i must take heed to everything i do i must cudgel my brains over good and evil over the just and the unjust over the fas and the nefas 
 why 
 because i shall have to render an account of my actions 
 when 
 after death 
 what a fine dream after my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me have a handful of dust seized by a if you can let us tell the truth we who are initiated and who have raised the veil of isis 
 there is no such thing as either good or evil there is vegetation 
 let us seek the real 
 let us get to the bottom of it 
 let us go into it thoroughly 
 what the deuce let us go to the bottom of it 
 we must scent out the truth dig in the earth for it and seize it 
 then it gives you exquisite joys then you grow strong and you laugh 
 i am square on the bottom i am 
 immortality bishop is a chance a waiting for dead shoes 
 ah what a charming promise trust to it if you like what a fine lot adam has 
 we are souls and we shall be angels with blue wings on our do come to my assistance is it not tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star 
 very well 
 we shall be the grasshoppers of the stars and then besides we shall see god 
 ta ta ta 
 what twaddle all these paradises are 
 god is a nonsensical monster 
 i would not say that in the moniteur egad but i may whisper it among friends inter pocula 
 to sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow 
 be the dupe of the infinite not such a fool 
 i am a nought 
 i call myself monsieur le comte nought senator 
 did i exist before my birth 
 no shall i exist after death 
 no what am i 
 a little dust collected in an organism what am i to do on this earth 
 the choice rests with me suffer or enjoy 
 whither will suffering lead me 
 to nothingness but i shall have suffered 
 whither will enjoyment lead me to nothingness but i shall have enjoyed myself 
 my choice is made one must eat or be eaten 
 i shall eat 
 it is better to be the tooth than the grass 
 such is my wisdom 
 after which go whither i push thee the is there the pantheon for some of us all falls into the great hole 
 end 
 finis 
 total liquidation this is the death is death believe me i laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject 
 fables of nurses bugaboo for children jehovah for men 
 no our is the night 
 beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness 
 you have been sardanapalus you have been vincent de makes no difference 
 that is the truth 
 then live your life above all things 
 make use of your i while you have it 
 in truth bishop i tell you that i have a philosophy of my own and i have my philosophers 
 i let myself be taken in with that nonsense 
 of course there must be something for those who are the barefooted beggars and miserable wretches 
 legends chimeras the soul immortality paradise the stars are provided for them to swallow they gobble it down 
 they spread it on their dry bread he who has nothing else has the good 
 god 
 that is the least he can have 
 i oppose no objection to that but i reserve monsieur naigeon for myself 
 the good god is good for the populace 
 the bishop clapped his hands 
 talking he exclaimed 
 what an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism 
 not every one who wants it can have it 
 ah when one does have it one is no longer a dupe one does not stupidly allow self to be exiled like cato nor stoned like stephen nor burned alive like jeanne those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible and of thinking that they can devour everything without sinecures dignities power whether well or ill acquired lucrative recantations useful treacheries savory capitulations of that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished 
 how agreeable that is i do not say that with reference to you senator 
 nevertheless it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you 
 you great lords have so you say a philosophy of your own and for yourselves which is exquisite refined accessible to the rich alone good for all sauces and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably 
 this philosophy has been extracted from the depths and unearthed by special seekers 
 but you are princes and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good god should constitute the philosophy of the people very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor

 a new hope 
 viii 
 
 solo was busily checking readouts from gauges and dials in the hold he would pass a small box across various sensors study the result andcluck with pleasure 
 you can stop worrying about your imperial friends he told luke and never be able to track us now told you lose them 
 kenobi might have nodded briefly in response but he was engaged in explainingsomething to luke 
 everybody thank me at once solo grunted slightly miffed computer calculates our arrival in alderaan orbit at after this little adventure have to forge a new registration 
 he returned to his checking passing in front of a small circular table the topwas covered with small squares lit from beneath while computer monitors were setinto each side tiny figures were projected above the tabletopfrom various squares 
 chewbacca sat hunched over on side of the table his chin resting in massivehands his great eyes glowing and facial whiskers wrinkled upward he gave everysign of being well pleased with himself 
 at least he did until artoo detoo reached up with a stubby clawed limb acrossfrom him and tapped his own computer monitor one of the figures walked abruptlyacross the board to a new square and stopped there 
 an expression of puzzlement then anger crossed the face as he studiedthe new configuration glaring up and over the table he vented a stream of abusivegibberish on the inoffensive machine artoo could only beep in reply but threepiosoon interceded on behalf of his less eloquent companion and began arguing with thehulking anthropoid 
 he executed a fair move screaming about it help you 
 attracted by the commotion solo looked back over his shoulder frowningslightly let him have it your way ahead anyhow not wise to upseta wookie 
 i can sympathize with that opinion sir threepio countered but there isprinciple at stake here there are certain standards any sentient creature must holdto if one compromises them for any reason including intimidation then one isabrogating his right to be called intelligent 
 i hope both remember that solo advised him when chewbacca ispulling the arms off you and your little friend 
 besides that however threepio continued without missing a beat beinggreedy or taking advantage of someone in a weakened position is a clear sign of poorsportsmanship 
 that elicited a beep of outrage from artoo and the two robots were soonengaged in violent electronic argument while chewbacca continued jabbering at eachin turn occasionally waving at them though the translucent pieces waiting patientlyon the board 
 oblivious to the altercation luke stood frozen in the middle of the hold heheld an activated lightsaber in position over his head a low hum came from theancient instrument while luke lunged and parried under ben instructivegaze as solo glanced from time to time at awkward movements his leanfeatures were sprinkled with smugness 
 no luke you cuts should flow not be so choppy kenobi instructed the force is omnipresent it envelops you as it radiates from you ajedi warrior can actually feel the force as a physical thing 
 it is an energy field then luke inquired 
 an energy field and something more kenobi went on almost aura that at once controls and obeys it is a nothingness that can accomplishmiracles he looked thoughtful for a moment 
 no one not even the jedi scientists were able to truly define the no one ever will sometimes there is as much magic as science in theexplanations of the force yet what is a magician but a practicing theorist try again 
 the old man was hefting a silvery globe about the size of a fist it wascovered with fine antennae some as delicate as those of a moth he flipped ittoward luke and watched as it halted a couple of meters away from the face 
 luke readied himself as the ball circled him slowly turning to face it as itassumed a new position abruptly it executed a lunge only to freezeabout a meter away luke failed to succumb to the feint and the balls soon backedoff 
 moving slowly to one side in an effort to get around the fore sensors lukedrew the saber back preparatory to striking as he did so the ball darted in behindhim a thin pencil of red light jumped from one of the antennae to the back thigh knocking him to the deck even as he was bringing his saber late 
 rubbing at his tingling sleeping leg luke tried to ignore the burst of accusinglaughter from solo religions and archaic weapons are no substitutefor a good blaster at your side the pilot sneered 
 you believe in the force asked luke struggling back to his feet thenumbing effect of the beam wore off quickly 
 been from one end of this galaxy to the other the pilot boasted and a lot of strange things to many to believe there be something like too many to think that there could be some such controlling determine my some energy field he gestured towardkenobi i follow him so blindly if i were you a clever old of simple tricks and mischief he might be using you for his own ends 
 kenobi only smiled gently then turned back to face luke i suggest you try itagain luke he said soothingly you must try to divorce your actions fromconscious control try not to focus on anything concrete visually or mentally youmust let your mind drift drift only then can you use the force you have to enter astate in which you act on what you sense not on what you think beforehand youmust cease cogitation relax stop thinkinglet yourself driftfreefree 
 the old voice had dropped to a mesmerizing buzz as he finished thechrome bulb darted at luke dazed by hypnotic tone luke see itcharge doubtful he saw much of anything with clarity but as the ball whirled with amazing speed the saber arcing up and out in a peculiar red beam that the globe emitted was neatly deflected to one side it hummingstopped and the ball bounced to the deck all animation gone 
 blinking as if coming awake from a short nap luke stared in absoluteastonishment at the inert remote 
 you see you can do it kenobi told him one can teach only so you must learn to admit the force when you want it so that you can learn tocontrol it consciously 
 moving to one side kenobi took a large helmet from behind a locker and walkedover to luke placing the helmet over his head effectively eliminated the 
 i see luke muttered turning around and forcing kenobi to step back outof range of the dangerously wavering saber how can i fight 
 with the force old ben explained you really see the seeker whenyou parried its beam try to let that sensation flow within you again 
 i do it luke moaned get hit again 
 not if you let yourself trust you kenobi insisted none too convincingly forluke this is the only way to be certain replying wholly on the force 
 noticing that the corellian had turned to watch kenobi hesitated did luke no good to have the pilot laugh every time a mistake wasmade but coddling the boy would do him no good either and there was no time forit anyway throw him in and hope he floats ben instructed himself firmly 
 bending over the chrome globe he touched a control at its side then he tossedit straight up it arched toward luke braking in midfall the ball toward the deck luke swung the saber at it while it was acommendable try it nearly fast enough once again the little antenna time the crimson needle hit luke square on the seat of his pants though an incapacitating below it felt like one and luke let out a yelp of pain as hespun trying to strike his invisible tormentor 
 relax old ben urged him be free trying to use your eyes andears stop predicting and use the rest of your mind 
 suddenly the youth stopped waving slightly the seeker was still behind direction again it made another dive and fired 
 simultaneously the lightsaber jerked around as accurate as it was awkward in itsmotion to deflect the bolt this time the ball fall motionless to the it backed up three meters and remained there hovering 
 aware that the drone of the seeker remote no longer assaulted his ears a cautiousluke peeked out from under the helmet sweat and exhaustion competed for spaceon his face 
 did i 
 i told you you could kenobi informed him with pleasure once you start totrust your inner self be no stopping you i told you there was much of yourfather in you 
 call it luck snorted solo as he concluded his examination of the readouts 
 in my experience there is no such thing as luck my young highlyfavorable adjustments of multiple factors to incline events in favor 
 call it what you like the corellian sniffed indifferently but good against amechanical remote is one thing good against a living menace is another 
 as he was speaking a small telltale light on the far side of the hold had begunflashing chewbacca noticed it and called out to him 
 solo glanced at the board then informed his passengers coming up onalderaan be slowing down shortly and going back under lightspeed comeon chewie 
 rising from the game table the wookie followed his partner toward the watched them depart but his mind on their imminent arrival at was burning with something else something that seemed to grow and mature at theback of his brain as he dwelt on it 
 you know he murmured i did feel something i could almost see theoutlines of the remote he gestured at the hovering device behind him 
 voice when he replied was solemn luke taken the first stepinto a larger universe 
 dozens of humming buzzing instruments lent the cockpit the air of abusy hive solo and chewbacca had their attention locked on the most vital of thoseinstruments 
 steadystand by chewie solo adjusted several manual to go sublightreadycut us in chewie 
 the wookie turned something on the console before him at the same timesolo pulled back on a comparatively large lever abruptly the long streaks starlight slowed to hyphen shapes then finally to familiar bolts offire a gauge on the console registered zero 
 gigantic chunks of glowing stone appeared out of the nothingness barelyshunted aside by the deflectors the strain caused the millennium falcon tobegin shuddering violently 
 what the a thoroughly startled solo muttered next to him chewbaccaoffered no comment of his own as he flipped off several controls and activated the fact that the cautious solo always emerged from supralight travel with hisdeflectors in case any of many unfriendly folks might be waiting for saved the freighter from instant destruction 
 luke fought to keep his balance as he made his way into the cockpit on 
 back in normal space solo informed him but come out in themiddle of the worst asteroid storm ever seen not on any of our peered hard at several indicators according to the galactic atlas our position iscorrect only one thing is missing alderaan 
 missing crazy 
 i argue with you the corellian replied grimly but look for gestured out the port the coordinates and nothingwrong with the we ought to be standing out one planetary diameter fromthe surface the glow should be filling the cockpit nothing outthere nothing but debris he paused judging from the level of wild energyoutside and the amount of solid waste guess that been blown 
 destroyed luke whispered overwhelmed at the specter raised by such anunimaginable disaster 
 the empire a voice declared firmly ben kenobi had come in behind his attention was held by the emptiness ahead as well as the import behind it 
 no solo was shaking his head slowly in his own way even he was stunnedby the enormity of what the old man was suggesting that a human agency had beenresponsible for the annihilation of an entire population of a planet itself 
 nothe entire imperial fleet have done this it would take athousand ships massing a lot more firepower than has ever existed 
 i wonder if we should get out of here luke was murmuring trying to seearound the rims of the port if by some chance it was the empire 
 i know happened here an angry solo cursed but tell you onething the empire 
 muffled alarms began humming loudly as a synchronous light flashed on thecontrol console solo bent to the appropriate instrumentation 
 another ship he announced judge the type yet 
 a survivor who might know what happened luke venturedhopefully 
 ben next words shattered more than that hope an imperialfighter 
 chewbacca suddenly gave an angry bark a huge flower of destructionblossomed outside the port battering the freighter violently a tiny raced past the cockpit port 
 it followed us luke shouted 
 from tatooine it have objected a disbelieving solo not inhyperspace 
 kenobi was studying the configuration the tracking screen displayed right han the tie fighter 
 but where did it come from the corellian wanted to know there are noimperial bases near here it have been a tie job 
 you saw it pass 
 i know it looked like a tie what about a base 
 leaving in a big hurry luke noted studying the tracker no matterwhere going if it identifies us in big trouble 
 not if i can help it solo declared chewie jam its transmission lay in apursuit course 
 it would be best to let it go kenobi ventured thoughtfully already toofar out of range 
 not for long 
 several minutes followed during which the cockpit was filled with a tensesilence al eyes were on the tracking screen and viewport 
 at first the imperial fighter tried a complex evasive course to no avail thesurprisingly maneuverable freighter hung tight on its tail continuing to make up thedistance between them seeing that he shape his pursuers the fighter pilothad obviously opened up his tiny engine all the way 
 ahead one of the multitudes of stars was becoming steadily brighter lukefrowned they were moving fast but not nearly fast enough for any heavenly objectto brighten so rapidly something here make sense 
 impossible for a fighter that small to be this deep in space on its own soloobserved 
 it must have gotten lost been part of a convoy or something lukehypothesized 
 comment was gleeful well he be around long enough to tellanyone about us be on top of him in a minute or two 
 the star ahead continued to brighten its glow evidently coming from within itassumed a circular outline 
 heading for that small moon luke murmured 
 the empire must have an outpost there solo admitted although accordingto the atlas alderaan had no moons he shrugged it off galactic topographywas never one of my best subjects only interested in worlds and moons withcustomers on them but i think i can get him before he gets there almost inrange 
 they drew steadily nearer gradually craters and mountains on the moonbecame visible yet there was something extremely odd about them the craterswere far too regular in outline the mountains far too vertical canyons and valleyimpossibly straight and regularized nothing as capricious as volcanic action hadformed those features 
 no moon kenobi breathed softly a space station 
 but too big to be a space station solo objected the size of it it 
 i have a very strange feeling about this was comment 
 abruptly the usually calm kenobi was shouting turn the ship around out of here 
 yes i think right old man full reverse chewie 
 the wookie started adjusting controls and the freighter seemed to slow arcingaround in a broad curve the tiny fighter leaped instantly toward the monstrousstation until it was swallowed up by its overpowering bulk 
 chewbacca chattered something at solo as the ship shook and strained againstunseen forces 
 lock in auxiliary power solo ordered 
 gauges began to whine in protest and by ones and twos every instrument on thecontrol console sequentially went berserk try as he might solo keep thesurface of the gargantuan station from looming steadily larger it becamethe heavens 
 luke stared wildly at secondary installations as big as mountains dish antennaelarger than all of mos eisley why are we still moving toward it 
 too late kenobi whispered softly a glance at solo confirmed his concern 
 caught in a tractor on i ever saw dragging us pilot muttered 
 you mean nothing you can do luke asked feeling unbelievablyhelpless 
 solo studied the overloaded sensor readouts and shook his head not againstthis kind of power on full power myself kid and not shifting out of coursea fraction of a degree no use going to have to shut down or meltour engines but not going to suck me up like so much dust without a fight 
 he started to vacate the chair but was restrained by an aged yet powerfulhand on his shoulder an expression of concern was on the old suggestion of something somewhat less funereal 
 if a fight you cannot my boy there are always alternatives tofighting 
 the true size of the battle station became apparent as the freighter was pulledcloser and closer running around the equator was an artificial cluster ofmetal mountains docking ports stretching beckoning fingers nearly two kilometersabove the surface 
 now only a miniscule speck against the gray bulk of the station the millenniumfalcon was sucked toward one of those steel pseudopods and finally swallowed by lake of metal closed off the entryway and the freighter vanished as if it had neverexisted 
 vader stared at the motley array of stars displayed on the mapwhile tarkin and admiral motti conferred nearby interestingly the first use of themost powerful destructive machine ever constructed had seemingly had no influenceat all on that map which in itself represented only a tiny fraction of this section of galaxy 
 it would take a microbreakdown of a portion of this map to reveal a slightreduction in spatial mass caused by the disappearance of alderaan alderaan withits many cities farms factories and traitors vader reminded himself 
 despite his advances and intricate technological methods of annihilation theactions of mankind remained unnoticeable to an uncaring unimaginably vast grandest plans ever came to pass all that would change 
 he was well aware that despite all their intelligence and drive the vastness andwonder were lost on the two men who continued to chatter monkeylike behind and motti were talented and ambitious but they saw things only on the scale ofhuman pettiness it was a pity vader thought that they did not possess the scope tomatch their abilities 
 still neither man was a dark lord as such little more could be expected ofthem these two were useful now and dangerous but someday they like have to be swept aside for now he could not afford to ignore them andwhile he would have preferred the company of equals he had to admit reluctantly thatat this point he had no equals 
 nonetheless he turned to them and insinuated himself into their defense systems on alderaan despite the protestations to the as strong as any in the empire i should conclude that our demonstration wasas impressive as it was thorough 
 tarkin turned to him nodding the senate is being informed of our action atthis very moment soon we will be able to announce the extermination of thealliance itself as soon as we have dealt with their main military base now thattheir main source of munitions alderaan has been eliminated the rest of thosesystems with secessionist inclinations will fall in line quickly enough see 
 tarkin turned as an imperial officer entered the chamber yes what is 
 the unlucky officer wore the expression of the mouse chosen to bell the the advance scouts have reached and circumnavigated dantooine theyhave found the remains of a rebel base which they estimate has been deserted forsome time years possibly they are proceeding with an extensive survey of theremainder of the system 
 tarkin turned apoplectic his face darkening to a fine pomegranate fury shelied she lied to us 
 no one could see but it seemed that vader must have smiled behind his we are even in the first exchange of truths i told you she would neverbetray the she thought her confession could somehow destroy us inthe process 
 terminate her immediately the governor was barely able to form words 
 calm yourself tarkin vader advised him you would throw away our onlylink to the real rebel base so casually she can still be of value to us 
 fagh you just said it yourself vader get nothing more out of her that hidden fortress if i have to destroy every star system in this sector 
 a quiet yet demanding beep interrupted him yes what is it he inquiredirritably 
 a voice reported over an unseen speaker sirs captured a smallfreighter that was entering the remains of alderaan a standard check indicates thatits markings apparently match that of the ship which blasted its way out of thequarantine at mos eisley tatooine system and went hyper before the imperialblockade craft there could close on it 
 tarkin looked puzzled mos eisley tatooine what is this thisall about vader 
 it means tarkin that the last of our unresolved difficulties is about to beeliminated someone apparently received the missing data tapes learned whotranscribed them and was trying to return them to her we may be able to facilitatetheir meeting with the senator 
 tarkin started to say something hesitated then nodded in understanding howconvenient i leave this matter in your hands vader 
 the dark lord bowed slightly a gesture which tarkin acknowledged withperfunctory salute then he spun and strode from the room leaving motti lookingfrom man to man in confusion 
 the freighter sat listlessly in the docking hangar of the huge bay thirty armedimperial troopers stood before the lowered man ramp leading into the ship theysnapped to attention when vader and a commander approached vader halted at thebase of the ramp studying the vessel as an officer and several soldiers came forward 
 there was no reply to our repeated signals sir so we activated the ramp fromoutside made no contact with anyone aboard either by communicator or inperson the officer reported 
 send your men in vader ordered 
 turning the officer relayed to command to a noncom who barked orders anumber of the heavily armored soldiers made their way up the ramp and entered theouter hold they advanced with appreciable caution 
 inside two men covered a third as he advanced moving in groups of three inthis fashion they rapidly spread through the ship corridors rang hollowly feet and doors slid aside willingly as they were activated 
 empty the sergeant in charge finally declared in surprise check thecockpit 
 several troopers made their way forward and slid the portal aside only todiscover the chairs as vacant as the rest of the freighter the controls weredeactivated and all systems shut down only a single light on the console winked onand off fitfully the sergeant moved forward recognized the source of the light andactivated the appropriate controls a printout appeared on a nearby screen hestudied it intently then turned to convey the information to his superior who waswaiting by the main hatch 
 that worthy listened carefully before he turned and called down to thecommander and vader there is no one aboard the ship is completely according to the log her crew abandoned ship immediately after set her on automatics for alderaan 
 possibly a decoy the commander ventured aloud then they should still beon tatooine 
 possibly vader admitted reluctantly 
 several of the escape pods have been jettisoned the officer went on 
 did you find any droids on board vader called 
 no if there were any they must have abandoned the ship alongwith the organic crew 
 vader hesitated before replying when he did so uncertainty was evident in hisvoice this feel right send a fully equipped scanning team on board iwant every centimeter of that ship checked out see to it as soon as that he whirled and stalked from the hangar pursued by the infuriating feelingthat he was overlooking something of vital importance 
 the rest of the assembled soldiers were dismissed by the officer on board thefreighter a last long figure left off examining the space beneath the cockpit consolesand ran to join his comrades he was anxious to be off this ghost ship and back inthe comfortable surroundings of the barracks his heavy footsteps echoed throughthe once more empty freighter 
 below the muffled sounds of the officer giving final orders faded leaving theinterior in complete quiet the quivering of a portion of the floor was the onlymovement on board 
 abruptly the quivering became a sharp upheaval two metal panels poppedupward followed by a pair of tousled heads han solo and luke looked aroundquickly then managed to relax a little when it became clear that the ship was as emptyas it sounded 
 lucky built these compartments luke commented 
 solo was not as cheerily confident where did you think i kept the main hold i admit i never expected to smuggle myself in started violently at a sudden sound but it was only another of the panels shiftingaside 
 this is ridiculous it going to work even if i could take off and getpast the closed jabbed a thumb never get past that tractorbeam 
 another panel opened revealing the face of an elderly imp you leave that tome 
 i was afraid say something like that muttered solo a damnfool old man 
 kenobi grinned at him what does that say of the man who allows himself tobe hired by a fool 
 solo muttered something under his breath as they pulled themselves clear of thecompartments chewbacca doing so with a good deal of grunting and twisting 
 two technicians had arrived at the base of the ramp they reported to the twobored soldiers guarding it 
 the all yours one of the troopers told them if the scanners pick upanything report it immediately 
 the men nodded then strained to lug their heavy equipment up the ramp assoon as they disappeared inside a loud crash was heard both guards whirled thenheard a voice call hey down there could you give us a hand with this 
 one trooper looked at his companion who shrugged they both started up theramp muttering at the inefficiency of mere technicians a second crashing soundreverberated but now there was no one left to hear it 
 but the absence of the two troopers was noticed soon thereafter a gantryofficer passing the window of a small command office near the freighter entranceglanced out frowning when he saw no sign of the guards concerned but notalarmed he moved to a comlink and spoke into it as he continued to stare at the ship 
 thx why you at your post thx do you copy 
 the speaker gave back only static 
 thx why you reply the officer was beginning to panic whenan armored figure descended the ramp and waved toward him pointing to theportion of his helmet covering his right ear the figure tapped it to indicate thecomlink inside working 
 shaking his head in disgust the gantry officer gave his busy aide an annoyedlook as he made for the door take over here got another bad going to see what i can do he activated the door took a step forward as it stumbled backward in a state of shock 
 filling the door completely was a towering hairy form chewbacca leanedinward and with a howl flattened the benumbed officer with oneswipe of a fist 
 the aide was already on his feet and reaching for his sidearm when a narrowenergy beam passed completely through him piercing his heart solo flipped up thefaceplate of his trooper helmet then slid it back into place as he followed the wookieinto the room kenobi and the droids squeezed in behind him with luke also cladin the armor of a luckless imperial soldier bringing up the rear 
 luke was looking around nervously as he shut the door behind them betweenhis howling and your blasting everything in sight a wonder the entire know here 
 bring em on solo demanded unreasonably enthused by their success so prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking in a hurry to die luke snapped but not all this sneakingaround has kept us alive 
 the corellian gave luke a sour eye but said nothing 
 they watched as kenobi operated an incredibly complex computer console withthe ease and confidence of one long accustomed to handling intricate machinery ascreen lit up promptly with a map of sections of the battle station the old manleaned forward scrutinizing the display carefully 
 meanwhile threepio and artoo had been going over an equally complicatedcontrol panel nearby artoo suddenly froze and began whistling wildly at somethinghe had found solo and luke their momentary disagreement over tactics over to where the robots were standing chewbacca busied himself hangingthe gentry officer up by his toes 
 plug him in kenobi suggested looking over from his place before the largerreadout he should be able to draw information from the entire station see if he can find out where the tractor beam power unit is located 
 why not just disconnect the beam from here sir luke wanted to know 
 it was solo who replied derisively what and have them lock it right back on usbefore we can get a length outside the docking bay 
 luke looked crestfallen oh i thought of that 
 we have to break the tractor at its power source in order to execute a cleanescape luke old ben chided gently as artoo punched a claw arm into the opencomputer socket he had discovered immediately a galaxy of lights came to life onthe panel in front of him and the room was filled with the hum of machinery workingat high speed 
 several minutes passed while the little droid sucked up information like a metalsponge then the hum slowed and he turned to beep something back at them 
 found it sir threepio announced excitedly 
 the tractor beam is coupled to the main reactors at seven locations most ofthe pertinent data is restricted but try to pull the critical information through tothe monitor 
 kenobi turned his attention from the larger screen to a small readout near began to race across it too fast for luke to see but apparently kenobi somehowmade something of the schematic blur i think any way you boys canhelp with this he told them i must go alone 
 that suits me fine said solo readily already done more than ibargained for on this trip but i think putting that tractor beam out of to take more than your magic old man 
 luke put off so easily i want to go with you 
 be impatient young luke this requires skills you yet and wait for my signal they must be delivered to the rebel forces or manymore worlds will meet the same fate as alderaan trust in the force 
 with a last look at the flow of information on the monitor kenobi adjusted thelightsaber at his waist stepping to the door he slid it aside looked once left onceright and disappeared down a long glowing hallway 
 as soon as he was gone chewbacca growled and solo nodded said it chewie he turned to luke you dig up that old fossil 
 ben a great man luke protested loftily 
 great at getting us into trouble solo snorted general my not going to get us out of here 
 you got any better ideas luke shot back challengingly 
 anything would be better than just waiting here for them to come and pick usup if we 
 a hysterical whistling and hooting came from the computer console lukehurried over to artoo detoo the little droid was all but hopping about on stubbylegs 
 what now luke asked threepio 
 the taller robot looked puzzled himself afraid i understand he says i found her and keeps repeating here here 
 who who has he found 
 artoo turned a flat blinking face toward luke and whistled frantically 
 princess leia the announced after listening carefully senator seem to be one and the same i believe she may be the person in the message hewas carrying 
 that portrait of indescribable beauty coalesced in mindagain the princess here 
 attracted by the commotion solo wandered over princess goingon 
 where where is she luke demanded breathlessly ignoring solocompletely 
 artoo whistled on while threepio translated level five detention block aa according to the information she is scheduled for slow termination 
 no got to do something 
 what are you three blabbering about an exasperated solo demanded 
 the one who programmed the message into artoo detoo luke explainedhurriedly the one we were trying to deliver to alderaan got to help her 
 now just a minute solo cautioned him this is going awful fast for get any funny ideas when i said i have any better ideas i meant old man said to wait here i like it but not going off on some crazymaze through this place 
 but ben know she was here luke half pleaded half argued surethat if he knew he would have changed his plans anxiety turned to if we could just figure a way to get into that detention block 
 solo shook his head and stepped back not going into anyimperial detention blocks 
 if we do something going to execute her a minute ago you saidyou just want to sit here and wait to be captured now all you want to do isstay which is it han 
 the corellian looked confused marching into a not what i had in mind likely to end up there rush it 
 but going to execute her 
 better her than me 
 your sense of chivalry han 
 solo considered near as i can recall i traded it for a chrysopaz andthree bottles of good brandy about five years ago on commenor 
 seen her luke persisted desperately beautiful 
 life 
 a rich and powerful senator luke pressed hoping an appeal to instincts might be more effective if we could save her the reward could besubstantial 
 uhrich then solo looked disdainful wait a minutereward fromwhom from the government on alderaan he made a sweeping gesture towardthe hangar and by implication the space where alderaan had once orbited 
 luke thought furiously if being held here and is scheduled to beexecuted that means she must be dangerous in some way to whoever destroyedalderaan to whoever had this station built you can bet it had something to do withthe empire instituting a reign of full repression 
 tell you pay for her rescue and for the information she holds thesenate the rebel alliance and every concern that did business with alderaan shecould be the sole surviving heir of the wealth of the entire system thereward could be more than you can imagine 
 i knowi can imagine quite a bit he glanced at chewbacca whogrunted a terse reply solo shrugged back at the big wookie all right giveit a try but better be right about that reward your plan kid 
 luke was momentarily taken aback al his energies up till now had beenconcentrated on persuading solo and chewbacca to aid in a rescue attempt thataccomplished luke became aware he had no idea how to proceed he had grownused to old ben and solo giving directions now the next move was up to him 
 his eyes were caught by several metal circlets dangling from the belt of give me those binders and tell chewbacca to come over there 
 solo handed luke the thin but quite unbreakable cuffs and relayed the request tochewbacca the wookie lumbered over and stood waiting next to luke 
 now going to put these on you luke began starting to move behind thewookie with the cuffs and 
 chewbacca made a sound low in his throat and luke jumped in spite of he began again han is going to put these on you and he sheepishlyhanded the binders to solo uncomfortably aware of the enormous eyes on him 
 solo sounded amused as he moved forward worry chewie i think iknow what he has in mind 
 the cuffs barely fit around the thick wrists despite his seemingconfidence in the plan the wookie wore a worried frightened look as the restraintswere activated 
 luke sir luke looked over at threepio pardon me for asking but should artoo and i do if someone discovers us here in your absence 
 hope they have blasters solo replied 
 tone indicated he find the answer humorous that veryreassuring 
 solo and luke were too engrossed in their coming expedition to pay muchattention to the worried robot they adjusted their helmets then with chewbaccawearing a downcast expression they started off along corridor where benkenobi had disappeared

 book one 
 chapter ix 
 
 it was past one when pierre left his friend it was a cloudless northern summer night pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home but the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night it was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night on the way pierre remembered that anatole kuragin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which there was generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind pierre was very fond of 
 i should like to go to thought he 
 but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go there then as happens to people of weak character he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go the thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to prince andrew was of no account because before he gave it he had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering besides thought he all such words of honor are conventional things with no definite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions he went to 
 reaching the large house near the horse guards barracks in which anatole lived pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairs and went in at the open door there was no one in the anteroom empty bottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell of alcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance 
 cards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersed pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were the remains of supper a footman thinking no one saw him was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses from the third room came sounds of laughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear and general commotion some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window three others were romping with a young bear one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others 
 i bet a hundred on stevens shouted one 
 mind no holding on cried another 
 i bet on dolokhov cried a third kuragin you part our hands 
 there leave bruin alone a bet on 
 at one draught or he loses shouted a fourth 
 jacob bring a bottle shouted the host a tall handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group without a coat and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front wait a bit you fellows here is petya good man cried he addressing pierre 
 another voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring cried from the window come here part the bets this was dolokhov an officer of the semenov regiment a notorious gambler and duelist who was living with anatole pierre smiled looking about him merrily 
 i understand it all about 
 wait a bit he is not drunk yet a bottle here said anatole taking a glass from the table he went up to pierre 
 first of all you must drink 
 pierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listening to their chatter anatole kept on refilling glass while explaining that dolokhov was betting with stevens an english naval officer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out 
 go on you must drink it all said anatole giving pierre the last glass or i let you go 
 no i said pierre pushing anatole aside and he went up to the window 
 dolokhov was holding the hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet addressing himself particularly to anatole and pierre 
 dolokhov was of medium height with curly hair and eyes he was about like all infantry officers he wore no mustache so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearly seen the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved the middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections yet though anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them including anatole himself respected him more than they did anatole dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won however much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness both kuragin and dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of petersburg 
 the bottle of rum was brought the window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around 
 anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window he wanted to smash something pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame but could not move it he smashed a pane 
 you have a try hercules said he turning to pierre 
 pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash 
 take it right out or think holding on said dolokhov 
 is the englishman bragging eh is it all right said anatole 
 said pierre looking at dolokhov who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window from which the light of the sky the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible 
 dolokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the window sill listen cried he standing there and addressing those in the room all were silent 
 i bet fifty imperials he spoke french that the englishman might understand him but he did not speak it very well i bet fifty imperials or do you wish to make it a hundred added he addressing the englishman 
 no fifty replied the latter 
 all right fifty imperials that i will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on this spot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window and without holding on to anything is that right 
 quite right said the englishman 
 anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him the englishman was short began repeating the terms of the wager to him in english 
 wait cried dolokhov hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention wait a bit kuragin listen if anyone else does the same i will pay him a hundred imperials do you understand 
 the englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not anatole did not release him and though he kept nodding to show that he understood anatole went on translating words into english a thin young lad an hussar of the life guards who had been losing that evening climbed on the window sill leaned over and looked down 
 oh oh oh he muttered looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement 
 shut up cried dolokhov pushing him away from the window the lad jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spurs 
 placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then to the left and took up the bottle anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill though it was already quite light back in his white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both sides everyone crowded to the window the englishman in front pierre stood smiling but silent one man older than the others present suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of shirt 
 i say this is folly be killed said this more sensible man 
 anatole stopped him 
 touch him startle him and then be killed eh what then eh 
 dolokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arranged himself on his seat 
 if anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips i will throw him down there now then 
 saying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle and lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free hand to balance himself one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from back anatole stood erect with staring eyes the englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips the man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall pierre hid his face from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear all were still pierre took his hands from his eyes dolokhov still sat in the same position only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back why is it so long thought pierre it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed suddenly dolokhov made a backward movement with his spine and his arm trembled nervously this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge as he began slipping down his head and arm wavered still more with the strain one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill but refrained from touching it pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never never them again suddenly he was aware of a stir all around he looked up dolokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale but radiant face 
 empty 
 he threw the bottle to the englishman who caught it neatly dolokhov jumped down he smelt strongly of rum 
 well done fine fellow a bet for you devil take you came from different sides 
 the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak pierre jumped upon the window sill 
 gentlemen who wishes to bet with me do the same thing he suddenly cried even without a bet there tell them to bring me a bottle do it bring a bottle 
 let him do it let him do it said dolokhov smiling 
 what next have you gone mad no one would let you why you go giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voices 
 drink it have a bottle of rum shouted pierre banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window 
 they seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying 
 no never manage him that way said anatole wait a bit and get round him listen take your bet tomorrow but now we are all going to s 
 come on then cried pierre come on and take bruin with us 
 and he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the ground and began dancing round the room with it

 chapter 
 
 on the morning of a fine june day my first bonny little nursling and the last of the ancient earnshaw stock was born we were busy with the hay in a far away field when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts came running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane calling me as she ran 
 oh such a grand bairn she panted out the finest lad that ever breathed but the doctor says missis must go he says been in a consumption these many months i heard him tell mr hindley and now she has nothing to keep her and be dead before winter you must come home directly to nurse it nelly to feed it with sugar and milk and take care of it day and night i wish i were you because it will be all yours when there is no missis 
 but is she very ill i asked flinging down my rake and tying my bonnet 
 i guess she is yet she looks bravely replied the girl and she talks as if she thought of living to see it grow a man out of her head for joy such a beauty if i were her certain i should not die i should get better at the bare sight of it in spite of kenneth i was fairly mad at him dame archer brought the cherub down to master in the house and his face just began to light up then the old croaker steps forward and says he earnshaw a blessing your wife has been spared to leave you this son when she came i felt convinced we keep her long and now i must tell you the winter will probably finish her take on and fret about it too much it be helped and besides you should have known better than to choose such a rush of a lass 
 and what did the master answer i inquired 
 i think he swore but i mind him i was straining to see the bairn and she began again to describe it rapturously i as zealous as herself hurried eagerly home to admire on my part though i was very sad for sake he had room in his heart only for two wife and himself he doted on both and adored one and i conceive how he would bear the loss 
 when we got to wuthering heights there he stood at the front door and as i passed in i asked how was the baby 
 nearly ready to run about nell he replied putting on a cheerful smile 
 and the mistress i ventured to inquire the doctor says 
 damn the doctor he interrupted reddening frances is quite right be perfectly well by this time next week are you going upstairs will you tell her that come if promise not to talk i left her because she would not hold her tongue and she her mr kenneth says she must be quiet 
 i delivered this message to mrs earnshaw she seemed in flighty spirits and replied merrily 
 i hardly spoke a word there he has gone out twice crying well say i promise i speak but that does not bind me not to laugh at him 
 poor soul till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed her and her husband persisted doggedly nay furiously in affirming her health improved every day when kenneth warned him that his medicines were useless at that stage of the malady and he put him to further expense by attending her he retorted 
 i know you need does not want any more attendance from you she never was in a consumption it was a fever and it is gone her pulse is as slow as mine now and her cheek as cool 
 he told his wife the same story and she seemed to believe him but one night while leaning on his shoulder in the act of saying she thought she should be able to get up tomorrow a fit of coughing took very slight raised her in his arms she put her two hands about his neck her face changed and she was dead 
 as the girl had anticipated the child hareton fell wholly into my hands mr earnshaw provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry was contented as far as regarded him for himself he grew desperate his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament he neither wept nor prayed he cursed and defied execrated god and man and gave himself up to reckless dissipation the servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long joseph and i were the only two that would stay i had not the heart to leave my charge and besides you know i had been his and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger would joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers and because it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove 
 the bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for catherine and heathcliff his treatment of the latter was enough to make a fiend of a saint and truly it appeared as if the lad were possessed of something diabolical at that period he delighted to witness hindley degrading himself past redemption and became daily more notable for savage sullenness and ferocity i could not half tell what an infernal house we had the curate dropped calling and nobody decent came near us at last unless edgar visits to miss cathy might be an exception at fifteen she was the queen of the countryside she had no peer and she did turn out a haughty headstrong creature i own i did not like her after her infancy was past and i vexed her frequently by trying to bring down her arrogance she never took an aversion to me though she had a wondrous constancy to old attachments even heathcliff kept his hold on her affections unalterably and young linton with all his superiority found it difficult to make an equally deep impression he was my late master that is his portrait over the fireplace it used to hang on one side and his on the other but hers has been removed or else you might see something of what she was can you make that out 
 mrs dean raised the candle and i discerned a face exceedingly resembling the young lady at the heights but more pensive and amiable in expression it formed a sweet picture the long light hair curled slightly on the temples the eyes were large and serious the figure almost too graceful i did not marvel how catherine earnshaw could forget her first friend for such an individual i marvelled much how he with a mind to correspond with his person could fancy my idea of catherine earnshaw 
 a very agreeable portrait i observed to the housekeeper is it like 
 yes she answered but he looked better when he was animated that is his everyday countenance he wanted spirit in general 
 catherine had kept up her acquaintance with the lintons since her five weeks residence among them and as she had no temptation to show her rough side in their company and had the sense to be ashamed of being rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy she imposed unwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality gained the admiration of isabella and the heart and soul of her brother acquisitions that flattered her from the first for she was full of ambition and led her to adopt a double character without exactly intending to deceive anyone in the place where she heard heathcliff termed a vulgar young ruffian and worse than a brute she took care not to act like him but at home she had small inclination to practise politeness that would only be laughed at and restrain an unruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise mr edgar seldom mustered courage to visit wuthering heights openly he had a terror of reputation and shrunk from encountering him and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility the master himself avoided offending him knowing why he came and if he could not be gracious kept out of the way i rather think his appearance there was distasteful to catherine she was not artful never played the coquette and had evidently an objection to her two friends meeting at all for when heathcliff expressed contempt of linton in his presence she could not half coincide as she did in his absence and when linton evinced disgust and antipathy to heathcliff she dared not treat his sentiments with indifference as if depreciation of her playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her had many a laugh at her perplexities and untold troubles which she vainly strove to hide from my mockery that sounds but she was so proud it became really impossible to pity her distresses till she should be chastened into more humility she did bring herself finally to confess and confide in me there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an adviser 
 mr hindley had gone from home one afternoon and heathcliff presumed to give himself a holiday on the strength of it he had reached the age of sixteen then i think and without having bad features or being deficient in intellect he contrived to convey an impression of inward and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of in the first place he had by that time lost the benefit of his early education continual hard work begun soon and concluded late had extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge and any love for books or learning his sense of superiority instilled into him by the favours of old mr earnshaw was faded away he struggled long to keep up an equality with catherine in her studies and yielded with poignant though silent regret but he yielded completely and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving upward when he found he must necessarily sink beneath his former level then personal appearance sympathized with mental deterioration he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look his naturally reserved disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable moroseness and he took a grim pleasure apparently in exciting the aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance 
 catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite from labour but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses as if conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of affection on him on the occasion he came into the house to announce his intention of doing nothing while i was assisting miss cathy to arrange her dress she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head to be idle and imagining she would have the whole place to herself she managed by some means to inform mr edgar of her absence and was then preparing to receive him 
 cathy are you busy this afternoon asked heathcliff are you going anywhere 
 no it is raining she answered 
 why have you that silk frock on then he said nobody coming here i hope 
 not that i know of stammered miss but you should be in the field now heathcliff it is an hour past dinner time i thought you were gone 
 hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence observed the boy not work any more today stay with you 
 oh but joseph will tell she suggested better go 
 joseph is loading lime on the farther side of pennistow crag it will take him till dark and never know 
 so saying he lounged to the fire and sat down catherine reflected an instant with knitted found it needful to smooth the way for an intrusion isabella and edgar linton talked of calling this afternoon she said at the conclusion of a silence as it rains i hardly expect them but they may come and if they do you run the risk of being scolded for no good 
 order ellen to say you are engaged cathy he persisted turn me out for those pitiful silly friends of yours on the point sometimes of complaining that not 
 that they what cried catherine gazing at him with a troubled countenance oh nelly she added petulantly jerking her head away from my hands combed my hair quite out of curl enough let me alone what are you on the point of complaining about heathcliff 
 look at the almanac on that wall he pointed to a framed sheet hanging near the window and crosses are for the evenings you have spent with the lintons the dots for those spent with me do you see marked every day 
 foolish as if i took notice replied catherine in a peevish tone and where is the sense of that 
 to show that i do take notice said heathcliff 
 and should i always be sitting with you she demanded growing more irritated what good do i get what do you talk about you might be dumb or a baby for anything you say to amuse me or for anything you do either 
 you never told me before that i talked too little or that you disliked my company cathy exclaimed heathcliff in much agitation 
 no company at all when people know nothing and say nothing she muttered 
 her companion rose up but he time to express his feelings further for a feet were heard on the flags and having knocked gently young linton entered his face brilliant with delight at the unexpected summons he had received doubtless catherine marked the difference between her friends as one came in and the other went out the contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak hilly coal country for a beautiful fertile valley and his voice and greeting were as opposite as his aspect 
 he had a sweet low manner of speaking and pronounced his words as you do less gruff than we talk here and softer 
 not come too soon am i he said casting a look at me i had begun to wipe the plate and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser 
 no answered catherine what are you doing there nelly 
 my work miss i replied mr hindley had given me directions to make a third parry in any private visits linton chose to pay 
 she stepped behind me and whispered crossly take yourself and your dusters off when company are in the house servants commence scouring and cleaning in the room where they are 
 a good opportunity now that the master is away i answered aloud he hates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence sure mr edgar will excuse me 
 i hate you to be fidgeting in my presence exclaimed the young lady imperiously not allowing her guest time to speak she had failed to recover her equanimity since the little dispute with heathcliff 
 sorry for it miss catherine was my response and i proceeded assiduously with my occupation 
 she supposing edgar could not see her snatched the cloth from my hand and pinched me with a prolonged wrench very spitefully on the arm said i did not love her and rather relished mortifying her vanity now and then besides she hurt me extremely so i started up from my knees and screamed out oh miss a nasty trick you have no right to nip me and not going to bear it 
 i touch you you lying creature cried she her fingers tingling to repeat the act and her ears red with rage she never had power to conceal her passion it always set her whole complexion in a blaze 
 that then i retorted showing a decided purple witness to refute her 
 she stamped her foot wavered a moment and then irresistibly impelled by the naughty spirit within her slapped me on the cheek a stinging blow that filled both eyes with water 
 catherine love catherine interposed linton greatly shocked at the double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed 
 leave the room ellen she repeated trembling all over 
 little hareton who followed me everywhere and was sitting near me on the floor at seeing my tears commenced crying himself and sobbed out complaints against wicked aunt cathy which drew her fury on to his unlucky head she seized his shoulders and shook him till the poor child waxed livid and edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver him in an instant one was wrung free and the astonished young man felt it applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest he drew back in consternation i lifted hareton in my arms and walked off to the kitchen with him leaving the door of communication open for i was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement the insulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat pale and with a quivering lip 
 right i said to myself take warning and begone a kindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition 
 where are you going demanded catherine advancing to the door 
 he swerved aside and attempted to pass 
 you must not go she exclaimed energetically 
 i must and shall he replied in a subdued voice 
 no she persisted grasping the handle not yet edgar linton sit down you shall not leave me in that temper i should be miserable all night and i be miserable for you 
 can i stay after you have struck me asked linton catherine was mute 
 made me afraid and ashamed of you he continued not come here again 
 her eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle and you told a deliberate untruth he said 
 i she cried recovering her speech i did nothing deliberately well go if you away and now cry myself sick 
 she dropped down on her knees by a chair and set to weeping in serious earnest edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court there he lingered i resolved to encourage him 
 miss is dreadfully wayward sir i called out as bad as any marred child better be riding home or else she will be sick only to grieve us 
 the soft thing looked askance through the window he possessed the power to depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half killed or a bird half eaten ah i thought there will be no saving him doomed and flies to his fate and so it was he turned abruptly hastened into the house again shut the door behind him and when i went in a while after to inform them that earnshaw had come home rabid drunk ready to pull the whole place about our ears his ordinary frame of mind in that condition i saw the quarrel had merely effected a closer intimacy had broken the outworks of youthful timidity and enabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship and confess themselves lovers 
 intelligence of mr arrival drove linton speedily to his horse and catherine to her chamber i went to hide little hareton and to take the shot out of the which he was fond of playing with in his insane excitement to the hazard of the lives of any who provoked or even attracted his notice too much and i had hit upon the plan of removing it that he might do less mischief if he did go the length of firing the gun

 chapter nine 
 
 i do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that those children should have the measles just now said meg one april day as she stood packing the go abroady trunk in her room surrounded by her sisters 
 and so nice of annie moffat not to forget her promise a whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid replied jo looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms 
 and such lovely weather so glad of that added beth tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box lent for the great occasion 
 i wish i was going to have a fine time and wear all these nice things said amy with her mouth full of pins as she artistically replenished her cushion 
 i wish you were all going but as you i shall keep my adventures to tell you when i come back sure the least i can do when you have been so kind lending me things and helping me get ready said meg glancing round the room at the very simple outfit which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes 
 what did mother give you out of the treasure box asked amy who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which mrs march kept a few relics of past splendor as gifts for her girls when the proper time came 
 a pair of silk stockings that pretty carved fan and a lovely blue sash i wanted the violet silk but there time to make it over so i must be contented with my old tarlatan 
 it will look nice over my new muslin skirt and the sash will set it off beautifully i wish i smashed my coral bracelet for you might have had it said jo who loved to give and lend but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use 
 there is a lovely pearl set in the treasure chest but mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl and laurie promised to send me all i want replied meg now let me see my new gray walking suit just curl up the feather in my hat beth then my poplin for sunday and the small party it looks heavy for spring it the violet silk would be so nice oh dear 
 never mind got the tarlatan for the big party and you always look like an angel in white said amy brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted 
 it and it sweep enough but it will have to do my blue housedress looks so well turned and freshly trimmed that i feel as if got a new one my silk sacque a bit the fashion and my bonnet look like i like to say anything but i was sadly disappointed in my umbrella i told mother black with a white handle but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle strong and neat so i ought not to complain but i know i shall feel ashamed of it beside silk one with a gold top sighed meg surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor 
 change it advised jo 
 i be so silly or hurt feelings when she took so much pains to get my things a nonsensical notion of mine and not going to give up to it my silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort you are a dear to lend me yours jo i feel so rich and sort of elegant with two new pairs and the old ones cleaned up for common and meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box annie moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps would you put some on mine she asked as beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins fresh from hands 
 no i for the smart caps match the plain gowns without any trimming on them poor folks rig said jo decidedly 
 i wonder if i shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps said meg impatiently 
 you said the other day that be perfectly happy if you could only go to annie observed beth in her quiet way 
 so i did well i am happy and i fret but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants it there now the trays are ready and everything in but my ball dress which i shall leave for mother to pack said meg cheering up as she glanced from the trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlatan which she called her ball dress with an important air 
 the next day was fine and meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure mrs march had consented to the visit rather reluctantly fearing that margaret would come back more discontented than she went but she begged so hard and sallie had promised to take good care of her and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life 
 the moffats were very fashionable and simple meg was rather daunted at first by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants but they were kindly people in spite of the frivolous life they led and soon put their guest at her ease perhaps meg felt without understanding why that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made it certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously drive in a fine carriage wear her best frock every day and do nothing but enjoy herself it suited her exactly and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her to put on little airs and graces use french phrases crimp her hair take in her dresses and talk about the fashions as well as she could the more she saw of annie pretty things the more she envied her and sighed to be rich home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it work grew harder than ever and she felt that she was a very destitute and girl in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings 
 she had not much time for repining however for the three young girls were busily employed in having a good time they shopped walked rode and called all day went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening for annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them her older sisters were very fine young ladies and one was engaged which was extremely interesting and romantic meg thought mr moffat was a fat jolly old gentleman who knew her father and mrs moffat a fat jolly old lady who took as great a fancy to meg as her daughter had done everyone petted her and daisey as they called her was in a fair way to have her head turned 
 when the evening for the small party came she found that the poplin do at all for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed so out came the tarlatan looking older limper and shabbier than ever beside crisp new one meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another and her cheeks began to burn for with all her gentleness she was very proud no one said a word about it but sallie offered to dress her hair and annie to tie her sash and belle the engaged sister praised her white arms but in their kindness meg saw only pity for her poverty and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself while the others laughed chattered and flew about like gauzy butterflies the hard bitter feeling was getting pretty bad when the maid brought in a box of flowers before she could speak annie had the cover off and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses heath and fern within 
 for belle of course george always sends her some but these are altogether ravishing cried annie with a great sniff 
 they are for miss march the man said and a note put in the maid holding it to meg 
 what fun who are they from know you had a lover cried the girls fluttering about meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise 
 the note is from mother and the flowers from laurie said meg simply yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her 
 oh indeed said annie with a funny look as meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy vanity and false pride for the few loving words had done her good and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty 
 feeling almost happy again she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts hair or skirts of her friends offering them so prettily that clara the elder sister told her she was the sweetest little thing she ever saw and they looked quite charmed with her small attention somehow the kind act finished her despondency and when all the rest went to show themselves to mrs moffat she saw a happy face in the mirror as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that strike her as so very shabby now 
 she enjoyed herself very much that evening for she danced to her content everyone was very kind and she had three compliments annie made her sing and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice major lincoln asked who the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes was and mr moffat insisted on dancing with her because she dawdle but had some spring in her as he gracefully expressed it so altogether she had a very nice time till she overheard a bit of conversation which disturbed her extremely she was sitting just inside the conservatory waiting for her partner to bring her an ice when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall 
 how old is he 
 sixteen or seventeen i should say replied another voice 
 it would be a grand thing for one of those girls it sallie says they are very intimate now and the old man quite dotes on them 
 mrs m has made her plans i dare say and will play her cards well early as it is the girl evidently think of it yet said mrs moffat 
 she told that fib about her momma as if she did know and colored up when the flowers came quite prettily poor thing be so nice if she was only got up in style do you think be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for thursday asked another voice 
 proud but i believe mind for that dowdy tarlatan is all she has got she may tear it tonight and that will be a good excuse for offering a decent one 
 here partner appeared to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated she was proud and her pride was useful just then for it helped her hide her mortification anger and disgust at what she had just heard for innocent and unsuspicious as she was she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends she tried to forget it but could not and kept repeating to herself mrs m has made her plans that fib about her mamma and dowdy tarlatan till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice as that was impossible she did her best to seem gay and being rather excited she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making she was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears those foolish yet well meant words had opened a new world to meg and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child her innocent friendship with laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by mrs moffat who judged others by herself and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven 
 poor meg had a restless night and got up unhappy half resentful toward her friends and half ashamed of herself for not speaking out frankly and setting everything right everybody dawdled that morning and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work something in the manner of her friends struck meg at once they treated her with more respect she thought took quite a tender interest in what she said and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed curiosity all this surprised and flattered her though she did not understand it till miss belle looked up from her writing and said with a sentimental air 
 daisy dear sent an invitation to your friend mr laurence for thursday we should like to know him and only a proper compliment to you 
 meg colored but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely you are very kind but afraid he come 
 why not cherie asked miss belle 
 too old 
 my child what do you mean what is his age i beg to know cried miss clara 
 nearly seventy i believe answered meg counting stitches to hide the merriment in her eyes 
 you sly creature of course we meant the young man exclaimed miss belle laughing 
 there any laurie is only a little boy and meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed you age nan said 
 nearer my sister i am seventeen in august returned meg tossing her head 
 very nice of him to send you flowers it said annie looking wise about nothing 
 yes he often does to all of us for their house is full and we are so fond of them my mother and old mr laurence are friends you know so it is quite natural that we children should play together and meg hoped they would say no more 
 evident daisy out yet said miss clara to belle with a nod 
 quite a pastoral state of innocence all round returned miss belle with a shrug 
 going out to get some little matters for my girls can i do anything for you young ladies asked mrs moffat lumbering in like an elephant in silk and lace 
 no thank you replied sallie got my new pink silk for thursday and want a thing 
 nor i began meg but stopped because it occurred to her that she did want several things and could not have them 
 what shall you wear asked sallie 
 my old white one again if i can mend it fit to be seen it got sadly torn last night said meg trying to speak quite easily but feeling very uncomfortable 
 why you send home for another said sallie who was not an observing young lady 
 i got any other it cost meg an effort to say that but sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise only that how funny she did not finish her speech for belle shook her head at her and broke in saying kindly 
 not at all where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she out yet no need of sending home daisy even if you had a dozen for got a sweet blue silk laid away which outgrown and you shall wear it to please me you dear 
 you are very kind but i mind my old dress if you it does well enough for a little girl like me said meg 
 now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style i admire to do it and be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there i let anyone see you till you are done and then burst upon them like cinderella and her godmother going to the ball said belle in her persuasive tone 
 meg refuse the offer so kindly made for a desire to see if she would be a little beauty after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the moffats 
 on the thursday evening belle shut herself up with her maid and between them they turned meg into a fine lady they crimped and curled her hair they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder and hortense would have added a soupcon of rouge if meg had not rebelled they laced her into a dress which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest meg blushed at herself in the mirror a set of silver filagree was added bracelets necklace brooch and even earrings for hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show a cluster of buds at the bosom and a ruche reconciled meg to the display of her pretty white shoulders and a pair of silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart a lace handkerchief a plumy fan and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off and miss belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll 
 mademoiselle is chatmante tres jolie is she not cried hortense clasping her hands in an affected rapture 
 come and show yourself said miss belle leading the way to the room where the others were waiting 
 as meg went rustling after with her long skirts trailing her earrings tinkling her curls waving and her heart beating she felt as if her fun had really begun at last for the mirror had plainly told her that she was a little beauty her friends repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically and for several minutes she stood like a jackdaw in the fable enjoying her borrowed plumes while the rest chattered like a party of magpies 
 while i dress do you drill her nan in the management of her skirt and those french heels or she will trip herself up take your silver butterfly and catch up that long curl on the left side of her head clara and any of you disturb the charming work of my hands said belle as she hurried away looking well pleased with her success 
 you look a bit like yourself but you are very nice nowhere beside you for belle has heaps of taste and quite french i assure you let your flowers hang be so careful of them and be sure you trip returned sallie trying not to care that meg was prettier than herself 
 keeping that warning carefully in mind margaret got safely downstairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the moffats and a few early guests were assembled she very soon discovered that there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class of people and secures their respect several young ladies who had taken no notice of her before were very affectionate all of a sudden several young gentlemen who had only stared at her at the other party now not only stared but asked to be introduced and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her and several old ladies who sat on the sofas and criticized the rest of the party inquired who she was with an air of interest she heard mrs moffat reply to one of them 
 daisy a colonel in the of our first families but reverses of fortune you know intimate friends of the laurences sweet creature i assure you my ned is quite wild about her 
 dear me said the old lady putting up her glass for another observation of meg who tried to look as if she had not heard and been rather shocked at mrs fibs the queer feeling did not pass away but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well though the tight dress gave her a the train kept getting under her feet and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken she was flirting her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman who tried to be witty when she suddenly stopped laughing and looked confused for just opposite she saw laurie he was staring at her with undisguised surprise and disapproval also she thought for though he bowed and smiled yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on to complete her confusion she saw belle nudge annie and both glance from her to laurie who she was happy to see looked unusually boyish and shy 
 silly creatures to put such thoughts into my head i care for it or let it change me a bit thought meg and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend 
 glad you came i was afraid you she said with her most air 
 jo wanted me to come and tell her how you looked so i did answered laurie without turning his eyes upon her though he half smiled at her maternal tone 
 what shall you tell her asked meg full of curiosity to know his opinion of her yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time 
 i shall say i know you for you look so and unlike yourself quite afraid of you he said fumbling at his glove button 
 how absurd of you the girls dressed me up for fun and i rather like it jo stare if she saw me said meg bent on making him say whether he thought her improved or not 
 yes i think she would returned laurie gravely 
 you like me so asked meg 
 no i was the blunt reply 
 why not in an anxious tone 
 he glanced at her frizzled head bare shoulders and fantastically trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than his answer which had not particle of his usual politeness in it 
 i like fuss and feathers 
 that was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself and meg walked away saying petulantly you are the rudest boy i ever saw 
 feeling very much ruffled she went and stood at a quiet window to cool her cheeks for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably brilliant color as she stood there major lincoln passed by and a minute after she heard him saying to his mother 
 they are making a fool of that little girl i wanted you to see her but they have spoiled her entirely nothing but a doll tonight 
 oh dear sighed meg i wish been sensible and worn my own things then i should not have disgusted other people or felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself 
 she leaned her forehead on the cool pane and stood half hidden by the curtains never minding that her favorite waltz had begun till some one touched her and turning she saw laurie looking penitent as he said with his very best bow and his hand out 
 please forgive my rudeness and come and dance with me 
 afraid it will be to disagreeable to you said meg trying to look offended and failing entirely 
 not a bit of it dying to do it come be good i like your gown but i do think you are just splendid and he waved his hands as if words failed to express his admiration meg smiled and relented and whispered as they stood waiting to catch the time take care my skirt trip you up the plague of my life and i was a goose to wear it 
 pin it round your neck and then it will be useful said laurie looking down at the little blue boots which he evidently approved of away they went fleetly and gracefully for having practiced at home they were well matched and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see as they twirled merrily round and round feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff 
 laurie i want you to do me a favor will you said meg as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out which it did very soon though she would not own why 
 i said laurie with alacrity 
 please tell them at home about my dress tonight 
 they understand the joke and it will worry mother 
 then why did you do it said eyes so plainly that meg hastily added 
 i shall tell them myself all about it and fess to mother how silly been but rather do it myself so not tell will you 
 i give you my word i only what shall i say when they ask me 
 just say i looked pretty well and was having a good time 
 say the first with all my heart but how about the other you look as if you were having a good time are you and laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper 
 no not just now think horrid i only wanted a little fun but this sort pay i find and getting tired of it 
 here comes ned moffat what does he want said laurie knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host in the light of a pleasant addition to the party 
 he put his name down for three dances and i suppose coming for them what a bore said meg assuming a languid air which amused laurie immensely 
 he did not speak to her again till suppertime when he saw her drinking champagne with ned and his friend fisher who were behaving like a pair of fools as laurie said to himself for he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the marches and fight their battles whenever a defender was needed 
 have a splitting headache tomorrow if you drink much of that i meg your mother like it you know he whispered leaning over her chair as ned turned to refill her glass and fisher stooped to pick up her fan 
 not meg tonight a doll who does all sorts of crazy things tomorrow i shall put away my fuss and feathers and be desperately good again se answered with an affected little laugh 
 wish tomorrow was here then muttered laurie walking off at the change he saw in her 
 meg danced and flirted chattered and giggled as the other girls did after supper she undertook the german and blundered through it nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt and romping in a way that scandalized laurie who looked on and meditated a lecture but he got no chance to deliver it for meg kept away from him till he came to say good night 
 remember she said trying to smile for the splitting headache had already begun 
 silence a la mort replied laurie with a melodramatic flourish as he went away 
 this little bit of byplay excited curiosity but meg was too tired for gossip and went to bed feeling as if she had been to a masquerade and enjoyed herself as much as she expected she was sick all the next day and on saturday went home quite used up with her fun and feeling that she had sat in the lap of luxury long enough 
 it does seem pleasant to be quiet and not have company manners on all the time home is a nice place though it splendid said meg looking about her with a restful expression as she sat with her mother and jo on the sunday evening 
 glad to hear you say so dear for i was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters replied her mother who had given her many anxious looks that day for motherly eyes are quick to see any change in faces 
 meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what a charming time she had had but something still seemed to weigh upon her spirits and when the younger girls were gone to bed she sat thoughtfully staring at the fire saying little and looking worried as the clock struck nine and jo proposed bed meg suddenly left her chair and taking stool leaned her elbows on her knee saying bravely 
 marmee i want to fess 
 i thought so what is it dear 
 shall i go away asked jo discreetly 
 of course not i always tell you everything i was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children but i want you to know all the dreadful things i did at the moffats 
 we are prepared said mrs march smiling but looking a little anxious 
 i told you they dressed me up but i tell you that they powdered and squeezed and frizzled and made me look like a fashion plate laurie thought i proper i know he did though he say so and one man called me a doll i knew it was silly but they flattered me and said i was a beauty and quantities of nonsense so i let them make a fool of me 
 is that all asked jo as mrs march looked silently at the downcast face of her pretty daughter and could not find it in her heart to blame her little follies 
 no i drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt and was altogether abominable said meg 
 there is something more i think and mrs march smoothed the soft cheek which suddenly grew rosy as meg answered slowly 
 yes very silly but i want to tell it because i hate to have people say and think such things about us and laurie 
 then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the moffats and as she spoke jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into innocent mind 
 well if that the greatest rubbish i ever heard cried jo indignantly why you pop out and tell them so on the spot 
 i it was so embarrassing for me i help hearing at first and then i was so angry and ashamed i remember that i ought to go away 
 just wait till i see annie moffat and show you how to settle such ridiculous stuff the idea of having plans and being kind to laurie because rich and may marry us he shout when i tell him what those silly things say about us poor children and jo laughed as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke 
 if you tell laurie never forgive you she must she mother said meg looking distressed 
 no never repeat that foolish gossip and forget it as soon as you can said mrs march gravely i was very unwise to let you go among people of whom i know so little kind i dare say but worldly and full of these vulgar ideas about young people i am more sorry than i can express for the mischief this visit may have done you meg 
 be sorry i let it hurt me forget all the bad and remember only the good for i did enjoy a great deal and thank you very much for letting me go not be sentimental or dissatisfied mother i know a silly little girl and stay with you till fit to take care of myself but it is nice to be praised and admired and i help saying i like it said meg looking half ashamed of the confession 
 that is perfectly natural and quite harmless if the liking does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly things learn to know and value the praise which is worth having and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty meg 
 margaret sat thinking a moment while jo stood with her hands behind her looking both interested and a little perplexed for it was a new thing to see meg blushing and talking about admiration lovers and things of that sort and jo felt as if during that fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly and was drifting away from her into a world where she could not follow 
 mother do you have plans as mrs moffat said asked meg bashfully 
 yes my dear i have a great many all mothers do but mine differ somewhat from mrs i suspect i will tell you some of them for the time has come when a word may set this romantic little head and heart of yours right on a very serious subject you are young meg but not too young to understand me and mothers lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls like you jo your turn will come in time perhaps so listen to my plans and help me carry them out if they are good 
 jo went and sat on one arm of the chair looking as if she thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair holding a hand of each and watching the two young faces wistfully mrs march said in her serious yet cheery way 
 i want my daughters to be beautiful accomplished and good to be admired loved and respected to have a happy youth to be well and wisely married and to lead useful pleasant lives with as little care and sorrow to try them as god sees fit to send to be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman and i sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience it is natural to think of it meg right to hope and wait for it and wise to prepare for it so that when the happy time comes you may feel ready for the duties and worthy of the joy my dear girls i am ambitious for you but not to have you make a dash in the world marry rich men merely because they are rich or have splendid houses which are not homes because love is wanting money is a needful and precious thing and when well used a noble thing but i never want you to think it is the first or only prize to strive for rather see you poor wives if you were happy beloved contented than queens on thrones without and peace 
 poor girls stand any chance belle says unless they put themselves forward sighed meg 
 then be old maids said jo stoutly right jo better be happy old maids than unhappy wives or unmaidenly girls running about to find husbands said mrs march decidedly be troubled meg poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover some of the best and most honored women i know were poor girls but so that they were not allowed to be old maids leave these things to time make this home happy so that you may be fit for homes of your own if they are offered you and contented here if they are not one thing remember my girls mother is always ready to be your confidante father to be your friend and both of hope and trust that our daughters whether married or single will be the pride and comfort of out lives 
 we will marmee we will cried both with all their hearts as she bade them good night

 a partially decayed hand reaches down and takes the sacred 
 canopic jar out of the shriveled hand 
 imhotep having regenerated even further he looks up and 
 catches eyes with imhotep grins then unhinges his 
 jaw his mouth stretches to an inhuman size and then a huge 
 swarm of flies comes out of his mouth and races straight up

 sucked out of him then he collapses to the floor on the 
 wall above him the shadow of the swirling sand condenses 
 forming a shadow of a human body the shadow convulses as the

 giovanni 
 ah double my money eh you tell me you want double my money joe 
 waving his hand up at him reassuring him 
 tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow that way 
 
 repeating to himself after joe has walked past 
 eh tomorrow 
 
 ann walks out onto the busy city street dodging a motorbike as she arrives from a she looks out fascinated at all the activity momentarily intimidated but then venturing out confidently as she enjoys the bustle of the city around her 
 joe peers down the street after her running between the people in order to keep within sight he follows her into a market as ann wanders along taking her time just enjoying herself she walks past several vendors offering her their goods 
 as ann stops to look at a stall joe has to back off and is instantly targetted by the nearest vendor who offers him some of his huge melons he shakes his head at him more interested in keeping an eye on ann who tries on a pair of shoes at the stall then pays the woman vendor for them vendor persists and joe finally buys the melon off him which at once quietens him down so carrying the melon he follows ann down to another street where she stops looking out at the fontana di trevi a magnificent facade ornamented with statues fronted by a pool 
 ann continues down the street that runs beside the fountain stopping outside a salon to look at the drawings of hairstyles in the window which surround a mirror she appears disappointed at the way she looks in the mirror and after smiling at the hair of someone who walks past decides to go inside 
 joe walks up the the shop smiling when he sees where she has gone 
 
 inside the hair salon ann sits on one of the seats in front of the large mirror holding up her long hair as the hairdresser mario delani fastens the cover around her 
 
 mario delani 
 speaking rather hesitant english

 he asks her something in italian 
 
 ann

 ann 
 emphatically

 mario delani 
 he turns he round in the chair taking her hair in his hand 
 all off 
 
 ann

 joe peers in them through the beaded curtain still holding his melon 
 mario delani 
 uncomfortable as he starts cutting off her long hair 
 off 
 joe goes outside looking round then walks away down the street 
 ann sits in the salon still her hair covering her face 
 
 mario delani 
 pulling apart her hair to see her 
 are you sure 
 
 ann 
 impatiently 
 yes 
 
 mario delani 
 dropping her hair back over her face 
 yes 
 
 as he cuts her locks off working his way round 
 off off off 
 
 wipes his forehead with his arm 
 joe finds a public phone down the street opposite the fountain joe waits impatiently studying his melon as another person speaks on the phone in italian then seeing a group of children playing on the statue goes over to one of them passing his melon to a boy 
 back in the salon the hairdresser cuts of the last lock of her hair 
 
 mario delani 
 off 
 
 he stands to the side of her as they both study the end result as ann moves her head slightly from side to side she looks down at something but engrossed in her the hairdresser jerks her head back to the centre to get a better view 
 outside joe sees a group of american schoolgirls playing and talking around the fountain he approaches one who carries a camera 
 
 joe 
 gently coaxing her to get a look at the camera 
 a nice little camera you have there ah nice mmmm er you mind if i just borrow it do you 
 
 he tries to coax it off her but the strap is around her neck 
 
 schoolgirl 
 calling out putting her hand up 
 miss weber 
 
 joe 
 give it back just for a couple of minutes 
 
 schoolgirl 
 trying to resist him 
 no go my camera 
 their teacher comes over looking over joe darkly he lets go of the camera as the teacher leads the student away then holds his head in his hand embarrassed 
 in the salon someone sweeps the hair up off the floor mario delani is combing her hair touching up the ends 
 
 mario delani

 she smiles flattered

 ann

 jane i should have known just like every other dweeb who worships quentin tarantino for the same reason you let go of that camera because you know how to be a real person in real life so obvious 
 rickyyou think not obvious you sit in front of your mirror wondering what it would be like to be beautiful like angela but the truth is more beautiful than ever be because more real because you 
 he starts to sing in a clear deep voice

 jane stares at him unsure whether she should laugh or run 
 ricky give me hope to carry on 
 she finally laughs he lowers the camera and smiles 
 ricky to see the most beautiful thing ever filmed 
 int fitts house bedroom later 
 on video were in an empty parking lot on a cold gray is floating across from us an empty wrinkled white plastic bag we follow it as the wind carries it in a circle around us sometimes whipping it about violently or without warning sending it soaring skyward then letting it float gracefully down to the ground 
 jane sits on the bed she watches tv her brow furrowed trying to figure out why this is beautiful 
 from a chair across the room ricky watches smiling 
 rickyit was one of those days when a minute away from snowing and this electricity in the air you can almost hear it right and this bag was like dancing with me like a little kid begging me to play with it for fifteen minutes and the day i knew there was this entire life behind things and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid ever 
 a beat 
 ricky a poor excuse but it helps me remember and i need to remember 
 now jane is watching him 
 ricky so much beauty in the world i feel like i take it like my going to cave in 
 he points a remote at the tv and switches it off then justsits there lost in thought not unlike his mother 
 after a moment jane gets up ricky watches impassively asshe kneels in front of him and takes his hands and kisses them then she leans up and kisses him softly on the lips his eyes scan hers curious to see how she reacts to this 
 my god what time is it

 int power plant close on body 
 floating in a amnion 
 his body spasms fighting against the thick gelatin 
 metal tubes surreal versions of hospital tubes obscure 
 his face other lines like ivs are connected to limbs 
 and cover his genitals 
 he is struggling desperately now air bubbles into the 
 but does not break the surface 
 pressing up the surface distends stretching like a red 
 rubber coccon 
 unable to breathe he fights wildly to stand clawing at 
 the thinning elastic shroud 
 until it ruptures a hole widening around his mouth as he 
 sucks for air tearing himself free he emerges from the 
 cell 
 it is neo 
 he is bald and naked his body slick with gelatin 
 dizzy nauseous he waits for his vision to focus 
 he is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled 
 with red gelatin the surface of which has solidified 
 like curdled milk 
 the ivs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear 
 to be grafted to his flesh 
 he feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the 
 back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial 
 plugged and locked into the base of his skull 
 he tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull 
 off a finger 
 to either side he sees other pods filled with 
 red gelatin beneath the surface pale and 
 motionless he sees other human beings 
 fanning out in a circle there are more all connected 
 to a center core each capsule like a red dimly glowing 
 petal attached to a black metal stem 
 above him level after level the stem rises seemingly 
 forever he moves to the foot of the capsule and looks 
 out 
 the image assaults his mind 
 towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible 
 heights disappearing down into a dim murk like an 
 underwater abyss 
 his sight is blurred and warped exaggerating the 
 intensity of the vision the sound of the plant is like 
 the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of 
 leviathan 
 below neo a petal detaches from the stem bearing away 
 the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a 
 new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space 
 inside the new capsule its surface more translucent and 
 pinkish in color neo sees a small baby 
 from above a machine drops directly in front of neo 
 he swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him 
 it is almost in its design beautiful 
 housings of alloyed metal covering systems 
 of hard and soft polymers 
 a black particle beam washes over neo he reacts in pain 
 as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired 
 to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex 
 at the back of the neck the cable lock spins and opens 
 disengaging 
 the cable pulls itself free a long clear plastic needle 
 and slides from the anterior of neols skull 
 with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid the other 
 connective hoses snap free and snake away as 
 the back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum like 
 an airplane door opening sucks the gelatin and then neo 
 into a black hole 
 
 int waste line 
 the pipe is a waste disposal system and neo falls 
 sliding with the clot of gelatin 
 banking through pipe spirals and elbows flushing up 
 through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of 
 cellulite 
 neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the 
 flow of waste 
 the metallic cable then lifts pulling him up into the 
 belly of the futuristic flying nachine hovering inside 
 the sewer main line 
 
 int hovercraft 
 the metal harness opens and drops the neo 
 onto the floor 
 human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself 
 looking straight at morpheus 
 trinity and apoc and others dressed in bizarre high 
 tech combat gear 
 morpheus smiles 
 morpheus 
 welcome to the real world neo 
 neo passes out 
 fade to black 
 we have no sense of time we hear voices whispering 
 man 
 do you think morpheus is right 
 do you think he could be the one 
 woman 
 it matter now but if wrong 
 fade in 
 pov 
 eyes flutter open we see face above us 
 angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick 
 
 angle on neo 
 neo 
 am i dead 
 trinity 
 far from it 
 fade to black 
 
 fade in 
 
 angle on neo 
 he opens his eyes again something tingling through him 
 he focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of 
 needles wired to a strange device 
 dozer 
 he needs a lot of work 
 morpheus 
 i know 
 dozer and morpheus are operating on neo 
 neo 
 what are you doing 
 morpheus 
 your muscles have atrophied rebuilding them 
 fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright 
 neo 
 why do my eyes hurt 
 morpheus 
 never used them before 
 morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on neo 
 neo lays back 
 morpheus 
 rest neo the answers are coming

lionfish nov chapter nine the writing on the wallcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 going on here going on 
 
 attracted no doubt by shout argus filch came shouldering his way through the crowd then he saw mrs norris and fell back clutching his face in horror 
 
 my cat my cat happened to mrs norris he shrieked 
 
 and his popping eyes fell on harry 
 
 screeched you murdered my cat killed her kill you 
 
 argus 
 
 dumbledore had arrived on the scene followed by a number of other teachers in seconds he had swept past harry ron and hermione and detached mrs norris from the torch bracket 
 
 come with me argus he said to filch you too mr potter mr weasley miss granger 
 
 lockhart stepped forward eagerly 
 
 my office is nearest headmaster just upstairs please feel free 
 
 thank you gilderoy said dumbledore 
 
 the silent crowd parted to let them pass lockhart looking excited and important hurried after dumbledore so did professors mcgonagall and snape 
 
 as they entered darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls harry saw several of the lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight their hair in rollers the real lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back dumbledore lay mrs norris on the polished surface and began to examine her harry ron and hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight watching 
 
 the tip of long crooked nose was barely an inch from mrs fur he was looking at her closely through his spectacles his long fingers gently prodding and poking professor mcgonagall was bent almost as close her eyes narrowed snape loomed behind them half in shadow wearing a most peculiar expression it was as though he was trying hard not to smile and lockhart was hovering around all of them making suggestions 
 
 it was definitely a curse that killed her probably the transmogrifian torture seen it used many times so unlucky i there i know the very countercurse that would have saved her 
 
 comments were punctuated by dry racking sobs he was slumped in a chair by the desk unable to look at mrs norris his face in his hands much as he detested filch harry help feeling a bit sorry for him though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself if dumbledore believed filch he would be expelled for sure 
 
 dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping mrs norris with his wand but nothing happened she continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed 
 
 i remember something very similar happening in ouagadogou said lockhart a series of attacks the full in my autobiography i was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets which cleared the matter up at once 
 
 the photographs of lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked one of them had forgotten to remove his hair net 
 
 at last dumbledore straightened up 
 
 not dead argus he said softly 
 
 lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented 
 
 not dead choked filch looking through his fingers at mrs norris but she all all stiff and frozen 
 
 she has been petrified said dumbledore ah i thought so said lockhart but how i cannot say 
 
 ask him shrieked filch turning his blotched and tearstained face to harry 
 
 no second year could have done this said dumbledore firmly it would take dark magic of the most advanced 
 
 he did it he did it filch spat his pouchy face purpling you saw what he wrote on the wall he found in my office he knows a a face worked horribly he knows a squib he finished 
 
 i never touched mrs norris harry said loudly uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him including all the lockharts on the walls and i even know what a squib is 
 
 rubbish snarled filch he saw my kwikspell letter 
 
 if i might speak headmaster said snape from the shadows and sense of foreboding increased he was sure nothing snape had to say was going to do him any good 
 
 potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time he said a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it but we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here why was he in the upstairs corridor at all why he at the halloween feast 
 
 harry ron and hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party there were hundreds of ghosts tell you we were there 
 
 but why not join the feast afterward said snape his black eyes glittering in the candlelight why go up to that corridor 
 
 ron and hermione looked at harry 
 
 because because harry said his heart thumping very fast something told him it would sound very if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear because we were tired and wanted to go to bed he said 
 
 without any supper said snape a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face i think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties 
 
 we hungry said ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble 
 
 nasty smile widened 
 
 i suggest headmaster that potter is not being entirely truthful he said it might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story i personally feel he should be taken off the gryffindor quidditch team until he is ready to be honest 
 
 really severus said professor mcgonagall sharply i see no reason to stop the boy playing quidditch this cat hit over the head with a broomstick there is no evidence at all that potter has done anything wrong 
 
 dumbledore was giving harry a searching look his twinkling gaze made harry feel as though he were being 
 
 innocent until proven guilty severus he said firmly 
 
 snape looked furious 
 
 so did filch 
 
 my cat has been petrified he shrieked his eyes popping i want to see some punishment 
 
 we will be able to cure her argus said dumbledore patiently professer sprout recently managed to procure some mandrakes as soon as they have reached their full size i will have a potion made that will revive mrs norris 
 
 make it lockhart butted in i must have done it a hundred times i could whip up a mandrake restorative draught in my sleep 
 
 excuse me said snape icily but i believe i am the potions master at this school 
 
 there was a very awkward pause 
 
 you may go dumbledore said to harry ron and hermione 
 
 they went as quickly as they could without actually running when they were a floor up from office they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them harry squinted at his faces 
 
 think i should have told them about that voice i heard 
 
 no said ron without hesitation hearing voices no one else can hear a good sign even in the wizarding world 
 
 something in voice made harry ask you do believe me you 
 
 course i do said ron quickly but you must admit weird 
 
 i know weird said harry the whole weird what was that writing on the wall about the chamber has been opened that supposed to mean 
 
 you know it rings a sort of bell said ron slowly i think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at hogwarts once been bill 
 
 and what on a squib said harry 
 
 to his surprise ron stifled a snigger 
 
 well not funny really but as filch he said a squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but got any magic powers kind of the opposite of wizards but squibs are quite unusual if trying to learn magic from a kwikspell course i reckon he must be a squib it would explain a lot like why he hates students so much ron gave a satisfied smile bitter 
 
 a clock chimed somewhere 
 
 midnight said harry better get to bed before snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else 
 
 for a few days the school could talk of little else but the attack on mrs norris filch kept it fresh in minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked as though he thought the attacker might come back harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with mrs magical mess remover but to no effect the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone when filch guarding the scene of the crime he was skulking through the corridors lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like breathing looking happy 
 
 ginny weasley seemed very disturbed by mrs fate according to ron she was a great cat lover 
 
 but you really got to know mrs norris ron told her bracingly honestly much better off without her lip trembled stuff like this often happen at hogwarts ron assured her catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time i just hope got time to petrify filch before expelled only joking ron added hastily as ginny blanched 
 
 the attack had also had an effect on hermione it was quite usual for hermione to spend a lot of time reading but she was now doing almost nothing else nor could harry and ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to and not until the following wednesday did they find out 
 
 harry had been held back in potions where snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks after a hurried lunch he went upstairs to meet ron in the library and saw justin the hufflepuff boy from herbology coming toward him harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when justin caught sight of him turned abruptly and sped off in the opposite direction 
 
 harry found ron at the back of the library measuring his history of magic homework professor binns had asked for a three foot long composition on the medieval assembly of european wizards 
 
 i believe it still eight inches short said ron furiously letting go of his parchment which sprang back into a roll and done four feet seven inches and her tiny 
 
 where is she asked harry grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework 
 
 somewhere over there said ron pointing along the shelves looking for another book i think trying to read the whole library before christmas 
 
 harry told ron about justin running away from him 
 
 dunno why you care i thought he was a bit of an idiot said ron scribbling away making his writing as large as possible all that junk about lockhart being so great 
 
 hermione emerged from between the bookshelves she looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them 
 
 all the copies of hogwarts a history have been taken out she said sitting down next to harry and ron and a waiting list i wish i left my copy at home but i fit it in my trunk with all the lockhart books 
 
 why do you want it said harry 
 
 the same reason everyone else wants it said hermione to read up on the legend of the chamber of secrets 
 
 that said harry quickly 
 
 just it i remember said hermione biting her lip and i find the story anywhere else 
 
 hermione let me read your composition said ron desperately checking his watch 
 
 no i said hermione suddenly severe had ten days to finish it 
 
 i only need another two inches come on 
 
 the bell rang ron and hermione led the way to history of magic bickering 
 
 history of magic was the dullest subject on their schedule professor binns who taught it was their only ghost teacher and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard ancient and shriveled many people said he noticed he was dead he had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire his routine had not varied in the slightest since 
 
 today was as boring as ever professor binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date then falling asleep again he had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before hermione put up her hand 
 
 professor binns glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the international warlock convention of looked amazed 
 
 miss er 
 
 granger professor i was wondering if you could tell us anything about the chamber of secrets said hermione in a clear voice 
 
 dean thomas who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open gazing out of the window jerked out of his trance lavender head came up off her arms and neville elbow slipped off his desk 
 
 professor binns blinked 
 
 my subject is history of magic he said in his dry wheezy voice i deal with facts miss granger not myths and legends he cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk slipping and continued in september of that year a subcommittee of sardinian sorcerers 
 
 he stuttered to a halt hand was waving in the air again 
 
 miss grant 
 
 please sir legends always have a basis in fact 
 
 professor binns was looking at her in such amazement harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before alive or dead 
 
 well said professor binns slowly yes one could argue that i suppose he peered at hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before however the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational even ludicrous tale 
 
 but the whole class was now hanging on professor every word he looked dimly at them all every face turned to his harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest 
 
 oh very well he said slowly let me see the chamber of secrets 
 
 you all know of course that hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago the precise date is uncertain by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age the four school houses are named after them godric gryffindor helga hufflepuff rowena ravenclaw and salazar slytherin they built this castle together far from prying muggle eyes for it was an age when magic was feared by common people and witches and wizards suffered much persecution 
 
 he paused gazed blearily around the room and continued 
 
 for a few years the founders worked in harmony together seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated but then disagreements sprang up between them a rift began to grow between slytherin and the others slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts he believed that magical learning should be kept within families he disliked taking students of muggle parentage believing them to be untrustworthy after a while there was a serious argument on the subject between slytherin and gryffindor and slytherin left the school 
 
 professor binns paused again pursing his lips looking like a wrinkled old tortoise 
 
 reliable historical sources tell us this much he said but these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the chamber of secrets the story goes that slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle of which the other founders knew nothing 
 
 slytherin according to the legend sealed the chamber of secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school the heir alone would be able to unseal the chamber of secrets unleash the horror within and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic 
 
 there was silence as he finished telling the story but it the usual sleepy silence that filled professor classes there was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him hoping for more professor binns looked faintly annoyed 
 
 the whole thing is arrant nonsense of course he said naturally the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber many times by the most learned witches and wizards it does not exist a tale told to frighten the gullible 
 
 hand was back in the air 
 
 sir what exactly do you mean by the horror chamber 
 
 that is believed to be some sort of monster which the heir of slytherin alone can control said professor binns in his dry reedy voice 
 
 the class exchanged nervous looks 
 
 i tell you the thing does not exist said professor binns shuffling his notes there is no chamber and no monster 
 
 but sir said seamus finnigan if the chamber can only be opened by true heir no one else would be able to find it would they 
 
 nonsense said professor binns in an aggravated tone if a long succession of hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses found the thing 
 
 but professor piped up parvati patil probably have to use dark magic to open it 
 
 just because a wizard use dark magic mean he miss pennyfeather snapped professor binns i repeat if the likes of dumbledore 
 
 but maybe got to be related to slytherin so dumbledore began dean thomas but professor binns had had enough 
 
 that will do he said sharply it is a myth it does not exist there is not a shred of evidence that slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard i regret telling you such a foolish story we will return if you please to history to solid believable verifiable fact 
 
 and within five minutes the class had sunk back into its usual torpor 
 
 i always knew salazar slytherin was a twisted old loony ron told harry and hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner but i never knew he started all this stuff i be in his house if you paid me honestly if the sorting hat had tried to put me in slytherin got the train straight back home 
 
 hermione nodded fervently but harry say anything his stomach had just dropped unpleasantly 
 
 harry had never told ron and hermione that the sorting hat had seriously considered putting him in slytherin he could remember as though it were yesterday the small voice that had spoken in his ear when placed the hat on his head a year before you could be great you know all here in your head and slytherin would help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that 
 
 but harry who had already heard of slytherin reputation for turning out dark wizards had thought desperately not slytherin and the hat had said oh well if sure better be gryffindor 
 
 as they were shunted along in the throng colin creevy went past 
 
 hiya harry 
 
 hullo colin said harry automatically 
 
 harry harry a boy in my class has been saying 
 
 but colin was so small he fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the great hall they heard him squeak see you harry and he was gone 
 
 a boy in his class saying about you hermione wondered 
 
 that heir i expect said harry his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way justin had run away from him at lunchtime 
 
 people believe anything said ron in disgust 
 
 the crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty 
 
 really think a chamber of secrets ron asked hermione 
 
 i know she said frowning dumbledore cure mrs norris and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be well human 
 
 as she spoke they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened they stopped and looked the scene was just as it had been that night except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message the chamber of secrets has been opened 
 
 where filch has been keeping guard ron muttered 
 
 they looked at each other the corridor was deserted 
 
 hurt to have a poke around said harry dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along searching for clues 
 
 scorch marks he said here and here 
 
 come and look at this said hermione this is funny 
 
 har ry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall hermione was pointing at the topmost pane where around twenty spiders were scuttling apparently fighting to get through a small crack a long silvery thread was dangling like a rope as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside 
 
 have you ever seen spiders act like that said hermione wonderingly 
 
 no said harry have you ron ron 
 
 he looked over his shoulder ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run 
 
 up said harry 
 
 i like spiders said ron tensely 
 
 i never knew that said hermione looking at ron in surprise used spiders in potions loads of times 
 
 i mind them dead said ron who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window i just like the way they move 
 
 hermione giggled 
 
 not funny said ron fiercely if you must know when i was three fred turned my my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because i broke his toy broomstick you like them either if been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and 
 
 he broke off shuddering hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh feeling they had better get off the subject harry said remember all that water on the floor where did that come from mopped it up 
 
 it was about here said ron recovering himself to walk a few paces past chair and pointing level with this door 
 
 he reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though been burned 
 
 the matter said harry 
 
 go in there said ron gruffly a 
 
 oh ron there be anyone in there said hermione standing up and coming over moaning place come on have a look 
 
 and ignoring the large out of order sign she opened the door 
 
 it was the gloomiest most depressing bathroom harry had ever set foot in under a large cracked and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks the floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles burning low in their holders the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges 
 
 hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall when she reached it she said hello myrtle how are you 
 
 harry and ron went to look moaning myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet picking a spot on her chin 
 
 this is a girls 
 
 bathroom she said eyeing ron and harry suspiciously not girls 
 
 no hermione agreed i just wanted to show them how er nice it is in here 
 
 she waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor 
 
 ask her if she saw anything harry mouthed at hermione 
 
 what are you whispering said myrtle staring at him 
 
 nothing said harry quickly we wanted to ask 
 
 i wish people would stop talking behind my back said myrtle in a voice choked with tears i do have feelings you know even if i am dead 
 
 myrtle no one wants to upset you said hermione harry only 
 
 no one wants to upset me a good one howled myrtle my life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death 
 
 we wanted to ask you if seen anything funny lately said hermione quickly because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on halloween 
 
 did you see anyone near here that night said harry 
 
 i paying attention said myrtle dramatically peeves upset me so much i came in here and tried to kill myself then of course i remembered that that 
 
 already dead said ron helpfully 
 
 myrtle gave a tragic sob rose up in the air turned over and dived headfirst into the toilet splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight although from the direction of her muffled sobs she had come to rest somewhere in the 
 
 harry and ron stood with their mouths open but hermione shrugged wearily and said honestly that was almost cheerful for myrtle come on go 
 
 harry had barely closed the door on gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump 
 
 ron 
 
 percy weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs prefect badge agleam an expression of complete shock on his face 
 
 a girls 
 
 bathroom he gasped what were you 
 
 just having a look around ron shrugged clues you know 
 
 percy swelled in a manner that reminded harry forcefully of mrs weasley 
 
 get away from there perry said striding toward them and starting to bustle them along flapping his arms you care what this looks like coming back here while at dinner 
 
 why we be here said ron hotly stopping short and glaring at percy listen we never laid a finger on that cat 
 
 what i told ginny said percy fiercely but she still seems to think going to be expelled never seen her so upset crying her eyes out you might think of her all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business 
 
 you care about ginny said ron whose ears were now reddening just worried going to mess up your chances of being head boy 
 
 five points from gryffindor percy said tersely fingering his prefect badge and i hope it teaches you a lesson no more detective work or write to mum 
 
 and he strode off the back of his neck as red as ears 
 
 harry ron and hermione chose seats as far as possible from percy in the common room that night ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his charms homework when he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges it ignited the parchment fuming almost as much as his homework ron slammed the standard book of spells grade shut to surprise hermione followed suit 
 
 who can it be though she said in a quiet voice as though continuing a conversation they had just been having want to frighten all the squibs and out of 
 
 think said ron in mock puzzlement who do we know who thinks are scum 
 
 he looked at hermione hermione looked back unconvinced 
 
 if talking about malfoy 
 
 of course i am said ron you heard him be next mudbloods come on only got to look at his foul rat face to know him 
 
 malfoy the heir of slytherin said hermione skeptically 
 
 look at his family said harry closing his books too the whole lot of them have been in slytherin always boasting about it they could easily be descendants his definitely evil enough 
 
 they had the key to the chamber of secrets for centuries said ron handing it down father to son 
 
 well said hermione cautiously i suppose possible 
 
 but how do we prove it said harry darkly 
 
 there might be a way said hermione slowly dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at percy of course it would be difficult and dangerous very dangerous be breaking about fifty school rules i expect 
 
 if in a month or so you feel like explaining you will let us know you said ron irritably 
 
 all right said hermione coldly what need to do is to get inside the slytherin common room and ask malfoy a few questions without him realizing us 
 
 but impossible harry said as ron laughed 
 
 no not said hermione all need would be some polyjuice potion 
 
 that said ron and harry together 
 
 snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago 
 
 think got nothing better to do in potions than listen to snape muttered ron 
 
 it transforms you into somebody else think about it we could change into three of the slytherins no one would know it was us malfoy would probably tell us anything probably boasting about it in the slytherin common room right now if only we could hear him 
 
 this polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me said ron frowning what if we were stuck looking like three of the slytherins forever 
 
 it wears off after a while said hermione waving her hand impatiently but getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult snape said it was in a book called moste potente potions and bound to be in the restricted section of the library there was only one way to get out a book from the restricted section you needed a signed note of permission from a teacher hard to see why want the book really said ron if we going to try and make one of the potions i think said hermione that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory we might stand a chance 
 
 oh come on no going to fall for that said ron have to be really thick 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine grim defeatcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 professor dumbledore sent all the gryffindors back to the great hall where they were joined ten minutes later by the students from hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin who all looked extremely confused 
 
 the teachers and i need to conduct a thorough search of the castle professor dumbledore told them as professors mcgonagall and flitwick closed all doors into the hall afraid that for your own safety you will have to spend the night here i want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and i am leaving the head boy and girl in charge any disturbance should be reported to me immediately he added to percy who was looking immensely proud and important send word with one of the ghosts 
 
 professor dumbledore paused about to leave the hall and said oh yes be needing 
 
 one casual wave of his wand and the long tables flew to the edges of the hall and stood themselves against the walls another wave and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple sleeping bags 
 
 sleep well said professor dumbledore closing the door behind him 
 
 the hall immediately began to buzz excitedly the gryffindors were telling the rest of the school what had just happened 
 
 everyone into their sleeping bags shouted percy come on now no more talking lights out in ten minutes 
 
 ron said to harry and hermione they seized three sleeping bags and dragged them into a corner 
 
 do you think still in the castle hermione whispered anxiously 
 
 dumbledore obviously thinks he might be said ron 
 
 very lucky he picked tonight you know said hermione as they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped themselves on their elbows to talk the one night we in the tower 
 
 i reckon lost track of time being on the run said ron realize it was halloween otherwise have come bursting in here 
 
 hermione shuddered 
 
 all around them people were asking one another the same question how did he get in 
 
 maybe he knows how to apparate said a ravenclaw a few feet away just appear out of thin air you know 
 
 disguised himself probably said a hufflepuff fifth year 
 
 he flown in suggested dean thomas 
 
 honestly am i the only person ever bothered to read hogwarts a history said hermione crossly to harry and ron 
 
 probably said ron why 
 
 because the protected by more than walls you know said hermione there are all sorts of enchantments on it to stop people entering by stealth you just apparate in here and like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors guarding every single entrance to the grounds have seen him fly in too and filch knows all the secret passages have them covered 
 
 the lights are going out now percy shouted i want everyone in their sleeping bags and no more talking 
 
 the candles all went out at once the only light now came from the silvery ghosts who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects and the enchanted ceiling which like the sky outside was scattered with stars what with that and the whispering that still filled the hall harry felt as though he were sleeping outdoors in a light wind 
 
 once every hour a teacher would reappear in the hall to check that everything was quiet around three in the morning when many students had finally fallen asleep professor dumbledore came in harry watched him looking around for percy who had been prowling between the sleeping bags telling people off for talking percy was only a short way away from harry ron and hermione who quickly pretended to be asleep as footsteps drew nearer 
 
 any sign of him professor asked percy in a whisper 
 
 no all well here 
 
 everything under control sir 
 
 good no point moving them all now found a temporary guardian for the gryffindor portrait hole be able to move them back in tomorrow 
 
 and the fat lady sir 
 
 hiding in a map of argyllshire on the second floor apparently she refused to let black in without the password so he attacked still very distressed but once calmed down have mr filch restore her 
 
 harry heard the door of the hall creak open again and more footsteps 
 
 headmaster it was snape harry kept quite still listening hard the whole of the third floor has been searched not there and filch has done the dungeons nothing there either 
 
 what about the astronomy tower professor room the owlery 
 
 all searched 
 
 very well severus i really expect black to linger 
 
 have you any theory as to how he got in professor asked snape 
 
 harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other ear 
 
 many severus each of them as unlikely as the next 
 
 harry opened his eyes a fraction and squinted up to where they stood back was to him but he could see face rapt with attention and profile which looked angry 
 
 you remember the conversation we had headmaster just before ah the start of term said snape who was barely opening his lips as though trying to block percy out of the conversation 
 
 i do severus said dumbledore and there was something like warning in his voice 
 
 it seems almost impossible that black could have entered the school without inside help i did express my concerns when you appointed 
 
 i do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped black enter it said dumbledore and his tone made it so clear that the subject was closed that snape reply i must go down to the dementors said dumbledore i said i would inform them when our search was complete 
 
 they want to help sir said percy 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore coldly but afraid no dementor will cross the threshold of this castle while i am headmaster 
 
 percy looked slightly abashed dumbledore left the hall walking quickly and quietly snape stood for a moment watching the headmaster with an expression of deep resentment on his face then he too left 
 
 harry glanced sideways at ron and hermione both of them had their eyes open too reflecting the starry ceiling 
 
 what was all that about ron mouthed 
 
 
 
 the school talked of nothing but sirius black for the next few days the theories about how he had entered the castle became wilder and wilder hannah abbott from hufflepuff spent much of their next herbology class telling anyone listen that black could turn into a flowering shrub 
 
 the fat ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and replaced with the portrait of sir cadogan and his fat gray pony nobody was very happy about this sir cadogan spent half his time challenging people to duels and the rest thinking up ridiculously complicated passwords which he changed at least twice a day 
 
 a complete lunatic said seamus finnigan angrily to percy we get anyone else 
 
 none of the other pictures wanted the job said percy frightened of what happened to the fat lady sir cadogan was the only one brave enough to volunteer 
 
 sir cadogan however was the least of worries he was now being closely watched teachers found excuses to walk along corridors with him and percy weasley acting harry suspected on his orders was tailing him everywhere like an extremely pompous guard dog to cap it all professor mcgonagall summoned harry into her office with such a somber expression on her face harry thought someone must have died 
 
 no point hiding it from you any longer potter she said in a very serious voice i know this will come as a shock to you but sirius black 
 
 i know after me said harry wearily i heard dad telling his mum mr weasley works for the ministry of magic 
 
 professor mcgonagall seemed very taken aback she stared at harry for a moment or two then said i see well in that case potter understand why i think a good idea for you to be practicing quidditch in the evenings out on the field with only your team members very exposed potter 
 
 got our first match on saturday said harry outraged got to train professor 
 
 professor mcgonagall considered him intently harry knew she was deeply interested in the gryffindor prospects it had been she after all suggested him as seeker in the first place he waited holding his breath 
 
 hmmprofessor mcgonagall stood up and stared out of the window at the quidditch field just visible through the rain wellgoodness knows like to see us win the cup at lastbut all the same be happier if a teacher were present ask madam hooch to oversee your training sessions 
 
 
 
 the weather worsened steadily as the first quidditch match drew nearer undaunted the gryffindor team was training harder than ever under the eye of madam hooch then at their final training session before match oliver wood gave his team some unwelcome news 
 
 not playing slytherin he told them looking very angry just been to see me playing hufflepuff instead 
 
 why chorused the rest of the team 
 
 excuse is that their still injured said wood grinding his teeth furiously but obvious why doing it want to play in this weather think damage their chances 
 
 there had been strong winds and heavy rain all day and as wood spoke they heard a distant rumble of thunder 
 
 nothing wrong with arm said harry furiously faking it 
 
 i know that but we prove it said wood bitterly and been practicing all those moves assuming playing slytherin and instead hufflepuff and their quite different got a new captain and seeker cedric diggory 
 
 angelina alicia and katie suddenly giggled 
 
 what said wood frowning at this lighthearted behavior 
 
 that tall one he said angelina 
 
 strong and silent said katie and they started to giggle again 
 
 only silent because too thick to string two words together said fred impatiently i know why worried oliver hufflepuff is a pushover last time we played them harry caught the snitch in about five minutes remember 
 
 we were playing in completely different conditions wood shouted his eyes bulging slightly put a very strong side together an excellent seeker i was afraid take it like this we relax we must keep our focus slytherin is trying to us we must win 
 
 oliver calm down said fred looking slightly alarmed taking hufflepuff very seriously seriously 
 
 
 
 the day before the match the winds reached howling point and the rain fell harder than ever it was so dark inside the corridors and classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit the slytherin team was looking very smug indeed and none more so than malfoy 
 
 ah if only my arm was feeling a bit better he sighed as the gale outside pounded the windows 
 
 harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except the match tomorrow oliver wood kept hurrying up to him between classes and giving him tips the third time this happened wood talked for so long that harry suddenly realized he was ten minutes late for defense against the dark arts and set off at a run with wood shouting after him got a very fast swerve harry so you might want to try looping him 
 
 harry skidded to a halt outside the defense against the dark arts classroom pulled the door open and dashed inside 
 
 sorry late professor lupin i 
 
 but it professor lupin who looked up at him from the desk it was snape 
 
 this lesson began ten minutes ago potter so i think make it ten points from gryffindor sit down 
 
 but harry move 
 
 professor lupin he said 
 
 he says he is feeling too ill to teach today said snape with a twisted smile i believe i told you to sit down 
 
 but harry stayed where he was 
 
 wrong with him 
 
 black eyes glittered 
 
 nothing he said looking as though he wished it were five more points from gryffindor and if i have to ask you to sit down again it will be fifty 
 
 harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down snape looked around at the class 
 
 as i was saying before potter interrupted professor lupin has not left any record of the topics you have covered so far 
 
 please sir done boggarts red caps kappas and grindylows said hermione quickly and just about to start 
 
 be quiet said snape coldly i did not ask for information i was merely commenting on professor lack of organization 
 
 the best defense against the dark arts teacher ever had said dean thomas boldly and there was a murmur of agreement from the rest of the class snape looked more menacing than ever 
 
 you are easily satisfied lupin is hardly overtaxing you i would expect first years to be able to deal with red caps and grindylows today we shall discuss 
 
 harry watched him flick through the textbook to the very back chapter which he must know they covered 
 
 werewolves said snape 
 
 but sir said hermione seemingly unable to restrain herself not supposed to do werewolves yet due to start hinkypunks 
 
 miss granger said snape in a voice of deadly calm i was under the impression that i am teaching this lesson not you and i am telling you all to turn to page he glanced around again all of you now 
 
 with many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering the class opened their books 
 
 which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf said snape 
 
 everyone sat in motionless silence everyone except hermione whose hand as it so often did had shot straight into the air 
 
 anyone snape said ignoring hermione his twisted smile was back are you telling me that professor lupin even taught you the basic distinction between 
 
 we told you said parvati suddenly we got as far as werewolves yet still on 
 
 silence snarled snape well well well i never thought meet a class who even recognize a werewolf when they saw one i shall make a point of informing professor dumbledore how very behind you all are 
 
 please sir said hermione whose hand was still in the air the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways the snout of the werewolf 
 
 that is the second time you have spoken out of turn miss granger said snape coolly five more points from gryffindor for being an insufferable 
 
 hermione went very red put down her hand and stared at the floor with her eyes full of tears it was a mark of how much the class loathed snape that they were all glaring at him because every one of them had called hermione a at least once and ron who told hermione she was a at least twice a week said loudly you asked us a question and she knows the answer why ask if you want to be told 
 
 the class knew instantly gone too far snape advanced on ron slowly and the room held its breath 
 
 detention weasley snape said silkily his face very close to and if i ever hear you criticize the way i teach a class again you will be very sorry indeed 
 
 no one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson they sat and made notes on werewolves from the textbook while snape prowled up and down the rows of desks examining the work they had been doing with professor lupin 
 
 very poorly explainedthat is incorrect the kappa is more commonly found in mongoliaprofessor lupin gave this eight out of ten i have given it three 
 
 when the bell rang at last snape held them back 
 
 you will each write an essay to be handed in to me on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves i want two rolls of parchment on the subject and i want them by monday morning it is time somebody took this class in hand weasley stay behind we need to arrange your detention 
 
 harry and hermione left the room with the rest of the class who waited until they were well out of earshot then burst into a furious tirade about snape 
 
 never been like this with any of our other defense against the dark arts teachers even if he did want the job harry said to hermione he got it in for lupin think this is all because of the boggart 
 
 i know said hermione pensively but i really hope professor lupin gets better soon 
 
 ron caught up with them five minutes later in a towering rage 
 
 know what that he called snape something that made hermione say ron is making me do got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing without magic he was breathing deeply his fists clenched why black have hidden in office eh he could have finished him off for us 
 
 
 
 harry woke extremely early the next morning so early that it was still dark for a moment he thought the roaring of the wind had woken him then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and sat bolt upright peeves the poltergeist had been floating next to him blowing hard in his ear 
 
 what did you do that for said harry furiously peeves puffed out his cheeks blew hard and zoomed backward out of the room cackling 
 
 harry fumbled for his alarm clock and looked at it it was half past four cursing peeves he rolled over and tried to get back to sleep but it was very difficult now that he was awake to ignore the sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead the pounding of the wind against the castle walls and the distant creaking of the trees in the forbidden forest in a few hours he would be out on the quidditch field battling through that gale finally he gave up any thought of more sleep got up dressed picked up his nimbus two thousand and walked quietly out of the dormitory 
 
 as harry opened the door something brushed against his leg he bent down just in time to grab crookshanks by the end of his bushy tail and drag him outside 
 
 you know i reckon ron was right about you harry told crookshanks suspiciously there are plenty of mice around this place go and chase them go on he added nudging crookshanks down the spiral staircase with his foot leave scabbers alone 
 
 the noise of the storm was even louder in the common room harry knew better than to think the match would be canceled quidditch matches called off for trifles like thunderstorms nevertheless he was starting to feel very apprehensive wood had pointed out cedric diggory to him in the corridor diggory was a fifth year and a lot bigger than harry seekers were usually light and speedy but weight would be an advantage in this weather because he was less likely to be blown off course 
 
 harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire getting up every now and then to stop crookshanks from sneaking up the boys staircase again at long last harry thought it must be time for breakfast so he headed through the portrait hole alone 
 
 stand and fight you mangy cur yelled sir cadogan 
 
 oh shut up harry yawned 
 
 he revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge and by the time started on toast the rest of the team had turned up 
 
 going to be a tough one said wood who eating anything 
 
 stop worrying oliver said alicia soothingly we mind a bit of rain 
 
 but it was considerably more than a bit of rain such was the popularity of quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual but they ran down the lawns toward the quidditch field heads bowed against the ferocious wind umbrellas being whipped out of their hands as they went just before he entered the locker room harry saw malfoy crabbe and goyle laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their way to the stadium 
 
 the team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for usual pep talk but it come he tried to speak several times made an odd gulping noise then shook his head hopelessly and beckoned them to follow him 
 
 the wind was so strong that they staggered sideways as they walked out onto the field if the crowd was cheering they hear it over the fresh rolls of thunder rain was splattering over glasses how on earth was he going to see the snitch in this 
 
 the hufflepuffs were approaching from the opposite side of the field wearing robes the captains walked up to each other and shook hands diggory smiled at wood but wood now looked as though he had lockjaw and merely nodded harry saw madam mouth form the words mount your brooms he pulled his right foot out of the mud with a squelch and swung it over his nimbus two thousand madam hooch put her whistle to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shrill and distant they were off 
 
 harry rose fast but his nimbus was swerving slightly with the wind he held it as steady as he could and turned squinting into the rain 
 
 within five minutes harry was soaked to his skin and frozen hardly able to see his teammates let alone the tiny snitch he flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow shapes with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game he hear the commentary over the wind the crowd was hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas twice harry came very close to being unseated by a bludger his vision was so clouded by the rain on his glasses he seen them coming 
 
 he lost track of time it was getting harder and harder to hold his broom straight the sky was getting darker as though night had decided to come early twice harry nearly hit another player without knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent everyone was now so wet and the rain so thick he could hardly tell them apart 
 
 with the first flash of lightning came the sound of madam whistle harry could just see the outline of wood through the thick rain gesturing him to the ground the whole team splashed down into the mud 
 
 i called for wood roared at his team come on under here 
 
 they huddled at the edge of the field under a large umbrella harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes 
 
 the score 
 
 fifty points up said wood but unless we get the snitch soon be playing into the night 
 
 got no chance with these on harry said exasperatedly waving his glasses 
 
 at that very moment hermione appeared at his shoulder she was holding her cloak over her head and was inexplicably beaming 
 
 had an idea harry give me your glasses quick 
 
 he handed them to her and as the team watched in amazement hermione tapped them with her wand and said impervius 
 
 there she said handing them back to harry repel water 
 
 wood looked as though he could have kissed her 
 
 brilliant he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into the crowd okay team go for it 
 
 spell had done the trick harry was still numb with cold still wetter than ever been in his life but he could see full of fresh determination he urged his broom through the turbulent air staring in every direction for the snitch avoiding a bludger ducking beneath diggory who was streaking in the opposite direction 
 
 there was another clap of thunder followed immediately by forked lightning this was getting more and more dangerous harry needed to get the snitch quickly 
 
 he turned intending to head back toward the middle of the field but at that moment another flash of lightning illuminated the stands and harry saw something that distracted him completely the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog clearly imprinted against the sky motionless in the topmost empty row of seats 
 
 numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his nimbus dropped a few feet shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes he squinted back into the stands the dog had vanished 
 
 harry came anguished yell from the gryffindor goal posts harry behind you 
 
 harry looked wildly around cedric diggory was pelting up the field and a tiny speck of gold was shimmering in the air between them 
 
 with a jolt of panic harry threw himself flat to the broom handle and zoomed toward the snitch 
 
 come on he growled at his nimbus as the rain whipped his face faster 
 
 but something odd was happening an eerie silence was falling across the stadium the wind though as strong as ever was forgetting to roar it was as though someone had turned off the sound as though harry had gone suddenly deaf what was going on 
 
 and then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him inside him just as he became aware of something moving on the field below 
 
 before had time to think harry had taken his eyes off the snitch and looked down 
 
 at least a hundred dementors their hidden faces pointing up at him were standing beneath him it was as though freezing water were rising in his chest cutting at his insides and then he heard it againsomeone was screaming screaming inside his heada woman 
 
 not harry not harry please not harry 
 
 stand aside you silly girlstand aside now 
 
 not harry please no take me kill me instead 
 
 numbing swirling white mist was filling brainwhat was he doing why was he flying he needed to help hershe was going to dieshe was going to be murdered 
 
 he was falling falling through the icy mist 
 
 not harry pleasehave mercyhave mercy 
 
 a shrill voice was laughing the woman was screaming and harry knew no more 
 
 lucky the ground was so soft 
 
 i thought he was dead for sure 
 
 but he even break his glasses 
 
 harry could hear the voices whispering but they made no sense whatsoever he have a clue where he was or how got there or what been doing before he got there all he knew was that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten 
 
 that was the scariest thing ever seen in my life 
 
 scariestthe scariest thinghooded black figurescoldscreaming 
 
 eyes snapped open he was lying in the hospital wing the gryffindor quidditch team spattered with mud from head to foot was gathered around his bed ron and hermione were also there looking as though just climbed out of a swimming pool 
 
 harry said fred who looked extremely white underneath the mud you feeling 
 
 it was as though memory was on fast forward the lightningthe grimthe snitchand the dementors 
 
 what happened he said sitting up so suddenly they all gasped 
 
 you fell off said fred been what fifty feet 
 
 we thought died said alicia who was shaking 
 
 hermione made a small squeaky noise her eyes were extremely bloodshot 
 
 but the match said harry what happened are we doing a replay 
 
 no one said anything the horrible truth sank into harry like a stone 
 
 we lose 
 
 diggory got the snitch said george just after you fell he realize what had happened when he looked back and saw you on the ground he tried to call it off wanted a rematch but they won fair and squareeven wood admits it 
 
 where is wood said harry suddenly realizing he there 
 
 still in the showers said fred we think trying to drown himself 
 
 harry put his face to his knees his hands gripping his hair fred grabbed his shoulder and shook it roughly 
 
 harry never missed the snitch before 
 
 there had to be one time you get it said george 
 
 not over yet said fred we lost by a hundred points 
 
 right so if hufflepuff loses to ravenclaw and we beat ravenclaw and slytherin 
 
 have to lose by at least two hundred points said george 
 
 but if they beat ravenclaw 
 
 no way ravenclaw is too good but if slytherin loses against hufflepuff 
 
 it all depends on the points a margin of a hundred either way 
 
 harry lay there not saying a word they had lostfor the first time ever he had lost a quidditch match 
 
 after ten minutes or so madam pomfrey came over to tell the team to leave him in peace 
 
 come and see you later fred told him beat yourself up harry still the best seeker ever had 
 
 the team trooped out trailing mud behind them madam pomfrey shut the door behind them looking disapproving ron and hermione moved nearer to bed 
 
 dumbledore was really angry hermione said in a quaking voice never seen him like that before he ran onto the field as you fell waved his wand and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground then he whirled his wand at the dementors shot silver stuff at them they left the stadium right awayhe was furious come onto the grounds we heard him 
 
 then he magicked you onto a stretcher said ron and walked up to school with you floating on it everyone thought you were 
 
 his voice faded but harry hardly noticed he was thinking about what the dementors had done to himabout the screaming voice he looked up and saw ron and hermione looking at him so anxiously that he quickly cast around for something to say 
 
 did someone get my nimbus 
 
 ron and hermione looked quickly at each other 
 
 er 
 
 what said harry looking from one to the other 
 
 wellwhen you fell off it got blown away said hermione hesitantly 
 
 and 
 
 and it hit it hit oh harry it hit the whomping willow 
 
 insides lurched the whomping willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds 
 
 and he said dreading the answer 
 
 well you know the whomping willow said ron it it like being hit 
 
 professor flitwick brought it back just before you came around said hermione in a very small voice 
 
 slowly she reached down for a bag at her feet turned it upside down and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed the only remains of faithful finally beaten broomstick

lionfish nov chapter nine the dark markcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 tell your mother been gambling mr weasley implored fred and george as they all made their way slowly down the stairs 
 
 worry dad said fred gleefully got big plans for this money we want it confiscated 
 
 mr weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were but seemed to decide upon reflection that he want to know 
 
 they were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the path and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads cackling and waving their lanterns when they finally reached the tents nobody felt like sleeping at all and given the level of noise around them mr weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in they were soon arguing enjoyably about the match mr weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with charlie and it was only when ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that mr weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed hermione and ginny went into the next tent and harry and the rest of the weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks from the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang 
 
 oh i am glad not on duty muttered mr weasley sleepily i fancy having to go and tell the irish got to stop celebrating 
 
 harry who was on a top bunk above ron lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead and picturing again some of more spectacular moves he was itching to get back on his own firebolt and try out the wronski oliver wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look saw himself in robes that had his name on the back and imagined the sensation of hearing a crowd roar as ludo voice echoed throughout the stadium i give 
 
 harry never knew whether or not he had actually dropped off to sleep his fantasies of flying like krum might well have slipped into actual dreams all he knew was that quite suddenly mr weasley was shouting 
 
 get up ron harry come on now get up this is urgent 
 
 harry sat up quickly and the top of his head hit canvas 
 
 s matter he said 
 
 dimly he could tell that something was wrong the noises in the campsite had changed the singing had stopped he could hear screams and the sound of people running he slipped down from the bunk and reached for his clothes but mr weasley who had pulled on his jeans over his own pajamas said no time harry just grab a jacket and get outside quickly 
 
 harry did as he was told and hurried out of the tent ron at his heels 
 
 by the light of the few fires that were still burning he could see people running away into the woods fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire loud jeering roars of laughter and drunken yells were drifting toward them then came a burst of strong green light which illuminated the scene 
 
 a crowd of wizards tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward was marching slowly across the field harry squinted at seem to have he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked high above them floating along in midair four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes it was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air two of the figures were very small 
 
 more wizards were joining the marching group laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled once or twice harry saw one of the marchers blast a tent out of his way with his wand several caught fire the screaming grew louder 
 
 the floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and harry recognized one of them mr roberts the campsite manager the other three looked as though they might be his wife and children one of the marchers below flipped mrs roberts upside down with his wand her nightdress fell down to reveal voluminous drawers and she struggled to cover herself up as the crowd below her screeched and hooted with glee 
 
 sick ron muttered watching the smallest muggle child who had begun to spin like a top sixty feet above the ground his head flopping limply from side to side that is really sick 
 
 hermione and ginny came hurrying toward them pulling coats over their nightdresses with mr weasley right behind them at the same moment bill charlie and percy emerged from the boys tent fully dressed with their sleeves rolled up and their wands out 
 
 going to help the ministry mr weasley shouted over all the noise rolling up his own sleeves you lot get into the woods and stick together come and fetch you when sorted this out 
 
 bill charlie and percy were already sprinting away toward the oncoming marchers mr weasley tore after them ministry wizards were dashing from every direction toward the source of the trouble the crowd beneath the roberts family was coming ever closer 
 
 said fred grabbing hand and starting to pull her toward the wood harry ron hermione and george followed they all looked back as they reached the trees the crowd beneath the roberts family was larger than ever they could see the ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center but they were having great difficulty it looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the roberts family fall 
 
 the colored lanterns that had lit the path to the stadium had been extinguished dark figures were blundering through the trees children were crying anxious shouts and panicked voices were reverberating around them in the cold night air harry felt himself being pushed hither and thither by people whose faces he could not see then he heard ron yell with pain 
 
 what happened said hermione anxiously stopping so abruptly that harry walked into her ron where are you oh this is stupid lumos 
 
 she illuminated her wand and directed its narrow beam across the path ron was lying sprawled on the ground 
 
 tripped over a tree root he said angrily getting to his feet again 
 
 well with feet that size hard not to said a drawling voice from behind them 
 
 harry ron and hermione turned sharply draco malfoy was standing alone nearby leaning against a tree looking utterly relaxed his arms folded he seemed to have been watching the scene at the campsite through a gap in the trees 
 
 ron told malfoy to do something that harry knew he would never have dared say in front of mrs weasley 
 
 language weasley said malfoy his pale eyes glittering you better be hurrying along now you like her spotted would you 
 
 he nodded at hermione and at the same moment a blast like a bomb sounded from the campsite and a flash of green light momentarily lit the trees around them 
 
 that supposed to mean said hermione defiantly 
 
 granger after muggles said malfoy want to be showing off your knickers in midair because if you do hang moving this way and it would give us all a laugh 
 
 a witch harry snarled 
 
 have it your own way potter said malfoy grinning maliciously if you think they spot a mudblood stay where you are 
 
 you watch your mouth shouted ron everybody present knew that mudblood was a very offensive term for a witch or wizard of muggle parentage 
 
 never mind ron said hermione quickly seizing arm to restrain him as he took a step toward malfoy 
 
 there came a bang from the other side of the trees that was louder than anything they had heard several people nearby screamed malfoy chuckled softly 
 
 scare easily they he said lazily i suppose your daddy told you all to hide he up to trying to rescue the muggles 
 
 your parents said harry his temper rising out there wearing masks are they 
 
 malfoy turned his face to harry still smiling 
 
 wellif they were i be likely to tell you would i potter 
 
 oh come on said hermione with a disgusted look at malfoy go and find the others 
 
 keep that big bushy head down granger sneered malfoy 
 
 come on hermione repeated and she pulled harry and ron up the path again 
 
 bet you anything his dad is one of that masked lot said ron hotly 
 
 well with any luck the ministry will catch him said hermione fervently oh i believe this where have the others got to 
 
 fred george and ginny were nowhere to be seen though the path was packed with plenty of other people all looking nervously over their shoulders toward the commotion back at the campsite a huddle of teenagers in pajamas was arguing vociferously a little way along the path when they saw harry ron and hermione a girl with thick curly hair turned and said quickly o est madame maxime nous perdue 
 
 er what said ron 
 
 oh the girl who had spoken turned her back on him and as they walked on they distinctly heard her say ogwarts 
 
 beauxbatons muttered hermione 
 
 sorry said harry 
 
 they must go to beauxbatons said hermione you knowbeauxbatons academy of read about it in an appraisal of magical education in europe 
 
 ohyeahright said harry 
 
 fred and george have gone that far said ron pulling out his wand lighting it like and squinting up the path harry dug in the pockets of his jacket for his own wand but it there the only thing he could find was his omnioculars 
 
 ah no i believe lost my wand 
 
 kidding 
 
 ron and hermione raised their wands high enough to spread the narrow beams of light farther on the ground harry looked all around him but his wand was nowhere to be seen 
 
 maybe back in the tent said ron 
 
 maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running hermione suggested anxiously 
 
 yeah said harry maybe 
 
 he usually kept his wand with him at all times in the wizarding world and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable 
 
 a rustling noise nearby made all three of them jump winky the was fighting her way out of a clump of bushes nearby she was moving in a most peculiar fashion apparently with great difficulty it was as though someone invisible were trying to hold her back 
 
 there is bad wizards about she squeaked distractedly as she leaned forward and labored to keep running people high high in the air winky is getting out of the way 
 
 and she disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path panting and squeaking as she fought the force that was restraining her 
 
 up with her said ron looking curiously after winky why she run properly 
 
 bet she ask permission to hide said harry he was thinking of dobby every time he had tried to do something the malfoys like the had been forced to start beating himself up 
 
 you know get a very raw deal said hermione indignantly slavery what it is that mr crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium and she was terrified and got her bewitched so she even run when they start trampling tents why anyone do something about it 
 
 well the elves are happy they ron said you heard old winky back at the is not supposed to have what she likes being bossed around 
 
 people like you ron hermione began hotly who prop up rotten and unjust systems just because too lazy to 
 
 another loud bang echoed from the edge of the wood 
 
 just keep moving shall we said ron and harry saw him glance edgily at hermione perhaps there was truth in what malfoy had said perhaps hermione was in more danger than they were they set off again harry still searching his pockets even though he knew his wand there 
 
 they followed the dark path deeper into the wood still keeping an eye out for fred george and ginny they passed a group of goblins who were cackling over a sack of gold that they had undoubtedly won betting on the match and who seemed quite unperturbed by the trouble at the campsite farther still along the path they walked into a patch of silvery light and when they looked through the trees they saw three tall and beautiful veela standing in a clearing surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards all of whom were talking very loudly 
 
 i pull down about a hundred sacks of galleons a year one of them shouted a dragon killer for the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures 
 
 no not yelled his friend a dishwasher at the leaky cauldronbut a vampire hunter killed about ninety so far 
 
 a third young wizard whose pimples were visible even by the dim silvery light of the veela now cut in about to become the youngest ever minister of magic i am 
 
 harry snorted with laughter he recognized the pimply wizard his name was stan shunpike and he was in fact a conductor on the knight bus he turned to tell ron this but face had gone oddly slack and next second ron was yelling did i tell you invented a broomstick reach jupiter 
 
 honestly said hermione and she and harry grabbed ron firmly by the arms wheeled him around and marched him away by the time the sounds of the veela and their admirers had faded completely they were in the very heart of the wood they seemed to be alone now everything was much quieter 
 
 harry looked around i reckon we can just wait here you know hear anyone coming a mile off 
 
 the words were hardly out of his mouth when ludo bagman emerged from behind a tree right ahead of them 
 
 even by the feeble light of the two wands harry could see that a great change had come over bagman he no longer looked buoyant and there was no more spring in his step he looked very white and strained 
 
 that he said blinking down at them trying to make out their faces what are you doing in here all alone 
 
 they looked at one another surprised 
 
 well a sort of riot going on said ron 
 
 bagman stared at him 
 
 what 
 
 at the campsitesome people have got hold of a family of muggles 
 
 bagman swore loudly 
 
 damn them he said looking quite distracted and without another word he disapparated with a small pop 
 
 not exactly on top of things mr bagman is he said hermione frowning 
 
 he was a great beater though said ron leading the way off the path into a small clearing and sitting down on a patch of dry grass at the foot of a tree the wimbourne wasps won the league three times in a row while he was with them 
 
 he took his small figure of krum out of his pocket set it down on the ground and watched it walk around like the real krum the model was slightly and much less impressive on his splayed feet than on his broomstick harry was listening for noise from the campsite everything seemed much quieter perhaps the riot was over 
 
 i hope the others are okay said hermione after a while 
 
 be fine said ron 
 
 imagine if your dad catches lucius malfoy said harry sitting down next to ron and watching the small figure of krum slouching over the fallen leaves always said like to get something on him 
 
 wipe the smirk off old face all right said ron 
 
 those poor muggles though said hermione nervously what if they get them down 
 
 they will said ron reassuringly find a way 
 
 mad though to do something like that when the whole ministry of out here tonight said hermione i mean how do they expect to get away with it do you think been drinking or are they just 
 
 but she broke off abruptly and looked over her shoulder harry and ron looked quickly around too it sounded as though someone was staggering toward their clearing they waited listening to the sounds of the uneven steps behind the dark trees but the footsteps came to a sudden halt 
 
 hello called harry 
 
 there was silence harry got to his feet and peered around the tree it was too dark to see very far but he could sense somebody standing just beyond the range of his vision 
 
 there he said 
 
 and then without warning the silence was rent by a voice unlike any they had heard in the wood and it uttered not a panicked shout but what sounded like a spell 
 
 morsmordre 
 
 and something vast green and glittering erupted from the patch of darkness eyes had been struggling to penetrate it flew up over the treetops and into the sky 
 
 what the gasped ron as he sprang to his feet again staring up at the thing that had appeared 
 
 for a split second harry thought it was another leprechaun formation then he realized that it was a colossal skull comprised of what looked like emerald stars with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue as they watched it rose higher and higher blazing in a haze of greenish smoke etched against the black sky like a new constellation 
 
 suddenly the wood all around them erupted with screams harry understand why but the only possible cause was the sudden appearance of the skull which had now risen high enough to illuminate the entire wood like some grisly neon sign he scanned the darkness for the person who had conjured the skull but he see anyone 
 
 there he called again 
 
 harry come on move hermione had seized the collar of his jacket and was tugging him backward 
 
 the matter harry said startled to see her face so white and terrified 
 
 the dark mark harry hermione moaned pulling him as hard as she could sign 
 
 
 
 harry come on 
 
 harry turned ron was hurriedly scooping up his miniature krum the three of them started across the clearing but before they had taken a few hurried steps a series of popping noises announced the arrival of twenty wizards appearing from thin air surrounding them 
 
 harry whirled around and in an instant he registered one fact each of these wizards had his wand out and every wand was pointing right at himself ron and hermione 
 
 without pausing to think he yelled duck 
 
 he seized the other two and pulled them down onto the ground 
 
 stupefy roared twenty voices there was a blinding series of flashes and harry felt the hair on his head ripple as though a powerful wind had swept the clearing raising his head a fraction of an inch he saw jets of fiery red light flying over them from the wizards wands crossing one another bouncing off tree trunks rebounding into the darkness 
 
 stop yelled a voice he recognized stop my son 
 
 hair stopped blowing about he raised his head a little higher the wizard in front of him had lowered his wand he rolled over and saw mr weasley striding toward them looking terrified 
 
 ron harry his voice sounded shaky hermione are you all right 
 
 out of the way arthur said a cold curt voice 
 
 it was mr crouch he and the other ministry wizards were closing in on them harry got to his feet to face them mr face was taut with rage 
 
 which of you did it he snapped his sharp eyes darting between them which of you conjured the dark mark 
 
 we do that said harry gesturing up at the skull 
 
 we do anything said ron who was rubbing his elbow and looking indignantly at his father what did you want to attack us for 
 
 do not lie sir shouted mr crouch his wand was still pointing directly at ron and his eyes were popping he looked slightly mad you have been discovered at the scene of the crime 
 
 barty whispered a witch in a long woolen dressing gown kids barty never have been able to 
 
 where did the mark come from you three said mr weasley quickly 
 
 over there said hermione shakily pointing at the place where they had heard the voice there was someone behind the treesthey shouted words an incantation 
 
 oh stood over there did they said mr crouch turning his popping eyes on hermione now disbelief etched all over his face said an incantation did they you seem very well informed about how that mark is summoned missy 
 
 but none of the ministry wizards apart from mr crouch seemed to think it remotely likely that harry ron or hermione had conjured the skull on the contrary at words they had all raised their wands again and were pointing in the direction she had indicated squinting through the dark trees 
 
 too late said the witch in the woolen dressing gown shaking her head have disapparated 
 
 i think so said a wizard with a scrubby brown beard it was amos diggory father our stunners went right through those a good chance we got them 
 
 amos be careful said a few of the wizards warningly as mr diggory squared his shoulders raised his wand marched across the clearing and disappeared into the darkness hermione watched him vanish with her hands over her mouth 
 
 a few seconds later they heard mr diggory shout 
 
 yes we got them someone here unconscious but blimey 
 
 got someone shouted mr crouch sounding highly disbelieving who who is it 
 
 they heard snapping twigs the rustling of leaves and then crunching footsteps as mr diggory reemerged from behind the trees he was carrying a tiny limp figure in his arms harry recognized the tea towel at once it was winky 
 
 mr crouch did not move or speak as mr diggory deposited his elf on the ground at his feet the other ministry wizards were all staring at mr crouch for a few seconds crouch remained transfixed his eyes blazing in his white face as he stared down at winky then he appeared to come to life again 
 
 this cannot be he said jerkily no 
 
 he moved quickly around mr diggory and strode off toward the place where he had found winky 
 
 no point mr crouch mr diggory called after him no one else there 
 
 but mr crouch did not seem prepared to take his word for it they could hear him moving around and the rustling of leaves as he pushed the bushes aside searching 
 
 bit embarrassing mr diggory said grimly looking down at unconscious form barty mean to say 
 
 come off it amos said mr weasley quietly you seriously think it was the elf the dark a sign it requires a wand 
 
 yeah said mr diggory and she had a wand 
 
 what said mr weasley 
 
 here look mr diggory held up a wand and showed it to mr weasley had it in her hand so clause three of the code of wand use broken for a start no creature is permitted to carry or use a wand 
 
 just then there was another pop and ludo bagman apparated right next to mr weasley looking breathless and disorientated he spun on the spot goggling upward at the skull 
 
 the dark mark he panted almost trampling winky as he turned inquiringly to his colleagues who did it did you get them barry going on 
 
 mr crouch had returned his face was still ghostly white and his hands and his toothbrush mustache were both twitching 
 
 where have you been barty said bagman why you at the match your elf was saving you a seat too gulping gargoyles bagman had just noticed winky lying at his feet what happened to her 
 
 i have been busy ludo said mr crouch still talking in the same jerky fashion barely moving his lips and my elf has been stunned 
 
 stunned by you lot you mean but why 
 
 comprehension dawned suddenly on round shiny face he looked up at the skull down at winky and then at mr crouch 
 
 no he said winky conjure the dark mark she know how need a wand for a start 
 
 and she had one said mr diggory i found her holding one ludo if all right with you mr crouch i think we should hear what got to say for herself 
 
 crouch gave no sign that he had heard mr diggory but mr diggory seemed to take his silence for assent he raised his own wand pointed it at winky and said ennervate 
 
 winky stirred feebly her great brown eyes opened and she blinked several times in a bemused sort of way watched by the silent wizards she raised herself shakily into a sitting position 
 
 she caught sight of mr feet and slowly tremulously raised her eyes to stare up into his face then more slowly still she looked up into the sky harry could see the floating skull reflected twice in her enormous glassy eyes she gave a gasp looked wildly around the crowded clearing and burst into terrified sobs 
 
 elf said mr diggory sternly do you know who i am a member of the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures 
 
 winky began to rock backward and forward on the ground her breath coming in sharp bursts harry was reminded forcibly of dobby in his moments of terrified disobedience 
 
 as you see elf the dark mark was conjured here a short while ago said mr diggory and you were discovered moments later right beneath it an explanation if you please 
 
 i i i is not doing it sir winky gasped i is not knowing how sir 
 
 you were found with a wand in your hand barked mr diggory brandishing it in front of her and as the wand caught the green light that was filling the clearing from the skull above harry recognized it 
 
 hey mine he said 
 
 everyone in the clearing looked at him 
 
 excuse me said mr diggory incredulously 
 
 my wand said harry i dropped it 
 
 you dropped it repeated mr diggory in disbelief is this a confession you threw it aside after you conjured the mark 
 
 amos think who talking to said mr weasley very angrily is harry potter likely to conjure the dark mark 
 
 er of course not mumbled mr diggory sorrycarried away 
 
 i drop it there anyway said harry jerking his thumb toward the trees beneath the skull i missed it right after we got into the wood 
 
 so said mr diggory his eyes hardening as he turned to look at winky again cowering at his feet you found this wand eh elf and you picked it up and thought have some fun with it did you 
 
 i is not doing magic with it sir squealed winky tears streaming down the sides of her squashed and bulbous nose i isi isi is just picking it up sir i is not making the dark mark sir i is not knowing how 
 
 it her said hermione she looked very nervous speaking up in front of all these ministry wizards yet determined all the same got a squeaky little voice and the voice we heard doing the incantation was much deeper she looked around at harry and ron appealing for their support it sound anything like winky did it 
 
 no said harry shaking his head it definitely sound like an elf 
 
 yeah it was a human voice said ron 
 
 well soon see growled mr diggory looking unimpressed a simple way of discovering the last spell a wand performed elf did you know that 
 
 winky trembled and shook her head frantically her ears flapping as mr diggory raised his own wand again and placed it tip to tip with 
 
 prior incantato roared mr diggory 
 
 harry heard hermione gasp horrified as a gigantic skull erupted from the point where the two wands met but it was a mere shadow of the green skull high above them it looked as though it were made of thick gray smoke the ghost of a spell 
 
 deletrius mr diggory shouted and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke 
 
 so said mr diggory with a kind of savage triumph looking down upon winky who was still shaking convulsively 
 
 i is not doing it she squealed her eyes rolling in terror i is not i is not i is not knowing how i is a good elf i using wands i knowing how 
 
 been caught elf mr diggory roared caught with the guilty wand in your hand 
 
 amos said mr weasley loudly think about itprecious few wizards know how to do that would she have learned it 
 
 perhaps amos is suggesting said mr crouch cold anger in every syllable that i routinely teach my servants to conjure the dark mark 
 
 there was a deeply unpleasant silence amos diggory looked horrified mr crouchnotnot at all 
 
 you have now come very close to accusing the two people in this clearing who are least likely to conjure that mark barked mr crouch harry potter and myself i suppose you are familiar with the story amos 
 
 of course everyone knows muttered mr diggory looking highly discomforted 
 
 and i trust you remember the many proofs i have given over a long career that i despise and detest the dark arts and those who practice them mr crouch shouted his eyes bulging again 
 
 mr crouch i i never suggested you had anything to do with it amos diggory muttered again now reddening behind his scrubby brown beard 
 
 if you accuse my elf you accuse me diggory shouted mr crouch where else would she have learned to conjure it 
 
 she she picked it up anywhere 
 
 precisely amos said mr weasley she might have picked it up he said kindly turning to the elf but she flinched as though he too was shouting at her where exactly did you find wand 
 
 winky was twisting the hem of her tea towel so violently that it was fraying beneath her fingers 
 
 i i is finding itfinding it there sir she whispered therein the trees sir 
 
 you see amos said mr weasley whoever conjured the mark could have disapparated right after done it leaving wand behind a clever thing to do not using their own wand which could have betrayed them and winky here had the misfortune to come across the wand moments later and pick it up 
 
 but then have been only a few feet away from the real culprit said mr diggory impatiently elf did you see anyone 
 
 winky began to tremble worse than ever her giant eyes flickered from mr diggory to ludo bagman and onto mr crouch then she gulped and said i is seeing no one sirno one 
 
 amos said mr crouch curtly i am fully aware that in the ordinary course of events you would want to take winky into your department for questioning i ask you however to allow me to deal with her 
 
 mr diggory looked as though he think much of this suggestion at all but it was clear to harry that mr crouch was such an important member of the ministry that he did not dare refuse him 
 
 you may rest assured that she will be punished mr crouch added coldly 
 
 winky stammered looking up at mr crouch her eyes brimming with tears 
 
 mr crouch stared back his face somehow sharpened each line upon it more deeply etched there was no pity in his gaze 
 
 winky has behaved tonight in a manner i would not have believed possible he said slowly i told her to remain in the tent i told her to stay there while i went to sort out the trouble and i find that she disobeyed me this means clothes 
 
 no shrieked winky prostrating herself at mr feet no master not clothes not clothes 
 
 harry knew that the only way to turn a free was to present it with proper garments it was pitiful to see the way winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over mr feet 
 
 but she was frightened hermione burst out angrily glaring at mr crouch your scared of heights and those wizards in masks were levitating people you blame her for wanting to get out of their way 
 
 mr crouch took a step backward freeing himself from contact with the elf whom he was surveying as though she were something filthy and rotten that was contaminating his shoes 
 
 i have no use for a who disobeys me he said coldly looking over at hermione i have no use for a servant who forgets what is due to her master and to her reputation 
 
 winky was crying so hard that her sobs echoed around the clearing there was a very nasty silence which was ended by mr weasley who said quietly well i think take my lot back to the tent if got any objections amos that told us all it can if harry could have it back please 
 
 mr diggory handed harry his wand and harry pocketed it 
 
 come on you three mr weasley said quietly but hermione seem to want to move her eyes were still upon the sobbing elf hermione mr weasley said more urgently she turned and followed harry and ron out of the clearing and off through the trees 
 
 going to happen to winky said hermione the moment they had left the clearing 
 
 i know said mr weasley 
 
 the way they were treating her said hermione furiously mr diggory calling her elf all the timeand mr crouch he knows she do it and still going to sack her he care how frightened been or how upset she was it was like she even human 
 
 well not said ron 
 
 hermione rounded on him 
 
 that mean she got feelings ron disgusting the way 
 
 hermione i agree with you said mr weasley quickly beckoning her on but now is not the time to discuss elf rights i want to get back to the tent as fast as we can what happened to the others 
 
 we lost them in the dark said ron dad why was everyone so uptight about that skull thing 
 
 explain everything back at the tent said mr weasley tensely 
 
 but when they reached the edge of the wood their progress was impeded a large crowd of witches and wizards was congregated there and when they saw mr weasley coming toward them many of them surged forward 
 
 going on in there 
 
 who conjured it 
 
 arthur not him 
 
 of course not him said mr weasley impatiently we know who it was it looks like they disapparated now excuse me please i want to get to bed 
 
 he led harry ron and hermione through the crowd and back into the campsite all was quiet now there was no sign of the masked wizards though several ruined tents were still smoking 
 
 head was poking out of the boys tent 
 
 dad going on he called through the dark fred george and ginny got back okay but the others 
 
 got them here said mr weasley bending down and entering the tent harry ron and hermione entered after him 
 
 bill was sitting at the small kitchen table holding a bedsheet to his arm which was bleeding profusely charlie had a large rip in his shirt and percy was sporting a bloody nose fred george and ginny looked unhurt though shaken 
 
 did you get them dad said bill sharply the person who conjured the mark 
 
 no said mr weasley we found barry elf holding wand but none the wiser about who actually conured the mark 
 
 what said bill charlie and percy together 
 
 wand said fred 
 
 mr elf said percy sounding thunderstruck 
 
 with some assistance from harry ron and hermione mr weasley explained what had happened in the woods when they had finished their story percy swelled indignantly 
 
 well mr crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that he said running away when expressly told her not toembarrassing him in front of the whole ministryhow would that have looked if been brought up in front of the department for the regulation and control 
 
 she do anything she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time hermione snapped at percy who looked very taken aback hermione had always got on fairly well with percy better indeed than any of the others 
 
 hermione a wizard in mr position afford a going to run amok with a wand said percy pompously recovering himself 
 
 she run amok shouted hermione she just picked it up off the ground 
 
 look can someone just explain what that skull thing was said ron impatiently it hurting it such a big deal 
 
 i told you symbol ron said hermione before anyone else could answer i read about it in the rise and fall of the dark arts 
 
 and it been seen for thirteen years said mr weasley quietly of course people panickedit was almost like seeing back again 
 
 i get it said ron frowning i still only a shape in the sky 
 
 ron and his followers sent the dark mark into the air whenever they killed said mr weasley the terror it inspiredyou have no idea too young just picture coming home and finding the dark mark hovering over your house and knowing what about to find inside mr weasley winced worst fearthe very worst 
 
 there was silence for a moment then bill removing the sheet from his arm to check on his cut said well it help us tonight whoever conjured it it scared the death eaters away the moment they saw it they all disapparated before got near enough to unmask any of them we caught the robertses before they hit the ground though having their memories modified right now 
 
 death eaters said harry what are death eaters 
 
 what supporters called themselves said bill i think we saw left of them tonight the ones who managed to keep themselves out of azkaban anyway 
 
 we prove it was them bill said mr weasley though it probably was he added hopelessly 
 
 yeah i bet it was said ron suddenly dad we met draco malfoy in the woods and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks and we all know the malfoys were right in with 
 
 but what were supporters harry began everybody flinched like most of the wizarding world the weasleys always avoided saying name sorry said harry quickly what were supporters up to levitating muggles i mean what was the point 
 
 the point said mr weasley with a hollow laugh harry their idea of fun half the muggle killings back when was in power were done for fun i suppose they had a few drinks tonight and resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large a nice little reunion for them he finished disgustedly 
 
 but if they were the death eaters why did they disapparate when they saw the dark mark said ron have been pleased to see it they 
 
 use your brains ron said bill if they really were death eaters they worked very hard to keep out of azkaban when lost power and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people i bet be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back they denied ever been involved with him when he lost his powers and went back to their daily reckon be with them do you 
 
 sowhoever conjured the dark mark said hermione slowly were they doing it to show support for the death eaters or to scare them away 
 
 your guess is as good as ours hermione said mr weasley but tell you thisit was only the death eaters who ever knew how to conjure it be very surprised if the person who did it been a death eater once even if not very late and if your mother hears happened be worried sick get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early portkey out of here 
 
 harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing he knew he ought to feel exhausted it was nearly three in the morning but he felt and worried 
 
 three days ago it felt like much longer but it had only been three days he had awoken with his scar burning and tonight for the first time in thirteen years lord mark had appeared in the sky what did these things mean 
 
 he thought of the letter he had written to sirius before leaving privet drive would sirius have gotten it yet when would he reply harry lay looking up at the canvas but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep and it was a long time after snores filled the tent that harry finally dozed off 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine the woes of mrs weasleycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 abrupt departure took harry completely by surprise he remained sitting where he was in the chained chair struggling with his feelings of shock and relief the wizengamot were all getting to their feet talking gathering up their papers and packing them away harry stood up nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on right who was now gazing down at him instead of at dumbledore ignoring her he tried to catch eye or madam wanting to ask whether he was free to go but fudge seemed quite determined not to notice harry and madam bones was busy with her briefcase so he took a lew tentative steps towards the exit and when nobody called him back broke into a very fast walk 
 
 he took the last lew steps at a run wrenched open the door and almost collided with mr weasley who was standing right outside looking pale and apprehensive 
 
 dumbledore say 
 
 cleared harry said pulling the door closed behind him of all charges 
 
 beaming mr weasley seized harry by the shoulders 
 
 harry wonderful well of course they have found you guilty not on the evidence but even so i pretend i 
 
 but mr weasley broke off because the courtroom door had ust opened again the wizengamot were filing out 
 
 beard exclaimed mr weasley wonderingly pulling harry aside to let them all pass you were tried by the full court 
 
 i think so said harry quietly 
 
 one or two of the wizards nodded to harry as they passed and a few including madam bones said morning arthur to mr weasley but most averted their eyes cornelius fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon fudge acted as though mr weasley and harry were part of the wall but again the witch looked almost appraisingly at harry as she passed last of all to pass was percy like fudge he completely ignored his father and harry he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quills his back rigid and his nose in the air the lines around mr mouth tightened slightly but other than this he gave no sign that he had seen his third son 
 
 going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news he said beckoning harry forwards as heels disappeared up the steps to level nine drop you off on the way to that toilet in bethnal green come on 
 
 so what will you have to do about the toilet harry asked grinning everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual it was starting to sink in he was cleared he was going back to hogwarts 
 
 oh a simple enough said mr weasley as they mounted the stairs but not so much having to repair the damage more the attitude behind the vandalism harry might strike some wizards as funny but an expression of something much deeper and nastier and i for one 
 
 mr weasley broke off in they had just reached the corridor and cornelius fudge was standing a few feet away from them talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed pale face 
 
 the second man turned at the sound of their footsteps he too broke off in his cold grey eyes narrowed and fixed upon face 
 
 well well well patronus potter said lucius malfoy coolly 
 
 harry felt winded as though he had just walked into something solid he had last seen those cold grey eyes through slits in a death hood and last heard that voice jeering in a dark graveyard while lord voldemort tortured him harry could not believe that lucius malfoy dared look him in the face he could not believe that he was here in the ministry of magic or that cornelius fudge was talking to him when harry had told fudge mere weeks ago that malfoy was a death eater 
 
 the minister was just telling me about your lucky escape potter drawled mr malfoy quite astonishing the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes snakelike in fact 
 
 mr weasley gripped shoulder in warning 
 
 yeah said harry yeah good at escaping 
 
 lucius malfoy raised his eyes to mr face 
 
 and arthur weasley too what are you doing here arthur 
 
 i work here said mr weasley curtly 
 
 not here surely said mr malfoy raising his eyebrows and glancing towards the door over mr shoulder i thought you were up on the second floor you do something that involves sneaking muggle artefacts home and bewitching them 
 
 no mr weasley snapped his fingers now biting into shoulder 
 
 what areyou doing here anyway harry asked lucius malfoy 
 
 i think private matters between myself and the minister are any concern of yours potter said malfoy smoothing the front of his robes harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold really just because you are favourite boy you must not expect the same indulgence from the rest of us shall we go up to your office then minister 
 
 certainly said fudge turning his back on harry and mr weasley this way lucius 
 
 they strode off together talking in low voices mr weasley did not let go of shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift 
 
 why he waiting outside office if got business to do together harry burst out furiously what was he doing down here 
 
 trying to sneak down to the courtroom if you ask me said mr weasley looking extremely agitated and glancing over his shoulder as though making sure they could not be overheard trying to find out whether been expelled or not leave a note for dumbledore when i drop you off he ought to know been talking to fudge again 
 
 what private business have they got together anyway 
 
 gold i expect said mr weasley angrily been giving generously to all sorts of things for years gets him in with the right people then he can ask favours delay laws he want passed oh very lucius malfoy 
 
 the lift arrived it was empty except for a flock of memos that flapped around mr head as he pressed the button for the atrium and the doors clanged shut he waved them away irritably 
 
 mr weasley said harry slowly if fudge is meeting death eaters like malfoy if seeing them alone how do we know they put the imperius curse on him 
 
 think it occurred to us harry said mr weasley quietly but dumbledore thinks fudge is acting of his own accord at the momentwhich as dumbledore says is not a lot of comfort best not talk about it any more just now harry 
 
 the doors slid open and they stepped out into the now atrium eric the watchwizard was hidden behind his daily prophet again they had walked straight past the golden fountain before harry remembered 
 
 wait he told mr weasley and pulling his moneybag from his pocket he turned back to the fountain 
 
 he looked up into the handsome face but up close harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish the witch was wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant and from what harry knew of goblins and centaurs they were most unlikely to be caught staring so soppily at humans of any description only the attitude of creeping servility looked convincing with a grin at the thought of what hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf harry turned his moneybag and emptied not just ten galleons but the whole contents into the pool at the statues feet 
 
 i knew it yelled ron punching the air you always get away with stuff 
 
 they were bound to clear you said hermione who had looked positively faint with anxiety when harry had entered the kitchen and was now holding a shaking hand over her eyes there was no case against you none at all 
 
 everyone seems quite relieved though considering you all knew get off said harry smiling 
 
 mrs weasley was wiping her face on her apron and fred george and ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enough settle down shouted mr weasley though he too was smiling listen sirius lucius malfoy was at the ministry 
 
 what said sirius sharply 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 be quiet you three yes we saw him talking to fudge on level nine then they went up to office together dumbledore ought to know 
 
 absolutely said sirius tell him worry 
 
 well better get going a vomiting toilet waiting for me in bethnal green molly be late covering for tonks but kingsley might be dropping in for dinner 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 enoughfredgeorgeginny said mrs weasley as mr weasley left the kitchen harry dear come and sit down have some lunch you hardly ate breakfast 
 
 ron and hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at grimmauld place and feeling of giddy relief which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with lucius malfoy swelled again the gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden even kreacher looked less ugly as he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise 
 
 course once dumbledore turned up on your side there was no way they were going to convict you said ron happily now dishing great mounds of mashed potato on to plates 
 
 yeah he swung it for me said harry he felt it would sound highly ungrateful not to mention childish to say i wish talked to me though or even looked at me 
 
 and as he thought this the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it 
 
 up said hermione looking alarmed 
 
 scar harry mumbled but nothing it happens all the time now 
 
 none of the others had noticed a thing all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over narrow escape fred george and ginny were still singing hermione looked rather anxious but before she could say anything ron had said happily i bet dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us you know 
 
 i think be able to ron said mrs weasley setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of harry really very busy at the moment 
 
 he got off he got off he got off 
 
 shut up roared mrs weasley 
 
 over the next few days harry could not help noticing that there was one person within number twelve grimmauld place who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to hogwarts sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news wringing hand and beaming just like the rest of them soon however he was moodier and surlier than before talking less to everybody even harry and spending increasing amounts of time shut up in his room with buckbeak 
 
 you go feeling guilty said hermione sternly after harry had confided some of his feelings to her and ron while they scrubbed out a mouldy cupboard on the third floor a few days later you belong at hogwarts and sirius knows it personally i think being selfish 
 
 a bit harsh hermione said ron frowning as he attempted to prise off a bit of mould that had attached itself firmly to his finger you want to be stuck inside this house without any company 
 
 have company said hermione headquarters to the order of the phoenix it he just got his hopes up that harry would be coming to live here with him 
 
 i think true said harry wringing out his cloth he give me a straight answer when i asked him if i could 
 
 he just want to get his own hopes up even more said hermione wisely and he probably felt a bit guilty himself because i think a part of him was really hoping be expelled then both be outcasts together 
 
 come off it said harry and ron together but hermione merely shrugged 
 
 suit yourselves but i sometimes think right and sirius gets confused about whether you or your father harry 
 
 so you think touched in the head said harry heatedly 
 
 no i just think been very lonely for a long time said hermione simply 
 
 at this point mrs weasley entered the bedroom behind them 
 
 still not finished she said poking her head into the cupboard 
 
 i thought you might be here to tell us to have a break said ron bitterly know how much mould got rid of since we arrived here 
 
 you were so keen to help the order said mrs weasley you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in 
 
 i feel like a grumbled ron 
 
 well now you understand what dreadful lives they lead perhaps be a bit more active in said hermione hopefully as mrs weasley left them to it you know maybe it be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the timewe could do a sponsored scrub of gryffindor common room all proceeds to it would raise awareness as well as funds 
 
 sponsor you to shut up about spew ron muttered irritably but only so harry could hear him 
 
 harry found himself daydreaming about hogwarts more and more as the end of the holidays approached he could not wait to see hagrid again to play quidditch even to stroll across the vegetable patches to the herbology greenhouses it would be a treat just to leave this dusty musty house where half of the cupboards were still bolted shut and kreacher wheezed insults out of the shadows as you passed though harry was careful not to say any of this within earshot of sirius 
 
 the fact was that living at the headquarters of the movement was not nearly as interesting or exciting as harry would have expected before experienced it though members of the order of the phoenix came and went regularly sometimes staying for meals sometimes only for a few minutes of whispered conversation mrs weasley made sure that harry and the others were kept well out of earshot whether extendable or normal and nobody not even sirius seemed to feel that harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival 
 
 on the very last day of the holidays harry was sweeping up owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelopes 
 
 booklists have arrived he said throwing one of the envelopes up to harry who was standing on a chair about time i thought forgotten they usually come much earlier than this 
 
 harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over head into the wastepaper basket in the corner which swallowed it and belched loudly he then opened his letter it contained two pieces of parchment one the usual reminder that term started on the first of september the other telling him which books he would need for the coming year 
 
 only two new ones he said reading the list the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk and defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 crack 
 
 fred and george apparated right beside harry he was so used to them doing this by now that he even fall off his chair 
 
 we were just wondering who assigned the slinkhard book said fred conversationally 
 
 because it means found a new defence against the dark arts teacher said george 
 
 and about time too said fred 
 
 what mean harry asked jumping down beside them 
 
 well we overheard mum and dad talking on the extendable ears a few weeks back fred told harry and from what they were saying dumbledore was having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year 
 
 not surprising is it when you look at happened to the last four said george 
 
 one sacked one dead memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine months said harry counting them off on his fingers yeah i see what you mean 
 
 up with you ron asked fred 
 
 ron did not answer harry looked round ron was standing very still with his mouth slightly open gaping at his letter from hogwarts 
 
 the matter said fred impatiently moving around ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment 
 
 mouth fell open too 
 
 prefect he said staring incredulously at the letter prefect 
 
 george leapt forward seized the envelope in other hand and turned it harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into palm 
 
 no way said george in a hushed voice 
 
 been a mistake said fred snatching the letter out of grasp and holding it up to the light as though checking for a watermark no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 the twins heads turned in unison and both of them stared at harry 
 
 we thought you were a cert said fred in a tone that suggested harry had tricked them in some way 
 
 we thought dumbledore was bound to pick you said george indignantly 
 
 winning the triwizard and everything said fred 
 
 i suppose all the mad stuff counted against him said george to fred 
 
 yeah said fred slowly yeah caused too much trouble mate well at least one of got their priorities right 
 
 he strode over to harry and clapped him on the back while giving ron a scathing look 
 
 prefect ickle ronnie the prefect 
 
 oh going to be revolting groaned george thrusting the prefect badge back at ron as though it might contaminate him 
 
 ron who still had not said a word took the badge stared at it for a moment then held it out to harry as though asking mutely for confirmation that it was genuine harry took it a large p was superimposed on the gryffindor lion he had seen a badge just like this on chest on his very first day at hogwarts 
 
 the door banged open hermione came tearing into the room her cheeks flushed and her hair flying there was an envelope in her hand 
 
 did youdid you get 
 
 she spotted the badge in hand and let out a shriek 
 
 i knew it she said excitedly brandishing her letter me too harry me too 
 
 no said harry quickly pushing the badge back into hand ron not me 
 
 itwhat 
 
 prefect not me harry said 
 
 ron said hermione her jaw dropping but are you sure i mean 
 
 she turned red as ron looked round at her with a defiant expression on his lace 
 
 my name on the letter he said 
 
 i said hermione looking thoroughly bewildered i well wow well done ron really 
 
 unexpected said george nodding 
 
 no said hermione blushing harder than ever no not done loads of really 
 
 the door behind her opened a little wider and mrs weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robes 
 
 ginny said the booklists had come at last she said glancing around at all the envelopes as she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robes into two piles if you give them to me take them over to diagon alley this afternoon and get your books while packing ron have to get you more pyjamas these are at least six inches too short i believe how fast growing what colour would you like 
 
 get him red and gold to match his badge said george smirking 
 
 match his what said mrs weasley absently rolling up a pair of maroon socks and placing them on pile 
 
 his badge said fred with the air of getting the worst over quickly his lovely shiny new badge 
 
 words took a moment to penetrate mrs preoccupation with pyjamas 
 
 his but ron not 
 
 ron held up his badge 
 
 mrs weasley let out a shriek just like 
 
 i believe it i believe it oh ron how wonderful a prefect everyone in the family 
 
 what are fred and i neighbours said george indignantly as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son 
 
 wait until your father hears ron so proud of you what wonderful news you could end up head boy just like bill and percy the first step oh what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry just thrilled oh ronnie 
 
 fred and george were both making loud retching noises behind her back but mrs weasley did not notice arms tight around neck she was kissing him all over his face which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge 
 
 mum mum get a grip he muttered trying to push her away 
 
 she let go of him and said breathlessly well what will it be we gave percy an owl but already got one of course 
 
 do you mean said ron looking as though he did not dare believe his ears 
 
 got to have a reward for this said mrs weasley fondly how about a nice new set of dress robes 
 
 already bought him some said fred sourly who looked as though he sincerely regretted this generosity 
 
 or a new cauldron old rusting through or a new rat you always liked scabbers 
 
 mum said ron hopefully can i have a new broom 
 
 mrs face fell slightly broomsticks were expensive 
 
 not a really good one ron hastened to add justjust a new one for a change 
 
 mrs weasley hesitated then smiled 
 
 of course you can well better get going if got a broom to buy too see you all later little ronnie a prefect and forget to pack your trunks a prefect oh all of a dither 
 
 she gave ron yet another kiss on the cheek sniffed loudly and bustled from the room 
 
 fred and george exchanged looks 
 
 you mind if we kiss you do you ron said fred in a falsely anxious voice 
 
 we could curtsey if you like said george 
 
 oh shut up said ron scowling at them 
 
 or what said fred an evil grin spreading across his face going to put us in detention 
 
 love to see him try sniggered george 
 
 he could if you watch out said hermione angrily 
 
 fred and george burst out laughing and ron muttered drop it hermione 
 
 going to have to watch our step george said fred pretending to tremble with these two on our case 
 
 yeah it looks like our days are finally over said george shaking his head 
 
 and with another loud crack the twins disapparated 
 
 those two said hermione furiously staring up at the ceiling through which they could now hear fred and george roaring with laughter in the room upstairs pay any attention to them ron only jealous 
 
 i think they are said ron doubtfully also looking up at the ceiling always said only prats become prefects still he added on a happier note never had new brooms i wish i could go with mum and choose never be able to afford a nimbus but the new cleansweep out be great yeah i think go and tell her i like the cleansweep just so she knows 
 
 he dashed from the room leaving harry and hermione alone 
 
 for some reason harry found he did not want to look at hermione he turned to his bed picked up the pile of clean robes mrs weasley had laid on it and crossed the room to his trunk 
 
 harry said hermione tentatively 
 
 well done hermione said harry so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all and still not looking at her brilliant prefect great 
 
 thanks said hermione ermharrycould i borrow hedwig so i can tell mum and dad be really pleasedi mean prefect is something they can understand 
 
 yeah no problem said harry still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him take her 
 
 he leaned over his trunk laid the robes on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called hedwig down a few moments passed harry heard the door close but remained bent double listening the only sounds he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings 
 
 he straightened up and looked behind him hermione had left and hedwig had gone harry hurried across the room closed the door then returned slowly to his bed and sank on to it gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe 
 
 he had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year he had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way towards certain people but if he had remembered if he had thought about it what would he have expected 
 
 not this said a small and truthful voice inside his head 
 
 harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands he could not lie to himself if he had known the prefect badge was on its way he would have expected it to come to him not ron did this make him as arrogant as draco malfoy did he think himself superior to everyone else did he really believe he was better than ron 
 
 no said the small voice defiantly 
 
 was that true harry wondered anxiously probing his own feelings 
 
 better at quidditch said the voice but not better at anything else 
 
 that was definitely true harry thought he was no better than ron in lessons but what about outside lessons what about those adventures he ron and hermione had had together since starting at hogwarts often risking much worse than expulsion 
 
 well ron and hermione were with me most of the time said the voice in head 
 
 not all the time though harry argued with himself they fight quirrell with me they take on riddle and the basilisk they get rid of all those dementors the night sirius escaped they in that graveyard with me the night voldemort returned 
 
 and the same feeling of that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again definitely done more harry thought indignantly done more than either of them 
 
 but maybe said the small voice fairly maybe dumbledore choose prefects because got themselves into a load of dangerous situations maybe he chooses them for other reasons ron must have something you 
 
 harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the clawed feet remembering what fred had said 
 
 no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect 
 
 harry gave a small snort of laughter a second later he felt sickened with himself 
 
 ron had not asked dumbledore to give him the prefect badge this was not fault was he harry best friend in the world going to sulk because he have a badge laugh with the twins behind back ruin this for ron when for the first time he had beaten harry at something 
 
 at this point harry heard footsteps on the stairs again he stood up straightened his glasses and hitched a grin on to his face as ron bounded back through the door 
 
 just caught her he said happily she says get the cleansweep if she can 
 
 cool harry said and he was relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty listenronwell done mate 
 
 the smile faded off face 
 
 i never thought it would be me he said shaking his head i thought it would be you 
 
 nah caused too much trouble harry said echoing fred 
 
 yeah said ron yeah i suppose well better get our trunks packed we 
 
 it was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived it took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their books and belongings from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunks marry noticed that ron kept moving his badge around first placing it on his bedside table then putting it into his jeans pocket then taking it out and lying it on his folded robes as though to see the effect of the red on the black only when fred and george dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a permanent sticking charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon socks and lock it in his trunk 
 
 mrs weasley returned from diagon alley around six laden with books and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that ron took from her with a moan of longing 
 
 never mind unwrapping it now people are arriving for dinner i want you all downstairs she said but the moment she was out of sight ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom an ecstatic expression on his face 
 
 down in the basement mrs weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table which read congratulations ron and hermionenew prefects she looked in a better mood than harry had seen her all holiday 
 
 i thought have a little party not a dinner she told harry ron hermione fred george and ginny as they entered the room your father and bill are on their way ron sent them both owls and thrilled she added beaming 
 
 fred rolled his eyes 
 
 sirius lupin tonks and kingsley shacklebolt were already there and moody stumped in shortly after harry had got himself a butterbeer 
 
 oh alastor i am glad here said mrs weasley brightly as shrugged off his travelling cloak been wanting to ask you for agescould you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell us inside it we wanted to open it just in case something really nasty 
 
 no problem molly 
 
 eye swivelled upwards and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen 
 
 drawing room he growled as the pupil contracted desk in the corner yeah i see it yeah a boggart want me to go up and get rid of it molly 
 
 no no do it myself later beamed mrs weasley you have your drink having a little bit of a celebration actually she gestured at the scarlet banner fourth prefect in the family she said fondly ruffling hair 
 
 prefect eh growled moody his normal eye on ron and his magical eye swivelling around to gaze into the side of his head harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it was looking at him and moved away towards sirius and lupin 
 
 well congratulations said moody still glaring at ron with his normal eye authority figures always attract trouble but i suppose dumbledore thinks you can withstand most major jinxes or he have appointed you 
 
 ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but was saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother mrs weasley was in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought mundungus with them he was wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely places and declined the offer to remove it and put it with travelling cloak 
 
 well i think a toast is in order said mr weasley when everyone had a drink he raised his goblet to ron and hermione the new gryffindor prefects 
 
 ron and hermione beamed as everyone drank to them and then applauded 
 
 i was never a prefect myself said tonks brightly from behind harry as everybody moved towards the table to help themselves to food her hair was tomato red and today she looked like older sister my head of house said i lacked certain necessary qualities 
 
 like what said ginny who was choosing a baked potato 
 
 like the ability to behave myself said tonks 
 
 ginny laughed hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it 
 
 what about you sirius ginny asked thumping hermione on the back 
 
 sirius who was right beside harry let out his usual laugh 
 
 no one would have made me a prefect i spent too much time in detention with james lupin was the good boy he got the badge 
 
 i think dumbledore might have hoped i would be able to exercise some control over my best friends said lupin i need scarcely say that i failed dismally 
 
 mood suddenly lifted his father had not been a prefect either all at once the party seemed much more enjoyable he loaded up his plate feeling doubly fond of everyone in the room 
 
 ron was rhapsodising about his new broom to anybody who would listen 
 
 nought to seventy in ten seconds not bad is it when you think the comet two only nought to sixty and with a decent tailwind according to which broomstick 
 
 hermione was talking very earnestly to lupin about her view of elf rights 
 
 i mean the same kind of nonsense as werewolf segregation it it all stems from this horrible thing wizards have of thinking superior to other creatures 
 
 mrs weasley and bill were having their usual argument about hair 
 
 getting really out of hand and so it would look much better shorter it harry 
 
 ohi dunno said harry slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion he slid away from them in the direction of fred and george who were huddled in a corner with mundungus 
 
 mundungus stopped talking when he saw harry but fred winked and beckoned harry closer 
 
 ok he told mundungus we can trust harry our financial backer 
 
 look what got us said george holding out his hand to harry it was full of what looked like shrivelled black pods a faint rattling noise was coming from them even though they were completely stationary 
 
 venomous tentacula seeds said george we need them for the skiving snackboxes but a class c substance so been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them 
 
 ten galleons the lot then dung said fred 
 
 wiv all the trouble i went to to get em said mundungus his saggy bloodshot eyes stretching even wider sorry lads but not taking a knut under twenty 
 
 dung likes his little joke fred said to harry 
 
 yeah his best one so far has been six sickles for a bag of knarl quills said george 
 
 be careful harry warned them quietly 
 
 what said fred busy cooing over prefect ron okay 
 
 but moody could have his eye on you harry pointed out 
 
 mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder 
 
 good point that he grunted all right lads ten it is if take em quick 
 
 cheers harry said fred delightedly when mundungus had emptied his pockets into the twins outstretched hands and scuttled off towards the food better get these upstairs 
 
 harry watched them go feeling slightly uneasy it had just occurred to him that mr and mrs weasley would want to know how fred and george were financing their joke shop business when as was inevitable they finally found out about it giving the twins his triwizard winnings had seemed a simple thing to do at the time but what if it led to another family row and a estrangement would mrs weasley still feel that harry was as good as her son if she found out he had made it possible for fred and george to start a career she thought quite unsuitable 
 
 standing where the twins had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company harry caught the sound of his own name kingsley deep voice was audible even over the surrounding chatter 
 
 why dumbledore make potter a prefect said kingsley 
 
 have had his reasons replied lupin 
 
 but it shown confidence in him what done persisted kingsley specially with the daily prophet having a go at him every few days 
 
 harry did not look round he did not want lupin or kingsley to know he had heard though not remotely hungry he followed mundungus back towards the table his pleasure in the party had evaporated as quickly as it had come he wished he were upstairs in bed 
 
 moody was sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his nose evidently he could not detect any trace of poison because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth 
 
 the made of spanish oak with varnish and vibration control ron was saying to tonks 
 
 mrs weasley yawned widely 
 
 well i think sort out that boggart before i turn in arthur i want this lot up too late all right night harry dear 
 
 she left the kitchen harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention 
 
 you all right potter grunted moody 
 
 yeah fine lied harry 
 
 moody took a swig from his hipflask his eye staring sideways at harry 
 
 come here got something that might interest you he said 
 
 from an inner pocket of his robes moody pulled a very tattered old wizarding photograph 
 
 original order of the phoenix growled moody found it last night when i was looking for my spare invisibility cloak seeing as podmore had the manners to return my best one thought people might like to see it 
 
 harry took the photograph a small crowd of people some waving at him others lifting their glasses looked back up at him 
 
 me said moody unnecessarily pointing at himself the moody in the picture was unmistakeable though his hair was slightly less grey and his nose was intact and dumbledore beside me dedalus diggle on the other side marlene mckinnon she was killed two weeks after this was taken they got her whole family frank and alice longbottom 
 
 stomach already uncomfortable clenched as he looked at alice longbottom he knew her round friendly face very well even though he had never met her because she was the image of her son neville 
 
 poor devils growled moody better dead than what happened to them and emmeline vance met her and that lupin obviously benjy fenwick he copped it too we only ever found bits of him shift aside there he added poking the picture and the little photographic people edged sideways so that those who were partially obscured could move to the front 
 
 edgar bones brother of amelia bones they got him and his family too he was a great wizard sturgis podmore blimey he looks young caradoc dearborn vanished six months after this we never found his body hagrid of course looks exactly the same as ever elphias doge met him forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat gideon prewett it took five death eaters to kill him and his brother fabian they fought like heroes budge along budge along 
 
 the little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture 
 
 brother aberforth only time i ever met him strange bloke dorcas meadowes voldemort killed her personally sirius when he still had short hair and there you go thought that would interest you 
 
 heart turned over his mother and father were beaming up at him sitting on either side of a small man whom harry recognised at once as wormtail the one who had betrayed his parents whereabouts to voldemort and so helped to bring about their deaths 
 
 eh said moody 
 
 harry looked up into moody s heavily scarred and pitted face evidently moody was under the impression he had just given harry a bit of a treat 
 
 yeah said harry once again attempting to grin er listen just remembered i packed my 
 
 he was spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed sirius had just said that got there and moody had turned towards him harry crossed the kitchen slipped through the door and up the stairs before anyone could call him back 
 
 he did not know why it had been such a shock he had seen pictures of his parents before after all and he had met wormtail but to have them sprung on him like that when he was least expecting it no one would like that he thought angrily 
 
 and then to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces benjy fenwick who had been found in bits and gideon prewett who had died like a hero and the longbottoms who had been tortured into madness all waving happily out of the photograph forever more not knowing that they were doomed well moody might find that interesting he harry found it disturbing 
 
 harry tiptoed up the stairs in the hall past the stuffed glad to be on his own again but as he approached the first landing he heard noises someone was sobbing in the drawing room 
 
 hello harry said 
 
 there was no answer but the sobbing continued he climbed the remaining stairs two at a time walked across the landing and opened the door 
 
 someone was cowering against the dark wall her wand in her hand her whole body shaking with sobs sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight clearly dead was ron 
 
 all the air seemed to vanish from lungs he felt as though he were falling through the floor his brain turned icy coldron dead no it be 
 
 but wait a moment it be ron was downstairs 
 
 mrs weasley harry croaked 
 
 mrs weasley sobbed pointing her shaking wand at body 
 
 crack 
 
 body turned into on his back his eyes wide open and empty mrs weasley sobbed harder than ever 
 
 she sobbed again 
 
 crack 
 
 mr body replaced his glasses askew a trickle of blood running down his face 
 
 no mrs weasley moaned no riddikulus riddikulus riddikulus 
 
 crack dead twins crack dead percy crack dead harry 
 
 mrs weasley just get out of here shouted harry staring down at his own dead body on the floor let someone else 
 
 going on 
 
 lupin had come running into the room closely followed by sirius with moody stumping along behind them lupin looked from mrs weasley to the dead harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant pulling out his own wand he said very firmly and clearly riddikulus 
 
 body vanished a silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke 
 
 ohohoh gulped mrs weasley and she broke into a storm of crying her face in her hands 
 
 molly said lupin bleakly walking over to her molly 
 
 next second she was sobbing her heart out on shoulder 
 
 molly it was just a boggart he said soothingly patting her on the head just a stupid boggart 
 
 i see them all the time mrs weasley moaned into his shoulder all the i about it 
 
 sirius was staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart pretending to be body had lain moody was looking at harry who avoided his gaze he had a funny feeling magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen 
 
 tell arthur mrs weasley was gulping now mopping her eyes frantically with her cuffs i want him to know being silly 
 
 lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose 
 
 harry so sorry what must you think of me she said shakily not even able to get rid of a boggart 
 
 be stupid said harry trying to smile 
 
 just worried she said tears spilling out of her eyes again half the in the order a miracle if we all come through this and not talking to us what if something happens and never it up with him and going to happen if arthur and i get killed to look after ron and ginny 
 
 molly enough said lupin firmly this like last time the order are better prepared got a head start we know what up to 
 
 mrs weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name 
 
 oh molly come on about time you got used to hearing his namelook i promise no going to get hurt nobody can promise that but much better off than we were last time you in the order then you understand last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the death eaters and they were picking us off one by one 
 
 harry thought of the photograph again of his parents beaming faces he knew moody was still watching him 
 
 worry about percy said sirius abruptly come round only a matter of time before voldemort moves into the open once he does the whole going to be begging us to forgive them and not sure be accepting their apology he added bitterly 
 
 and as for going to look after ron and ginny if you and arthur died said lupin smiling slightly what do you think do let them starve 
 
 mrs weasley smiled tremulously 
 
 being silly she muttered again mopping her eyes 
 
 but harry closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later could not think mrs weasley silly he could still see his parents beaming up at him from the battered old photograph unaware that their lives like so many of those around them were drawing to a close the image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of mrs family in turn kept flashing before his eyes 
 
 without warning the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly 
 
 cut it out he said firmly rubbing the scar as the pain receded 
 
 first sign of madness talking to your own head said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall 
 
 harry ignored it he felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had got a badge 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine the princecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry and ron met hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning hoping for some support in his theory harry lost no time in telling hermione what he had overheard malfoy saying on the hogwarts express 
 
 but he was obviously showing off for parkinson he interjected ron quickly before hermione could say anything 
 
 well she said uncertainly i know it would be like malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is but a big lie to tell 
 
 exactly said harry but he could nor press the point because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands 
 
 rude to point ron snapped at a particularly minuscule boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole the boy who had been muttering something about harry behind his hand to his friend promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm ron sniggered i love being a sixth year and going to be getting free time this year whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax 
 
 going to need that time for studying ron said hermione as they set off down the corridor 
 
 yeah but not today said ron going to be a real loss i reckon 
 
 hold it said hermione throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year who was attempting to push past her with a disk clutched tightly in his hand fanged frisbees banned hand it over she told him sternly the scowling boy handed over the snarling frisbee ducked under her arm and took off after his friends ron waited for him to vanish then tugged the frisbee from grip 
 
 excellent always wanted one of these 
 
 remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle lavender brown had apparently found remark highly amusing she continued to laugh as she passed them glancing back at ron over her shoulder ron looked rather pleased with himself 
 
 the ceiling of the great hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail wispy clouds just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows while they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon harry and ron told hermione about their embarassing conversation with hagrid the previous evening 
 
 but he really think continue care of magical creatures she said looking distressed i mean when has any of us expressed you know any enthusiasm 
 
 it though innit said ron swallowing an entire fried egg whole we were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like hagrid but he thinks we liked the stupid subject reckon going to go on to 
 
 neither harry nor hermione answered there was no need they knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue care of magical creatures they avoided eye and returned his cheery wave only when he left the staff table ten minutes later 
 
 after they had eaten they remained in their places awaiting professor descent from the staff table the distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year for professor mcgonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary grades to continue with their chosen 
 
 hermione was immediately cleared to continue with charms defense against the dark arts transfiguration herbology arithmancy ancient runes and potions and shot off to a first period ancient runes class without further ado neville took a little longer to sort out his round face was anxious as professor mcgonagall looked down his application and then consulted his results 
 
 herbology fine she said professor sprout will be delighted to see you back with an outstanding and you qualify for defense against the dark arts with exceeds expectations but the problem is transfiguration sorry longbottom but an acceptable really good enough to continue to level just think be able to cope with the coursework 
 
 neville hung his head professor mcgonagall peered at him through her square spectacles 
 
 why do you want to continue with transfiguration anyway never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it 
 
 neville looked miserable and muttered something about my grandmother wants 
 
 hmph snorted professot mcgonagall high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson got rather than the one she thinks she ought to haveparticularly after what happened at the ministry 
 
 neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly professor mcgonagall had never paid him a compliment before 
 
 sorry longbottom but i cannot let you into my class i see that you have an exceeds expectations in charm howeverwhy not try for a in charms 
 
 my grandmother thinks charms is a soft option mumbled neville 
 
 take charms said professor mcgonagall and i shall drop augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her charms the subject is not necessarily worthless smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on face professor mcgonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand and handed it now carrying details of his new classes to neville 
 
 professor mcgonagall turned next to parvati patil whose first question was whether firenze the handsome centaur was still teaching divination 
 
 he and professor trelawney are dividing classes between them this year said professor mcgonagall a hint of disapproval in her voice it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of divination the sixth year is being taken by professor trelawney 
 
 parvati set off for divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen 
 
 so potter potter said professor mcgonagall consulting her notes as she turned to harry charms defense against the dark arts herbology transfiguration all fine i must say i was pleased with your transfiguration mark potter very pleased now why you applied to continue with potions i thought it was your ambition to become an auror 
 
 it was but you told me i had to get an outstanding in my professor 
 
 and so you did when professor snape was teaching the subject professor slughorn however is perfectly happy to accept students with exceeds expectations at do you wish to proceed with potions 
 
 yes said harry but i buy the books or any ingredients or anything 
 
 sure professor slughorn will be able to lend you some said professor mcgonagall very well potter here is your schedule oh by the waytwenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the gryffindor quidditch team i shall pass the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure 
 
 a few minutes later ron was cleared to do the same subjects as harry and the two of them left the table together 
 
 look said ron delightedly gazing ar his schedule got a free period now and a free period after break and after lunch excellent 
 
 they returned to the common room which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years including katie bell the only remaining member of the original gryffindor quidditch team that harry had joined in his first year 
 
 i thought get that well done she called over pointing at the captains badge on chest tell me when you call trials 
 
 be stupid said harry you need to try out i watched you play for five years 
 
 you start off like that she said warningly for all you know someone much better than me out there good teams have been ruined before now because captains just kept playing the old faces or letting in their friends 
 
 ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the fanged frisbee hermione had taken from the student it zoomed around the common room snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close 
 
 an hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the defense against the dark arts classroom four floors below hermione was already queuing outside carrying an armful of heavy books and looking 
 
 we got so much homework for runes she said anxiously when harry and ron joined her a essay two translations and got to read these by wednesday 
 
 shame yawned ron 
 
 you wait she said resentfully i bet snape gives us loads 
 
 the classroom door opened as she spoke and snape stepped into the corridor his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair silence fell over the queue immediately 
 
 inside he said 
 
 harry looked around as they entered snape had imposed his personality upon the room already it was gloomier than usual as curtains had been drawn over the windows and was lit by candlelight new pictures adorned the walls many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain sporting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts nobody spoke as they settled down looking around at the shadowy gruesome pictures 
 
 i have not asked you to take out your books said snape closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk hermione hastily dropped her copy of confronting the faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair i wish to speak to you and i want your fullest attention 
 
 his black eyes roved over their upturned faces lingering for a fraction of a second longer on than anyone 
 
 you have had five teachers in this subject so far i believe 
 
 you believe like you watched them all come and go hoping be next thought harry scathingly 
 
 naturally these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities given this confusion i am surprised so many of you scraped an in this subject i shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the work which will be more advanced 
 
 snape set off around the edge of the room speaking now in a lower voice the class craned their necks to keep him in view 
 
 the dark arts said snape are many varied and eternal fighting them is like fighting a monster which each time a neck is severed sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before you are fighting that which is unfixed mutating indestructible 
 
 harry stared at snape it was surely one thing to respect the dark arts as a dangerous enemy another to speak of them as snape was doing with a loving caress in his voice 
 
 your defenses said snape a little louder must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo these pictures he indicated a few of them as he swept past give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer for instance the cruciatus curse he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony feel the kiss a wizard lying huddled and slumped against a wall or provoke the aggression of the inferius a bloody mass upon ground 
 
 has an inferius been seen then said parvati patil in a high pitched voice is it definite is he using them 
 
 the dark lord has used inferi in the past said snape which means you would be to assume he might use them again now 
 
 he set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk and again they watched him as he walked his dark robes billowing behind him 
 
 you are i believe complete novices in the use of spells what is the advantage of a spell 
 
 hand shot into the air snape took his time looking around at everybody else making sure he had no choice before saying curtly very wellmiss granger 
 
 your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic about to perform said hermione which gives you a advantage 
 
 an answer copied almost word for word from the standard book of spells grade six said snape dismissively over in the corner malfoy sniggered but correct in essentials yes those who progress in using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their not all wizards can do this of course it is a question of concentration and mind power which some his gaze lingered maliciously upon harry once more lack 
 
 harry knew snape was thinking of their disastrous occlumency lessons of the previous year he refused to drop his gaze but glowered at snape until snape looked away 
 
 you will now divide snape went on into pairs one partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking the other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence carry on 
 
 although snape did not know it harry had taught at least half the class everyone who had been a member of the how to perform a shield charm the previous year none of them had ever cast the charm without speaking however a reasonable amount of cheating ensued many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud typically ten minutes into the lesson hermione managed to repel muttered jinx without uttering a single word a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for gryffindor from any reasonable teacher thought harry bitterly but which snape ignored he swept between them as they practiced looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever lingering to watch harry and ron struggling with the task 
 
 ron who was supposed to be jinxing harry was purple in the face his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation harry had his wand raised waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come 
 
 pathetic weasley said snape after a while herelet me show you 
 
 he turned his wand on harry so fast that harry reacted instinctively all thought of spells forgotten he yelled protego 
 
 his shield charm was so strong snape was knocked and hit a desk the whole class had looked around and now watched as snape righted himself scowling 
 
 do you remember me telling you we are practicing spells potter 
 
 yes said harry stiffly 
 
 yes sir 
 
 no need to call me sir professor the words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying several people gasped including hermione behind snape however ron dean and seamus grinned appreciatively 
 
 detention saturday night my office said snape i do not take cheek from anyone potter not even the chosen one 
 
 that was brilliant harry chortled ron once they were safely on their way to break a short while later 
 
 you really have said it said hermione frowning at ron what made you 
 
 he tried to jinx me in case you notice fumed harry i had enough of that during those occlumency lessons why he use another guinea pig for a change dumbledore playing at anyway letting him teach defense did you hear him talking about the dark arts he loves them all that unfixed indestructible stuff 
 
 well said hermione i thought he sounded a bit like you 
 
 like me 
 
 yes when you were telling us what like to face voldemort you said it just memorizing a bunch of spells you said it was just you and your brains and your gutswell that what snape was saying that it really comes down to being brave and 
 
 harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as the standard book of spells that he did not argue 
 
 harry hey harry 
 
 harry looked around jack sloper one of the beaters on last gryffindor quidditch team was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment 
 
 for you panted sloper listen i heard the new captain you holding trials 
 
 not sure yet said harry thinking privately that sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team let you know 
 
 oh right i was hoping be this weekend 
 
 but harry was not listening he had just recognized the thin slanting writing on the parchment leaving sloper in he hurried away with ron and hermione unrolling the parchment as he went 
 
 dear harry 
 i would like to start our private lessons this saturday kindly come along to my office at eight i hope you are enjoying your first day back at school 
 yours sincerely 
 albus dumbledore 
 i enjoy acid pops 
 he enjoys acid pops said ron who had read the message over shoulder and was looking perplexed 
 
 the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study said harry in a low voice ha not going to be pleased i be able to do his detention 
 
 he ron and hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what dumbledore would teach harry ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the death eaters would not know hermione said such things were illegal and thought it much more likely that dumbledore wanted to teach harry advanced defensive magic after break she went off to arithmancy while harry and ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started homework this turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when hermione joined them for their free period though she considerably speeded up the process they had only just finished when the bell rang for the double potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had for so long been 
 
 when they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to level crabbe and goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required grade but four slytherins had made it through including malfoy four ravenclaws were there and one hufflepuff ernie macmillan whom harry liked despite his rather pompous manner 
 
 harry ernie said portentously holding out his hand as harry approached get a chance to speak in defense against the dark arts this morning good lesson i thought but shield charms are old hat of course for us old lags and how are you ronhermione 
 
 before they could say more than fine the dungeon door opened and belly preceded him out of the door as they filed into the room his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth and he greeted harry and zabini with particular enthusiasm 
 
 the dungeon was most unusually already full of vapors and odd smells harry ron and hermione sniffed interestedly as they passed large bubbling cauldrons the four slytherins took a table together as did the four ravenclaws this left harry ron and hermione to share a table with ernie they chose the one nearest a cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive scents harry had ever inhaled somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart the woody smell of a broomstick handle and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the burrow he found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply and that the fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink a great contentment stole over him he grinned across at ron who grinned back lazily 
 
 now then now then now then said slughorn whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors scales out everyone and potion kits and forget your copies of advanced 
 
 sir said harry raising his hand 
 
 harry 
 
 i got a book or scales or ronwe realize be able to do the you see 
 
 ah yes professor mcgonagall did mention not to worry my dear boy not to worry at all you can use ingredients from the store cupboard today and sure we can lend you some scales and got a small stock of old books here do until you can write to flourish and blotts 
 
 slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and after a foraging emerged with two very copies of advanced by libatius borage which he gave to harry and ron along with two sets of tarnished scales 
 
 now then said slughorn returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off prepared a few potions for you to have a look at just out of interest you know these are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your you ought to have heard of em even if you made em yet anyone tell me what this one is 
 
 he indicated the cauldron nearest the slytherin table harry raised himself slighty in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it 
 
 hand hit the air before anybody slughorn pointed at her 
 
 veritaserum a colorless odorless potion thar forces the drinker to tell the truth said hermione 
 
 very good very good said slughorn happily now he continued pointing at the cauldron nearest the ravenclaw table this one here is pretty well known featured in a few ministry leaflets lately too who can 
 
 hand was fastest once more 
 
 polyjuice potion sir she said 
 
 harry too had recognized the mudlike substance the second cauldron but did not resent hermione getting the credit for answering the question she after all was the one who had succeeded in making it back in their second year 
 
 excellent excellent now this one her yes my dear said slughorn now looking slightly bemused as hand punched the air again 
 
 amortentia 
 
 it is indeed ir seems almost foolish to ask said slughorn who was looking mightily impressed but i assume you know what it does 
 
 the most powerful love porion in the world said hermione 
 
 quite right you recognized it i suppose by its distinctive sheen 
 
 and the steam rising in characteristic spirals said hermione enthusiastically and supposed to smell differently to each of according to what attracts us and i can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and 
 
 but she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence 
 
 may i ask your name my dear said slughorn ignoring embarrassment 
 
 hermione granger sir 
 
 granger granger can you possibly be related to hector who founded the most extraordinary society of potioneers 
 
 no i think so sir you see 
 
 harry saw malfoy lean close to nott and whisper something both of them sniggered but slughorn showed no dismay on the contrary he beamed and looked from hermione to harry who was sitting next to her 
 
 oho one of my best friends is and the best in our year assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke harry 
 
 yes sir said harry 
 
 well well take twenty points for gryffindor miss granger said slughorn genially 
 
 malfoy looked rather as he had done the time hermione had punched him in the face hermione turned to harry with a radiant expression and whispered did you really tell him the best in the year oh harry 
 
 well so impressive about that whispered ron who for some reason looked annoyed you are the best in the told him so if asked me 
 
 hermione smiled but made a shushing gesture so that they could hear what slughorn was saying ron looked slightly disgruntled 
 
 amortentia really create love of course it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love no this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession it is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this roomoh yes he said nodding gravely at malfoy and nott both of whom were smirking skeptically when you have seen as much of life as i have you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love 
 
 and now said slughorn it is time for us to start work 
 
 sir you told us in this one said ernie macmillan pointing at a small black cauldron standing on desk the potion within was splashing about merrily it was the color of molten gold and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface though not a particle had spilled 
 
 oho said slughorn again harry was sure that slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect yes that well that one ladies and gentlemen is a most curious little potion called felix felicis i take it he turned smiling to look at hermione who had let out an audible gasp that you know what felix felicis does miss granger 
 
 liquid luck said hermione excitedly it makes you lucky 
 
 the whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter now all harry could see of malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head because he was at last giving slughorn his full and undivided attention 
 
 quite right take another ten points for gryffindor yes a funny little potion felix felicis said slughorn desperately tricky to make and disastrous to get wrong however if brewed correctly as this has been you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed at least until the effects wear off 
 
 why people drink it all the time sir said terry boot eagerly 
 
 because if taken in excess it causes giddiness recklessness and dangerous overconfidence said slughorn too much of a good thing you know highly toxic in large quantities but taken sparingly and very occasionally 
 
 have you ever taken it sir asked michael corner with great interest 
 
 twice in my life said slughorn once when i was once when i was two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast two perfect days 
 
 he gazed dreamily into the distance whether he was playacting or not thought harry the effect was good 
 
 and that said slughorn apparently coming back to earth is what i shall be offering as a prize in this lesson 
 
 there was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold 
 
 one tiny bottle of felix felicis said slughorn taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all enough for twelve hours luck from dawn till dusk you will be lucky in everything you attempt 
 
 now i must give you warning that felix felicis is a banned substance in organized competition sporting events for instance examinations or elections so the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary 
 
 so said slughorn suddenly brisk how are you to win this fabulous prize well by turning to page ten of advanced potion making we have a little over an hour left to us which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the draught of living death i know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before and i do not expect a perfect potion from anybody the person who does best however will win little felix here off you go 
 
 there was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to their scales but nobody spoke the concentration within the room was almost tangible harry saw malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of advanced it could not have been clearer that malfoy really wanted that lucky day harry bent swiftly over the tattered book slughorn had lent him 
 
 to his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the pages so that the margins were as black as the printed portions bending low to decipher the ingredients even here the previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed as he dashed back to his cauldron he saw malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could 
 
 everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of potions that it was hard to keep your work private within ten minutes the whole place was full of bluish steam hermione of course seemed to have progressed furthest her potion already resembled the smooth black liquid mentioned as the ideal halfway stage 
 
 having finished chopping his roots harry bent low over his book again it was really very irritating having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction 
 
 crush with flat side of silver dagger releases juice better than cutting 
 
 sir i think you knew my grandfather abraxas malfoy harry looked up slughorn was just passing the slytherin table 
 
 yes said slughorn without looking at malfoy i was sorry to hear he had died although of course it unexpected dragon pox at his age 
 
 and he walked away harry bent back over his cauldron smirking he could tell that malfoy had expected to be treated like harry or zabini perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from snape it looked as though malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of felix felicis 
 
 the sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up harry turned to hermione 
 
 can i borrow your silver knife 
 
 she nodded impatiently not taking her eyes off her potion which was still deep purple though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now 
 
 harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger to his astonishment it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all 
 
 hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw to his surprise that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook 
 
 his annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot harry now squinted at the next line of instructions according the book he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned clear as water according to the addition the previous owner made however he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir could the old owner be right twice 
 
 harry stirred counterclockwise held his breath and stirred once clockwise the effect was immediate the potion turned pale pink 
 
 how are you doing that demanded hermione who was redfaced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron her potion was still resolutely purple 
 
 add a clockwise stir 
 
 no no the book says counterclockwise she snapped 
 
 harry shrugged and continued what he was doing seven stirs counterclockwise one clockwise pause seven stirs counterclockwise one stir clockwise 
 
 across the table ron was cursing fluently under his breath his potion looked like liquid licorice harry glanced around as far as he could see no one potion had turned as pale as his he felt elated something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon 
 
 and up called slughorn stop stirring please 
 
 slughorn moved slowly among the tables peering into cauldrons he made no comment but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff at last he reached the table where harry ron hermione and ernie were sitting he smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in cauldron he passed over navy concoction potion he gave an approving nod then he saw and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face 
 
 the clear winner he cried to the dungeon excellent excellent harry good lord clear inherited your talent she was a dab hand at potions lily was here you are then here you areone bottle of felix felicis as promised and use it well 
 
 harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the slytherins faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on ron looked simply dumbfounded 
 
 how did you do that he whispered to harry as they left the dungeon 
 
 got lucky i suppose said harry because malfoy was within earshot 
 
 once they were securely ensconced at the gryffindor table for dinner however he felt safe enough to tell them face became stonier with every word he uttered 
 
 i you think i cheated he finished aggravated by her expression 
 
 well it exactly your own work was it she said stiffly 
 
 he only followed different instructions to ours said ron been a catastrophe it but he took a risk and it paid off he heaved a sigh slughorn handed me that book but no i get the one no ever written on puked on by the look of page but 
 
 hang on said a voice close by left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in dungeon he looked around and saw that ginny had joined them did i hear right been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book harry 
 
 she looked alarmed and angry harry knew what was on her mind at once 
 
 nothing he said reassuringly lowering his voice not like you know diary just an old textbook scribbled on 
 
 but doing what it says 
 
 i just tried a few of the tips written in the margins honestly ginny nothing funny 
 
 got a point said hermione perking up at once we ought to check that nothing odd about it i mean all these funny instructions who knows 
 
 hey said harry indignantly as she pulled his copy of advanced out of his bag and raised her wand 
 
 specialis revelio she said rapping it smartly on the front cover nothing whatsoever happened the book simply lay there looking old and dirty and 
 
 finished said harry irritably or want to wait and see if it does a few backflips 
 
 it seems all right said hermione still staring at the book suspiciously i mean it really does seem to be just a textbook 
 
 good then have it back said harry snatching it off the table but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor nobody else was looking harry bent low to retrieve the book and as he did so he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bottle of felix felicis now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs 
 
 this book is the property of the half blood prince

 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter nine a place to hidecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 everything seemed fuzzy slow harry and hermione jumped to their feet and drew their wands many people were only just realizing that something strange had happened heads were still turning toward the silver cat as it vanished silence spread outward in cold ripples from the place where the patronus had landed then somebody screamed 
 
 harry and hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd guests were sprinting in all directions many were disapparating the protective enchantments around the burrow had broken 
 
 ron hermione cried ron where are you 
 
 as they pushed their way across the dance floor harry saw cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd then he saw lupin and tonks their wands raised and heard both of them shout protego a cry that was echoed on all sides c 
 
 ron ron hermione called half sobbing as she and harry were buffered by terrified guests harry seized her hand to make sure they werent separated as a streak of light whizzed over their heads whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know c 
 
 and then ron was there he caught hold of hermiones free arm and harry felt her turn on the spot sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him all he could feel was hermiones hand as he was squeezed through space and time away from the burrow away from the descending death eaters away perhaps from voldemort himself 
 
 where are we said rons voice 
 
 harry opened his eyes for a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all they still seemed to be surrounded by people 
 
 tottenham court road panted hermione walk just walk we need to find somewhere for you to change 
 
 harry did as she asked they half walked half ran up the wide dark street thronged with revelers and lined with closed shops stars twinkling above them a bus rumbled by and a group of merry ogled them as they passed harry and ron were still wearing dress robes 
 
 hermione we havent got anything to change into ron told her as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him 
 
 why didnt i make sure i had the invisibility cloak with me said harry inwardly cursing his own stupidity all last year i kept it on me and c 
 
 its okay ive got the cloak ive got clothes for both of you said hermione just try and act naturally until c this will do 
 
 she led them down a side street then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway 
 
 when you say youve got the cloak and clothes said harry frowning at hermione who was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag in which she was now rummaging 
 
 yes theyre here said hermione and to harry and rons utter astonishment she pulled out a pair of jeans a sweatshirt some maroon socks and finally the silvery invisibility cloak 
 
 how the ruddy hell c 
 
 undetectable extension charm said hermione tricky but i think ive done it okay anyway i managed to fit everything we need in here she gave the bag a little shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it oh damn thatll be the books she said peering into it and i had them all stacked by subject oh well harry youd better take the invisibility cloak ron hurry up and change 
 
 when did you do all this harry asked as ron stripped off his robes 
 
 i told you at the burrow ive had the essentials packed for days you know in case we needed to make a quick getaway i packed your rucksack this morning harry after you changed and put it in here i just had a feeling 
 
 youre amazing you are said ron handing her his robes 
 
 thank you said hermione managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag please harry get that cloak on 
 
 harry threw his invisibility cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head vanishing from sight he was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened 
 
 the others c everybody at the wedding c 
 
 we cant worry about that now whispered hermione its you theyre after harry and well just put everyone in even more danger by going back 
 
 shes right said ron who seemed to know that harry was about to argue even if he could not see his face most of the order was there theyll look after everyone 
 
 harry nodded then remembered that they could not see him and said yeah but he thought of ginny and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach 
 
 come on i think we ought to keep moving said hermione 
 
 they moved back up the side street and onto the main road again where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement 
 
 just as a matter of interest why tottenham court road ron asked hermione 
 
 ive no idea it just popped into my head but im sure were safer out in the muggle world its not where theyll expect us to be 
 
 true said ron looking around but dont you feel a bit c exposed 
 
 where else is there asked hermione cringing as the men on the other side of the road started at her we can hardly book rooms at the leaky cauldron can we and grimmauld place is out if snape can get in there i suppose we could try my parents home though i think theres a chance they might check there oh i wish theyd shut up 
 
 all right darling the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling fancy a drink ditch ginger and come and have a pint 
 
 lets sit down somewhere hermione said hastily as ron opened his mouth to shout back across the road look this will do in here 
 
 it was a small and shabby caf a light layer of grease lay on all the tables but it was at least empty harry slipped into a booth first and ron sat next to him opposite hermione who had her back to the entrance and did not like it she glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a twitch harry did not like being stationary walking had given the illusion that they had a goal beneath the cloak he could feel the last vestiges of polyjuice leaving him his hands returning to their usual length and shape he pulled his glasses out of his pocket and put them on again 
 
 after a minute or two ron said you know were not far from the leaky cauldron here its only in charing cross c 
 
 ron we cant said hermione at once 
 
 not to stay there but to find out whats going on 
 
 we know whats going on voldemorts taken over the ministry what else do we need to know 
 
 okay okay it was just an idea 
 
 they relapsed into a prickly silence the waitress shuffled over and hermione ordered two cappuccinos as harry was invisible it would have looked odd to order him one a pair of burly workmen entered the caf and squeezed into the next booth hermione dropped her voice to a whisper 
 
 i say we find a quiet place to disapparate and head for the countryside once were there we could send a message to the order 
 
 can you do that talking patronus thing then asked ron 
 
 ive been practicing and i think so said hermione 
 
 well as long as it doesnt get them into trouble though they mightve been arrested already god thats revolting ron added after one sip of the foamy grayish coffee the waitress had heard she shot ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers orders the larger of the two workmen who was blond and quite huge now that harry came to look at him waved her away she stared affronted 
 
 lets get going then i dont want to drink this muck said ron hermione have you got muggle money to pay for this 
 
 yes i took out all my building society savings before i came to the burrow ill bet all the change is at the bottom sighed hermione reaching for her beaded bag 
 
 the two workmen made identical movements and harry mirrored them without conscious thought all three of them drew their wands ron a few seconds late in realizing what was going on lunged across the table pushing hermione sideways onto her bench the force of the death eaters spells shattered the tiled wall where rons head had just been as harry still invisible yelled stupefy 
 
 the great blond death eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light he slumped sideways unconscious his companion unable to see who had cast the spell fired another at ron shining black ropes flew from his and bound ron head to foot c the waitress screamed and ran for the door c harry sent another stunning spell at the death eater with the twisted face who had tied up ron but the spell missed rebounded on the window and hit the waitress who collapsed in front of the door 
 
 expulso bellowed the death eater and the table behind which harry was standing blew up the force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the cloak slipped off him 
 
 petrificus totalus screamed hermione from out of sight and the death eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china table and coffee hermione crawled out from underneath the bench shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over 
 
 she said pointing her wand at ron who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans leaving a deep cut oh im so sorry ron my hands shaking diffindo 
 
 the severed ropes fell away ron got to his feet shaking his arms to regain feeling in them harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond death eater was sprawled across the bench 
 
 i shouldve recognized him he was there the night dumbledore died he said he turned over the darker death eater with his foot the mans eyes moved rapidly between harry ron and hermione 
 
 thats dolohov said ron i recognize him from the old wanted posters i think the big ones thorfinn rowle 
 
 never mind what theyre called said hermione a little hysterically how did they find us what are we going to do 
 
 somehow her panic seemed to clear harrys head 
 
 lock the door he told her and ron turn out the lights 
 
 he looked down at the paralyzed dolohov thinking fast as the lock clicked and ron used the deluminator to plunge the caf into darkness harry could hear the men who had jeered at hermione earlier yelling at another girl in the distance 
 
 what are we going to do with them ron whispered to harry through the dark then even more quietly kill them theyd kill us they had a good go just now 
 
 hermione shuddered and took a step backward harry shook his head 
 
 we just need to wipe their memories said harry its better like that itll throw them off the scent if we killed them itd be obvious we were here 
 
 youre the boss said ron sounding profoundly relieved but ive never down a memory charm 
 
 nor have i said hermione but i know the theory 
 
 she took a deep calming breath then pointed her wand at dolohovs forehead and said obliviate 
 
 at once dolohovs eyes became unfocused and dreamy 
 
 brilliant said harry clapping her on the back take care of the other one and the waitress while ron and i clear up 
 
 clear up said ron looking around at the partly destroyed caf why 
 
 dont you think they might wonder whats happened if they wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like its just been bombed 
 
 oh right yeah 
 
 ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket 
 
 its no wonder i cant get it out hermione you packed my old jeans theyre tight 
 
 oh im so sorry hissed hermione and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the windows harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where ron could stick his wand instead 
 
 once the caf was restored to its previous condition they heaved the death eaters back into their booth and propped them up facing each other but how did they find us hermione asked looking from one inert man to the other how did they know where we were 
 
 she turned to harry 
 
 you c you dont think youve still got your trace on you do you harry 
 
 he cant have said ron the trace breaks at seventeen thats wizarding law you cant put it on an adult 
 
 as far as you know said hermione what if the death eaters have found a way to put it on a 
 
 but harry hasnt been near a death eater in the last hours whos supposed to have put a trace back on him 
 
 hermione did not reply harry felt contaminated tainted was that really how the death eaters had found them 
 
 if i cant use magic and you cant use magic near me without us giving away our position c he began 
 
 were not splitting up said hermione firmly 
 
 we need a safe place to hide said ron give us time to think things through 
 
 grimmauld place said harry 
 
 the other two gaped 
 
 dont be silly harry snape can get in there 
 
 rons dad said theyve put up jinxes against him c and even if they havent worked he pressed on as hermione began to argue so what i swear id like nothing better than to meet snape 
 
 but c 
 
 hermione where else is there its the best chance weve got snapes only one death eater if ive still got the trace on me well have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go 
 
 she could not argue though she looked as if she would have liked to while she unlocked the caf door ron clicked the deluminator to release the cafs light then on harrys count of three they reversed the spells upon their three victims and before the waitress or either of the death eaters could do more than stir sleepily harry ron and hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the compressing darkness once more 
 
 seconds later harrys lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes they were now standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square tall dilapidated houses looked down on them from every side number twelve was visible to them for they had been told of its existence by dumbledore its and they rushed toward it checking every few yards that they were not being followed or observed they raced up the stone steps and harry tapped the front door once with his wand they heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain then the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold 
 
 as harry closed the door behind them the gas lamps sprang into life casting flickering light along the length of the hallway it looked just as harry remembered it eerie cobwebbed the outlines of the heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase long dark curtains concealed the portrait of siriuss mother the only thing that was out of place was the trolls leg umbrella stand which was lying on its side as if tonks had just knocked it over again 
 
 i think somebodys been in here hermione whispered pointing toward it 
 
 that couldve happened as the order left ron murmured back 
 
 so where are these jinxes they put up against snape harry asked 
 
 maybe theyre only activated if he shows up suggested ron 
 
 yet they remained close together on the doormat backs against the door scared to move farther into the house 
 
 well we cant stay here forever said harry and he took a step forward 
 
 severus snape 
 
 moodys voice whispered out of the darkness making all three of them jump back in fright were not snape croaked harry before something whooshed over him like cold air and his tongue curled backward on itself making it impossible to speak before he had time to feel inside his mouth however his tongue had unraveled again 
 
 the other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation ron was making retching noises hermione stammered that have the curse set up for snape 
 
 gingerly harry took another step forward something shifted in the shadows at the end of the hall and before any of them could say another word a figure had risen up out of the carpet tall and terrible hermione screamed and so did mrs black her curtains flying open the gray figure was gliding toward them faster and faster its hair and beard streaming behind it its face sunken fleshless with empty eye sockets horribly familiar dreadfully altered it raised a wasted arm pointing at harry 
 
 no harry shouted and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him no it wasnt us we didnt kill you c 
 
 on the word kill the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust coughing his eyes watering harry looked around to see hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head and ron who was shaking from head to foot patting her clumsily on the shoulder and saying its all its 
 
 dust swirled around harry like mist catching the blue gaslight as mrs black continued to scream 
 
 mudbloods filth stains of dishonor taint of shame on the house of my fathers c 
 
 shut up harry bellowed directing his wand at her and with a bang and a burst of red sparks the curtains swung shut again silencing her 
 
 that that was hermione whimpered as ron helped her to her feet 
 
 yeah said harry but it wasnt really him was it just something to scare snape 
 
 had it worked harry wondered or had snape already blasted the aside as casually as he had killed the real dumbledore nerves still tingling he led the other two up the hall some new terror to reveal itself but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along the skirting board 
 
 before we go any farther i think wed better check whispered hermione and she raised her wand and said homenum revelio 
 
 nothing happened 
 
 well youve just had a big shock said ron kindly what was that supposed to do 
 
 it did what i meant it to do said hermione rather crossly that was a spell to reveal human presence and theres nobody here except us 
 
 and old dusty said ron glancing at the patch of carpet from which the had risen 
 
 lets go up said hermione with a frightened look at the same spot and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor 
 
 hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps then shivering slightly in the drafty room she perched on the sofa her arms wrapped tightly around her ron crossed to the window and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch 
 
 cant see anyone out there he reported and youd think if harry still had a trace on him theyd have followed us here i know they cant get in the house but c whats up harry 
 
 harry had given a cry of pain his scar had burned against as something flashed across his mind like a bright light on water he saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through his body violent and brief as an electric shock 
 
 what did you see ron asked advancing on harry did you see him at my place 
 
 no i just felt anger c hes really angry c 
 
 but that could be at the burrow said ron loudly what else didnt you see anything was he cursing someone 
 
 no i just felt anger c i couldnt tell c 
 
 harry felt badgered confused and hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice your scar again but whats going on i thought that connection had closed 
 
 it did for a while muttered harry his scar was still painful which made it hard to concentrate i c i think its started opening again whenever he loses control thats how it used to c 
 
 but then youve got to close your mind said hermione shrilly harry dumbledore didnt want you to use that connection he wanted you to shut it down thats why you were supposed to use occlumency otherwise voldemort can plant false images in your mind remember c 
 
 yeah i do remember thanks said harry through gritted teeth he did not need hermione to tell him that voldemort had once used this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap nor that it had resulted in siriuss death he wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt it made voldemort more threatening as though he were pressing against the window of the room and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it it was like resisting the urge to be sick 
 
 he turned his back on ron and hermione pretending to examine the old tapestry of the black family tree on the wall then hermione shrieked harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of rons father 
 
 family safe do not reply we are being watched 
 
 the patronus dissolved into nothingness ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa hermione joined him gripping his arm 
 
 theyre all right theyre all right she whispered and ron half laughed and hugged her 
 
 harry he said over hermiones shoulder i c 
 
 its not a problem said harry sickened by the pain in his head its your family course you were worried id feel the same way he thought of ginny i do feel the same way 
 
 the pain in his scar was reaching a peak burning as it had back in the garden of the burrow faintly he heard hermione say i dont want to be on my own could we use the sleeping bags ive brought and camp in here tonight 
 
 he heard ron agree he could not fight the pain much longer he had to succumb 
 
 bathroom he muttered and he left the room as fast as he could without running 
 
 he barely made it bolting the door behind him with trembling hands he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor then in an explosion of agony he felt the rage that did not belong to him possess his soul saw a long room lit only by firelight and the giant blond death eater on the floor screaming and writhing and a slighter figure standing over him wand outstretched while harry spoke in a high cold merciless voice 
 
 more rowle or shall we end it and feed you to nagini lord voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time you called me back for this to tell me that harry potter has escaped again draco give rowle another taste of our displeasure do it or feel my wrath yourself 
 
 a log fell in the fire flames reared their light darting across a terrified pointed white face c with a sense of emerging from deep water harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes 
 
 he was on the cold black marble floor his nose inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large bathtub he sat up malfoys gaunt petrified face seemed burned on the inside of his eyes harry felt sickened by what he had seen by the use to which draco was now being put by voldemort 
 
 there was a sharp rap on the door and harry jumped as hermiones voice rang out 
 
 harry do you want your toothbrush ive got it here 
 
 yeah great thanks he said fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 by the almshouse window 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 near the rampart which encircles copenhagen lies a 
 great red house balsams and other flowers greet us from the long rows of windows in the house whose interior is sufficiently 
 and poor and old are the people who inhabit it 
 the building is the warton almshouse 
 
 look at the window there leans an old maid she plucks the 
 withered leaf from the balsam and looks at the rampart on which many children are playing what is the old maid thinking of a whole life drama is unfolding itself before her inward gaze the poor little children how happy they are how merrily they 
 play and romp together what red cheeks and what angels eyes but 
 they have no shoes nor stockings they dance on the green rampart 
 just on the place where according to the old story the ground always 
 sank in and where a sportive frolicsome child had been lured by 
 means of flowers toys and sweetmeats into an open grave ready dug for it and which was afterwards closed over the child and from that 
 moment the old story says the ground gave way no longer the mound remained firm and fast and was quickly covered with the green turf the little people who now play on that spot know nothing of the old tale else would they fancy they heard a child crying deep below the earth and the dewdrops on each blade of grass would be to them tears of woe nor do they know anything of the danish king who here in the face of the coming foe took an oath before all his trembling courtiers that he would hold out with the citizens of his capital and die here in his nest they know nothing of the men who have fought here or of the women who from here have drenched with boiling water the enemy clad in white and biding in the snow to surprise the city 
 
 no the poor little ones are playing with light childish 
 spirits play on play on thou little maiden soon the years will 
 come yes those glorious years the priestly hands have been laid 
 on the candidates for confirmation hand in hand they walk on the 
 green rampart thou hast a white frock on it has cost thy mother much labor and yet it is only cut down for thee out of an old larger 
 dress you will also wear a red shawl and what if it hang too far 
 down people will only see how large how very large it is you are 
 thinking of your dress and of the giver of all good so glorious is 
 it to wander on the green rampart 
 
 and the years roll by they have no lack of dark days but you 
 have your cheerful young spirit and you have gained a friend you 
 know not how you met oh how often you walk together on the rampart in the fresh spring on the high days and holidays when all the world come out to walk upon the ramparts and all the bells of the church steeples seem to be singing a song of praise for the coming spring 
 
 scarcely have the violets come forth but there on the rampart 
 just opposite the beautiful castle of rosenberg there is a tree 
 bright with the first green buds every year this tree sends forth 
 fresh green shoots alas it is not so with the human heart dark 
 mists more in number than those that cover the northern skies 
 cloud the human heart poor child thy bridal chamber is a 
 black coffin and thou becomest an old maid from the almshouse 
 window behind the balsams thou shalt look on the merry children at 
 play and shalt see thine own history renewed 
 
 and that is the life drama that passes before the old maid while 
 she looks out upon the rampart the green sunny rampart where the 
 children with their red cheeks and bare shoeless feet are 
 rejoicing merrily like the other free little birds

 happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way 
 everything was in confusion in the house the wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a french girl who had been a governess in their family and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him this position of affairs had now lasted two days and not only the husband and wife themselves but all the members of their family and the household were painfully conscious of it all the members of the family and the household felt that there was no sense in their living together and that even stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they the members of the family and the household of the oblonskys the wife did not leave her own apartments the husband had not been home for two days the children ran wild all over the house the english governess quarreled with the housekeeper and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new employ for her the man cook had walked off the day before just at dinnertime the kitchenmaid and the coachman had given warning 
 two days after the quarrel prince stepan arkadyevich oblonsky stiva as he was called in the fashionable world woke up at his usual hour that is at eight in the morning not in his bedroom but on the sofa in his study he turned over his stout person on the springy sofa as though he would sink into a long sleep again he vigorously embraced the pillow on its other side and buried his face in it but all at once he jumped up sat up on the sofa and opened his eyes 
 yes yes how was it now he thought going over his dream yes how was it yes alabin was giving a dinner at darmstadt no not darmstadt but something american yes but then darmstadt was in america yes alabin was giving a dinner on glass tables and the tables sang il mio tesoro no not il mio tesoro but something better and there were some sort of little decanters on the table and at the same time these decanters were women he recalled 
 stepan eyes twinkled gaily and he pondered with a smile yes it was jolly very jolly there was a great deal more that was delightful only no putting it into words or even expressing it in waking thoughts and noticing a gleam of light peeping in beside one of the curtains he cheerfully dropped his feet over the edge of the sofa and felt about with them for his slippers a present on his last birthday worked for him by his wife on morocco and as he used to do for the last nine years he stretched out his hand without getting up toward the place where his dressing gown always hung in the bedroom and thereupon he suddenly remembered that he was not sleeping in his room but in his study as well as the reason the smile vanished from his face and he knit his brows

 this stupid smile he could not forgive himself catching sight of that smile dolly shuddered as though from physical pain broke out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words and rushed out of the room since then she had refused to see her husband 
 all the fault of that stupid smile stepan arkadyevich was thinking 
 but to be done to be done he kept saying to himself in despair and found no answer

 this stupid smile he could not forgive himself catching sight of that smile dolly shuddered as though from physical pain broke out with her characteristic heat into a flood of cruel words and rushed out of the room since then she had refused to see her husband 
 all the fault of that stupid smile stepan arkadyevich was thinking 
 but to be done to be done he kept saying to himself in despair and found no answer

 stepan arkadyevich was a truthful man in his relations with himself he was incapable of and of persuading himself that he repented his conduct he could not at this date repent the fact that he handsome susceptible to love a man of was not in love with his wife the mother of five living and two dead children and only a year younger than himself all he repented was that he had not succeeded better in hiding this from his wife but he felt all the difficulty of his position and was sorry for his wife his children and himself possibly he might have managed to conceal his sins better from his wife if he had anticipated that the knowledge of them would have had such an effect upon her he had never clearly reflected on the subject but he had vaguely conceived that his wife must long ago have suspected him of being unfaithful to her and had shut her eyes to the fact he had even supposed that she a woman no longer young or and in no way remarkable or uncommon merely a good mother ought from a sense of fairness to take an indulgent view it had turned out quite the other way 
 oh awful oh dear oh dear awful stepan arkadyevich kept repeating to himself and he could think of nothing to be done and how well things were going up till now how well we got on she was contented and happy in her children i never interfered with her in anything i let her manage the children and the house just as she liked true bad her having been a governess in our house bad something common vulgar in flirting with governess but what a governess he vividly recalled the roguish black eyes of mlle roland and her smile but after all while she was in the house i kept myself in hand and the worst of it all is that already it seems as if ill luck would have it so oh oh but what what is to be done 
 there was no solution save that universal solution which life gives to all questions even the most complex and insolvable one must live in the needs of the day that is forget oneself to forget himself in sleep was impossible now at least till nighttime he could not go back now to the music sung by the decanter women so he must forget himself in the dream of daily life 
 then we shall see stepan arkadyevich said to himself and getting up he put on a gray dressing gown lined with blue silk tied the tassels in a knot and drawing a deep breath of air into his broad chest he walked to the window with his usual confident step turning out his feet that carried his full frame so easily he pulled up the blind and rang the bell loudly it was at once answered by the appearance of an old friend his valet matvei carrying his clothes his boots and a telegram matvei was followed by the barber with all the necessaries for shaving 
 are there any papers from the board asked stepan arkadyevich taking the telegram and seating himself at the looking glass 
 on the table replied matvei glancing with inquiring sympathy at his master and after a short pause he added with a sly smile 
 sent from the carriage jobber 
 stepan arkadyevich made no reply but merely glanced at matvei in the looking glass the glance in which their eyes met in the looking glass made it clear that they understood one another stepan eyes seemed to ask why do you tell me that you know 
 matvei put his hands in his jacket pockets thrust out one leg and gazed silently with a faint smile at his master 
 i told them to come on sunday and till then not to trouble you or themselves for nothing he said he had obviously prepared the sentence beforehand 
 stepan arkadyevich saw matvei wanted to make a joke and attract attention to himself tearing open the telegram he read it through guessing at the words misspelled as they always are in telegrams and his face brightened 
 matvei my sister anna arkadyevna will be here tomorrow he said checking for a minute the sleek plump hand of the barber cutting a pink path between his long curly side whiskers 
 thank god said matvei showing by this response that he like his master realized the significance of this arrival anna arkadyevna the sister his master was so fond of might bring about a reconciliation between husband and wife 
 alone or with her husband inquired matvei 
 stepan arkadyevich could not answer as the barber was at work on his upper lip and he raised one finger matvei nodded at the looking glass 
 alone is the room to be got ready upstairs 
 inform darya alexandrovna where she orders 
 darya alexandrovna matvei repeated as though in doubt 
 yes inform her here take the telegram give it to her and then do what she tells you 
 you want to try it out matvei guessed but only said yes sir 
 stepan arkadyevich was already washed and combed and ready to be dressed when matvei stepping slowly in his creaky boots came back into the room with the telegram in his hand the barber had gone 
 darya alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away let him that is you do as he likes he said laughing only with his eyes and putting his hands in his pockets he watched his master with his head on one side stepan arkadyevich was silent a minute then a and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome face 
 eh matvei he said shaking his head 
 never mind sir everything will come round said matvei 
 come round 
 just so sir 
 do you think so there asked stepan arkadyevich hearing the rustle of a dress at the door 
 i said a firm pleasant feminine voice and the stern pockmarked face of matriona philimonovna the nurse was thrust in at the door 
 well the matter matriosha queried stepan arkadyevich meeting her in the doorway 
 although stepan arkadyevich was completely in the wrong as regards his wife and was conscious of this himself almost everyone in the house even the nurse darya chief ally was on his side 
 well what now he asked cheerlessly 
 go to her sir own your fault again maybe god will aid you she is suffering so pitiful to see her and besides everything in the house is you must have pity sir on the children beg her forgiveness sir no help for it one must pay the piper 
 but she see me 
 you do your part god is merciful pray to god sir pray to god 
 come do you can go said stepan arkadyevich blushing suddenly well now dress he turned to matvei and resolutely threw off his dressing gown

 chapter 
 
 when he was dressed stepan arkadyevich sprinkled some scent on himself pulled down his shirt cuffs distributed into his pockets his cigarettes pocketbook matches and watch with its double chain and seals and shaking out his handkerchief feeling himself clean fragrant healthy and physically at ease in spite of his misfortune he walked with a slight swing of each leg into the dining room where coffee was already waiting for him and alongside of his cup the letters and papers from the office 
 he read the letters one was very unpleasant from a merchant who was buying a forest on his property to sell this forest was absolutely essential but at present until he was reconciled with his wife the subject could not be discussed the most unpleasant thing of all was that his pecuniary interests should in this way enter into the question of his reconciliation with his wife and the idea that he might be led on by his interests that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest that idea hurt him 
 when he had finished his letters stepan arkadyevich moved the office papers close to him rapidly looked through two cases made a few notes with a big pencil and pushing away the papers turned to his coffee sipping it he opened a still damp morning paper and began to read it 
 stepan arkadyevich took in and read a liberal paper not an extreme one but one advocating the views held by the majority and in spite of the fact that science art and politics had no special interest for him he firmly held those views on all these subjects which were held by the majority and by his paper and he only changed them when the majority changed them or more strictly speaking he did not change them but they imperceptibly changed of themselves within him 
 stepan arkadyevich had not chosen his political opinions or his views these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves just as he did not choose the shapes of his hat and coat but simply accepted those that were being worn and for him living in a certain society owing to the need ordinarily developed at years of discretion for some degree of mental activity to have views was just as indispensable as to have a hat if there was a reason for his preferring liberal to conservative views which were held also by many of his circle it arose not from his considering liberalism more rational but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life the liberal party said that in russia everything was wrong and indeed stepan arkadyevich had many debts and was decidedly short of money the liberal party said that marriage was an institution quite out of date and that it stood in need of reconstruction and indeed family life afforded stepan arkadyevich little gratification and forced him into lying and hypocrisy which were so repulsive to his nature the liberal party said or rather allowed it to be understood that religion was only a curb to keep in check the barbarous classes of the people and indeed stepan arkadyevich could not stand through even a short service without his legs aching and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world and with all this stepan arkadyevich who liked a merry joke was fond of embarrassing some plain man by saying that if one were to pride oneself on origin one ought not to stop at rurik and disown the founder of the line the monkey and so liberalism had become a habit of stepan arkadyevich and he liked his newspaper as he did his cigar after dinner for the slight fog it diffused in his brain he read the leading article which maintained that it was quite senseless in our day to raise an outcry that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements and that the government ought to take measures to crush the revolutionary hydra that on the contrary in our opinion the danger lies not in that imaginary revolutionary hydra but in the obstinacy of traditionalism clogging progress etc etc he read another article too a financial one which alluded to bentham and mill and dropped some innuendoes reflecting on the ministry with his characteristic he caught the drift of each innuendo divined whence it came at whom and on what ground it was aimed and that afforded him as it always did a certain gratification but today that gratification was embittered by matriona advice and the unsatisfactory state of his household he read too that count beist was rumored to have left for wiesbaden and that one need have no more gray hair and of the sale of a light carriage and of a young person seeking a situation but these items of information did not give him as usual a quiet ironical gratification 
 having finished the paper a second cup of coffee and a roll and butter he got up shaking the crumbs off his waistcoat and squaring his broad chest he smiled joyously not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind the joyous smile was evoked by a good digestion 
 but this joyous smile at once recalled everything to him and he grew thoughtful 
 two childish voices stepan arkadyevich recognized the voices of grisha his youngest boy and tania his eldest girl were heard outside the door they were carrying something and dropped it 
 i told you not to sit passengers on the roof said the little girl in english there pick them up 
 in confusion thought stepan arkadyevich there are the children running about by themselves and going to the door he called them they left off the box that represented a train and came in to their father 
 the little girl her favorite ran up boldly embraced him and hung laughingly on his neck enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers at last the little girl kissed his face which was flushed from his stooping posture and beaming with tenderness loosed her hands and was about to run away again but her father held her back 
 how is mamma he asked passing his hand over his smooth soft little neck good morning he said smiling to the boy who had come up to greet him 
 he was conscious that he loved the boy less and always tried to be fair but the boy felt it and did not smile responsively to his chilly smile 
 mamma she is up answered the girl 
 stepan arkadyevich sighed 
 that means she slept again all night he thought 
 well is she cheerful 
 the little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother and that her mother could not be cheerful and that her father must be aware of this and that he was pretending when he asked about it so lightly and she blushed for her father he at once perceived it and blushed too 
 i know she said she did not say we must do our lessons but she said we were to go for a walk with miss hoole to 
 well go tania my darling oh wait a minute though he said still holding her and stroking her soft little hand 
 he took off the mantelpiece where he had put it yesterday a little box of sweets and gave her two picking out her favorites a chocolate and a bonbon 
 for grisha said the little girl pointing to the chocolate 
 yes yes and still stroking her little shoulder he kissed the nape of her neck and let her go 
 the carriage is ready said matvei but someone to see you with a petition 
 been here long asked stepan arkadyevich 
 half an hour or so 
 how many times have i told you to tell me at once 
 one must let you drink your coffee in peace at least said matvei in the affectionately gruff tone with which it was impossible to be angry 
 well show the person up at once said oblonsky frowning with vexation 
 the petitioner the widow of a staff captain kalinin came with a request impossible and unreasonable but stepan arkadyevich as he generally did made her sit down heard her to the end attentively without interrupting her and gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to apply and even wrote for her easily and clearly in his large sprawling calligraphic and legible hand a little note to a personage who might be of use to her having got rid of the staff widow stepan arkadyevich took his hat and stopped to recollect whether he had forgotten anything it appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget his wife 
 ah yes he bowed his head and his handsome face assumed a melancholy expression to go or not to go he said to himself and an inner voice told him he must not go that nothing could come of it but falsity that to amend to set right their relations was impossible because it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love or to make him an old man not susceptible to love except deceit and lying nothing could come of it now and deceit and lying were opposed to his nature 
 it must be some day though it go on like this he said trying to give himself courage he set straight his chest took out a cigarette lighted it took two whiffs at it flung it into a ash tray and with rapid steps walked through the drawing room and opened the other door into his bedroom

 chapter 
 
 darya alexandrovna in a dressing jacket and with her now scanty hair once luxuriant and beautiful fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck with a sunken thin face and large startled eyes which looked prominent from the thinness of her face was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room before an open bureau from which she was taking something hearing her steps she stopped looking toward the door and trying in vain to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression she felt she was afraid of him and afraid of the coming interview she was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days to sort out the things and her own so as to take them to her and again she could not bring herself to do this but now again as each time before she kept saying to herself that things cannot go on like this that she must undertake something punish him put him to shame avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her she still continued to tell herself that she should leave him but she was conscious that this was impossible it was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and of loving him besides this she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly they would be still worse off where she was going with all of them as it was even in the course of these three days the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before she was conscious that it was impossible to go away but cheating herself she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was going 
 seeing her husband she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her but her face to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression expressed bewilderment and suffering 
 dolly he said in a subdued and timid voice he had hunched up his shoulders and tried to look pitiful and humble but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health in a rapid glance she scanned his figure beaming with freshness and health yes he is happy and content she thought while i and that disgusting good nature which everyone likes him for and praises i hate that good nature of his she thought her mouth stiffened the muscles of the cheek trembled on the right side of her pale nervous face 
 what do you want she said in a rapid deep unnatural voice 
 dolly he repeated with a quiver in his voice anna is coming today 
 well what is that to me i see her she cried 
 but you must really dolly 
 go away go away go away she shrieked without looking at him as though this shriek were called up by physical pain 
 stepan arkadyevich could be calm when he thought of his wife he could hope that everything would come round as matvei expressed it and had been able to go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee but when he saw her tortured suffering face heard the tone of her voice submissive to fate and full of despair his breath was cut short and a lump came to this throat and his eyes began to shine with tears 
 my god what have i done dolly for sake you know he could not go on there was a sob in his throat 
 she shut the bureau with a slam and glanced at him 
 dolly what can i say one thing forgive me remember cannot nine years of our life atone for an instant 
 she dropped her eyes and listened expecting what he would say as if beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently 
 instant of passion he said and would have gone on but at that word as at a pang of physical pain her lips stiffened again and again the muscles of her right cheek worked 
 go away go out of the room she shrieked still more shrilly and talk to me of your passions and your vilenesses 
 she tried to go out but tottered and clung to the back of a chair to support herself his face relaxed his lips became puffy tears welled up in his eyes 
 dolly he said sobbing now for sake think of the children they are not to blame i am to blame punish me then make me expiate my fault anything i can do i am ready to do i am to blame no words can express how much i am to blame but dolly forgive me 
 she sat down he listened to her hard heavy breathing and he was unutterably sorry for her she made several attempts to speak but could not he waited 
 you remember the children stiva to play with them but i remember and know that they go to ruin now she said obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the last three days 
 she had called him stiva and he glanced at her with gratitude and moved to take her hand but she drew back from him with aversion 
 i remember the children and for that reason i would do anything in the world to save them but i myself know the means by taking them away from their father or by leaving them with a vicious father yes a vicious father tell me after what has happened can we live together is that possible do tell me is it possible she repeated raising her voice after my husband the father of my children enters into a love affair with his own governess 
 but to be done to be done he kept saying in a pitiful voice not knowing what he was saying as his head sank lower and lower 
 you are loathsome to me repulsive she shrieked getting more and more heated your tears mean nothing you have never loved me you have neither a heart nor a sense of honor you are hateful to me disgusting a stranger yes a complete stranger with pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to herself stranger

 at that moment in the next room a child began to cry probably it had fallen down darya alexandrovna listened and her face suddenly softened

 dolly one word more he said following her

 darya alexandrovna in a dressing jacket and with her now scanty hair once luxuriant and beautiful fastened up with hairpins on the nape of her neck with a sunken thin face and large startled eyes which looked prominent from the thinness of her face was standing among a litter of all sorts of things scattered all over the room before an open bureau from which she was taking something hearing her steps she stopped looking toward the door and trying in vain to give her features a severe and contemptuous expression she felt she was afraid of him and afraid of the coming interview she was just attempting to do what she had attempted to do ten times already in these last three days to sort out the things and her own so as to take them to her and again she could not bring herself to do this but now again as each time before she kept saying to herself that things cannot go on like this that she must undertake something punish him put him to shame avenge on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her she still continued to tell herself that she should leave him but she was conscious that this was impossible it was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of regarding him as her husband and of loving him besides this she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly they would be still worse off where she was going with all of them as it was even in the course of these three days the youngest was unwell from being given unwholesome soup and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before she was conscious that it was impossible to go away but cheating herself she went on all the same sorting out her things and pretending she was going 
 seeing her husband she dropped her hands into the drawer of the bureau as though looking for something and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her but her face to which she tried to give a severe and resolute expression expressed bewilderment and suffering 
 dolly he said in a subdued and timid voice he had hunched up his shoulders and tried to look pitiful and humble but for all that he was radiant with freshness and health in a rapid glance she scanned his figure beaming with freshness and health yes he is happy and content she thought while i and that disgusting good nature which everyone likes him for and praises i hate that good nature of his she thought her mouth stiffened the muscles of the cheek trembled on the right side of her pale nervous face 
 what do you want she said in a rapid deep unnatural voice 
 dolly he repeated with a quiver in his voice anna is coming today 
 well what is that to me i see her she cried 
 but you must really dolly 
 go away go away go away she shrieked without looking at him as though this shriek were called up by physical pain 
 stepan arkadyevich could be calm when he thought of his wife he could hope that everything would come round as matvei expressed it and had been able to go on reading his paper and drinking his coffee but when he saw her tortured suffering face heard the tone of her voice submissive to fate and full of despair his breath was cut short and a lump came to this throat and his eyes began to shine with tears 
 my god what have i done dolly for sake you know he could not go on there was a sob in his throat 
 she shut the bureau with a slam and glanced at him 
 dolly what can i say one thing forgive me remember cannot nine years of our life atone for an instant 
 she dropped her eyes and listened expecting what he would say as if beseeching him in some way or other to make her believe differently 
 instant of passion he said and would have gone on but at that word as at a pang of physical pain her lips stiffened again and again the muscles of her right cheek worked 
 go away go out of the room she shrieked still more shrilly and talk to me of your passions and your vilenesses 
 she tried to go out but tottered and clung to the back of a chair to support herself his face relaxed his lips became puffy tears welled up in his eyes 
 dolly he said sobbing now for sake think of the children they are not to blame i am to blame punish me then make me expiate my fault anything i can do i am ready to do i am to blame no words can express how much i am to blame but dolly forgive me 
 she sat down he listened to her hard heavy breathing and he was unutterably sorry for her she made several attempts to speak but could not he waited 
 you remember the children stiva to play with them but i remember and know that they go to ruin now she said obviously one of the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of the last three days 
 she had called him stiva and he glanced at her with gratitude and moved to take her hand but she drew back from him with aversion 
 i remember the children and for that reason i would do anything in the world to save them but i myself know the means by taking them away from their father or by leaving them with a vicious father yes a vicious father tell me after what has happened can we live together is that possible do tell me is it possible she repeated raising her voice after my husband the father of my children enters into a love affair with his own governess 
 but to be done to be done he kept saying in a pitiful voice not knowing what he was saying as his head sank lower and lower 
 you are loathsome to me repulsive she shrieked getting more and more heated your tears mean nothing you have never loved me you have neither a heart nor a sense of honor you are hateful to me disgusting a stranger yes a complete stranger with pain and wrath she uttered the word so terrible to herself stranger 
 he looked at her and the fury expressed in her face alarmed and amazed him he did not understand that it was his pity for her that exasperated her she saw in him compassion for her but not love no she hates me she will not forgive me he thought 
 it is awful awful he said

 it was friday and in the dining room the watchmaker a german was winding up the clock stepan arkadyevich remembered his joke about this punctual bald watchmaker that the german was wound up for a whole lifetime himself to wind up watches and he smiled stepan arkadyevich was fond of a nice joke and maybe it will come round a good expression come round he thought i must tell that 
 matvei he shouted arrange everything with marya in the sitting room for anna arkadyevna he said to matvei when he came in

 chapter 
 
 stepan arkadyevich had learned easily at school thanks to his excellent abilities but he had been idle and mischievous and therefore was one of the lowest in his class but in spite of his habitually dissipated mode of life his inferior grade in the service and his comparative youth he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of president of one of the government boards at moscow this post he had received through his sister husband alexei alexandrovich karenin who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to which the moscow office belonged but if karenin had not got his this berth then through a hundred other personages brothers sisters cousins uncles and aunts stiva oblonsky would have received this post or some other like it together with the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him as his affairs in spite of his considerable property were in a poor state 
 half moscow and peterburg were friends and relations of stepan arkadyevich he was born in the midst of those who had been and had become the powerful ones of this world of the men in the government the older men had been friends of his and had known him in pinafores another third were his intimate chums and the remainder were friendly acquaintances consequently the distributors of earthly blessings in the shape of posts rents concessions and such were all his friends and could not overlook one of their own set and oblonsky had no need to make any special exertion to get a lucrative post he had only not to refuse things not to show jealousy not to be quarrelsome or take offense all of which from his characteristic good nature he never did it would have struck him as absurd if he had been told that he would not get a position with the salary he required especially as he expected nothing out of the way he only wanted what the men of his own age and standing did get and he was no worse qualified for performing duties of this kind than any other man 
 stepan arkadyevich was not merely liked by all who knew him for his good humor his bright disposition and his unquestionable honesty in him in his handsome radiant figure his sparkling eyes black hair and eyebrows and his white and pink complexion there was something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor on the people who met him aha stiva oblonsky the man himself was almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him even though it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that nothing particularly delightful had happened the next day and the next everyone was just as delighted to meet him again 
 after filling for two years the post of president of one of the government boards at moscow stepan arkadyevich had won the respect as well as the liking of his fellow officials subordinates and superiors and all who had had business with him the principal qualities in stepan arkadyevich which had gained him this universal respect in the service consisted in the first place of his extreme indulgence for others founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings secondly of his perfect liberalism not the liberalism he read of in the papers but the liberalism that was in his blood in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly equally and exactly the same whatever their fortune or rank might be and thirdly the most important point of his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged in consequence of which he was never carried away and made no mistakes 
 on reaching the offices of the board stepan arkadyevich escorted by a deferential porter with a portfolio went into his little private room put on his uniform and went into the board room the clerks and officials all rose greeting him with deference stepan arkadyevich moved quickly as always to his place shook hands with the members of the board and sat down he made a joke or two and talked just as much as was consistent with due decorum and began work no one knew better than stepan arkadyevich how to hit on that exact limit of freedom simplicity and official stiffness which is necessary for the agreeable conduct of business a secretary with the deference common to everyone in stepan office came up with papers and began to speak in the familiar and easy tone which had been introduced by stepan arkadyevich 
 we have succeeded in getting the information from the government department of penza here would you care 
 got it at last said stepan arkadyevich laying his finger on the paper now gentlemen 
 and the sitting of the board began 
 if they but knew he thought inclining his head with an important air and listening to the report what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago and his eyes were laughing during the reading of the report till two the sitting would go on without a break then there would be an interval and luncheon 
 it was not yet two when the large glass doors of the board room suddenly opened and someone came in 
 all the members of the board sitting at the table from below the portrait of the czar and from behind the mirror of justice delighted at any distraction looked round at the door but the doorkeeper standing there at once drove out the intruder and closed the glass door after him 
 when the case had been read through stepan arkadyevich got up and stretched and by way of tribute to the liberalism of the times took out a cigarette being in the board room and went into his private room two of his board fellows the old veteran in the service nikitin and the kammerjunker grinevich went in with him 
 we shall have time to finish after lunch said stepan arkadyevich 
 to be sure we shall said nikitin 
 a pretty sharp fellow this fomin must be said grinevich of one of the persons taking part in the case they were examining 
 stepan arkadyevich frowned at words giving him thereby to understand that it was improper to pass judgment prematurely and made him no reply 
 who was it who came in he asked the doorkeeper 
 some fellow your excellency sneaked in without permission directly my back was turned he was asking for you i told him when the members come out then 
 where is he 
 maybe gone into the passage he was strolling here till now he said the doorkeeper pointing to a strongly built broad shouldered man with a curly beard who without taking off his sheepskin cap was running lightly and rapidly up the worn steps of the stone staircase one of the officials going down a lean fellow with a portfolio stood out of his way looked disapprovingly at the legs of the running man and then glanced inquiringly at oblonsky 
 stepan arkadyevich was standing at the top of the stairs his beaming face above the embroidered collar of his uniform beamed more than ever when he recognized the man coming up 
 why actually you levin at last he said with a friendly mocking smile gazing on the approaching man how is it you have deigned to look me up in this den said stepan arkadyevich and not content with shaking hands he kissed his friend have you been here long 
 i have just come and very much wanted to see you said levin looking about him shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily 
 well go into my room said stepan arkadyevich who knew his sensitive and irritable shyness and taking his arm he drew him along as though guiding him through dangers 
 stepan arkadyevich was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances and called almost all of them by their christian names old men of sixty boys of twenty actors ministers merchants and adjutant generals so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had through the medium of oblonsky something in common he was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne and he took a glass of champagne with everyone and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums as he used in joke to call many of his friends in the presence of his subordinates he well knew how with his characteristic tact to diminish any possible disagreeable impression levin was not a disreputable chum but oblonsky with his ready tact felt that levin fancied oblonsky might not care to show his intimacy with him before subordinates and so stepan arkadyevich made haste to take him off into his room 
 levin was almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth they were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth but in spite of this each of them as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds though in discussion he would even justify the career in his heart despised it it seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin how often he had seen him come up to moscow from the country where he was doing something but what precisely stepan arkadyevich could never quite make out and indeed took no interest in the matter levin arrived in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new unexpected view of things stepan arkadyevich laughed at this and liked it in the same way levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend and his official duties which he laughed at and regarded as trifling but the difference was that oblonsky since he was doing the same as everyone did laughed assuredly and while levin laughed without assuredness and sometimes angrily 
 we have long been expecting you said stepan arkadyevich going into his room and letting hand go as though to show that here all danger was over i am very very glad to see you he went on well what now how are you when did you come 
 
 levin was silent looking at the unfamiliar faces of two companions and especially at the elegant hands with such long white fingers such long yellow nails curved at their end and such huge shining studs on the shirt cuff that apparently these hands absorbed all his attention and allowed him no freedom of thought oblonsky noticed this at once and smiled 
 ah to be sure let me introduce you he said my colleagues philip ivanich nikitin mikhail stanislavich grinevich and turning to levin a zemstvo member a modern zemstvo man a gymnast who lifts five poods with one hand a cattle breeder and sportsman and my friend constantin dmitrievich levin the brother of sergei ivanovich koznishev 
 delighted said the veteran 
 i have the honor of knowing your brother sergei ivanovich said grinevich holding out his slender hand with its long nails 
 levin frowned shook hands coldly and at once turned to oblonsky though he had a great respect for his an author well known to all russia he could not endure it when people treated him not as constantin levin but as the brother of the celebrated koznishev 
 no i am no longer a zemstvo man i have quarreled with them all and go to the sessions any more he said turning to oblonsky 
 been quick about it said oblonsky with a smile but how why 
 a long story i will tell you some time said levin but began telling him at once well to put it shortly i was convinced that nothing was really done by the zemstvo councils or ever could be he began as though someone had just insulted him on one side a plaything they play at being a parliament and neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings and on the other side he stammered a means for the coterie of the district to feather their nests formerly they did this through wardships and courts of justice now they do it through the zemstvo instead of taking the bribes they take the unearned salary he said as hotly as though one of those present had opposed his opinion 
 aha in a new phase again i see a conservative said stepan arkadyevich however we can go into that later 
 yes later but i had to see you said levin looking with hatred at hand 
 stepan arkadyevich gave a scarcely perceptible smile 
 but you used to say never wear european dress again he said gazing on new suit obviously cut by a french tailor so i see a new phase 
 levin suddenly blushed not as grown men blush slightly without being themselves aware of it but as boys blush feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more almost to the point of tears and it was so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky left off looking at him 
 oh where shall we meet you know i want very much to talk to you said levin 
 oblonsky seemed to ponder 
 tell you what go to to lunch and there we can talk i am free till three 
 no answered levin after an thought i have another visit to make 
 all right then dine together 
 dine together but i have nothing very particular just a word or two a question then a little chatting 
 well have your word or two right now and talk it over in the course of the dinner 
 well this said levin however of no importance 
 his face suddenly assumed an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness 
 what are the shcherbatskys doing everything as it used to be he said 
 stepan arkadyevich who had long known that levin was in love with his kitty gave a hardly perceptible smile and his eyes sparkled merrily 
 said your word or two but i answer in a few words because excuse me for just a minute 
 a secretary came in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of affairs he went up to oblonsky with some papers and began under pretense of asking a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevich without hearing him out laid his hand genially on the sleeve 
 no you do as i told you he said smoothing his remark with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he moved away the papers and said so do it that way if you please zakhar nikitich 
 the secretary retired in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment he was standing with elbows on the back of a chair and on his face was a look of ironical attention 
 i understand it i understand it he said 
 what you understand said oblonsky smiling just as cheerfully and picking up a cigarette he expected some queer outburst from levin 
 i understand what you are doing said levin shrugging his shoulders how can you be serious about it 
 why not 
 why because nothing in it 
 you think so yet overwhelmed with work 
 on paper but there a gift for it added levin 
 to say you think a lack of something in me 
 perhaps so said levin but all the same i admire your grandeur and am proud to have such a great person as a friend not answered my question though he went on with a desperate effort looking oblonsky straight in the face 
 oh all very well you wait a bit and come to this yourself very nice for you to have three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district and such muscles and the freshness of a girl of twelve still be one of us one day yes as to your question there is no change but a pity been away so long 
 oh why so levin queried frightened 
 oh nothing responded oblonsky talk it over but brought you up to town 
 oh talk about that too later on said levin reddening again up to his ears 
 all right i see said stepan arkadyevich i should ask you to come to us you know but my not quite well but tell you what if you want to see them sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five kitty skates you drive along there and come and fetch you and go and dine somewhere together 
 capital so till then 
 now mind forget i know you or rush off home to the country stepan arkadyevich called out laughing 
 no truly 
 and levin went out of the room recalling only when he was in the doorway that he had forgotten to take leave of colleagues 
 that gentleman must be a man of great energy said grinevich when levin had gone away 
 yes my dear sir said stepan arkadyevich nodding his head a lucky fellow three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district everything before him and what youth and vigor not like some of us 
 but why are you complaining stepan arkadyevich 
 why it goes hard with me very bad said stepan arkadyevich with a heavy sigh

 i have just come and very much wanted to see you said levin looking about him shyly and at the same time angrily and uneasily 
 well go into my room said stepan arkadyevich who knew his sensitive and irritable shyness and taking his arm he drew him along as though guiding him through dangers 
 stepan arkadyevich was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances and called almost all of them by their christian names old men of sixty boys of twenty actors ministers merchants and adjutant generals so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme ends of the social ladder and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had through the medium of oblonsky something in common he was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne and he took a glass of champagne with everyone and when in consequence he met any of his disreputable chums as he used in joke to call many of his friends in the presence of his subordinates he well knew how with his characteristic tact to diminish any possible disagreeable impression levin was not a disreputable chum but oblonsky with his ready tact felt that levin fancied oblonsky might not care to show his intimacy with him before subordinates and so stepan arkadyevich made haste to take him off into his room 
 levin was almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth they were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their characters and tastes as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth but in spite of this each of them as is often the way with men who have selected careers of different kinds though in discussion he would even justify the career in his heart despised it it seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life and the life led by his friend was a mere phantasm oblonsky could not restrain a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin how often he had seen him come up to moscow from the country where he was doing something but what precisely stepan arkadyevich could never quite make out and indeed took no interest in the matter levin arrived in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new unexpected view of things stepan arkadyevich laughed at this and liked it in the same way levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend and his official duties which he laughed at and regarded as trifling but the difference was that oblonsky since he was doing the same as everyone did laughed assuredly and while levin laughed without assuredness and sometimes angrily 
 we have long been expecting you said stepan arkadyevich going into his room and letting hand go as though to show that here all danger was over i am very very glad to see you he went on well what now how are you when did you come 
 
 levin was silent looking at the unfamiliar faces of two companions and especially at the elegant hands with such long white fingers such long yellow nails curved at their end and such huge shining studs on the shirt cuff that apparently these hands absorbed all his attention and allowed him no freedom of thought oblonsky noticed this at once and smiled 
 ah to be sure let me introduce you he said my colleagues philip ivanich nikitin mikhail stanislavich grinevich and turning to levin a zemstvo member a modern zemstvo man a gymnast who lifts five poods with one hand a cattle breeder and sportsman and my friend constantin dmitrievich levin the brother of sergei ivanovich koznishev 
 delighted said the veteran 
 i have the honor of knowing your brother sergei ivanovich said grinevich holding out his slender hand with its long nails 
 levin frowned shook hands coldly and at once turned to oblonsky though he had a great respect for his an author well known to all russia he could not endure it when people treated him not as constantin levin but as the brother of the celebrated koznishev 
 no i am no longer a zemstvo man i have quarreled with them all and go to the sessions any more he said turning to oblonsky 
 been quick about it said oblonsky with a smile but how why 
 a long story i will tell you some time said levin but began telling him at once well to put it shortly i was convinced that nothing was really done by the zemstvo councils or ever could be he began as though someone had just insulted him on one side a plaything they play at being a parliament and neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in playthings and on the other side he stammered a means for the coterie of the district to feather their nests formerly they did this through wardships and courts of justice now they do it through the zemstvo instead of taking the bribes they take the unearned salary he said as hotly as though one of those present had opposed his opinion 
 aha in a new phase again i see a conservative said stepan arkadyevich however we can go into that later 
 yes later but i had to see you said levin looking with hatred at hand 
 stepan arkadyevich gave a scarcely perceptible smile 
 but you used to say never wear european dress again he said gazing on new suit obviously cut by a french tailor so i see a new phase 
 levin suddenly blushed not as grown men blush slightly without being themselves aware of it but as boys blush feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more almost to the point of tears and it was so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish plight that oblonsky left off looking at him 
 oh where shall we meet you know i want very much to talk to you said levin 
 oblonsky seemed to ponder 
 tell you what go to to lunch and there we can talk i am free till three 
 no answered levin after an thought i have another visit to make 
 all right then dine together 
 dine together but i have nothing very particular just a word or two a question then a little chatting 
 well have your word or two right now and talk it over in the course of the dinner 
 well this said levin however of no importance 
 his face suddenly assumed an expression of anger from the effort he was making to surmount his shyness 
 what are the shcherbatskys doing everything as it used to be he said 
 stepan arkadyevich who had long known that levin was in love with his kitty gave a hardly perceptible smile and his eyes sparkled merrily 
 said your word or two but i answer in a few words because excuse me for just a minute 
 a secretary came in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of affairs he went up to oblonsky with some papers and began under pretense of asking a question to explain some objection stepan arkadyevich without hearing him out laid his hand genially on the sleeve 
 no you do as i told you he said smoothing his remark with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he moved away the papers and said so do it that way if you please zakhar nikitich 
 the secretary retired in confusion during the consultation with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment he was standing with elbows on the back of a chair and on his face was a look of ironical attention 
 i understand it i understand it he said 
 what you understand said oblonsky smiling just as cheerfully and picking up a cigarette he expected some queer outburst from levin 
 i understand what you are doing said levin shrugging his shoulders how can you be serious about it 
 why not 
 why because nothing in it 
 you think so yet overwhelmed with work 
 on paper but there a gift for it added levin 
 to say you think a lack of something in me 
 perhaps so said levin but all the same i admire your grandeur and am proud to have such a great person as a friend not answered my question though he went on with a desperate effort looking oblonsky straight in the face 
 oh all very well you wait a bit and come to this yourself very nice for you to have three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district and such muscles and the freshness of a girl of twelve still be one of us one day yes as to your question there is no change but a pity been away so long 
 oh why so levin queried frightened 
 oh nothing responded oblonsky talk it over but brought you up to town 
 oh talk about that too later on said levin reddening again up to his ears 
 all right i see said stepan arkadyevich i should ask you to come to us you know but my not quite well but tell you what if you want to see them sure now to be at the zoological gardens from four to five kitty skates you drive along there and come and fetch you and go and dine somewhere together 
 capital so till then 
 now mind forget i know you or rush off home to the country stepan arkadyevich called out laughing 
 no truly 
 and levin went out of the room recalling only when he was in the doorway that he had forgotten to take leave of colleagues 
 that gentleman must be a man of great energy said grinevich when levin had gone away 
 yes my dear sir said stepan arkadyevich nodding his head a lucky fellow three thousand dessiatinas in the karazinsky district everything before him and what youth and vigor not like some of us 
 but why are you complaining stepan arkadyevich 
 why it goes hard with me very bad said stepan arkadyevich with a heavy sigh

 when oblonsky asked levin what had brought him to town levin blushed and was furious with himself for blushing because he could not answer i have come to make your a proposal though that was solely what he had come for 
 the families of the levins and the shcherbatskys were old noble moscow families and had always been on intimate and friendly terms this intimacy had grown still closer during student days he had both prepared for the university with the young prince shcherbatsky the brother of kitty and dolly and had entered at the same time with him in those days levin was a frequent visitor at the house of the shcherbatskys and he was in love with the shcherbatsky household strange as it may appear it was with the household the family that constantin levin was in love especially with the feminine half of the household levin did not remember his own mother and his only sister was older than he was so that it was in the house that he saw for the first time that inner life of an old noble cultured and honorable family of which he had been deprived by the death of his father and mother all the members of that family especially the feminine half were pictured by him as it were wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil and he not only perceived no defects whatever in them but under the poetical veil that shrouded them he assumed the existence of the loftiest sentiments and every possible perfection why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak french and the next english why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the piano the sounds of which were audible in their room above where the students used to work why they were visited by those professors of french literature of music of drawing of dancing why at certain hours all the three young ladies with mademoiselle linon drove in the coach to the tverskoy boulevard dressed in their satin cloaks dolly in a long one natalie in a one and kitty in one so short that her shapely legs in red stockings were visible to all beholders why it was they had to walk about the tverskoy boulevard escorted by a footman with a gold cockade in his hat all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand but he was sure that everything that was done there was very good and he was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings 
 in his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest dolly but she was soon married to oblonsky then he began being in love with the second he felt as it were that he had to be in love with one of the sisters only he could not quite make out which but natalie too had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the diplomat lvov kitty was still a child when levin left the university young shcherbatsky went into the navy was drowned in the baltic and visits to the shcherbatskys despite his friendship with oblonsky became less frequent but when early in the winter of this year levin came to moscow after a year in the country and saw the shcherbatskys he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed destined to love 
 one would have thought that nothing could be simpler than for him a man of good family rather rich than poor and years old to make the young princess shcherbatskaia an offer of marriage in all likelihood he would at once have been looked upon as a good match but levin was in love and so it seemed to him that kitty was so perfect in every respect a creature so far above everything earthly while he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her 
 after spending two months in moscow in a state of befuddlement seeing kitty almost every day in society into which he went so as to meet her he abruptly decided that it could not be and went back to the country 
 conviction that it could not be was founded on the idea that in the eyes of her family he was a disadvantageous and worthless match for the charming kitty and that kitty herself could not love him in her eyes he had no ordinary definite career and position in society while his comrades by this time when he was were already one a colonel and another a professor another director of a bank and railways or chairman of a board like oblonsky but he he knew very well how he must appear to others was a country gentleman occupied in breeding cattle shooting game and building barns in other words a fellow of no ability who had not turned out well and who was doing just what according to the ideas of the world is done by people fit for nothing else 
 the mysterious enchanting kitty herself could not love such an ugly person as he conceived himself to be and above all such an ordinary in no way striking person moreover his attitude to kitty in the past the attitude of a person to a child arising from his friendship with her brother seemed to him yet another obstacle to love an ugly man as he considered himself might he supposed be liked as a friend but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved kitty one would need to be handsome and still more a distinguished man 
 he had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men but he did not believe it for he judged by himself and he could not himself have loved any but beautiful mysterious and exceptional women 
 but after spending two months alone in the country he was convinced that this was not one of those passions of which he had had experience in his early youth that this feeling gave him not an rest that he could not live without deciding the question as to whether she would or would not be his wife that his despair had arisen only from his own imaginings and that he had no sort of proof that he would be rejected so he had now come to moscow with a firm determination to make a proposal and get married if he were accepted or he could not conceive what would become of him if he were rejected

 on arriving in moscow by a morning train levin had put up at the house of his elder koznishev after changing his clothes he went down to his study intending to talk to him at once about the object of his visit and to ask his advice but his brother was not alone with him there was a professor of philosophy who had come from charkov expressly to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question the professor was carrying on a hot crusade against materialists sergei koznishev had been following this crusade with interest and after reading the last article had written him a letter stating his objections he accused the professor of making too great concessions to the materialists and the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out the point in discussion was the question then in vogue is there a line to be drawn between psychical and physiological phenomena in man and if so where 
 sergei ivanovich met his brother with the smile of chilly friendliness he always had for everyone and introducing him to the professor went on with the conversation 
 a little man in spectacles with a narrow forehead tore himself from the discussion for an instant to greet levin and then went on talking without paying any further attention to him levin sat down to wait till the professor should go but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion 
 levin had come across the magazine articles about which they were disputing and had read them interested in them as a development of the first principles of science familiar to him when a natural science student at the university but he had never connected these scientific deductions as to the origin of man as an animal as to reflex action biology and sociology with those questions as to the meaning to himself of life and death which had of late been more and more often in his mind 
 as he listened to his argument with the professor he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems that at times they almost touched on the latter but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point they promptly beat a hasty retreat and plunged again into a sea of subtle distinctions reservations quotations allusions and appeals to authorities and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about 
 i cannot admit it said sergei ivanovich with his habitual clearness and distinctness of expression and elegance of diction i cannot in any case agree with keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from impressions the most fundamental idea the idea of existence has not been received by me through sensation indeed there is no special sense organ for the transmission of such an idea 
 yes but they wurst and knaust and pripassov would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations wurst indeed says plainly that assuming there are no sensations it follows that there is no idea of existence 
 i maintain the contrary began sergei ivanovich 
 but here it seemed again to levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter they were again retreating and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor 
 according to that if my senses are annihilated if my body is dead i can have no existence of any sort he queried 
 the professor in annoyance and as it were mental suffering at the interruption looked round at the strange inquirer more like a hauler of a barge than a philosopher and turned his eyes upon sergei ivanovich as though to ask one to say to him but sergei ivanovich who had been talking with far less stress and than the professor and who had sufficient breadth of mind to answer the professor and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put smiled and said 
 that question we have no right to answer as yet 
 we have not the requisite data confirmed the professor and he went back to his argument no he said i would point out the fact that if as pripassov directly asserts sensation is based on impression then we are bound to distinguish sharply between these two conceptions 
 levin listened no more and simply waited for the professor to go
