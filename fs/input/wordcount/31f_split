lionfish nov chapter the battle of hogwartscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 the enchanted ceiling of the great hall was dark and scattered with stars and below it the four long house tables were lined with disheveled students some in traveling cloaks others in dressing gowns here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts every eye living and dead was fixed upon professor mcgonagall who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the hall behind her stood the remaining teaches including the palomino centaur firenze and the members of the order of the phoenix who had arrived to fight 
 
 evacuation will be overseen by mr filch and madame pomfrey prefects when i give the word you will organize your house and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation point 
 
 many of the students looked petrified however as harry skirted the walls scanning the gryffindor table for ron and hermione ernie macmillan stood up at the hufflepuff table and shouted and what if we want to stay and fight 
 
 there was a smattering of applause 
 
 if you are of age you may stay said professor mcgonagall 
 
 what about our things called a girl at the ravenclaw table our trunks our owls 
 
 we have no time to collect possessions said professor mcgonagall the important thing is to get you out of here safely 
 
 wheres professor snape shouted a girl from the slytherin table 
 
 he has to use the common phrase done a bunk replied professor mcgonagall and a great cheer erupted from the gryffindors hufflepuffs and ravenclaws 
 
 harry moved up the hall alongside the gryffindor table still looking for ron and hermione as he passed faces turned in his direction and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake 
 
 we have already placed protection around the castle professor mcgonagall was saying but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it i must ask you therefore to move quickly and calmly and do as your prefects c 
 
 but her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the hall it was high cold and clear there was no telling from where it came it seemed to issue from the walls themselves like the monster it had once commanded it might have lain dormant there for centuries 
 
 i know that you are preparing to fight there were screams amongst the students some of whom clutched each other looking around in terror for the source of the sound your efforts are futile you cannot fight me i do not want to kill you i have great respect for the teachers of hogwarts i do not want to spill magical blood 
 
 there was silence in the hall now the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums that seems too huge to be contained by walls 
 
 give me harry potter said voldemorts voice and they shall not be harmed give me harry potter and i shall leave the school untouched give me harry potter and you will be rewarded 
 
 you have until midnight 
 
 the silence swallowed them all again every head turned every eye in the place seemed to have found harry to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible beams then a figure rose from the slytherin table and he recognized pansy parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and screamed but hes there potters there someone grab him 
 
 before harry could speak there was a massive movement the gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing not harry but the slytherins then the hufflepuffs stood and almost at the same moment the ravenclaws all of them with their backs to harry all of them looking toward pansy instead and harry awestruck and overwhelmed saw wands emerging everywhere pulled from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves 
 
 thank you miss parkinson said professor mcgonagall in a clipped voice you will leave the hall first with mr filch if the rest of your house could follow 
 
 harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the slytherins trooping out on the other side of the hall 
 
 ravenclaws follow on cried professor mcgonagall 
 
 slowly the four tables emptied the slytherin table was completely deserted but a number of older ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out even more hufflepuffs stayed behind and half of gryffindor remained in their seats necessitating professor mcgonagalls descent from the teachers platform to chivvy the underage on their way 
 
 absolutely not creevey go and you peakes 
 
 harry hurried over to the weasleys all sitting together at the gryffindor table 
 
 where are ron and hermione 
 
 havent you found began mr weasley looking worried 
 
 but he broke off as kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who had remained behind 
 
 weve only got half an half an hour until midnight so we need to act fast a battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of hogwarts and the order of the phoenix professors flitwick sprout and mcgonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers c ravenclaw astronomy and gryffindor c where theyll have good overview excellent positions from which to work spells meanwhile remus c he indicated lupin c arthur c he pointed toward mr weasley sitting at the gryffindor table c and i will take groups into the grounds well need somebody to organize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school c 
 
 sounds like a job for us called fred indicating himself and george and kingsley nodded his approval 
 
 all right leaders up here and well divide up the troops 
 
 potter said professor mcgonagall hurrying up to him as students flooded the platform jostling for position receiving instructions arent you supposed to be looking for something 
 
 what oh said harry oh yeah 
 
 he had almost forgotten about the horcrux almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it the inexplicable absence of ron and hermione had momentarily driven every other thought from his mind 
 
 then go potter go 
 
 right c yeah c 
 
 he sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the great hall again into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students he allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor fear and panic were clouding his thought processes he tried to calm himself to concentrate on finding the horcrux but his thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass without ron and hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas he slowed down coming to a halt halfway along a passage where he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the marauders map out of the pouch around his neck he could not see rons of hermiones names anywhere on it though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the room of requirement might he thought be concealing them he put the map away pressed his hands over his face and closed his eyes trying to concentrate 
 
 voldemort thought id go to ravenclaw tower 
 
 there it was a solid fact the place to start voldemort had stationed alecto carrow in the ravenclaw common room and there could be only one explanation voldemort feared that harry already knew his horcrux was connected to that house 
 
 but the only object anyone seemed to associate with ravenclaw was the lost diadem and how could the horcrux be the diadem how was it possible that voldemort the slytherin had found the diadem that had eluded generations of ravenclaws who could have told him where to look when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory 
 
 in living memory 
 
 beneath his fingers harrys eyes flew open again he leapt up from the plinth and tore back the way he had come now in pursuit of his one last hope the sound of hundreds of people marching toward the room of requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs prefects were shouting instructions trying to keep track of the students in their own houses there was much pushing and shouting harry saw zacharias smith bowling over first years to get to the front of the queue here and there younger students were in tears while older ones called desperately for friends or siblings 
 
 harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor 
 
 nick nick i need to talk to you 
 
 he forced his way back through the tide of students finally reaching the bottom of the stairs where nearly headless nick ghost of gryffindor tower stood waiting for him 
 
 harry my dear boy 
 
 nick made to grasp harrys hands with both of his own harry felt as though they had been thrust into icy water 
 
 nick youve got to help me whos the ghost of ravenclaw tower 
 
 nearly headless nick looked surprised and a little offended 
 
 the gray lady of course but if it is ghostly services you require 
 
 its got to be her c dyou know where she is 
 
 lets see 
 
 nicks head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither peering over the heads of the swarming students 
 
 thats her over there harry the young woman with the long hair 
 
 harry looked in the direction of nicks transparent pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of harry looking at her raised her eyebrows and drifted away through a solid wall 
 
 harry ran after her once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared he saw her at the very end of the passage still gliding smoothly away from him 
 
 hey c wait c come back 
 
 she consented to pause floating a few inches from the ground harry supposed that she was beautiful with her hair and cloak but she also looked haughty and proud close in he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor but to whom he had never spoken 
 
 youre the gray lady 
 
 she nodded but did not speak 
 
 the ghost of ravenclaw tower 
 
 that is correct 
 
 her tone was not encouraging 
 
 please i need some help i need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem 
 
 a cold smile curved her lips 
 
 i am afraid she said turning to leave that i cannot help you 
 
 wait 
 
 he had not meant to shout but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him he glanced at his watch as she hovered in front of him it was a quarter to midnight 
 
 this is urgent he said fiercely if that diadems at hogwarts ive got to find it fast 
 
 you are hardly the first student to covet the diadem she said disdainfully generations of students have badgered me c 
 
 this isnt about trying to get better marks harry shouted at her its about voldemort c defeating voldemort c or arent you interested in that 
 
 she could not blush but her transparent cheeks became more opaque and her voice was heated as she replied of course i c how dare you suggest c 
 
 well help me then 
 
 her composure was slipping 
 
 it c it is not a question of c she stammered my mothers diadem c 
 
 your mothers 
 
 she looked angry with herself 
 
 when i lived she said stiffly i was helena ravenclaw 
 
 youre her daughter but then you must know what happed to it 
 
 while the diadem bestows wisdom she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together i doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself lord c 
 
 havent i told you im not interested in wearing it harry said fiercely theres no time to explain c but if you care about hogwarts if you want to see voldemort finished youve got to tell me anything you know about the diadem 
 
 she remained quite still floating in midair staring down at him and a sense of hopelessness engulfed harry of course if she had known anything she would have told flitwick of dumbledore who had surely asked her the same question he had shaken his head and made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice 
 
 i stole the diadem from my mother 
 
 you c you did what 
 
 i stole the diadem repeated helena ravenclaw in a whisper i sought to make myself cleverer more important than my mother i ran away with it 
 
 he did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask he simply listened hard as she went on 
 
 my mother they say never admitted that the diadem was gone but pretended that she had it still she concealed her loss my dreadful betrayal even from the other founders of hogwarts 
 
 then my mother fell ill c fatally ill in spite of my perfidy she was desperate to see me one more time she sent a man who had long loved me though i spurned his advances to find me she knew that he would not rest until he had done so 
 
 harry waited she drew a deep breath and threw back her head 
 
 he tracked me to the forest where i was hiding when i refused to return with him he became violent the baron was always a man furious at my refusal jealous of my freedom he stabbed me 
 
 the baron you mean 
 
 the bloody baron yes said the gray lady and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest 
 
 when he saw what he had done he was overcome with remorse he took the weapon that had claimed my life and used it to kill himself all these centuries later he wears his chains as an act of penitence as he should she added bitterly 
 
 and c and the diadem 
 
 it remained where i had hidden it when i heard the baron blundering through the forest toward me concealed inside a hollow tree 
 
 a hollow tree repeated harry what tree where was this 
 
 a forest in albania a lonely place i thought was far beyond my mothers reach 
 
 albania repeated harry sense was emerging miraculously from confusion and now he understood why she was telling him what she had denied dumbledore and flitwick youve already told someone this story havent you another student 
 
 she closed her eyes and nodded 
 
 i had no idea he was flattering he seemed to understand to sympathize 
 
 yes harry thought tom riddle would certainly have understood helena ravenclaws desire to possess fabulous objects to which she had little right 
 
 well you werent the first person riddle wormed things out of harry muttered he could be charming when he wanted 
 
 so voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost diadem out of the gray lady he had traveled to that forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place perhaps as soon as he left hogwarts before he even started work at borgin and burkes 
 
 and wouldnt those secluded albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when so much later voldemort and needed a place to lie low undisturbed for ten long years 
 
 but the diadem once it became his precious horcrux had not been left in that lowly tree no the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home and voldemort must have put it there c 
 
 c the night he asked for a job said harry finishing his thought 
 
 i beg your pardon 
 
 he hid the diadem in the castle the night he asked dumbledore to let him teach said harry saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all he mustve hidden the diadem on his way up to or down from dumbledores office but it was well worth trying to get the job c then he mightve got the chance to nick gryffindors sword as well c thank you thanks 
 
 harry left her floating there looking utterly bewildered as he rounded the corner back into the entrance hall he checked his watch it was five minutes until midnight and though he now knew what the last horcrux was he was no closer to discovering where it was 
 
 generations of students had failed to find the diadem that suggested that it was not in ravenclaw tower c but if not there where what hiding place had tom riddle discovered inside hogwarts castle that he believed would remain secret forever 
 
 lost in desperate speculation harry turned a corner but he had taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening shattering crash as he leapt aside a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall 
 
 something large and furry detached itself whimpering from the new arrival and flung itself at harry 
 
 hagrid harry bellowed fighting off fang the boarhounds attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet what the c 
 
 harry yer here yer here 
 
 hagrid stooped down bestowed upon harry a cursory and hug then ran back to the shattered window 
 
 good boy grawpy he bellowed through the hole in the window ill se yer in a moment theres a good lad 
 
 beyond hagrid out in the dark night harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a weird keening scream he looked down at his watch it was midnight the battle had begun 
 
 blimey harry panted hagrid this is it eh time ter fight 
 
 hagrid where have you come from 
 
 heard from up in our cave said hagrid grimly voice carried didnt it yet got till midnight ter gimme potter knew yeh mus be here knew that mus be happenin get down fang so we come ter join in me an grawpy an fang smashed our way through the boundary by the forest grawpy was carryin us fang an me told him ter let me down at the castle so he shoved me through the window bless him not exactly what i meant bu c wheres ron an hermione 
 
 that said harry is a really good question come on 
 
 they hurried together along the corridor fang lolloping beside them harry could hear movement through the corridors all around running footsteps shouts through the windows he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds 
 
 wherere we goin puffed hagrid pounding along at harrys heels making the floorboards quake 
 
 i dunno exactly said harry making another random turn but ron and hermione must be around here somewhere 
 
 the first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead the two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that had sailed through another broken window their remains stirred feebly on the floor and as harry leapt over one of their disembodied heads it moaned faintly oh dont mind me ill just be here and crumble 
 
 its ugly stone face made harry think suddenly of the marble bust of rowena ravenclaw at xenophiliuss house wearing that mad headdress c and then of the statue in ravenclaw tower with the stone diadem upon her white curls 
 
 and as he reached the end of the passage the memory of a third stone effigy came back to him that of an ugly old warlock onto whose head harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old hat the shock shot through harry with the heat of firewhisky and he nearly stumbled 
 
 he knew at least where the horcrux sat waiting for him 
 
 tom riddle who confided in no one and operated alone might have been arrogant enough to assume that he and only he had penetrated the deepest mysteries of hogwarts castle of course dumbledore and flitwick those model pupils had never set foot in that particular place but he harry had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school c here at least was a secret area he and voldemort knew that dumbledore had never discovered c 
 
 he was roused by professor sprout who was thundering past followed by neville and half a dozen others all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants 
 
 mandrakes neville bellowed at harry over his shoulder as he ran going to lob them over the walls c they wont like this 
 
 harry knew now where to go he sped off with hagrid and fang galloping behind him they passed portrait after portrait and the painted figures raced alongside them wizards and witches in ruffs and breeches in armor and cloaks cramming themselves into each others canvases screaming news from other parts of the castle as they reached the end of this corridor the whole castle shook and harry knew as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the order 
 
 its all righ fang c its all righ yelled hagrid but the great boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air and hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog leaving harry alone 
 
 he forged on through the trembling passages his wand at the ready and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight sir cadrigan rushed from painting to painting beside him clanking along in his armor screaming encouragement his fat little pony cantering behind him 
 
 braggarts and rogues dogs and scoundrels drive them out harry potter see them off 
 
 harry hurtled around a corner and found fred and a small knot of students including lee jordan and hannah abbott standing beside another empty plinth whose statue had concealed a secret passageway their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole 
 
 nice night for it fred shouted as the castle quaked again and harry sprinted by elated and terrified in equal measure along yet another corridor he dashed and then there were owls everywhere and mrs norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws no doubt to return them to their proper place 
 
 potter 
 
 aberforth dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead his wand held ready 
 
 ive had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub potter 
 
 i know were evacuating harry said voldemorts c 
 
 c attacking because they havent handed you over yeah said aberforth im not deaf the whole of hogsmeade heard him and it never occurred to any of you to keep a few slytherins hostage there are kids of death eaters youve just sent to safety wouldnt it have been a bit smarter to keep em here 
 
 it wouldnt stop voldemort said harry and your brother would never have done it 
 
 aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction 
 
 your brother would never have done it well it was the truth harry thought as he ran on again dumbledore who had defended snape for so long would never have held students ransom 
 
 and then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw them ron and hermione both with their arms full of large curved dirty yellow objects ron with a broomstick under his arms 
 
 where the hell have you been harry shouted 
 
 chamber of secrets said ron 
 
 chamber c what said harry coming to an unsteady halt before them 
 
 it was ron all rons idea said hermione breathlessly wasnt it absolutely brilliant there we were after we left and i said to ron even if we find the other one how are we going to get rid of it we still hadnt got rid of the cup and then he thought of it the basilisk 
 
 what the c 
 
 something to get rid of horcruxes said ron simply 
 
 harrys eyes dropped to the objects clutched in ron and hermiones arms great curved fangs torn he now realized from the skull of a dead basilisk 
 
 but how did you get in there he asked staring from the fangs to ron you need to speak parseltongue 
 
 he did whispered hermione show him ron 
 
 ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise 
 
 its what you did to open the locket he told harry apologetically i had to have a few goes to get it right but he shrugged modestly we got there in the end 
 
 he was amazing said hermione amazing 
 
 so harry was struggling to keep up so 
 
 so were another horcrux down said ron and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled remains of hufflepuffs cup hermione stabbed it thought she should she hasnt had the pleasure yet 
 
 genius yelled harry 
 
 it was nothing said ron though he looked delighted with himself so whats new with you 
 
 as he said it there was an explosion from overhead all three of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream 
 
 i know what the diadem looks like and i know where it is said harry talking fast he hid it exactly where i had my old potions book where everyones been hiding stuff for centuries he thought he was the only one to find it come on 
 
 as the walls trembled again he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the room of requirement it was empty except for three women ginny tonks and an elderly witch wearing a hat whom harry recognized immediately as nevilles grandmother 
 
 ah potter she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him you can tell us whats going on 
 
 is everyone okay said ginny and tonks together 
 
 s far as we know said harry are there still people in the passage to the hogs head 
 
 he knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it 
 
 i was the last to come through said mrs longbottom i sealed it i think it unwise to leave it open now aberforth has left his pub have you seen my grandson 
 
 hes fighting said harry 
 
 naturally said the old lady proudly excuse me i must go and assist him 
 
 with surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps 
 
 harry looked at tonks 
 
 i thought you were supposed to be with teddy at your mothers 
 
 i couldnt stand not knowing c tonks looked anguished shell look after him c have you seen remus 
 
 he was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds c 
 
 without another word tonks sped off 
 
 ginny said harry im sorry but we need you to leave too just for a bit then you can come back in 
 
 ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary 
 
 and then you can come back in he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after tonks youve got to come back in 
 
 hang on a moment said ron sharply weve forgotten someone 
 
 who asked hermione 
 
 the theyll all be down in the kitchen wont they 
 
 you mean we ought to get them fighting asked harry 
 
 no said ron seriously i mean we should tell them to get out we dont want anymore dobbies do we we cant order them to die for us c 
 
 there was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of hermiones arms running at ron she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth ron threw away the fangs and broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted hermione off her feet 
 
 is this the moment harry asked weakly and when nothing happened except that ron and hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot he raised his voice oi theres a war going on here 
 
 ron and hermione broke apart their arms still around each other 
 
 i know mate said ron who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the head with a bludger so its now or never isnt it 
 
 never mind that what about the horcrux harry shouted dyou think you could just c just hold it in until weve got the diadem 
 
 yeah c right c sorry c said ron and he and hermione set about gathering up fangs both pink in the face 
 
 it was clear as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs that in the minutes that they had spent in the room of requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated severely the walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever dust filled the air and through the nearest window harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew the death eaters must be very near to entering the place looking down harry saw grawp the giant meandering past swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring his displeasure 
 
 lets hope he steps on some of them said ron as more screams echoed from close by 
 
 as long as its not any of our lot said a voice harry turned and saw ginny and tonks both with their wands drawn at the next window which was missing several panes even as he watched ginny sent a jinx into a crowd of fighters below 
 
 good girl roared a figure running through the dust toward them and harry saw aberforth again his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past they look like they might be breaching the north battlements theyve brought giants of their own 
 
 have you seen remus tonks called after him 
 
 he was dueling dolohov shouted aberforth havent seen him since 
 
 tonks said ginny tonks im sure hes okay c 
 
 but tonks had run off into the dust after aberforth 
 
 ginny turned helpless to harry ron and hermione 
 
 theyll be all right said harry though he knew they were empty words ginny well be back in a moment just keep out of the way keep safe c come on he said to ron and hermione and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the room of requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant 
 
 i need the place where everything is hidden harry begged of it inside his head and the door materialized on their third run past 
 
 the furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind them all was silent they were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city its towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of students 
 
 and he never realized anyone could get in said ron his voice echoing in the silence 
 
 he thought he was the only one said harry too bad for him ive had to hide stuff in my time this way he added i think its down here 
 
 they sped off up adjacent aisles harry could hear the others footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk of bottles hats crates chairs books weapons broomsticks bats 
 
 somewhere near here harry muttered to himself somewhere somewhere 
 
 deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went looking for objects he recognized from his one previous trip into the room his breath was loud in his ears and then his very soul seemed to shiver there it was right ahead the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old potions book and on top of it the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient discolored tiara 
 
 he had already stretched out his hand though he remained few feet away when a voice behind him said hold it potter 
 
 he skidded to a halt and turned around crabbe and goyle were standing behind him shoulder to shoulder wands pointing right at harry through the small space between their jeering faces he saw draco malfoy 
 
 thats my wand youre holding potter said malfoy pointing his own through the gap between crabbe and goyle 
 
 not anymore panted harry tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand winners keepers malfoy whos lent you theirs 
 
 my mother said draco 
 
 harry laughed though there was nothing very humorous about the situation he could not hear ron or hermione anymore they seemed to have run out of earshot searching for the diadem 
 
 so how come you three arent with voldemort asked harry 
 
 were gonna be rewarded said crabbe his voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous person harry had hardly ever heard him speak before crabbe was speaking like a small child promised a large bag of sweets we ung back potter we decided not to go decided to bring you to im 
 
 good plan said harry in mock admiration he could not believe that he was this close and was going to be thwarted by malfoy crabbe and goyle he began edging slowly backward toward the place where the horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust if he could just get his hands on it before the fight broke out 
 
 so how did you get in here he asked trying to distract them 
 
 i virtually lived in the room of hidden things all last year said malfoy his voice brittle i know how to get in 
 
 we was hiding in the corridor outside grunted goyle we can do disslusion charms now and then his face split into a gormless grin you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking for a whats a 
 
 harry rons voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to harrys right are you talking to someone 
 
 with a whiplike movement crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty foot mountain of old furniture of broken trunks of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk and shouted descendo 
 
 the wall began to totter then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where ron stood 
 
 ron harry bellowed as somewhere out of sight hermione screamed and harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall he pointed his wand at the rampart cried finite and it steadied 
 
 no shouted malfoy staying crabbes arm as the latter made to repeat his spell if you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing 
 
 whats that matter said crabbe tugging himself free its potter the dark lord wants who cares about a 
 
 potter came in here to get it said malfoy with impatience at the of his colleagues so that must mean c 
 
 must mean crabbe turned on malfoy with undisguised ferocity who cares what you think i dont take your orders no more draco you an your dad are finished 
 
 harry shouted ron again from the other side of the junk wad whats going on 
 
 harry mimicked crabbe whats going on c no potter crucio 
 
 harry had lunged for the tiara crabbes curse missed him but hit the stone bust which flew into the air the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested 
 
 stop malfoy shouted at crabbe his voice echoing through the enormous room the dark lord wants him alive c 
 
 so im not killing him am i yelled crabbe throwing off malfoys restraining arm but if i can i will the dark lord wants him dead anyway whats the diff c 
 
 a jet of scarlet light shot past harry by inches hermione had run around the corner behind him and sent a stunning spell straight at crabbes head it only missed because malfoy pulled him out of the way 
 
 its that mudblood avada kedavra 
 
 harry saw hermione dive aside and his fury that crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind he shot a stunning spell at crabbe who lurched out of the way knocking malfoys wand out of his hand it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones 
 
 dont kill him dont kill him malfoy yelled at crabbe and goyle who were both aiming at harry their split seconds hesitation was all harry needed 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 goyles wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him goyle leapt foolishly on the spot trying to retrieve it malfoy jumped out of range of hermiones second stunning spell and ron appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle shot a full curse at crabbe which narrowly missed 
 
 crabbe wheeled around and screamed avada kedavra again ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light the malfoy cowered behind a wardrobe as hermione charged toward them hitting goyle with a stunning spell as she came 
 
 its somewhere here harry yelled at her pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara had fallen look for it while i go and help r c 
 
 harry she screamed 
 
 a roaring billowing noise behind him gave him a moments warning he turned and saw both ron and crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them 
 
 like it hot scum roared crabbe as he ran 
 
 but he seemed to have no control over what he had done flames of abnormal size were pursuing them licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks which were crumbling to soot at their touch 
 
 aguamenti harry bawled but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated in the air 
 
 run 
 
 malfoy grabbed the stunned goyle and dragged him along crabbe outstripped all of them now looking terrified harry ron and hermione pelted along in his wake and the fire pursued them it was not normal fire crabbe had used a curse of which harry had no knowledge as they turned a corner the flames chased them as though they were alive sentient intent upon killing them now the fire was mutating forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts flaming serpents chimaeras and dragons rose and fell and rose again and the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths tossed high on clawed feet before being consumed by the inferno 
 
 malfoy crabbe and goyle had vanished from view harry ron and hermione stopped dead the fiery monsters were circling them drawing closer and closer claws and horns and tails lashed and the heat was solid as a wall around them 
 
 what can we do hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire what can we do 
 
 here 
 
 harry seized a pair of broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to ron who pulled hermione onto it behind him harry swung his leg over the second broom and with hard kicks to the ground they soared up in the air missing by feet the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them the smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming below them the cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted students the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room harry could not see a trace of malfoy crabbe or goyle anywhere he swooped as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to find them but there was nothing but fire what a terrible way to die he had never wanted this 
 
 harry lets get out lets get out bellowed ron though it was impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke 
 
 and then harry heard a thin piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion the thunder of devouring flame 
 
 its c too c dangerous c ron yelled but harry wheeled in the air his glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the smoke he raked the firestorm below seeking a sign of life a limb or a face that was not yet charred like wood 
 
 and he saw them malfoy with his arms around the unconscious goyle the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks and harry dived malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm but even as harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good goyle was too heavy and malfoys hand covered in sweat slid instantly out of harrys c 
 
 if we die for them ill kill you harry roared rons voice and as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them he and hermione dragged goyle onto their broom and rose rolling and pitching into the air once more as malfoy clambered up behind harry 
 
 the door get to the door the door screamed malfoy in harrys ear and harry sped up following ron hermione and goyle through the billowing black smoke hardly able to breathe and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration cups and shields a sparkling necklace and an old discolored tiara c 
 
 what are you doing what are you doing the doors that way screamed malfoy but harry made a hairpin swerve and dived the diadem seemed to fall in slow motion turning and glittering as it dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent and then he had it caught it around his wrist c 
 
 harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him he soared upward and straight toward the place where he prayed the door stood open ron hermione and goyle had vanished malfoy was screaming and holding harry so tightly it hurt then through the smoke harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the broom at it and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they collided with the wall in the corridor beyond 
 
 malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown gasping coughing and retching harry rolled over and sat up the door to the room of requirement had vanished and ron and hermione sat panting on the floor beside goyle who was still unconscious 
 
 choked malfoy as soon as he could speak 
 
 hes dead said ron harshly 
 
 there was silence apart from panting and coughing then a number of huge bangs shook the castle and a great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms harry staggered to his feet when the headless hunt had passed and looked around the battle was still going on all around him he could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts panic flared within him 
 
 wheres ginny he said sharply she was here she was supposed to be going back into the room of requirement 
 
 blimey dyou reckon itll still work after that fire asked ron but he too got to his feet rubbing his chest and looking left and right shall we split up and look c 
 
 no said hermione getting to her feet too malfoy and goyle remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor neither of them had wands lets stick together i say we go c harry whats that on your arm 
 
 what oh yeah c 
 
 he pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up it was still hot blackened with soot but as he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure 
 
 a bloodlike substance dark and tarry seemed to be leaking from the diadem suddenly harry felt the thing vibrate violently then break apart in his hands and as it did so he thought he heard the faintest most distant scream of pain echoing not from the grounds or the castle but from the thing that had just fragmented in his fingers 
 
 it must have been fiendfyre whimpered hermione her eyes on the broken piece 
 
 sorry 
 
 fiendfyre c cursed fire c its one of the substances that destroy horcruxes but i would never ever have dared use it its so dangerous c how did crabbe know how to c 
 
 mustve learned from the carrows said harry grimly 
 
 shame he wasnt concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it really said ron whose hair like hermiones was singed and whose face was blackened if he hadnt tried to kill us all id be quite sorry he was dead 
 
 but dont you realize whispered hermione this means if we can just get the snake c 
 
 but she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail death eaters had penetrated hogwarts fred and percy had just backed into view both of them dueling masked and hooded men 
 
 harry ron and hermione ran forward to help jets of light flew in every direction and the man dueling percy backed off fast then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair c 
 
 hello minister bellowed percy sending a neat jinx straight at thicknesse who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes apparently in awful discomfort did i mention im resigning 
 
 youre joking perce shouted fred as the death eater he was battling collapsed under the weight of three separate stunning spells thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupting all over him he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin fred looked at percy with glee 
 
 you actually are joking perce i dont think ive heard you joke since you were c 
 
 the air exploded they had been grouped together harry ron hermione fred and percy the two death eaters at their feet one stunned the other transfigured and in that fragment of a moment when danger seemed temporarily at bay the world was rent apart harry felt himself flying through the air and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his one and only weapon and shield his head in his arms he heard the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them c 
 
 and then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness he was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack cold air told him that the side of the castle had been blown away and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding copiously then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides that expressed agony of a kind neither flame nor curse could cause and he stood up swaying more frightened than he had been that day more frightened perhaps than he had been in his life 
 
 and hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage and three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart harry grabbed hermiones hand as they staggered and stumbled over stone and wood 
 
 no c no c no someone was shouting no fred no and percy was shaking his brother and ron was kneeling beside them and freds eyes stared without seeing the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face
