 the terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded and the consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm produced an unexpected impression on napoleon who usually liked to look at the killed and wounded thereby he considered testing his strength of mind this day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his greatness he rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the shevardino knoll where he sat on his campstool his sallow face swollen and heavy his eyes dim his nose red and his voice hoarse involuntarily listening with downcast eyes to the sounds of firing with painful dejection he awaited the end of this action in which he regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest a personal human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the artificial phantasm of life he had served so long he felt in his own person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield the heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for himself at that moment he did not desire moscow or victory or glory what need had he for any more glory the one thing he wished for was rest tranquillity and freedom but when he had been on the semenovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the fire on the russian troops crowded in front of knyazkovo napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought to him of the effect those batteries produced 
 an adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns had been concentrated on the russians as he had ordered but that they still held their ground 
 our fire is mowing them down by rows but still they hold on said the adjutant 
 they want more said napoleon in a hoarse voice 
 sire asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark 
 they want more croaked napoleon frowning let them have it 
 even before he gave that order the thing he did not desire and for which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him was being done and he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary greatness and again as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing something for itself he submissively fulfilled the cruel sad gloomy and inhuman role predestined for him 
 and not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening lay more than on all the others who took part in it never to the end of his life could he understand goodness beauty or truth or the significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and truth too remote from everything human for him ever to be able to grasp their meaning he could not disavow his actions belauded as they were by half the world and so he had to repudiate truth goodness and all humanity 
 not only on that day as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men killed and maimed by his will as he believed did he reckon as he looked at them how many russians there were for each frenchman and deceiving himself find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that there were five russians for every frenchman not on that day alone did he write in a letter to paris that the battle field was superb because fifty thousand corpses lay there but even on the island of st helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done he wrote 
 the russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times it was a war of good sense for real interests for the tranquillity and security of all it was purely pacific and conservative 
 it was a war for a great cause the end of uncertainties and the beginning of security a new horizon and new labors were opening out full of and prosperity for all the european system was already founded all that remained was to organize it 
 satisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere i too should have had my congress and my holy alliance those ideas were stolen from me in that reunion of great sovereigns we should have discussed our interests like one family and have rendered account to the peoples as clerk to master 
 europe would in this way soon have been in fact but one people and anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the common fatherland i should have demanded the freedom of all navigable rivers for everybody that the seas should be common to all and that the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards for the sovereigns 
 on returning to france to the bosom of the great strong magnificent peaceful and glorious fatherland i should have proclaimed her frontiers immutable all future wars purely defensive all aggrandizement antinational i should have associated my son in the empire my dictatorship would have been finished and his constitutional reign would have begun 
 paris would have been the capital of the world and the french the envy of the nations 
 my leisure then and my old age would have been devoted in company with the empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son to leisurely visiting with our own horses and like a true country couple every corner of the empire receiving complaints redressing wrongs and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and everywhere 
 napoleon predestined by providence for the gloomy role of executioner of the peoples assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the peoples welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by the employment of power confer benefactions 
 of four hundred thousand who crossed the vistula he wrote further of the russian war half were austrians prussians saxons poles bavarians wurttembergers mecklenburgers spaniards italians and neapolitans the imperial army strictly speaking was one third composed of dutch belgians men from the borders of the rhine piedmontese swiss genevese tuscans romans inhabitants of the military division of bremen of hamburg and so on it included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke french the russian expedition actually cost france less than fifty thousand men the russian army in its retreat from vilna to moscow lost in the various battles four times more men than the french army the burning of moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand russians who died of cold and want in the woods finally in its march from moscow to the oder the russian army also suffered from the severity of the season so that by the the time it reached vilna it numbered only fifty thousand and at kalisch less than eighteen thousand 
 he imagined that the war with russia came about by his will and the horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul he boldly took the whole responsibility for what happened and his darkened mind found justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who perished there were fewer frenchmen than hessians and bavarians

 cracks beneath the foundation 
 at the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of penetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop the beginning of louis reign it was necessary that there should be no equivoque and it became requisite that this book should offer some explanation with regard to this king 
 louis philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority without violence without any direct action on his part by virtue of a revolutionary change evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the revolution but in which he the duc exercised no personal initiative 
 he had been born a prince and he believed himself to have been elected king 
 he had not served this mandate on himself he had not taken it it had been offered to him and he had accepted it convinced wrongly to be sure but convinced nevertheless that the offer was in accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance with duty hence his possession was in good faith 
 now we say it in good conscience louis philippe being in possession in perfect good faith and the democracy being in good faith in its attack the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the king nor on the democracy 
 a clash of principles resembles a clash of elements 
 the ocean defends the water the hurricane defends the air the king defends royalty the democracy defends the people the relative which is the monarchy resists the absolute which is the republic society bleeds in this conflict but that which constitutes its suffering will constitute its safety later on and in any case those who combat are not to be blamed one of the two parties is evidently mistaken the right is not like the colossus of rhodes on two shores at once with one foot on the republic and one in royalty it is indivisible and all on one side but those who are in error are so sincerely a blind man is no more a criminal than a vendean is a ruffian let us then impute to the fatality of things alone these formidable collisions 
 whatever the nature of these tempests may be human irresponsibility is mingled with them 
 let us complete this exposition 
 the government of led a hard life immediately 
 born yesterday it was obliged to fight 
 hardly installed it was already everywhere conscious of vague movements of traction on the apparatus of july so recently laid and so lacking in solidity 
 resistance was born on the morrow perhaps even it was born on the preceding evening 
 from month to month the hostility increased and from being concealed it became patent 
 the revolution of july which gained but little acceptance outside of france by kings had been diversely interpreted in france as we have said 
 god delivers over to men his visible will in events an obscure text written in a mysterious tongue 
 men immediately make translations of it translations hasty incorrect full of errors of gaps and of nonsense 
 very few minds comprehend the divine language the most sagacious the calmest the most profound decipher slowly and when they arrive with their text the task has long been completed there are already twenty translations on the public place from each remaining springs a party and from each misinterpretation a faction and each party thinks that it alone has the true text and each faction thinks that it possesses the light 
 power itself is often a faction 
 there are in revolutions swimmers who go against the current they are the old parties 
 for the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of god think that revolutions having sprung from the right to revolt one has the right to revolt against them 
 error 
 for in these revolutions the one who revolts is not the people it is the king revolution is precisely the contrary of revolt 
 every revolution being a normal outcome contains within itself its legitimacy which false revolutionists sometimes dishonor but which remains even when soiled which survives even when stained with blood 
 revolutions spring not from an accident but from necessity a revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real 
 it is because it must be that it is 
 none the less did the old legitimist parties assail the revolution of with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning errors make excellent projectiles 
 they strike it cleverly in its vulnerable spot in default of a cuirass in its lack of logic they attacked this revolution in its royalty 
 they shouted to it revolution why this king 
 factions are blind men who aim correctly 
 this cry was uttered equally by the republicans 
 but coming from them this cry was logical 
 what was blindness in the legitimists was clearness of vision in the democrats 
 had bankrupted the people the enraged democracy reproached it with this 
 between the attack of the past and the attack of the future the establishment of july struggled 
 it represented the minute at loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries on the other hand with eternal right 
 in addition and beside all this as it was no longer revolution and had become a monarchy was obliged to take precedence of all europe to keep the peace was an increase of complication 
 a harmony established contrary to sense is often more onerous than a war from this secret conflict always muzzled but always growling was born armed peace that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness of the european cabinets is suspicious in itself the royalty of july reared up in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of european cabinets 
 metternich would gladly have put it in pushed on in france by progress it pushed on the monarchies those loiterers in europe 
 after having been towed it undertook to tow 
 meanwhile within her pauperism the proletariat salary education penal servitude prostitution the fate of the woman wealth misery production consumption division exchange coin credit the rights of capital the rights of labor all these questions were multiplied above society a terrible slope 
 outside of political parties properly so called another movement became manifest 
 philosophical fermentation replied to democratic fermentation 
 the elect felt troubled as well as the masses in another manner but quite as much 
 thinkers meditated while the soil that is to say the people traversed by revolutionary currents trembled under them with indescribably vague epileptic shocks 
 these dreamers some isolated others united in families and almost in communion turned over 
 social questions in a pacific but profound manner impassive miners who tranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano hardly disturbed by the dull commotion and the furnaces of which they caught glimpses 
 this tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this agitated epoch 
 these men left to political parties the question of rights they occupied themselves with the question of happiness 
 the of man that was what they wanted to extract from society 
 they raised material questions questions of agriculture of industry of commerce almost to the dignity of a religion 
 in civilization such as it has formed itself a little by the command of god a great deal by the agency of man interests combine unite and amalgamate in a manner to form a veritable hard rock in accordance with a dynamic law patiently studied by economists those geologists of politics these men who grouped themselves under different appellations but who may all be designated by the generic title of socialists endeavored to pierce that rock and to cause it to spout forth the living waters of human felicity 
 from the question of the scaffold to the question of war their works embraced everything 
 to the rights of man as proclaimed by the french revolution they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child 
 the reader will not be surprised if for various reasons we do not here treat in a thorough manner from the theoretical point of view the questions raised by socialism 
 we confine ourselves to indicating them 
 all the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves cosmogonic visions revery and mysticism being cast aside can be reduced to two principal problems 
 first problem 
 to produce wealth 
 second problem 
 to share it 
 the first problem contains the question of work 
 the second contains the question of salary 
 in the first problem the employment of forces is in question 
 in the second the distribution of enjoyment 
 from the proper employment of forces results public power 
 from a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness 
 by a good distribution not an equal but an equitable distribution must be understood 
 from these two things combined the public power without individual happiness within results social prosperity 
 social prosperity means the man happy the citizen free the nation great 
 england solves the first of these two problems 
 she creates wealth admirably she divides it badly 
 this solution which is complete on one side only leads her fatally to two extremes monstrous opulence monstrous wretchedness 
 all enjoyments for some all privations for the rest that is to say for the people privilege exception monopoly feudalism born from toil itself a false and dangerous situation which sates public power or private misery which sets the roots of the state in the sufferings of the individual 
 a badly constituted grandeur in which are combined all the material elements and into which no moral element enters 
 communism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem they are mistaken 
 their division kills production 
 equal partition abolishes emulation and consequently labor 
 it is a partition made by the butcher which kills that which it divides 
 it is therefore impossible to pause over these pretended solutions slaying wealth is not the same thing as dividing it 
 the two problems require to be solved together to be well solved the two problems must be combined and made but one 
 solve only the first of the two problems you will be venice you will be england 
 you will have like venice an artificial power or like england a material power you will be the wicked rich man 
 you will die by an act of violence as venice died or by bankruptcy as england will fall 
 and the world will allow to die and fall all that is merely selfishness all that does not represent for the human race either a virtue or an idea 
 it is well understood here that by the words venice england we designate not the peoples but social structures the oligarchies superposed on nations and not the nations themselves 
 the nations always have our respect and our sympathy 
 venice as a people will live again england the aristocracy will fall but england the nation is immortal 
 that said we continue 
 solve the two problems encourage the wealthy and protect the poor suppress misery put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble by the strong put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy of the man who is making his way against the man who has reached the goal adjust mathematically and fraternally salary to labor mingle gratuitous and compulsory education with the growth of childhood and make of science the base of manliness develop minds while keeping arms busy be at one and the same time a powerful people and a family of happy men render property democratic not by abolishing it but by making it universal so that every citizen without exception may be a proprietor an easier matter than is generally supposed in two words learn how to produce wealth and how to distribute it and you will have at once moral and material greatness and you will be worthy to call yourself france 
 this is what socialism said outside and above a few sects which have gone astray that is what it sought in facts that is what it sketched out in minds 
 efforts worthy of admiration 
 sacred attempts 
 these doctrines these theories these resistances the unforeseen necessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account confused evidences of which we catch a glimpse a new system of politics to be created which shall be in accord with the old world without too much disaccord with the new revolutionary ideal a situation in which it became necessary to use lafayette to defend polignac the intuition of progress transparent beneath the revolt the chambers and streets the competitions to be brought into equilibrium around him his faith in the revolution perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the vague acceptance of a superior definitive right his desire to remain of his race his domestic spirit his sincere respect for the people his own honesty preoccupied louis philippe almost painfully and there were moments when strong and courageous as he was he was overwhelmed by the difficulties of being a king 
 he felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation which was not nevertheless a reduction to dust france being more france than ever 
 piles of shadows covered the horizon 
 a strange shade gradually drawing nearer extended little by little over men over things over ideas a shade which came from wraths and systems everything which had been hastily stifled was moving and fermenting at times the conscience of the honest man resumed its breathing so great was the discomfort of that air in which sophisms were intermingled with truths 
 spirits trembled in the social anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm 
 the electric tension was such that at certain instants the first comer a stranger brought light 
 then the twilight obscurity closed in again at intervals deep and dull mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed as to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud 
 twenty months had barely elapsed since the revolution of july the year had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening 
 the distress of the people the laborers without bread the last prince de conde engulfed in the shadows brussels expelling the nassaus as paris did the bourbons belgium offering herself to a french prince and giving herself to an english prince the russian hatred of nicolas behind us the demons of the south ferdinand in spain miguel in portugal the earth quaking in italy metternich extending his hand over bologna france treating austria sharply at ancona at the north no one knew what sinister sound of the hammer nailing up poland in her coffin irritated glances watching france narrowly all over europe england a suspected ally ready to give a push to that which was tottering and to hurl herself on that which should fall the peerage sheltering itself behind beccaria to refuse four heads to the law the erased from the carriage the cross torn from notre dame lafayette lessened laffitte ruined benjamin constant dead in indigence casimir perier dead in the exhaustion of his power political and social malady breaking out simultaneously in the two capitals of the kingdom the one in the city of thought the other in the city of toil at paris civil war at lyons servile war in the two cities the same glare of the furnace a crimson on the brow of the people the south rendered fanatic the west troubled the duchesse de berry in la vendee plots conspiracies risings cholera added the sombre roar of tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas

 several tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the davydov family and to the crown serfs those fields and meadows where for hundreds of years the peasants of borodino gorki shevardino and semenovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle at the dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space of some three acres around crowds of men of various arms wounded and unwounded with frightened faces dragged themselves back to mozhaysk from the one army and back to valuevo from the other other crowds exhausted and hungry went forward led by their officers others held their ground and continued to fire 
 over the whole field previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun there now spread a mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded on the frightened exhausted and hesitating men as if to say enough men enough cease bethink yourselves what are you doing 
 to the men of both sides alike worn out by want of food and rest it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to slaughter one another all the faces expressed hesitation and the question arose in every soul for what for whom must i kill and be killed you may go and kill whom you please but i want to do so anymore by evening this thought had ripened in every soul at any moment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere 
 but though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of what they were doing though they would have been glad to leave off some incomprehensible mysterious power continued to control them and they still brought up the charges loaded aimed and applied the match though only one artilleryman survived out of every three and though they stumbled and panted with fatigue perspiring and stained with blood and powder the cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides crushing human bodies and that terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but at the will of him who governs men and worlds continued 
 anyone looking at the disorganized rear of the russian army would have said that if only the french made one more slight effort it would disappear and anyone looking at the rear of the french army would have said that the russians need only make one more slight effort and the french would be destroyed but neither the french nor the russians made that effort and the flame of battle burned slowly out 
 the russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking the french at the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way to moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the beginning but even had the aim of the russians been to drive the french from their positions they could not have made this last effort for all the russian troops had been broken up there was no part of the russian army that had not suffered in the battle and though still holding their positions they had lost one half of their army 
 the french with the memory of all their former victories during fifteen years with the assurance of invincibility with the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had lost only a quarter of their men and still had their guards intact twenty thousand strong might easily have made that effort the french had attacked the russian army in order to drive it from its position ought to have made that effort for as long as the russians continued to block the road to moscow as before the aim of the french had not been attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain but the french did not make that effort some historians say that napoleon need only have used his old guards who were intact and the battle would have been won to speak of what would have happened had napoleon sent his guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring it could not be napoleon did not give his guards not because he did not want to but because it could not be done all the generals officers and soldiers of the french army knew it could not be done because the flagging spirit of the troops would not permitit 
 it was not napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling of the mighty arm being stricken powerless but all the generals and soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not after all their experience of previous battles when after one tenth of such efforts the enemy had fled experienced a similar feeling of terror before an enemy who after losing half his men stood as threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle the moral force of the attacking french army was exhausted not that sort of victory which is defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks called standards and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were standing but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the russians at borodino the french invaders like an infuriated animal that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound felt that they were perishing but could not stop any more than the russian army weaker by one half could help swerving by impetus gained the french army was still able to roll forward to moscow but there without further effort on the part of the russians it had to perish bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at borodino the direct consequence of the battle of borodino was senseless flight from moscow his retreat along the old smolensk road the destruction of the invading army of five hundred thousand men and the downfall of napoleonic france on which at borodino for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit had been laid

 of cunning 
 we take cunning for a sinister or crooked wisdom and certainly there is great difference between a cunning man and a wise man not only in point of honesty but in point of ability there be that can pack the cards and yet cannot play well so there are some that are good in canvasses and factions that are otherwise weak men 
 again it is one thing to understand persons and another thing to understand matters for many are perfect in humours that are not greatly capable of the real part of business which is the constitution of one that hath studied men more than books such men are fitter for practice than for counsel and they are good 
 but in their own alley turn them to new men and they have lost their aim so as the old rule to know a fool from a wise man nutte ambos nudos ad ignotos et videbis doth scarce hold for them and because these cunning men are like haberdashers of small wares it is 
 not amiss to set forth their shop 
 
 it is a point of cunning to wait upon him with whom you speak with your eye as the jesuits give it in precept for there be many wise men that have secret hearts and transparent countenances yet this would be done with a demure abasing of your eye sometimes as the jesuits also do use 
 
 another is that when you have anything to obtain of present dispatch you entertain and amuse the party with whom you deal with some other discourse that he be not too much awake to make objections i knew a counsellor and secretary that never came to queen elizabeth of england with bills to sign but he would always first put her into some discourse of estate that she mought the less mind the bills 
 
 the like surprise may be made by moving things when the party is in haste and cannot stay to consider advisedly of that is moved 
 
 if a man would cross a business that he doubts some other would handsomely and effectually move let him pretend to wish it well and move it himself in such sort as may foil it 
 
 the breaking off in the midst of that one was about to say as if he took himself up breeds a greater appetite in him with whom you confer to know more 
 
 and because it works better when anything seemeth to be gotten from you by question than if you offer it of yourself you may lay a bait for a question by showing another visage and countenance than you are wont to the end to give occasion for the party 
 to ask what the matter is of the change as nehemias did and i had not before that time been sad before the king 
 
 in things that arc tender and unpleasing it is good to break the ice by some whose words are of less weight and to reserve the more weighty voice to come in as by chance so that he may be asked the question upon the speech 
 as narcissus did in relating to claudius the marriage of messalina and silius in things that a man would not be seen in himself it is a point of cunning to borrow the name of the world as to say the world says or there is a speech abroad 
 
 i knew one that when he wrote a letter he would put that which was most material in the as if it had been a 
 i knew another that when he came to have speech he would pass over that that he intended most and go forth and come back again and speak of it as of a thing that he had almost forgot 
 
 some procure themselves to be surprised at such times as it is like the party that they work upon will suddenly come upon them and to be found with a letter in their hand or doing somewhat which they are not accustomed to the end they may be apposed of those things which of themselves they are desirous to utter it is a point of cunning to let fall those words in a own name which he would have another man learn and use and thereupon take advantage i knew two that were competitors for the place in queen time and yet kept good quarter between themselves and would confer one with another upon the business 
 and the one of them said that to be a secretary in the declination of a monarchy was a ticklish thing and that he did not affect it the other straight caught up those words and discoursed with divers of his friends that he had no reason to desire to be secretary in the declination of a monarchy the first man took hold of it and found means it was told the queen who hearing of a declination of a monarchy took it so ill as she would never after hear of the suit 
 
 there is a cunning which we in england call the turning of the cat in the pan which is when that which a man says to another he lays it as if another had said it to him and to say truth it is not easy when such a matter passed between two to make it appear from which of them it first moved and began 
 it is a way that some men have to glance and dart at others by justifying themselves by negatives as to say this do not as tigellinus did towards burrus se non diversas spes sed incolumitatem imperatoris simplidter spectare 
 some have in readiness so many tales and stories as there is nothing they would insinuate but they can wrap it into a tale which serveth both to keep themselves more in guard and to make others carry it with more pleasure 
 it is a good point of cunning for a man to shape the answer he would have in his own words and propositions for it makes the other party stick the less 
 
 it is strange how long some men will lie in wait to speak somewhat they desire to say and how far about they will fetch and how many other matters they will beat over to come near it it is a thing of great patience but yet of much use 
 
 a sudden bold and unexpected question doth many times surprise a man and lay him open like to him that having changed his name and walking in another suddenly came behind him and called him by his true name whereat straightways he looked back 
 
 but these small wares and petty points of cunning are infinite and it were a good deed to make a list of them for that nothing doth more hurt in a state than that cunning men pass for wise 
 
 but certainly some there are that know the resorts and falls of business that cannot sink into the main of it like a house that hath convenient stairs and entries but never a fair room therefore you shall see them find out pretty looses in the conclusion but are no ways able to examine or debate matters 
 and yet commonly they take advantage of their inability and would be thought wits of direction some build rather upon the abusing of others and as we now say putting tricks upon them than 
 upon soundness of their own proceedings but solomon saith prudens advertit ad gressus suos 
 stultus divertit ad dolos

 the interior of despair 
 let us try to say it 
 it is necessary that society should look at these things because it is itself which creates them 
 he was as we have said an ignorant man but he was not a fool the light of nature was ignited in him 
 unhappiness which also possesses a clearness of vision of its own augmented the small amount of daylight which existed in this mind 
 beneath the cudgel beneath the chain in the cell in hardship beneath the burning sun of the galleys upon the plank bed of the convict he withdrew into his own consciousness and meditated 
 he constituted himself the tribunal 
 he began by putting himself on trial 
 he recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished he admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy act that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to him had he asked for it that in any case it would have been better to wait until he could get it through compassion or through work that it is not an unanswerable argument to say can one wait when one is hungry 
 that in the first place it is very rare for any one to die of hunger literally and next that fortunately or unfortunately man is so constituted that he can suffer long and much both morally and physically without dying that it is therefore necessary to have patience that that would even have been better for those poor little children that it had been an act of madness for him a miserable unfortunate wretch to take society at large violently by the collar and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft that that is in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through which infamy enters in short that he was in the wrong 
 then he asked himself 
 whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history whether it was not a serious thing that he a laborer out of work that he an industrious man should have lacked bread 
 and whether the fault once committed and confessed the chastisement had not been ferocious and disproportioned 
 whether there had not been more abuse on the part of the law in respect to the penalty than there had been on the part of the culprit in respect to his fault 
 whether there had not been an excess of weights in one balance of the scale in the one which contains expiation 
 whether the of the penalty was not equivalent to the annihilation of the crime and did not result in reversing the situation of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the repression of converting the guilty man into the victim and the debtor into the creditor and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who had violated it 
 whether this penalty complicated by successive aggravations for attempts at escape had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler a crime of society against the individual a crime which was being committed afresh every day a crime which had lasted nineteen years 
 he asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack of foresight and in the other case for its pitiless foresight and to seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess a default of work and an excess of punishment 
 whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods made by chance and consequently the most deserving of consideration 
 these questions put and answered he judged society and condemned it 
 he condemned it to his hatred 
 he made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering and he said to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call it to account 
 he declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not in truth unjust but that it most assuredly was iniquitous 
 anger may be both foolish and absurd one can be irritated wrongfully one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on side at bottom 
 jean valjean felt himself exasperated 
 and besides human society had done him nothing but harm he had never seen anything of it save that angry face which it calls justice and which it shows to those whom it strikes 
 men had only touched him to bruise him 
 every contact with them had been a blow never since his infancy since the days of his mother of his sister had he ever encountered a friendly word and a kindly glance from suffering to suffering he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a war and that in this war he was the conquered he had no other weapon than his hate 
 he resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear it away with him when he departed 
 there was at toulon a school for the convicts kept by the ignorantin friars where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the unfortunate men who had a mind for them 
 he was of the number who had a mind 
 he went to school at the age of forty and learned to read to write to cipher 
 he felt that to fortify his intelligence was to fortify his hate 
 in certain cases education and enlightenment can serve to eke out evil 
 this is a sad thing to say after having judged society which had caused his unhappiness he judged providence which had made society and he condemned it also 
 thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery this soul mounted and at the same time fell 
 light entered it on one side and darkness on the other 
 jean valjean had not as we have seen an evil nature 
 he was still good when he arrived at the galleys 
 he there condemned society and felt that he was becoming wicked he there condemned providence and was conscious that he was becoming impious 
 it is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point 
 does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom can the man created good by god be rendered wicked by man can the soul be completely made over by fate and become evil fate being evil 
 can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault 
 is there not in every human soul was there not in the soul of jean valjean in particular a first spark a divine element incorruptible in this world immortal in the other which good can develop fan ignite and make to glow with splendor and which evil can never wholly extinguish 
 grave and obscure questions to the last of which every physiologist would probably have responded no and that without hesitation had he beheld at toulon during the hours of repose which were for jean valjean hours of revery this gloomy seated with folded arms upon the bar of some capstan with the end of his chain thrust into his pocket to prevent its dragging serious silent and thoughtful a pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath condemned by civilization and regarding heaven with severity 
 we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact the observing physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery he would perchance have pitied this sick man of the making but he would not have even essayed any treatment he would have turned aside his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse within this soul and like dante at the portals of hell he would have effaced from this existence the word which the finger of god has nevertheless inscribed upon the brow of every 
 was this state of his soul which we have attempted to analyze as perfectly clear to jean valjean as we have tried to render it for those who read us 
 did jean valjean distinctly perceive after their formation and had he seen distinctly during the process of their formation all the elements of which his moral misery was composed 
 had this rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of the succession of ideas through which he had by degrees mounted and descended to the lugubrious aspects which had for so many years formed the inner horizon of his spirit was he conscious of all that passed within him and of all that was working there 
 that is something which we do not presume to state it is something which we do not even believe 
 there was too much ignorance in jean valjean even after his misfortune to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there 
 at times he did not rightly know himself what he felt 
 jean valjean was in the shadows he suffered in the shadows he hated in the shadows one might have said that he hated in advance of himself 
 he dwelt habitually in this shadow feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer 
 only at intervals there suddenly came to him from without and from within an access of wrath a surcharge of suffering a livid and rapid flash which illuminated his whole soul and caused to appear abruptly all around him in front behind amid the gleams of a frightful light the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny 
 the flash passed the night closed in again and where was he he no longer knew 
 the peculiarity of pains of this nature in which that which is is to say that which is is to transform a man little by little by a sort of stupid transfiguration into a wild beast sometimes into a ferocious beast 
 jean successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone suffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul 
 jean valjean would have renewed these attempts utterly useless and foolish as they were as often as the opportunity had presented itself without reflecting for an instant on the result nor on the experiences which he had already gone through he escaped impetuously like the wolf who finds his cage open instinct said to him flee 
 reason would have said remain but in the presence of so violent a temptation reason vanished nothing remained but instinct 
 the beast alone acted 
 when he was recaptured the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to render him still more wild 
 one detail which we must not omit is that he possessed a physical strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the galleys 
 at work at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan jean valjean was worth four men 
 he sometimes lifted and sustained enormous weights on his back and when the occasion demanded it he replaced that implement which is called a and was formerly called orgueil pride whence we may remark in passing is derived the name of the rue montorgueil near the halles fishmarket in paris 
 his comrades had nicknamed him jean the once when they were repairing the balcony of the at toulon one of those admirable caryatids of puget which support the balcony became loosened and was on the point of falling 
 jean valjean who was present supported the caryatid with his shoulder and gave the workmen time to arrive 
 his suppleness even exceeded his strength 
 certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined 
 it is the science of muscles an entire system of mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners men who are forever envious of the flies and birds to climb a vertical surface and to find points of support where hardly a projection was visible was play to jean valjean an angle of the wall being given with the tension of his back and legs with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of the stone he raised himself as if by magic to the third story he sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison 
 he spoke but little 
 he laughed not at all 
 an excessive emotion was required to wring from him once or twice a year that lugubrious laugh of the convict which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon to all appearance he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of something terrible 
 he was absorbed in fact 
 athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed intelligence he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was resting on him 
 in that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance he perceived with terror mingled with rage a sort of frightful accumulation of things 
 collecting and mounting above him beyond the range of his vision laws prejudices men and outlines escaped him whose mass terrified him and which was nothing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization 
 he distinguished here and there in that swarming and formless mass now near him now afar off and on inaccessible some group some detail vividly illuminated here the and his cudgel there the gendarme and his sword yonder the mitred archbishop away at the top like a sort of sun the emperor crowned and dazzling it seemed to him that these distant splendors far from dissipating his night rendered it more funereal and more black 
 all this laws prejudices deeds men and came above him over his head in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which god imparts to civilization walking over him and crushing him with i know not what peacefulness in its cruelty and inexorability in its indifference 
 souls which have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks the reproved of the law feel the whole weight of this human society so formidable for him who is without so frightful for him who is beneath resting upon their heads 
 in this situation jean valjean meditated and what could be the nature of his meditation 
 if the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts it would doubtless think that same thing which jean valjean thought 
 all these things realities full of spectres phantasmagories full of realities had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which is almost indescribable 
 at times amid his convict toil he paused 
 he fell to thinking his reason at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore rose in revolt 
 everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible 
 he said to himself it is a dream he gazed at the standing a few paces from him the seemed a phantom to him 
 all of a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel 
 visible nature hardly existed for him 
 it would almost be true to say that there existed for jean valjean neither sun nor fine summer days nor radiant sky nor fresh april dawns i know not what daylight habitually illumined his soul 
 to sum up in conclusion that which can be summed up and translated into positive results in all that we have just pointed out we will confine ourselves to the statement that in the course of nineteen years jean valjean the inoffensive of faverolles the formidable convict of toulon had become capable thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him of two sorts of evil action 
 firstly of evil action which was rapid unpremeditated dashing entirely instinctive in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone secondly of evil action which was serious grave consciously argued out and premeditated with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish 
 his deliberate deeds passed through three successive phases which natures of a certain stamp can alone will perseverance he had for moving causes his habitual wrath bitterness of soul a profound sense of indignities suffered the reaction even against the good the innocent and the just if there are any such the point of departure like the point of arrival for all his thoughts was hatred of human law that hatred which if it be not arrested in its development by some providential incident becomes within a given time the hatred of society then the hatred of the human race then the hatred of creation and which manifests itself by a vague incessant and brutal desire to do harm to some living being no matter whom 
 it will be perceived that it was not without reason that jean passport described him as a very dangerous man 
 from year to year this soul had dried away slowly but with fatal sureness 
 when the heart is dry the eye is dry 
 on his departure from the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear

 the empire strikes back 
 viii 
 
 darth vader looked like a great silent god as he stood on the main control deck of hismammoth star destroyer 
 he was staring through the large rectangular window above the deck at theraging field of asteroids that was pelting his ship as it glided through of rocks streaked past the windows some collided with one another andexploded in brilliant displays of vivid light 
 as vader watched one of his smaller ships disintegrated under the impact of anenormous asteroid seemingly unmoved he turned to look at a series of twentyholographic images these twenty holograms in three dimensions thefeatures of twenty imperial battleship commanders the image of commanderwhose ship had just been obliterated was fading rapidly almost as quickly as theglowing particles of his exploded ship were being flung to oblivion 
 admiral piett and an aide quietly moved to stand behind their as he turned to an image in the center of the twenty holograms which wascontinually interrupted by static and faded in and out as captain needa of the stardestroyer avenger made his report his first words had already been drowned bystatic 
 which was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes captain needacontinued considering the amount of damage sustained they also must havebeen destroyed 
 vader disagreed he knew of the millennium power and was quitefamiliar with the skills of her cocky pilot no captain he snarled alive i want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until 
 as soon as vader had given his command captain image and those ofthe other nineteen captains faded completely when the last hologram vanished thedark lord having sensed the two men standing behind him turned now what isso important it wait admiral he asked imperiously speak up 
 the face turned pale with fear his trembling voice shaking almost asmuch as his body it wasthe emperor 
 the emperor the voice behind the black breath mask repeated 
 yes the admiral replied he commands you make contact with him 
 move this ship out of the asteroid field vader ordered into a position wherewe can send a clear transmission 
 yes my lord 
 and cod the signal to my private chamber 
 the millennium falcon had come to rest hidden in the small cave which waspitch black and dripping with moisture the crew turned down its enginesuntil no sound at all was emitted from the small craft 
 inside the cockpit han solo and his shaggy copilot were just completingshutting down the electronic systems as they did so all the service lightsdimmed and the interior of the ship became nearly as dark as its sheltering cave 
 han glanced over at leia and flashed her a quick grin getting kind ofromantic in here 
 chewbacca growled there was work to be done in here and the wookieeneeded undivided attention if they were going to repair the malfunctioninghyperdrive 
 irritated han returned to his work what are you so grouchy about the wookiee could respond the protocol droid timidly approached han andposed a question of burning importance sir afraid to ask but does shuttingdown all except emergency power systems include me 
 chewbacca expressed his opinion with a resounding bark of affirmation but handisagreed no he said going to need you to talk to the old falcon hereand find out what happened to our hyperdrive he looked over at the princess andadded how are you with a macrofuser your holiness 
 before leia could get off a suitable retort the millennium falcon lurchedforward as a sudden impact struck its hull everything that was not bolted downflew through the cockpit even the giant wookiee howling boisterously had tostruggle to stay in his chair 
 hang on han yelled watch out 
 clattered against a wall then collected himself sir verypossible this asteroid is not stable 
 han glared at him glad here to tell us these things 
 the ship rocked once more even more violently than before 
 the wookiee howled again threepio stumbled backward and leia was hurledacross the cabin directly into the waiting arms of captain solo 
 the rocking stopped as suddenly as it had started but leia still stood embrace for once she did not draw away and he could almost swear she waswillingly embracing him why princess he said pleasantly surprised this is sosudden 
 at that she began to pull back let go she insisted trying to move out of hisarms getting angry 
 he saw the old familiar expression of arrogance beginning to return to her look angry he lied 
 how do i look 
 beautiful he answered truthfully with an emotion that surprised him 
 leia felt suddenly unexpectedly shy her cheeks flushed pink and when sherealized she was blushing she averted her eyes but she still did not really try to getfree 
 han somehow let the tender moment last and excited he had toadd 
 leia became infuriated once again the angry princess and haughty quickly moved away from him and drew herself up to her most regal captain she said her cheeks now reddened in anger being held by you to get me excited 
 well i hope you expect more he grunted angrier at himself than at herstinging words 
 i expect anything leia said indignantly except to be left alone 
 if just get out of my way leave you alone 
 embarrassed to realize that she was indeed still standing rather close leiastepped aside and made an effort to change the subject you think timewe got to work on your ship 
 han frowned fine with me he said coldly not looking at her 
 leia quickly turned on her heel and left the cockpit 
 for a moment han stood there quietly just gathering his he looked at the now quiet wookiee and droid both of whom hadwitnessed the entire incident 
 come on chewie tear into this flying short circuit he said quickly to endthe awkward moment 
 the copilot barked in agreement then joined his captain as they began to leavethe cockpit as they walked out han looked back at threepio who was stillstanding in the dim chamber looking dumbfounded you too goldenrod 
 i must admit the robot muttered to himself as he began to shuffle out of thecockpit there are times i understand human behavior 
 the lights of luke fighter pierced the darkness of the bogplanet the ship had sunk deeper into the scummy waters but there was still enoughof it above the surface to let luke carry needed supplies from the storagecompartments he knew it could not be much longer before his ship all the the water he thought that his chance ofsurvival might be increased if he gathered as many supplies as he could 
 it was now so dark that luke could scarcely see in front of him out in thedense jungle he heard a sharp snapping noise and felt a chill run through his pistol he prepared to blast any thing that leaped from the jungle toattack him but nothing did and he clipped his weapon back onto its holster andcontinued to unpack his gear 
 you ready for some power luke asked artoo who was patiently waiting forhis own form of nourishment luke took a small fusion furnace from an equipmentbox and ignited it welcoming even the tiny glow thrown off by the small heatingdevice then took a power cable and attached it to artoo through a protuberance thatroughly resembled a nose as power radiated through electronic innards thestout robot whistled his appreciation 
 luke sat down and opened a container of processed food as he began to talked to the robot now all i have to do is find this yoda if he even exists 
 he looked around nervously at the shadows in the jungle and felt and increasingly in doubt about his quest this certainly seems like astrange place to find a jedi master he said to the little robot gives me thecreeps 
 from the sound of his beep it was clear artoo shared opinion of theswamp world 
 although luke continued as he reluctantly tasted more of the food familiar about this place i feel like 
 you feel like what 
 that voice luke leaped up grabbed his pistol then spun into the gloom to try to find the source of those words 
 as he turned he saw a tiny creature standing directly in front of him lukeimmediately stepped back in surprise this little being seemed to have materialized outof nowhere it stood no more than half a meter in height fearlessly holding itsground in front of the towering youth who wielded an awesome laser pistol 
 the little wizened thing could have been any age its face was deeply lined butwas framed with elfin pointed ears that gave it a look of eternal youth long whitehair was parted down the middle and hung down on either side of the the being was bipedal and stood on short legs that terminated in reptilian feet it wore rags as gray as the mists of the swamp and in suchtatters that they must have approximated the very age 
 for the moment luke could not decide whether to be frightened or to when he gazed into those bulbous eyes and sensed the kindly nature herelaxed at last the creature motioned toward the pistol in hand 
 away put your weapon i mean you no harm it said 
 after some hesitation luke quietly put his pistol back into his belt as he didso he wondered why he felt impelled to obey this little creature 
 i am wondering the creature spoke again why are you here 
 looking for someone luke answered 
 looking looking the creature repeated curiously with a wide smilebeginning to crease his face found someone say 
 luke had to force himself not to smile yeah 
 help you i canyesyes 
 inexplicably luke found himself trusting the odd creature but at all surethat such a tiny individual could be of help on his important quest i thinkso he replied gently you see looking for a great warrior 
 a great warrior the creature shook his head the whitish hair floppingabout his pointed ears wars make one great 
 a strange phrase luke thought but before he could answer luke saw the tinyhominid hobble over to the top of the salvaged supply cases shocked he watchedas the creature began to rummage through the articles luke had brought with himfrom hoth 
 get away from there he said surprised at this sudden strange behavior 
 moving across the ground artoo waddled toward the pile of cases standing justabout at optical sensor level with the creature the droid squealed his disapproval ashe scanned the creature that was carelessly digging through the supplies 
 the strange being grabbed the container holding the remains of food andtook a bite 
 hey my dinner luke exclaimed 
 but no sooner had the creature taken his first bite than he spat out what he hadtasted his deeply lined face wrinkling like a prune peewh he said you no how get you so big eating food of this kind he looked luke upand down 
 before the astounded youth could reply the creature flipped the food container direction then dipped one of his small and delicate hands into another supplycase 
 listen friend luke said watching this bizarre scavenger we mean toland here and if i could get my fighter out of this puddle i would but i 
 get your ship out have you tried have you tried the creaturegoaded 
 luke had to admit to himself that he had not but then the whole idea waspatently ludicrous he have the proper equipment to 
 something in case had attracted the interest luke finallyreached the end of his patience when he saw the crazy little being snatch somethingout of the supply case knowing that survival depended on those supplies hegrabbed for the case but the creature held on to his miniature power lampthat he gripped tightly in his hand the little light came alive in hand throwing its radiance up into his delighted face and he immediatelybegan to examine his treasure 
 give me that luke cried 
 the creature retreated from the approaching youth like a petulant child or help you not 
 still clutching the lamp to his breast the creature stepped bumping into not remembering that the robot was at allanimate the being stood next to it as luke approached 
 i want your help luke said indignantly i want my lamp back it in this slimy mudhole 
 luke instantly realized he had issued an insult 
 mudhole slimy my home this is 
 as they argued artoo slowly reached out a mechanical arm suddenly hisappendage grabbed the pilfered lamp and immediately the two little figures wereengaged in a over the stolen prize as they spun about in battle artoobeeped a few electronic give me 
 mine mine give it back the creature cried abruptly though he seemedto give up the bizarre struggle and lightly poked the droid with one bluish finger 
 artoo emitted a loud startled squeal and immediately released the power lamp 
 the victor grinned at the glowing object in his tiny hands gleefully mine 
 luke was about fed up with these antics and advised the robot that the battle wasover okay artoo he said with a sigh let him have it now get out of fellow got things to do 
 no no the creature pleaded excitedly stay and help you find yourfriend 
 not looking for a friend luke said looking for a jedi master 
 oh the eyes widened as he spoke a jedi master differentaltogether yoda you seek yoda 
 mention of that name surprised luke but he felt skeptical how could an elflike this know anything about a great teacher of the jedi knights you know him 
 of course yes the creature said proudly take you to him but first wemust eat good food come come 
 with that the creature scurried out of camp and into the shadows of theswamp the tiny power lamp he carried was gradually dimming in the distance asluke stood feeling baffled at first he had no intention of pursuing the creature butall at once he found himself diving into the fog after him 
 as luke started off into the jungle he heard artoo whistling and beeping as if hewould blow his circuits luke turned around to see the little droid standing forlornlynext to the miniature fission furnace 
 better stay here and watch over the camp luke instructed the robot 
 but artoo only intensified his noisy output running through the entire gamut ofhis electronic articulations 
 artoo now settle down luke called as he ran into the jungle i can takecare of myself be safe okay 
 electronic grumbling grew fainter as luke hurried to catch up with thelittle guide i must really be out of my mind luke thought following this weirdbeing into but the creature had mentioned name andluke felt compelled to accept any help he could get to find the jedi master hestumbled in the dark over thick weeds and twisting roots as he pursued the flickeringlight ahead 
 the creature was chattering gaily as he led the way through the safeyes of course then in his odd little way thismysterious being started to laugh 
 two imperial cruisers slowly moved across the surface of the giant millennium falcon had to be hidden somewhere where 
 as the ships skimmed the surface of the asteroid they dropped bombs on itspockmarked terrain trying to scare out the freighter the shock waves from theexplosives violently shook the spheroid but there was no sign of the falcon as itdrifted above the asteroid one of the imperial star destroyers cast an eclipsingshadow across the tunnel entrance yet the scanners failed to not the curioushole in the bowllike wall within that hole in a winding tunnel not detected by theminions of the powerful empire sat the freighter it rattled and vibrated with everyexplosion that pounded the surface above 
 inside chewbacca worked feverishly to repair the complex powertrain he hadscrambled into an overhead compartment to get at the wires that operated thehyperdrive system but when he felt the first of the explosions he popped his headout through the mass of wires and gave out a worried yelp 
 princess leia who was welding a damaged valve stopped her work and lookedup the bombs sounded very close 
 glanced up at leia and nervously tilted his head oh my hesaid found us 
 everyone became quiet as if fearing that the sound of their voices mightsomehow carry and betray their exact position again the ship was shaken by a intense than the last 
 moving away leia said 
 han saw through their tactic just trying to see if they can stir upsomething he told her safe if we stay put 
 where have i heard that line before leia said with an innocent air 
 ignoring her sarcasm han moved past her as he went back to work thepassageway in the hold was so narrow that he avoid brushing against her ashe passed could he 
 with mixed emotions the princess watched him for a moment as he continued towork on his ship and then she turned back to her welding 
 ignored all this odd human behavior he was too busy trying tocommunicate with the falcon trying to find out what was wrong with its at the central control panel threepio was making uncharacteristic whistleand beep sounds a moment later the control panel whistled back 
 where is artoo when i need him sighed the golden robot the response had been difficult for him to interpret i know where yourship learned to communicate threepio announced to han but its dialect leavessomething to be desired i believe sir it says the power coupling on the negativeaxis has been polarized afraid have to replace it 
 of course have to replace it han snapped then called up to was peering from the ceiling compartment replace it he whispered 
 he noticed that leia had finished her welding but was having trouble reengagingthe valve struggling with a lever that simply would not budge he moved towardher and began offering to help but she coldly turned her back to him and continuedher battle with the valve 
 easy your worship he said only trying to help 
 still struggling with the lever leia asked quietly would you please stop callingme that 
 han was surprised at the simple tone he had expected a stingingretort or at best a cold silence but her words were missing the mocking tone thathe was accustomed to hearing was she finally bringing their relentless battle ofwills to an end sure he said gently 
 you make things difficult sometimes leia said as she shyly glanced at him 
 he had to agree i do i really do but he added you could be a little come on admit it sometimes you think all right 
 she let go of the lever and rubbed her sore hand sometimes she said with alittle smile maybeoccasionally when you acting the scoundrel 
 scoundrel he laughed finding her choice of words endearing i like thesound of that 
 without another word he reached for hand and began to massage it 
 stop it leia protested 
 han continued to hold her hand stop what he asked softly 
 leia felt flustered confused hundred things in that her sense of dignity prevailed stop that she said regally my hands aredirty 
 han smiled at her feeble excuse but held on to her hand and looked right intoher eyes my hands are dirty too what are you afraid of 
 afraid she returned his direct gaze of getting my hand dirty 
 why trembling he asked he could see that she was affectedby his closeness and by his touch and her expression softened whereupon hereached out and took her other hand 
 i think you like me because a scoundrel he said i think you enough scoundrels in your life as he spoke he slowly drew her near 
 leia resist his gentle pull now as she looked at him she thought he hadnever seemed more handsome but she was still the princess i happen to like nicemen she chided in a whisper 
 and not nice han asked teasing 
 chewbacca stuck his head out from the overhead compartment and watched theproceedings unnoticed 
 yes she whispered but you 
 before she could finish han solo drew her to him and felt her body tremble ashe pressed his lips to hers it seemed forever it seemed an eternity to share betweenthem as he gently bent her body back this time she resist at all 
 when they parted luke needed a moment to catch her breath she tried toregain her composure and work up a measure of indignation but she found it difficultto talk 
 okay hot shot she began i 
 but then she stopped and suddenly found herself kissing him pulling him evencloser than before 
 when their lips finally parted han held leia in his arms as they looked at eachother for a long moment there was a peaceful kind of emotion between leia began to draw away her thoughts and feelings a turmoil she averted hereyes and began to disengage herself from embrace in the next second sheturned and rushed from the cabin 
 han silently looked after her as she left the room he then became acutelyaware of the very curious wookiee whose head was poking from the ceiling 
 okay chewie he bellowed give me a hand with this valve 
 the fog dispersed by a torrent of rain snaked around the swamp in diaphanousswirls scooting along amid the pounding rain was a single r droid looking for hismaster 
 sensing devices were busily sending impulses to his electronicnerve ends at the slightest sound his auditory systems sent information to the nervous computer brain 
 it was too wet for artoo in this murky jungle he aimed his optical sensors inthe direction of a strange little mud house on the edge of a dark lake the by an perception of loneliness moved closer to the windowof the tiny abode artoo extended his utility feet toward the window and peekedinside he hoped no one inside noticed the slight shiver of his form orheard his nervous little electronic whimper 
 somehow luke skywalker managed to squeeze inside the miniature everything within was perfectly scaled to its tiny resident luke on the dried mud floor in the living room careful not to bang his skullagainst the low ceiling there was a table in front of him and he could see a fewcontainers holding what appeared to be scrolls 
 the creature was in his kitchen next to the living room busilyconcocting an incredible meal from where luke sat he could see the little cookstirring steaming pots chopping this shredding that scattering herbs over all andscurrying back and forth to put platters on the table in front of the youth 
 fascinated as he was by this bustling activity luke was growing very the creature made one of his frantic runs into the living room area luke remindedhis host i told you not hungry 
 patience the creature said as he scuttled back into the steamy time to eat 
 luke tried to be polite look he said it smells good sure but i know why we see yoda now 
 the time to eat too the creature answered 
 but luke was eager to be on his way will it take long to get there how faris he 
 not far not far be patient soon you will see him why wish you becomea jedi 
 because of my father i guess luke answered as he reflected that he neverreally knew his father that well in truth his deepest kinship with his father wasthrough the lightsaber ben had entrusted to him 
 luke noticed the curious look in the eyes as he mentioned his your father the being said sitting down to begin his vast meal a powerfuljedi was he powerful jedi 
 the youth wondered if the creature were mocking him how could you knowmy father he asked a little angrily you even know who i am heglanced around at the bizarre room and shook his head i know what here 
 then he noticed that the creature had turned away from him and was talking to acorner of the room this really is the final straw luke thought now thisimpossible creature is talking to thin air 
 no good is this the creature was saying irritably this will not do icannot teach him the boy has no patience 
 head spun in the direction the creature was facing cannot teach nopatience bewildered he still saw no one there then the truth of the situationgradually became as plain to him as the deep lines on the little he was being by none other than yoda himself 
 from the empty corner of the room luke heard the gentle wise voice of benkenobi responding to yoda he will learn patience ben said 
 much anger in him the dwarfish jedi teacher persisted like in his father 
 discussed this before kenobi said 
 luke could no longer wait i can be a jedi he interrupted it meant morethan anything else to him to become a part of the noble band that had championed thecauses of justice and peace ready benben the youth called to hisinvisible mentor looking about the room in hopes of finding him but all he sawwas yoda sitting across from him at the table 
 ready are you the skeptical yoda asked what know you of ready ihave trained jedi for eight hundred years my own counsel keep on who is to betrained 
 why not me luke asked insulted by insinuation 
 to become a jedi yoda said gravely takes the deepest commitment the mostserious mind 
 he can do it voice said in defense of the youth 
 looking toward the invisible kenobi yoda pointed at luke this one i havewatched a long time all his life has he looked awayto the horizon to the sky tothe future never his mind on where he was on what he was doing yoda shot a glaring look at luke a jedi craves not these things 
 luke tried to defend his past i have followed my feelings 
 you are reckless the jedi master shouted 
 he will learn came the soothing voice of kenobi 
 too old yoda argued yes too old too set in his ways to start thetraining 
 luke thought he heard a subtle softening in voice perhaps there wasstill a chance to sway him learned much luke said he give upnow he had come too far endured too much lost too much for that 
 yoda seemed to look right through luke as he spoke those words as if trying todetermine how much he had learned he turned to the invisible kenobi he finish what he begins yoda asked 
 come this far was the answer he is our only hope 
 i will not fail you luke said to both yoda and ben not afraid at that moment the young skywalker felt he could face anything without fear 
 but yoda was not so optimistic you will be my young one he jedi master turned slowly to face luke as a strange little smile appeared on hisblue face heh you will be

 while these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess room a carriage containing pierre who had been sent for and anna mikhaylovna who found it necessary to accompany him was driving into the court of count house as the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows anna mikhaylovna having turned with words of comfort to her companion realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up rousing himself pierre followed anna mikhaylovna out of the carriage and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him he noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door while he was getting down from the carriage steps two men who looked like tradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall pausing for a moment pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides but neither anna mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman who could not help seeing these people took any notice of them it seems to be all right pierre concluded and followed anna mikhaylovna she hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase calling to pierre who was lagging behind to follow though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all still less why he had to go by the back stairs yet judging by anna air of assurance and haste pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who carrying pails came running downstairs their boots clattering these men pressed close to the wall to let pierre and anna mikhaylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there 
 is this the way to the princesses apartments asked anna mikhaylovna of one of them 
 yes replied a footman in a bold loud voice as if anything were now permissible the door to the left 
 perhaps the count did not ask for me said pierre when he reached the landing better go to my own room 
 anna mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come up 
 ah my friend she said touching his arm as she had done her when speaking to him that afternoon believe me i suffer no less than you do but be a man 
 but really i better go away he asked looking kindly at her over his spectacles 
 ah my dear friend forget the wrongs that may have been done you think that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death she sighed i have loved you like a son from the first trust yourself to me pierre i shall not forget your interests 
 pierre did not understand a word but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger and he meekly followed anna mikhaylovna who was already opening a door 
 this door led into a back anteroom an old man a servant of the princesses sat in a corner knitting a stocking pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms anna mikhaylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet asked about the princess health and then led pierre along a stone passage the first door on the left led into the princesses apartments the maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door everything in the house was done in haste at that time and pierre and anna mikhaylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room where prince vasili and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking seeing them pass prince vasili drew back with obvious impatience while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might 
 this action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on prince face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide anna mikhaylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly and sighed as if to say that this was no more than she had expected 
 be a man my friend i will look after your interests said she in reply to his look and went still faster along the passage 
 pierre could not make out what it was all about and still less what watching over his interests meant but he decided that all these things had to be from the passage they went into a large dimly lit room adjoining the reception room it was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to pierre only from the front approach but even in this room there now stood an empty bath and water had been spilled on the carpet they were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them they went into the reception room familiar to pierre with two italian windows opening into the conservatory with its large bust and full length portrait of catherine the great the same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before whispering to one another all became silent and turned to look at the pale anna mikhaylovna as she entered and at the big stout figure of pierre who hanging his head meekly followed her 
 anna face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived with the air of a practical petersburg lady she now keeping pierre close beside her entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon she felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see her own admission was assured casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the confessor there she glided up to him with a sort of amble not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priest 
 god be thanked that you are in time said she to one of the priests all we relatives have been in such anxiety this young man is the son she added more softly what a terrible moment 
 having said this she went up to the doctor 
 dear doctor said she this young man is the son is there any hope 
 the doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders anna mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and moved away from the doctor to pierre to him in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad voice she said 
 trust in his mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it 
 pierre having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly moved toward the sofa she had indicated as soon as anna mikhaylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy he noticed that they whispered to one another casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility a deference such as he had never before received was shown him a strange lady the one who had been talking to the priests rose and offered him her seat an picked up and returned a glove pierre had dropped the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by and moved to make way for him at first pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way but all at once he felt that this would not do and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him and that he was therefore bound to accept their services he took the glove in silence from the and sat down in the chair placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of an egyptian statue and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him 
 not two minutes had passed before prince vasili with head erect majestically entered the room he was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast he seemed to have grown thinner since the morning his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed pierre he went up to him took his hand a thing he never used to do and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on 
 courage courage my friend he has asked to see you that is well and he turned to go 
 but pierre thought it necessary to ask how is and hesitated not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the count yet ashamed to call him father 
 he had another stroke about half an hour ago courage my friend 
 mind was in such a confused state that the word stroke suggested to him a blow from something he looked at prince vasili in perplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness prince vasili said something to lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe he could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step the eldest princess followed him and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about and at last anna mikhaylovna still with the same expression pale but resolute in the discharge of duty ran out and touching pierre lightly on the arm said 
 the divine mercy is inexhaustible unction is about to be administered come 
 pierre went in at the door stepping on the soft carpet and noticed that the strange lady the and some of the servants all followed him in as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room

 chapter 
 
 summer drew to an end and early autumn it was past michaelmas but the harvest was late that year and a few of our fields were still uncleared mr linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk and the evening happening to be chill and damp my master caught a bad cold that settling obstinately on his lungs confined him indoors throughout the whole of the winter nearly without intermission 
 poor cathy frightened from her little romance had been considerably sadder and duller since its abandonment and her father insisted on her reading less and taking more exercise she had his companionship no longer i esteemed it a duty to supply its lack as much as possible with mine an inefficient substitute for i could only spare two or three hours from my numerous diurnal occupations to follow her footsteps and then my society was obviously less desirable than his 
 on an afternoon in october or the beginning of fresh watery afternoon when the turf and paths were rustling with moist withered leaves and the cold blue sky was half hidden by grey streamers rapidly mounting from the west and boding abundant requested my young lady to forego her ramble because i was certain of showers she refused and i unwillingly donned a cloak and took my umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park a formal walk which she generally affected if that she invariably was when mr edgar had been worse than ordinary a thing never known from his confession but guessed both by her and me from his increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance she went sadly on there was no running or bounding now though the chill wind might well have tempted her to a race and often from the side of my eye i could detect her raising a hand and brushing something off her cheek i gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts on one side of the road rose a high rough bank where hazels and stunted oaks with their roots half exposed held uncertain tenure the soil was too loose for the latter and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal in summer miss catherine delighted to climb along these trunks and sit in the branches swinging twenty feet above the ground and i pleased with her agility and her light childish heart still considered it proper to scold every time i caught her at such an elevation but so that she knew there was no necessity for descending from dinner to tea she would lie in her cradle doing nothing except singing old nursery herself or watching the birds joint tenants feed and entice their young ones to fly or nestling with closed lids half thinking half dreaming happier than words can express 
 look miss i exclaimed pointing to a nook under the roots of one twisted tree winter is not here yet a little flower up yonder the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those turf steps in july with a lilac mist will you clamber up and pluck it to show to papa 
 cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom trembling in its earthy shelter and replied at length 
 no not touch it but it looks melancholy does it not ellen 
 yes i observed about as starved and sackless as you your cheeks are bloodless let us take hold of hands and run so low i dare say i shall keep up with you 
 no she repeated and continued sauntering on pausing at intervals to muse over a bit of moss or a tuft of blanched grass or a fungus spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage and ever and anon her hand was lifted to her averted face 
 catherine why are you crying love i asked approaching and putting my arm over her shoulder you cry because papa has a cold be thankful it is nothing worse 
 she now put no further restraint on her tears her breath was stifled by sobs 
 oh it will be something worse she said and what shall i do when papa and you leave me and i am by myself i forget your words ellen they are always in my ear how life will be changed how dreary the world will be when papa and you are dead 
 none can tell whether you die before us i replied wrong to anticipate evil hope there are years and years to come before any of us go master is young and i am strong and hardly my mother lived till eighty a canty dame to the last and suppose mr linton were spared till he saw sixty that would be more years than you have counted miss and would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity above twenty years beforehand 
 but aunt isabella was younger than papa she remarked gazing up with timid hope to seek further consolation 
 aunt isabella had not you and me to nurse her i replied she as happy as master she as much to live for all you need do is to wait well on your father and cheer him by letting him see you cheerful and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject mind that cathy not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless and cherished a foolish fanciful affection for the son of a person who would be glad to have him in his grave and allowed him to discover that you fretted over the separation he had judged it expedient to make 
 i fret about nothing on earth except illness answered my companion i care for nothing in comparison with papa and never while i have my senses do an act or say a word to vex him i love him better than myself ellen and i know it by this i pray every night that i may live after him because i would rather be miserable than that he should be that proves i love him better than myself 
 good words i replied but deeds must prove it also and after he is well remember you forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear 
 as we talked we neared a door that opened on the road and my young lady lightening into sunshine again climbed up and seated herself on the top of the wall reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed scarlet on the summit branches of the wild rose trees shadowing the highway side the lower fruit had disappeared but only birds could touch the upper except from present station in stretching to pull them her hat fell off and as the door was locked she proposed scrambling down to recover it i bid her be cautious lest she got a fall and she nimbly disappeared but the return was no such easy matter the stones were smooth and neatly cemented and the and blackberry stragglers could yield no assistance in i like a fool recollect that till i heard her laughing and exclaiming 
 ellen have to fetch the key or else i must run round to the lodge i scale the ramparts on this side 
 stay where you are i answered i have my bundle of keys in my pocket perhaps i may manage to open it if not go 
 catherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door while i tried all the large keys in succession i had applied the last and found that none would do so repeating my desire that she would remain there i was about to hurry home as fast as i could when an approaching sound arrested me it was the trot of a horse dance stopped and in a minute the horse stopped also 
 who is that i whispered 
 ellen i wish you could open the door whispered back my companion anxiously 
 ho miss linton cried a deep voice the glad to meet you be in haste to enter for i have an explanation to ask and obtain 
 i speak to you mr heathcliff answered catherine papa says you are a wicked man and you hate both him and me and ellen says the same 
 that is nothing to the purpose said heathcliff he it was i hate my son i suppose and it is concerning him that i demand your attention yes you have cause to blush two or three months since were you not in the habit of writing to linton making love in play eh you deserved both of you flogging for that you especially the elder and less sensitive as it turns out got your letters and if you give me any pertness send them to your father i presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it you well you dropped linton with it into a slough of despond he was in earnest in love really as true as i live dying for you breaking his heart at your fickleness not figuratively but actually though hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks and i have used more serious measures and attempted to frighten him out of his idiotcy he gets worse daily and be under the sod before summer unless you restore him 
 how can you lie so glaringly to the poor child i called from the inside pray ride on how can you deliberately get up such paltry falsehoods miss cathy knock the lock off with a stone you believe that vile nonsense you can feel in yourself it is impossible that a person should die for love of a stranger 
 i was not aware there were eavesdroppers muttered the detected villain worthy mrs dean i like you but i like your he added aloud how could you lie so glaringly as to affirm i hated the poor child and invent bugbear stories to terrify her from my doorstones catherine linton the very name warms me my bonnie lass i shall be from home all this week go and see if i have not spoken truth do a darling just imagine your father in my place and linton in yours then think how you would value your careless lover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you when your father himself entreated him and from pure stupidity fall into the same error i swear on my salvation going to his grave and none but you can save him 
 the lock gave way and i issued out 
 i swear linton is dying repeated heathcliff looking hard at me and grief and disappointment are hastening his death nelly if you let her go you can walk over yourself but i shall not return till this time next week and i think your master himself would scarcely object to her visiting her cousin 
 come in said i taking cathy by the arm and her to for she lingered viewing with troubled eyes the features of the speaker too stern to express his inward deceit 
 he pushed his horse close and bending down observed 
 miss catherine owe to you that i have little patience with linton and hareton and joseph have less own that with a harsh set he pines for kindness as well as love and a kind word from you would be his best medicine mind mrs cruel cautions but be generous and contrive to see him he dreams of you day and night and cannot be persuaded that you hate him since you neither write nor call 
 i closed the door and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in holding it and spreading my umbrella i drew my charge underneath for the rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees and warned us to avoid delay our hurry prevented any comment on the encounter with heathcliff as we stretched towards home but i divined instinctively that heart was clouded now in double darkness her features were so sad they did not seem hers she evidently regarded what she had heard as every syllable true 
 the master had retired to rest before we came in cathy stole to his room to inquire how he was he had fallen asleep she returned and asked me to sit with her in the library we took our tea together and afterwards she lay down on the rug and told me not to talk for she was weary i got a book and pretended to read as soon as she supposed me absorbed in my occupation she recommenced her silent weeping it appeared at present her favourite diversion i suffered her to enjoy it a while then i expostulated deriding and ridiculing all mr assertions about his son as if i were certain she would coincide alas i skill to counteract the effect his account had produced it was just what he intended 
 you may be right ellen she answered but i shall never feel at ease till i know and i must tell linton it is not my fault that i write and convince him that i shall not change 
 what use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity we parted that but next day beheld me on the road to wuthering heights by the side of my wilful young pony i bear to witness her sorrow to see her pale dejected countenance and heavy eyes and i yielded in the faint hope that linton himself might prove by his reception of us how little of the tale was founded on fact

 chapter 
 
 like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed the invalids improved rapidly and mr march began to talk or returning early in the new year beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day amusing herself with the cats at first and in time with sewing which had fallen sadly behindhand her once active limbs were so stiff and feeble that jo took her for a daily airing about the house in her strong arms meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for the dear while amy a loyal slave of the ring celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept 
 as christmas approached the usual mysteries began to haunt the house and jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies in honor of this unusually merry christmas laurie was equally impracticable and would have had bonfires skyrockets and triumphal arches if he had had his own way after many skirmishes and snubbings the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched and went about with forlorn faces which were rather belied by explosions of laughter when the two got together 
 several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid christmas day hannah felt in her bones that it was going to be an unusually fine day and she proved herself a true prophetess for everybody and everything seemed bound to produce a grand success to begin with mr march wrote that he should soon be with them then beth felt uncommonly well that morning and being dressed in her gift a soft crimson merino wrapper was borne in high triumph to the window to behold the offering of jo and laurie the unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise out in the garden stood a stately snow maiden crowned with holly bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand a great roll of music in the other a perfect rainbow of an afghan round her chilly shoulders and a christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer 
 
 the jungfrau to beth 
 god bless you dear queen bess 
 may nothing you dismay 
 but health and peace and happiness 
 be yours this christmas day 
 fruit to feed our busy bee 
 and flowers for her nose 
 music for her pianee 
 an afghan for her toes 
 a portrait of joanna see 
 by raphael no 
 ho laboured with great industry 
 to make it fair and true 
 accept a ribbon red i beg 
 for madam tail 
 and ice cream made by lovely peg 
 a mont blanc in a pail 
 their dearest love my makers laid 
 within my breast of snow 
 accept it and the alpine maid 
 from laurie and from jo 
 
 how beth laughed when she saw it how laurie ran up and down to bring in the gifts and what ridiculous speeches jo made as she presented them 
 so full of happiness that if father was only here i hold one drop more said beth quite sighing with contentment as jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the jungfrau had sent her 
 so am i added jo slapping the pocket wherein reposed the undine and sintram 
 sure i am echoed amy poring over the engraved copy of the madonna and child which her mother had given her in a pretty frame 
 of course i am cried meg smoothing the silvery folds of her first sild dress for mr laurence had insisted on giving it how can i be otherwise said mrs march gratefully as her eyes went from her letter to smiling face and her hand carressed the brooch made of gray and golden chestnut and dark brown hair which the girls had just fastened on her breast 
 now and then in this workaday world things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion and what a comfort it is half an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could only hold one drop more the drop came laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly he might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an indian war whoop for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up though he only said in a queer breathless voice another christmas present for the march family 
 before the words were well out of his mouth he was whisked away somehow and in his place appeared a tall man muffled up to the eyes leaning on the arm of another tall man who tried to say something and of course there was a general stampede and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits for the strangest things were done and no one said a word 
 mr march became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of loving arms jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away and had to be doctored by laurie in the china closet mr brooke kissed meg entirely by mistake as he somewhat incoherently explained and amy the dignified tumbled over a stool and never stopping to get up hugged and cried over her boots in the most touching manner mrs march was the first to recover herself and held up her hand with a warning hush remember beth 
 but it was too late the study door flew open the little red wrapper appeared on the threshold joy put strength into the feeble limbs and beth ran straight into her arms never mind what happened just after that for the full hearts overflowed washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the sweetness of the present 
 it was not at all romantic but a hearty laugh set everybody straight again for hannah was discovered behind the door sobbing over the fat turkey which she had forgotten to put down when she rushed up from the kitchen as the laugh subsided mrs march began to thank mr brooke for his faithful care of her husband at which mr brooke suddenly remembered that mr march needed rest and seizing laurie he precipitately retired then the two invalids were ordered to repose which they did by both sitting in one big chair and talking hard 
 mr march told how he had longed to surprise them and how when the fine weather came he had been allowed by his doctor to take advantage of it how devoted brooke had been and how he was altogether a most estimable and upright young man why mr march paused a minute just there and after a glance at meg who was violently poking the fire looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows i leave you to imagine also why mrs march gently nodded her head and asked rather abruptly if he like to have something to eat jo saw and understood the look and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea muttering to herself as she slammed the door i hate estimable young men with brown eyes 
 there never was such a christmas dinner as they had that day the fat turkey was a sight to behold when hannah sent him up stuffed browned and decorated so was the plum pudding which melted in mouth likewise the jellies in which amy reveled like a fly in a honeypot everything turned out well which was a mercy hannah said for my mind was that flustered mum that a merrycle i roast the pudding and stuff the turkey with raisins let alone bilin of it in a cloth 
 mr laurence and his grandson dined with them also mr brooke at whom jo glowered darkly to infinite amusement two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table in which sat beth and her father feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit they drank healths told stories sang songs reminisced as the old folks say and had a thoroughly good time a sleigh ride had been planned but the girls would not leave their father so the guests departed early and as twilight gathered the happy family sat together round the fire 
 just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal christmas we expected to have do you remember asked jo breaking a short pause which had followed a long conversation about many things 
 rather a pleasant year on the whole said meg smiling at the fire and congratulating herself on having treated mr brooke with dignity 
 i think been a pretty hard one observed amy watching the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes 
 glad over because got you back whispered beth who sat on her knee 
 rather a rough road for you to travel my little pilgrims especially the latter part of it but you have got on bravely and i think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon said mr march looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four young faces gathered round him 
 how do you know did mother tell you asked jo 
 not much straws show which way the wind blows and made several discoveries today 
 oh tell us what they are cried meg who sat beside him 
 here is one and taking up the hand which lay on the arm of his chair he pointed to the roughened forefinger a burn on the back and two or three little hard spots on the palm i remember a time when this hand was white and smooth and your first care was to keep it so it was very pretty then but to me it is much prettier now for in this seeming blemishes i read a little history a burnt offering has been made to vanity this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters and sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time so much good will went into the stitches meg my dear i value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white hands or fashionable accomplishments proud to shake this good industrious little hand and hope i shall not soon be asked to give it away 
 if meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor she received it in the hearty pressure of her hand and the approving smile he gave her 
 what about jo please say something nice for she has tried so hard and been so very very good to me said beth in her ear 
 he laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite with and unusually mild expression in her face 
 in spite of the curly crop i see the son jo whom i left a year ago said mr march i see a young lady who pins her collar straight laces her boots neatly and neither whistles talks slang nor lies on the rug as she used to do her face is rather thin and pale just now with watching and anxiety but i like to look at it for it has grown gentler and her voice is lower she bounce but moves quietly and takes care of a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me i rather miss my wild girl but if i get a strong helpful tenderhearted woman in her place i shall feel quite satisfied i know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep but i do know that in all washington i find anything beautiful enough to be bought with the dollars my good girl sent me 
 keen eyes were rather dim for a minute and her thin face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her praise feeling that she did deserve a portion of it 
 now beth said amy longing for her turn but ready to wait 
 so little of her afraid to say much for fear she will slip away altogether though she is not so shy as she used to be began their father cheerfully but recollecting how nearly he had lost her he held her close saying tenderly with her cheek against his own got you safe my beth and keep you so please god 
 after a silence he looked down at amy who sat on the cricket at his feet and said with a caress of the shining hair 
 i observed that amy took drumsticks at dinner ran errands for her mother all the afternoon gave meg her place tonight and has waited on every on with patience and good humor i also observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass and has not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears so i conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she molds her little clay figures i am glad of this for though i should be very proud of a graceful statue made by her i shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others 
 what are you thinking of beth asked jo when amy had thanked her father and told about her ring 
 i read in progress today how after many troubles christian and hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round and there they rested happily as we do now before they went on to their end answered beth adding as she slipped out of her arms and went to the instrument singing time now and i want to be in my old place try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the pilgrims heard i made the music for father because he likes the verses 
 so sitting at the dear little piano beth softly touched the keys and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn which was a singularly fitting song for her 
 he that is down need fear no fall 
 he that is low no pride 
 he that is humble ever shall 
 have god to be his guide 
 i am content with what i have 
 little be it or much 
 and lord contentment still i crave 
 because thou savest such 
 fulness to them a burden is 
 that go on pilgrimage 
 here little and hereafter bliss 
 is best from age to age

 harry 
 
 hermione was tugging at his sleeve staring at her watch got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hospital wing without anybody seeing us before dumbledore locks the door 
 
 okay said harry wrenching his gaze from the sky go 
 
 they slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase as they reached the bottom of it they heard voices they flattened themselves against the wall and listened it sounded like fudge and snape they were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase 
 
 only hope not going to make difficulties snape was saying the kiss will be performed immediately 
 
 as soon as macnair returns with the dementors this whole black affair has been highly embarrassing i tell you how much looking forward to informing the daily prophet that got him at last i daresay want to interview you snape and once young back in his right mind i expect want to tell the prophet exactly how you saved him 
 
 harry clenched his teeth he caught a glimpse of smirk as he and fudge passed harry and hiding place their footsteps died away harry and hermione waited a few moments to make sure really gone then started to run in the opposite direction down one staircase then another along a new corridor then they heard a cackling ahead 
 
 peeves harry muttered grabbing wrist in here 
 
 they tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time peeves seemed to be bouncing along the corridor in boisterous good spirits laughing his head off 
 
 oh horrible whispered hermione her ear to the door i bet all excited because the dementors are going to finish off sirius she checked her watch three minutes harry 
 
 they waited until gloating voice had faded into the distance then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again 
 
 hermione happen if we get back inside before dumbledore locks the door harry panted 
 
 i want to think about it hermione moaned checking her watch again one minute 
 
 they had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing entrance okay i can hear dumbledore said hermione tensely come on harry 
 
 they crept along the corridor the door opened back appeared 
 
 i am going to lock you in they heard him saying it is five minutes to midnight miss granger three turns should do it good luck 
 
 dumbledore backed out of the room closed the door and took out his wand to magically lock it panicking harry and hermione ran forward dumbledore looked up and a wide smile appeared under the long silver mustache well he said quietly 
 
 we did it said harry breathlessly sirius has gone on buckbeak 
 
 dumbledore beamed at them 
 
 well done i think he listened intently for any sound within the hospital wing yes i think gone too get inside lock you in 
 
 harry and hermione slipped back inside the dormitory it was empty except for ron who was still lying motionless in the end bed as the lock clicked behind them harry and hermione crept back to their own beds hermione tucking the back under her robes a moment later madam pomfrey came striding back out of her office 
 
 did i hear the headmaster leaving am i allowed to look after my patients now 
 
 she was in a very bad mood harry and hermione thought it best to accept their chocolate quietly madam pomfrey stood over them making sure they ate it but harry could hardly swallow he and hermione were waiting listening their nerves jangling and then as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from madam pomfrey they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them 
 
 what was that said madam pomfrey in alarm 
 
 now they could hear angry voices growing louder and louder madam pomfrey was staring at the door 
 
 really wake everybody up what do they think doing 
 
 harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying they were drawing nearer 
 
 he must have disapparated severus we should have left somebody in the room with him when this gets out 
 
 he disapparate snape roared now very close at hand you apparate or disapparate inside this castle this has something to do with potter 
 
 severus be reasonable harry has been locked up 
 
 bam 
 
 the door of the hospital wing burst open 
 
 fudge snape and dumbledore came striding into the ward dumbledore alone looked calm indeed he looked as though he was quite enjoying himself fudge appeared angry but snape was beside himself 
 
 out with it potter he bellowed what did you do 
 
 professor snape shrieked madam pomfrey control yourself 
 
 see here snape be reasonable said fudge this been locked we just saw 
 
 they helped him escape i know it snape howled pointing at harry and hermione his face was twisted spit was flying from his mouth 
 
 calm down man fudge barked talking nonsense 
 
 you know potter shrieked snape he did it i know he did it 
 
 that will do severus said dumbledore quietly think about what you are saying this door has been locked since i left the ward ten minutes ago madam pomfrey have these students left their beds 
 
 of course not said madam pomfrey bristling i would have heard them 
 
 well there you have it severus said dumbledore calmly unless you are suggesting that harry and hermione are able to be in two places at once afraid i see any point in troubling them further 
 
 snape stood there seething staring from fudge who looked thoroughly shocked at his behavior to dumbledore whose eyes were twinkling behind his glasses snape whirled about robes swishing behind him and stormed out of the ward 
 
 fellow seems quite unbalanced said fudge staring after him watch out for him if i were you dumbledore 
 
 oh not unbalanced said dumbledore quietly just suffered a severe disappointment 
 
 not the only one puffed fudge the daily going to have a field day we had black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again all it needs now is for the story of that escape to get out and be a laughingstock well better go and notify the ministry 
 
 and the dementors said dumbledore be removed from the school i trust 
 
 oh yes have to go said fudge running his fingers distractedly through his hair never dreamed attempt to administer the kiss on an innocent boy completely out of control no have them packed off back to azkaban tonight perhaps we should think about dragons at the school entrance 
 
 hagrid would like that said dumbledore smiling at harry and hermione as he and fudge left the dormitory madam pomfrey hurried to the door and locked it again muttering angrily to herself she headed back to her office 
 
 there was a low moan from the other end of the ward ron had woken up they could see him sitting up rubbing his head looking around 
 
 what what happened he groaned harry why are we in here sirius lupin going on 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other 
 
 you explain said harry helping himself to some more chocolate 
 
 
 
 when harry ron and hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day it was to find an almost deserted castle the sweltering heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another hogsmeade visit neither ron nor hermione felt like going however so they and harry wandered onto the grounds still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where sirius and buckbeak were now sitting near the lake watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank the stag had galloped toward him from there just last night 
 
 a shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very hagrid mopping his sweaty face with one of his handkerchiefs and beaming down at them 
 
 know i shouldn feel happy after wha happened las night he said i mean black escapin again an everythin but guess what 
 
 what they said pretending to look curious 
 
 beaky he escaped free bin celebratin all night 
 
 wonderful said hermione giving ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing 
 
 yeah tied him up properly said hagrid gazing happily out over the grounds i was worried this mornin mind thought he mighta met professor lupin on the grounds but lupin says he never ate anythin las night 
 
 what said harry quickly 
 
 blimey haven yeh heard said hagrid his smile fading a little he lowered his voice even though there was nobody in sight er snape told all the slytherins this mornin thought know by now professor a werewolf see an he was loose on the grounds las night packin now o course 
 
 packing said harry alarmed why 
 
 leavin isn he said hagrid looking surprised that harry had to ask resigned firs thing this mornin says he risk it happenin again 
 
 harry scrambled to his feet 
 
 going to see him he said to ron and hermione 
 
 but if resigned 
 
 c sound like anything we can do 
 
 i care i still want to see him meet you back here 
 
 office door was open he had already packed most of his things the empty tank stood next to his battered old suitcase which was open and nearly full lupin was bending over something on his desk and looked up only when harry knocked on the door 
 
 i saw you coming said lupin smiling he pointed to the parchment he had been poring over it was the map 
 
 i just saw hagrid said harry and he said resigned not true is it 
 
 afraid it is said lupin he started opening his desk drawers and taking out the contents 
 
 why said harry the ministry of magic think you were helping sirius do they 
 
 lupin crossed to the door and closed it behind harry 
 
 no professor dumbledore managed to convince fudge that i was trying to save your lives he sighed that was the final straw for severus i think the loss of the order of merlin hit him hard so he er accidentally let slip that i am a werewolf this morning at breakfast 
 
 not leaving just because of that said harry 
 
 lupin smiled wryly 
 
 this time tomorrow the owls will start arriving from parents they will not want a werewolf teaching their children harry and after last night i see their point i could have bitten any of you that must never happen again 
 
 the best defense against the dark arts teacher ever had said harry go 
 
 lupin shook his head and speak he carried on emptying his drawers then while harry was trying to think of a good argument to make him stay lupin said from what the headmaster told me this morning you saved a lot of lives last night harry if proud of anything done this year how much learned tell me about your patronus 
 
 how know about that said harry distracted 
 
 what else could have driven the dementors back 
 
 harry told lupin what had happened when finished lupin was smiling again 
 
 yes your father was always a stag when he transformed he said you guessed right why we called him prongs 
 
 lupin threw his last few books into his case closed the desk drawers and turned to look at harry 
 
 here i brought this from the shrieking shack last night he said handing harry back the invisibility cloak and he hesitated then held out the map too i am no longer your teacher so i feel guilty about giving you back this as well no use to me and i daresay you ron and hermione will find uses for it 
 
 harry took the map and grinned 
 
 you told me moony wormtail padfoot and prongs wanted to lure me out of school you said have thought it was funny 
 
 and so we would have said lupin now reaching down to close his case i have no hesitation in saying that james would have been highly disappointed if his son had never found any of the secret passages out of the castle 
 
 there was a knock on the door harry hastily stuffed the map and the invisibility cloak into his pocket 
 
 it was professor dumbledore he look surprised to see harry there 
 
 your carriage is at the gates remus he said 
 
 thank you headmaster 
 
 lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank 
 
 well harry he said smiling it has been a real pleasure teaching you i feel sure meet again sometime headmaster there is no need to see me to the gates i can manage 
 
 harry had the impression that lupin wanted to leave as quickly as possible 
 
 then remus said dumbledore soberly lupin shifted the grindylow tank slightly so that he and dumbledore could shake hands then with a final nod to harry and a swift smile lupin left the office 
 
 harry sat down in his vacated chair staring glumly at the floor he heard the door close and looked up dumbledore was still there 
 
 why so miserable harry he said quietly you should be very proud of yourself after last night 
 
 it make any difference said harry bitterly pettigrew got away 
 
 make any difference said dumbledore quietly it made all the difference in the world harry you helped uncover the truth you saved an innocent man from a terrible fate 
 
 terrible something stirred in memory greater and more terrible than ever before professor prediction 
 
 professor dumbledore yesterday when i was having my divination exam professor trelawney went very very strange 
 
 indeed said dumbledore er stranger than usual you mean 
 
 yes her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said she said servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight she said the servant would help him come back to power harry stared up at dumbledore and then she sort of became normal again and she remember anything said was it was she making a real prediction 
 
 dumbledore looked mildly impressed 
 
 do you know harry i think she might have been he said thoughtfully have thought it that brings her total of real predictions up to two i should offer her a pay raise 
 
 but harry looked at him aghast how could dumbledore take this so calmly 
 
 but i stopped sirius and professor lupin from killing pettigrew that makes it my fault if voldemort comes back 
 
 it does not said dumbledore quietly your experience with the taught you anything harry the consequences of our actions are always so complicated so diverse that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed professor trelawney bless her is living proof of that you did a very noble thing in saving life 
 
 but if he helps voldemort back to power 
 
 pettigrew owes his life to you you have sent voldemort a deputy who is in your debt when one wizard saves another life it creates a certain bond between them and much mistaken if voldemort wants his servant in the debt of harry potter 
 
 i want a connection with pettigrew said harry he betrayed my parents 
 
 this is magic at its deepest its most impenetrable harry but trust me the time may come when you will be very glad you saved life 
 
 harry imagine when that would be dumbledore looked as though he knew what harry was thinking 
 
 i knew your father very well both at hogwarts and later harry he said gently he would have saved pettigrew too i am sure of it 
 
 harry looked up at him dumbledore laugh he could tell dumbledore 
 
 i thought it was my dad conjured my patronus i mean when i saw myself across the lake i thought i was seeing him 
 
 an easy mistake to make said dumbledore softly i expect tire of hearing it but you do look extraordinarily like james except for the eyes you have your eyes 
 
 harry shook his head 
 
 it was stupid thinking it was him he muttered i mean i knew he was dead 
 
 you think the dead we loved ever truly leave us you think that we recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble your father is alive in you harry and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him how else could you produce that particular patronus prongs rode again last night 
 
 it took a moment for harry to realize what dumblefore had said 
 
 last night sirius told me all about how they became animagi said dumbledore smiling an extraordinary achievement not least keeping it quiet from me and then i remembered the most unusual form your patronus took when it charged mr malfoy down at your quidditch match against ravenclaw you know harry in a way you did see your father last night you found him inside yourself 
 
 and dumbledore left the office leaving harry to his very confused thoughts 
 
 
 
 nobody at hogwarts now knew the truth of what had happened the night that sirius buckbeak and pettigrew had vanished except harry ron hermione and professor dumbledore as the end of term approached harry heard many different theories about what had really happened but none of them came close to the truth 
 
 malfoy was furious about buckbeak he was convinced that hagrid had found a way of smuggling the hippogriff to safety and seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a gamekeeper percy weasley meanwhile had much to say on the subject of escape 
 
 if i manage to get into the ministry have a lot of proposals to make about magical law enforcement he told the only person who would listen his girlfriend penelope 
 
 though the weather was perfect though the atmosphere was so cheerful though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in helping sirius to freedom harry had never approached the end of a school year in worse spirits 
 
 he certainly the only one who was sorry to see professor lupin go the whole of defense against the dark arts class was miserable about his resignation 
 
 wonder what give us next year said seamus finnigan gloomily 
 
 maybe a vampire suggested dean thomas hopefully 
 
 it only professor departure that was weighing on mind he help thinking a lot about professor prediction he kept wondering where pettigrew was now whether he had sought sanctuary with voldemort yet but the thing that was lowering spirits most of all was the prospect of returning to the dursleys for maybe half an hour a glorious half hour he had believed he would be living with sirius from now onhis parents best friendit would have been the next best thing to having his own father back and while no news of sirius was definitely good news because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding harry help feeling miserable when he thought of the home he might have had and the fact that it was now impossible 
 
 the exam results came out on the last day of term harry ron and hermione had passed every subject harry was amazed that he had got through potions he had a shrewd suspicion that dumbledore might have stepped in to stop snape failing him on purpose behavior toward harry over the past week had been quite alarming harry have thought it possible that dislike for him could increase but it certainly had a muscle twitched unpleasantly at the corner of thin mouth every time he looked at harry and he was constantly flexing his fingers as though itching to place them around throat 
 
 percy had got his fred and george had scraped a handful of each gryffindor house meanwhile largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the quidditch cup had won the house championship for the third year running this meant that the end of term feast took place amid decorations of scarlet and gold and that the gryffindor table was the noisiest of the lot as everybody celebrated even harry managed to forget about the journey back to the dursleys the next day as he ate drank talked and laughed with the rest 
 
 
 
 as the hogwarts express pulled out of the station the next morning hermione gave harry and ron some surprising news 
 
 i went to see professor mcgonagall this morning just before breakfast decided to drop muggle studies 
 
 but you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent said ron 
 
 i know sighed hermione but i stand another year like this one that it was driving me mad handed it in without muggle studies and divination be able to have a normal schedule again 
 
 i still believe you tell us about it said ron grumpily supposed to be your friends 
 
 i promised i tell anyone said hermione severely she looked around at harry who was watching hogwarts disappear from view behind a mountain two whole months before see it again 
 
 oh cheer up harry said hermione sadly 
 
 okay said harry quickly just thinking about the holidays 
 
 yeah been thinking about them too said ron harry got to come and stay with us fix it up with mum and dad then call you i know how to use a fellytone now 
 
 a telephone ron said hermione honestly you should take muggle studies next year 
 
 ron ignored her 
 
 the quidditch world cup this summer how about it harry come and stay and go and see it dad can usually get tickets from work 
 
 this proposal had the effect of cheering harry up a great deal 
 
 yeah i bet the be pleased to let me come especially after what i did to aunt marge 
 
 feeling considerably more cheerful harry joined ron and hermione in several games of exploding snap and when the witch with the tea cart arrived he bought himself a very large lunch though nothing with chocolate in it 
 
 but it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him truly happy turned up 
 
 harry said hermione suddenly peering over his shoulder that thing outside your window 
 
 harry turned to look outside something very small and gray was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass he stood up for a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl carrying a letter that was much too big for it the owl was so small in fact that it kept tumbling over in the air buffeted this way and that in the slipstream harry quickly pulled down the window stretched out his arm and caught it it felt like a very fluffy snitch he brought it carefully inside 
 
 the owl dropped its letter onto seat and began zooming around their compartment apparently very pleased with itself for accomplishing its task hedwig clicked her beak with a sort of dignified disapproval crookshanks sat up in his seat following the owl with his great yellow eyes ron noticing this snatched the owl safely out of way 
 
 harry picked up the letter it was addressed to him he ripped open the letter and shouted from sirius 
 
 what said ron and hermione excitedly read it aloud 
 
 dear harry 
 i hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle i know whether used to owl post 
 buckbeak and i are in hiding i tell you where in case this owl falls into the wrong hands i have some doubt about his reliability but he is the best i could find and he did seem eager for the job 
 i believe the dementors are still searching for me but they a hope of finding me here i am planning to allow some muggles to glimpse me soon a long way from hogwarts so that the security on the castle will be lifted 
 there is something i never got around to telling you during our brief meeting it was i who sent you the firebolt 
 ha said hermione triumphantly see i told you it was from him 
 
 yes but he jinxed it had he said ron ouch the tiny owl now hooting happily in his hand had nibbled one of his fingers in what it seemed to think was an affectionate way 
 
 c crookshanks took the order to the owl office for me i used your name but told them to take the gold from my own gringotts vault please consider it as thirteen birthdays worth of presents from your godfather 
 i would also like to apologize for the fright i think i gave you that night last year when you left your house i had only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north but i think the sight of me alarmed you 
 i am enclosing something else for you which i think will make your next year at hogwarts more enjoyable 
 if ever you need me send word your owl will find me 
 write again soon 
 sirius 
 harry looked eagerly inside the envelope there was another piece of parchment in there he read it through quickly and felt suddenly as warm and contented as though swallowed a bottle of hot butterbeer in one gulp 
 
 i sirius black harry godfather hereby give him permission to visit hogsmeade on weekends be good enough for dumbledore said harry happily he looked back at letter hang on a ps 
 i thought your friend ron might like to keep this owl as my fault he no longer has a rat 
 eyes widened the minute owl was still hooting excitedly keep him he said uncertainly he looked closely at the owl for a moment then to and great surprise he held him out for crookshanks to sniff 
 
 what do you reckon ron asked the cat definitely an owl 
 
 crookshanks purred 
 
 good enough for me said ron happily mine 
 
 harry read and reread the letter from sirius all the way back into cross station it was still clutched tightly in his hand as he ron and hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform nine and harry spotted uncle vernon at once he was standing a good distance from mr and mrs weasley eyeing them suspiciously and when mrs weasley hugged harry in greeting his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed 
 
 call about the world cup ron yelled after harry as harry bid him and hermione then wheeled the trolley bearing his trunk and cage toward uncle vernon who greeted him in his usual fashion 
 
 that he snarled staring at the envelope harry was still clutching in his hand if another form for me to sign got another 
 
 not said harry cheerfully a letter from my godfather 
 
 godfather sputtered uncle vernon you got a godfather 
 
 yes i have said harry brightly he was my mum and best friend a convicted murderer but broken out of wizard prison and on the run he likes to keep in touch with me though keep up with my news check if happy 
 
 and grinning broadly at the look of horror on uncle face harry set off toward the station exit hedwig rattling along in front of him for what looked like a much better summer than the last 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter the unexpected taskcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 potter weasley will you pay attention 
 
 professor irritated voice cracked like a whip through the transfiguration class on thursday and harry and ron both jumped and looked up 
 
 it was the end of the lesson they had finished their work the guinea fowl they had been changing into guinea pigs had been shut away in a large cage on professor desk still had feathers they had copied down their homework from the blackboard describe with examples the ways in which transforming spells must be adapted when performing switches the bell was due to ring at any moment and harry and ron who had been having a sword fight with a couple of fred and fake wands at the back of the class looked up ron holding a tin parrot and harry a rubber haddock 
 
 now that potter and weasley have been kind enough to act their age said professor mcgonagall with an angry look at the pair of them as the head of haddock drooped and fell silently to the floor beak had severed it moments before i have something to say to you all 
 
 the yule ball is approaching a traditional part of the triwizard tournament and an opportunity for us to socialize with our foreign guests now the ball will be open only to fourth years and above although you may invite a younger student if you wish 
 
 lavender brown let out a shrill giggle parvati patil nudged her hard in the ribs her face working furiously as she too fought not to giggle they both looked around at harry professor mcgonagall ignored them which harry thought was distinctly unfair as she had just told off him and ron 
 
 dress robes will be worn professor mcgonagall continued and the ball will start at eight on christmas day finishing at midnight in the great hall now then 
 
 professor mcgonagall stared deliberately around the class 
 
 the yule ball is of course a chance for us all to er let our hair down she said in a disapproving voice 
 
 lavender giggled harder than ever with her hand pressed hard against her mouth to stifle the sound harry could see what was funny this time professor mcgonagall with her hair in a tight bun looked as though she had never let her hair down in any sense 
 
 but that does not mean professor mcgonagall went on that we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from hogwarts students i will be most seriously displeased if a gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way 
 
 the bell rang and there was the usual scuffle of activity as everyone packed their bags and swung them onto their shoulders 
 
 professor mcgonagall called above the noise potter a word if you please 
 
 assuming this had something to do with his headless rubber haddock harry proceeded gloomily to the desk professor mcgonagall waited until the rest of the class had gone and then said potter the champions and their partners 
 
 what partners said harry 
 
 profesor mcgonagall looked suspiciously at him as though she thought he was trying to be funny 
 
 your partners for the yule ball potter she said coldly your dance partners 
 
 insides seemed to curl up and shrivel 
 
 dance partners he felt himself going red i dance he said quickly 
 
 oh yes you do said professor mcgonagall irritably what telling you traditionally the champions and their partners open the ball 
 
 harry had a sudden mental image of himself in a top hat and tails accompanied by a girl in the sort of frilly dress aunt petunia always wore to uncle work parties 
 
 not dancing he said 
 
 it is traditional said professor mcgonagall firmly you are a hogwarts champion and you will do what is expected of you as a representative of the school so make sure you get yourself a partner potter 
 
 but i 
 
 you heard me potter said professor mcgonagall in a very final sort of way 
 
 
 
 a week ago harry would have said finding a partner for a dance would be a cinch compared to taking on a hungarian horntail but now that he had done the latter and was facing the prospect of asking a girl to the ball he thought rather have another round with the dragon 
 
 harry had never known so many people to put their names down to stay at hogwarts for christmas he always did of course because the alternative was usually going back to privet drive but he had always been very much in the minority before now this year however everyone in the fourth year and above seemed to be staying and they all seemed to harry to be obsessed with the coming ball or at least all the girls were and it was amazing how many girls hogwarts suddenly seemed to hold he had never quite noticed that before girls giggling and whispering in the corridors girls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them girls excitedly comparing notes on what they were going to wear on christmas night 
 
 why do they have to move in packs harry asked ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them sniggering and staring at harry you supposed to get one on their own to ask them 
 
 lasso one ron suggested got any idea who going to try 
 
 harry answer he knew perfectly well whom like to ask but working up the nerve was something was a year older than he was she was very pretty she was a very good quidditch player and she was also very popular 
 
 ron seemed to know what was going on inside head 
 
 listen not going to have any trouble a champion just beaten a hungarian horntail i bet be queuing up to go with you 
 
 in tribute to their recently repaired friendship ron had kept the bitterness in his voice to a bare minimum moreover to amazement he turned out to be quite right 
 
 a hufflepuff girl to whom harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day harry was so taken aback he said no before even stopped to consider the matter the girl walked off looking rather hurt and harry had to endure and taunts about her all through history of magic the following day two more girls asked him a second year and to his horror a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused 
 
 she was quite said ron fairly after stopped laughing 
 
 she was a foot taller than me said harry still unnerved imagine what look like trying to dance with her 
 
 words about krum kept coming back to him they only like him because famous harry doubted very much if any of the girls who had asked to be his partner so far would have wanted to go to the ball with him if he been a school champion then he wondered if this would bother him if cho asked him 
 
 on the whole harry had to admit that even with the embarrassing prospect of opening the ball before him life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task he attracting nearly as much unpleasantness in the corridors anymore which he suspected had a lot to do with cedric he had an idea cedric might have told the hufflepuffs to leave harry alone in gratitude for about the dragons there seemed to be fewer support cedric diggory badges around too draco malfoy of course was still quoting rita article to him at every possible opportunity but he was getting fewer and fewer laughs out of it and just to heighten feeling of no story about hagrid had appeared in the daily prophet 
 
 she didn seem very in magical creatures ter tell yeh the truth hagrid said when harry ron and hermione asked him how his interview with rita skeeter had gone during the last care of magical creatures lesson of the term to their very great relief hagrid had given up on direct contact with the skrewts now and they were merely sheltering behind his cabin today sitting at a trestle table and preparing a fresh selection of food with which to tempt the skrewts 
 
 she jus wanted me ter talk about you harry hagrid continued in a low voice well i told her been friends since i went ter fetch yeh from the dursleys never had to tell him off in four years she said never played you up in lessons has he i told her no an she didn seem happy at all think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible harry 
 
 course she did said harry throwing lumps of dragon liver into a large metal bowl and picking up his knife to cut some more she keep writing about what a tragic little hero i am get boring 
 
 she wants a new angle hagrid said ron wisely as he shelled salamander eggs you were supposed to say a mad delinquent 
 
 but not said hagrid looking genuinely shocked 
 
 she interviewed snape said harry grimly give her the goods on me any day potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school 
 
 said that did he said hagrid while ron and hermione laughed well yeh bent a few rules harry bu all righ really aren you 
 
 cheers hagrid said harry grinning 
 
 you coming to this ball thing on christmas day hagrid said ron 
 
 though i might look in on it yeah said hagrid gruffly should be a good do i reckon be openin the dancin won yeh harry you takin 
 
 no one yet said harry feeling himself going red again hagrid pursue the subject 
 
 the last week of term became increasingly boisterous as it progressed rumors about the yule ball were flying everywhere though harry believe half of them for instance that dumbledore had bought eight hundred barrels of mulled mead from madam rosmerta it seemed to be fact however that he had booked the weird sisters exactly who or what the weird sisters were harry know never having had access to a wireless but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the wwn wizarding wireless network that they were a very famous musical group 
 
 some of the teachers like little professor flitwick gave up trying to teach them much when their minds were so clearly elsewhere he allowed them to play games in his lesson on wednesday and spent most of it talking to harry about the perfect summoning charm harry had used during the first task of the triwizard tournament other teachers were not so generous nothing would ever deflect professor binns for example from plowing on through his notes on goblin rebellions as binns let his own death stand in the way of continuing to teach they supposed a small thing like christmas going to put him off it was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as report professors mcgonagall and moody kept them working until the very last second of their classes too and snape of course would no sooner let them play games in class than adopt harry staring nastily around at them all he informed them that he would be testing them on poison antidotes during the last lesson of the term 
 
 evil he is ron said bitterly that night in the gryffindor common room springing a test on us on the last day ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying 
 
 not exactly straining yourself though are you said hermione looking at him over the top of her potions notes ron was busy building a card castle out of his exploding snap pack a much more interesting pastime than with muggle cards because of the chance that the whole thing would blow up at any second 
 
 christmas hermione said harry lazily he was rereading flying with the cannons for the tenth time in an armchair near the fire 
 
 hermione looked severely over at him too have thought be doing something constructive harry even if you want to learn your antidotes 
 
 like what harry said as he watched joey jenkins of the cannons belt a bludger toward a ballycastle bats chaser 
 
 that egg hermione hissed 
 
 come on hermione got till february the harry said 
 
 he had put the golden egg upstairs in his trunk and opened it since the celebration party after the first task there were still two and a half months to go until he needed to know what all the screechy wailing meant after all 
 
 but it might take weeks to work it out said hermione going to look a real idiot if everyone else knows what the next task is and you 
 
 leave him alone hermione earned a bit of a break said ron and he placed the last two cards on top of the castle and the whole lot blew up singeing his eyebrows 
 
 nice look rongo well with your dress robes that will 
 
 it was fred and george they sat down at the table with harry ron and hermione as ron felt how much damage had been done 
 
 ron can we borrow pigwidgeon george asked 
 
 no off delivering a letter said ron why 
 
 because george wants to invite him to the ball said fred sarcastically 
 
 because we want to send a letter you stupid great prat said george 
 
 who two keep writing to eh said ron 
 
 nose out ron or burn that for you too said fred waving his wand threateningly soyou lot got dates for the ball yet 
 
 nope said ron 
 
 well better hurry up mate or all the good ones will be gone said fred 
 
 you going with then said ron 
 
 angelina said fred promptly without a trace of embarrassment 
 
 what said ron taken aback already asked her 
 
 good point said fred he turned his head and called across the common room oi angelina 
 
 angelina who had been chatting with alicia spinnet near the fire looked over at him 
 
 what she called back 
 
 want to come to the ball with me 
 
 angelina gave fred an appraising sort of look 
 
 all right then she said and she turned back to alicia and carried on chatting with a bit of a grin on her face 
 
 there you go said fred to harry and ron piece of cake 
 
 he got to his feet yawning and said better use a school owl then george come on 
 
 they left ron stopped feeling his eyebrows and looked across the smoldering wreck of his card castle at harry 
 
 we should get a move on you knowask someone right we want to end up with a pair of trolls 
 
 hermione let out a sputter of indignation 
 
 a pair ofwhat excuse me 
 
 well you know said ron shrugging rather go alone than with with eloise midgen say 
 
 her loads better lately and really nice 
 
 her nose is said ron 
 
 oh i see hermione said bristling so basically going to take the girl have you even if completely horrible 
 
 er yeah that sounds about right said ron 
 
 going to bed hermione snapped and she swept off toward the girls staircase without another word 
 
 
 
 the hogwarts staff demonstrating a continued desire to impress the visitors from beauxbatons and durmstrang seemed determined to show the castle at its best this christmas when the decorations went up harry noticed that they were the most stunning he had yet seen inside the school everlasting icicles had been attached to the banisters of the marble staircase the usual twelve christmas trees in the great hall were bedecked with everything from luminous holly berries to real hooting golden owls and the suits of armor had all been bewitched to sing carols whenever anyone passed them it was quite something to hear o come all ye faithful sung by an empty helmet that only knew half the words several times filch the caretaker had to extract peeves from inside the armor where he had taken to hiding filling in the gaps in the songs with lyrics of his own invention all of which were very rude 
 
 and still harry asked cho to the ball he and ron were getting very nervous now though as harry pointed out ron would look much less stupid than he would without a partner harry was supposed to be starting the dancing with the other champions 
 
 i suppose always moaning myrtle he said gloomily referring to the ghost who haunted the girls toilets on the second floor 
 
 harry just got to grit our teeth and do it said ron on friday morning in a tone that suggested they were planning the storming of an impregnable fortress when we get back to the common room tonight both have partners agreed 
 
 erokay said harry 
 
 but every time he glimpsed cho that day during break and then lunchtime and once on the way to history of magic she was surrounded by friends she ever go anywhere alone could he perhaps ambush her as she was going into a bathroom but no she even seemed to go there with an escort of four or five girls yet if he do it soon she was bound to have been asked by somebody else 
 
 he found it hard to concentrate on potions test and consequently forgot to add the key ingredient a bezoar meaning that he received bottom marks he care though he was too busy screwing up his courage for what he was about to do when the bell rang he grabbed his bag and hurried to the dungeon door 
 
 meet you at dinner he said to ron and hermione and he dashed off upstairs 
 
 just have to ask cho for a private word that was hurried off through the packed corridors looking for her and rather sooner than he had expected he found her emerging from a defense against the dark arts lesson 
 
 er cho could i have a word with you 
 
 giggling should be made illegal harry thought furiously as all the girls around cho started doing it she though she said okay and followed him out of earshot other classmates 
 
 harry turned to look at her and his stomach gave a weird lurch as though he had missed a step going downstairs 
 
 er he said 
 
 he ask her he but he had to cho stood there looking puzzled watching him the words came out before harry had quite got his tongue around them 
 
 wangoballwime 
 
 sorry said cho 
 
 want to go to the ball with me said harry why did he have to go red now why 
 
 oh said cho and she went red too oh harry really sorry and she truly looked it already said go with someone else 
 
 oh said harry 
 
 it was odd a moment before his insides had been writhing like snakes but suddenly he seem to have any insides at all 
 
 oh okay he said no problem 
 
 really sorry she said again 
 
 okay said harry 
 
 they stood there looking at each other and then cho said well 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 well bye said cho still very red she walked away 
 
 harry called after her before he could stop himself 
 
 you going with 
 
 oh cedric she said cedric diggory 
 
 oh right said harry 
 
 his insides had come back again it felt as though they had been filled with lead in their absence 
 
 completely forgetting about dinner he walked slowly back up to gryffindor tower voice echoing in his ears with every step he took cedric cedric diggory he had been starting to quite like cedric prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at quidditch and was handsome and popular and nearly favorite champion now he suddenly realized that cedric was in fact a useless pretty boy who have enough brains to fill an eggcup 
 
 fairy lights he said dully to the fat lady the password had been changed the previous day 
 
 yes indeed dear she trilled straightening her new tinsel hair band as she swung forward to admit him 
 
 
 
 entering the common room harry looked around and to his surprise he saw ron sitting in a distant corner ginny was sitting with him talking to him in what seemed to be a low soothing voice 
 
 up ron said harry joining them 
 
 ron looked up at harry a sort of blind horror in his face 
 
 why did i do it he said wildly i know what made me do it 
 
 what said harry 
 
 he er just asked fleur delacour to go to the ball with him said ginny she looked as though she was fighting back a smile but she kept patting arm sympathetically 
 
 you what said harry 
 
 i know what made me do it ron gasped again what was i playing at there were people all around gone mad everyone watching i was just walking past her in the entrance hall she was standing there talking to diggory and it sort of came over me and i asked her 
 
 ron moaned and put his face in his hands he kept talking though the words were barely distinguishable 
 
 she looked at me like i was a sea slug or something even answer and then i dunno i just sort of came to my senses and ran for it 
 
 part veela said harry you were right her grandmother was one it your fault i bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for diggory and got a blast of it but she was wasting her time going with cho chang 
 
 ron looked up 
 
 i asked her to go with me just now harry said dully and she told me 
 
 ginny had suddenly stopped smiling 
 
 this is mad said ron the only ones left who got anyone well except neville hey guess who he asked hermione 
 
 what said harry completely distracted by this startling news 
 
 yeah i know said ron some of the color coming back into his face as he started to laugh he told me after potions said always been really nice helping him out with work and stuff but she told him she was already going with someone ha as if she just want to go with nevillei mean who would 
 
 said ginny annoyed laugh 
 
 just then hermione climbed in through the portrait hole 
 
 why you two at dinner she said coming over to join them 
 
 because oh shut up laughing you two because both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball said ginny 
 
 that shut harry and ron up 
 
 thanks a bunch ginny said ron sourly 
 
 all the ones taken ron said hermione loftily eloise midgen starting to look quite pretty now is she well sure find someone somewhere have you 
 
 but ron was staring at hermione as though suddenly seeing her in a whole new light 
 
 hermione right you are a girl 
 
 oh well spotted she said acidly 
 
 well you can come with one of us 
 
 no i snapped hermione 
 
 oh come on he said impatiently we need partners going to look really stupid if we got any everyone else has 
 
 i come with you said hermione now blushing because already going with someone 
 
 no not said ron you just said that to get rid of neville 
 
 oh did i said hermione and her eyes flashed dangerously just because taken you three years to notice ron mean no one else has spotted a girl 
 
 ron stared at her then he grinned again 
 
 okay okay we know a girl he said that do will you come now 
 
 already told you hermione said very angrily going with someone else 
 
 and she stormed off toward the girls dormitories again 
 
 lying said ron flatly watching her go 
 
 not said ginny quietly 
 
 who is it then said ron sharply 
 
 not telling you her business said ginny 
 
 right said ron who looked extremely put out this is getting stupid ginny you can go with harry and just 
 
 i said ginny and she went scarlet too going with with neville he asked me when hermione said no and i not going to be able to go otherwise not in fourth year she looked extremely miserable i think go and have dinner she said and she got up and walked off to the portrait hole her head bowed 
 
 ron goggled at harry 
 
 got into them he demanded 
 
 but harry had just seen parvati and lavender come in through the portrait hole the time had come for drastic action 
 
 wait here he said to ron and he stood up walked straight up to parvati and said parvati will you go to the ball with me 
 
 parvati went into a fit of giggles harry waited for them to subside his fingers crossed in the pocket of his robes 
 
 yes all right then she said finally blushing furiously 
 
 thanks said harry in relief lavender will you go with ron 
 
 going with seamus said parvati and the pair of them giggled harder than ever 
 
 harry sighed 
 
 you think of anyone go with ron he said lowering his voice so that ron hear 
 
 what about hermione granger said parvati 
 
 going with someone else 
 
 parvati looked astonished 
 
 ooooh who she said keenly 
 
 harry shrugged no idea he said so what about ron 
 
 well said parvati slowly i suppose my sister mightpadma you knowin ravenclaw ask her if you like 
 
 yeah that would be great said harry let me know will you 
 
 and he went back over to ron feeling that this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth and hoping very much that padma nose was dead center 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter st hosptial for magical maladies and injuriescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry was so relieved she was taking him seriously that he did not hesitate but jumped out of bed at once pulled on his dressing gown and pushed his glasses back on to his nose 
 
 weasley you ought to come too said professor mcgonagall 
 
 they followed professor mcgonagall past the silent figures of neville dean and seamus out of the dormitory down the spiral stairs into the common room through the portrait hole and off along the fat moonlit corridor harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment he wanted to run to yell for dumbledore mr weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately and what if those fangs harry tried hard not to think my fangs had been poisonous they passed mrs norris who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly but professor mcgonagall said shoo mrs norris slunk away into the shadows and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to dumbledore s office 
 
 fizzing whizzbee said professor mcgonagall 
 
 the gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator the three of them stepped on to the moving stairs the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin 
 
 though it was now well past midnight there were voices coming from inside the room a positive babble of them it sounded as though dumbledore was entertaining at least a dozen people 
 
 professor mcgonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off the door opened of its own accord and professor mcgonagall led harry and ron inside 
 
 the room was in the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames behind the door a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing 
 
 oh you professor mcgonagall and ah 
 
 dumbledore was sitting in a chair behind his desk he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him he was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white nightshirt but seemed his penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon professor mcgonagall 
 
 professor dumbledore potter has had a well a nightmare said professor mcgonagall he says 
 
 it a nightmare said harry quickly 
 
 professor mcgonagall looked round at harry frowning slightly 
 
 very well then potter you tell the headmaster about it 
 
 i well i was asleep said harry and even in his terror and his desperation to make dumbledore understand he felt slightly irritated that the headmaster was not looking at him but examining his own interlocked fingers but it an ordinary dream it was real i saw it happen he took a deep breath dadmr weasleyhas been attacked by a giant snake 
 
 the words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them sounding slightly ridiculous even comic there was a pause in which dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling ron looked from harry to dumbledore and shocked 
 
 how did you see this dumbledore asked quietly still not looking at harry 
 
 well i know said harry rather angrilywhat did it matter inside my head i suppose 
 
 you misunderstand me said dumbledore still in the same calm tone i mean can you remembererwhere you were positioned as you watched this attack happen were you perhaps standing beside the victim or else looking down on the scene from above 
 
 this was such a curious question that harry gaped at dumbledore it was almost as though he knew 
 
 i was the snake he said i saw it all from the point of view 
 
 nobody else spoke for a moment then dumbledore now looking at ron who was still asked in a new and sharper voice is arthur seriously injured 
 
 yes said harry emphaticallywhy were they all so slow on the uptake did they not realise how much a person bled when fangs that long pierced their side and why could dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him 
 
 but dumbledore stood up so quickly it made harry jump and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling everard he said sharply and you too dilys 
 
 a wizard with a short black fringe and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps opened their eyes immediately 
 
 you were listening said dumbledore 
 
 the wizard nodded the witch said naturally 
 
 the man has red hair and glasses said dumbledore everard you will need to raise the alarm make sure he is found by the right people 
 
 both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames but instead of emerging in neighbouring pictures as usually happened at hogwarts neither reappeared one frames now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain the other a handsome leather armchair harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls though snoring and drooling most convincingly kept sneaking peeks at him from under their eyelids and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked 
 
 everard and dilys were two of hogwartss most celebrated heads dumbledore said now sweeping around harry ron and professor mcgonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important wizarding institutions as they are free to move between their own portraits they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere 
 
 but mr weasley could be anywhere said harry 
 
 please sit down all three of you said dumbledore as though harry had not spoken everard and dilys may not be back for several minutes professor mcgonagall if you could draw up extra chairs 
 
 professor mcgonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it three chairs appeared out of thin air and wooden quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that dumbledore had conjured up at hearing harry sat down watching dumbledore over his shoulder dumbledore was now stroking plumed golden head with one finger the phoenix awoke immediately he stretched his beautiful head high and observed dumbledore through bright dark eyes 
 
 we will need dumbledore said very quietly to the bird a warning 
 
 there was a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone 
 
 dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function harry had never known carried it over to his desk sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand 
 
 the instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top dumbledore watched the smoke closely his brow furrowed after a few seconds the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air a head grew out of the end of it opening its mouth wide harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story he looked eagerly at dumbledore for a sign that he was right but dumbledore did not look up 
 
 naturally naturally murmured dumbledore apparently to himself still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise but in essence divided 
 
 harry could make neither head nor tail of this question the smoke serpent however split itself instantly into two snakes both coiling and undulating in the dark air with a look of grim satisfaction dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint became a formless haze and vanished 
 
 dumbledore replaced the instrument on its spindly little table harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes then realising that harry was watching them hastily pretend to be sleeping again harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for but before he could do so there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right the wizard called everard had reappeared in his portrait panting slightly 
 
 dumbledore 
 
 what news said dumbledore at once 
 
 i yelled until someone came running said the wizard who was mopping his brow on the curtain behind him said heard something moving downstairsthey sure whether to believe me but went down to checkyou know there are no portraits down there to watch from anyway they carried him up a few minutes later he look good covered in blood i ran along to elfrida portrait to get a good view as they left 
 
 good said dumbledore as ron made a convulsive movement i take it dilys will have seen him arrive then 
 
 and moments later the witch had reappeared in her picture too she sank coughing into her armchair and said yes taken him to st dumbledore they carried him past my portrait he looks bad 
 
 thank you said dumbledore he looked round at professor mcgonagall 
 
 minerva i need you to go and wake the other weasley children 
 
 of course 
 
 professor mcgonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door harry cast a sideways glance at ron who was looking terrified 
 
 and dumbledore what about molly said professor mcgonagall pausing at the door 
 
 that will be a job for fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching said dumbledore but she may already know that excellent clock of hers 
 
 harry knew dumbledore was referring to the clock that told not the time but the whereabouts and conditions of the various weasley family members and with a pang he thought that mr hand must even now be pointing at mortal it was very late mrs weasley was probably asleep not watching the clock harry felt cold as he remembered mrs boggart turning into mr lifeless body his glasses askew blood running down his face but mr weasley going to die he 
 
 dumbledore was now rummaging in a cupboard behind harry and ron he emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle which he placed carefully on his desk he raised his wand and murmured portus for a moment the kettle trembled glowing with an odd blue light then it quivered to rest as solidly black as ever 
 
 dumbledore marched over to another portrait this time of a wizard with a pointed beard who had been painted wearing the slytherin colours of green and silver and was apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear voice when he attempted to rouse him 
 
 phineas phineas 
 
 the subjects of the portraits lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep they were shifting around in their frames the better to watch what was happening when the wizard continued to feign sleep some of them shouted his name too 
 
 phineas phineas phineas 
 
 he could not pretend any longer he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eyes wide 
 
 did someone call 
 
 i need you to visit your other portrait again phineas said dumbledore got another message 
 
 visit my other portrait said phineas in a reedy voice giving a long fake yawn his eyes travelling around the room and focusing on harry oh no dumbledore i am too tired tonight 
 
 something about voice was familiar to harry where had he heard it before but before he could think the portraits on the surrounding walls broke into a storm of protest 
 
 insubordination sir roared a corpulent wizard brandishing his fists dereliction of duty 
 
 we are to give service to the present headmaster of hogwarts cried a old wizard whom harry recognised as predecessor armando dippet sharne on you phineas 
 
 shall i persuade him dumbledore called a witch raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod 
 
 oh very well said the wizard called phineas eyeing the wand with mild apprehension though he may well have destroyed my picture by now done away with most of the family 
 
 sirius knows not to destroy your portrait said dumbledore and harry realised immediately where he had heard voice before issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in grimmauld place you are to give him the message that arthur weasley has been gravely injured and that his wife children and harry potter will be arriving at his house shortly do you understand 
 
 arthur weasley injured wife and children and harry potter coming to stay repeated phineas in a bored voice yes yes very well 
 
 he sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment the study door opened again fred george and ginny were ushered inside by professor mcgonagall all three of them looking dishevelled and shocked still in their night things 
 
 going on asked ginny who looked frightened professor mcgonagall says you saw dad get hurt 
 
 your father has been injured in the course of his work for the order of the phoenix said dumbledore before harry could speak he has been taken to st hospital for magical maladies and injuries i am sending you back to house which is much more convenient for the hospital than the burrow you will meet your mother there 
 
 we going asked fred looking shaken floo powder 
 
 no said dumbledore floo powder is not safe at the moment the network is being watched you will be taking a portkey he indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk we are just waiting for phineas nigellus to report back i want to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you 
 
 there was a flash of flame in the very middle of the office leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor 
 
 it is warning said dumbledore catching the feather as it fell professor umbridge must know out of your beds minerva go and head her offtell her any story 
 
 professor mcgonagall was gone in a swish of tartan 
 
 he says be delighted said a bored voice behind dumbledore the wizard called phineas had reappeared in front of his slytherin banner my has always had an odd taste in 
 
 come here then dumbledore said to harry and the weasleys and quickly before anyone else joins us 
 
 harry and the others gathered around desk 
 
 you have all used a portkey before asked dumbledore and they nodded each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle good on the count of three then one two 
 
 it happened in a fraction of a second in the infinitesimal pause before dumbledore said three harry looked up at himthey were very close togetherand clear blue gaze moved from the portkey to face 
 
 at once scar burned as though the old wound had burst open againand unbidden unwanted but terrifyingly strong there rose within harry a hatred so powerful he felt for that instant he would like nothing better than to striketo biteto sink his fangs into the man before him 
 
 three 
 
 harry felt a powerful jerk behind his navel the ground vanished from beneath his feet his hand was glued to the kettle he was banging into the others as they all sped forwards in a swirl of colours and a rush of wind the kettle pulling them onwards until his feet hit the ground so hard his knees buckled the kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said 
 
 back again the brats is it true their dying 
 
 out roared a second voice 
 
 harry scrambled to his feet and looked around they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of number twelve grimmauld place the only sources of light were the fire and one guttering candle which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth sirius was hurrying towards them all looking anxious he was unshaven and still in his day clothes there was also a slightly whiff of stale drink about him 
 
 going on he said stretching out a hand to help ginny up thineas nigellus said been badly injured 
 
 ask harry said fred 
 
 yeah i want to hear this for myself said george 
 
 the twins and ginny were staring at him footsteps had stopped on the stairs outside 
 
 it was harry began this was even worse than telling mcgonagall and dumbledore i had aa kind ofvision 
 
 and he told them all that he had seen though he altered the story so that it sounded as though he had watched from the sidelines as the snake attacked rather than from behind the own eyes ron who was still very white gave him a fleeting look but did not speak when harry had finished fred george and ginny continued to stare at him for a moment harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not but he fancied there was something accusatory in their looks well if they were going to blame him just for seeing the attack he was glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time 
 
 is mum here said fred turning to sirius 
 
 she probably even know happened yet said sirius the important thing was to get you away before umbridge could interfere i expect letting molly know now 
 
 got to go to st mungos said ginny urgently she looked around at her brothers they were of course still in their pyjamas sirius can you lend us cloaks or anything 
 
 hang on you go tearing off to st said sirius 
 
 course we can go to st if we want said fred with a mulish expression our dad 
 
 and how are you going to explain how you knew arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know 
 
 what does that matter said george hotly 
 
 it matters because we want to draw attention to the fact that harry is having visions of things that are happening hundreds of miles away said sirius angrily have you any idea what the ministry would make off that information 
 
 fred and george looked as though they could not care less what the ministry made of anything ron was still and silent 
 
 ginny said somebody else could have told us we could have heard it somewhere other than harry 
 
 like who said sirius impatiently listen your been hurt while on duty for the order and the circumstances are fishy enough without his children knowing about it seconds after it happened you could seriously damage the 
 
 we care about the dumb order shouted fred 
 
 our dad dying talking about yelled george 
 
 your father knew what he was getting into and he thank you for messing things up for the order said sirius equally angry this is how it isthis is why not in the orderyou understandthere are things worth dying for 
 
 easy for you to say stuck here bellowed fred i see you risking your neck 
 
 the little colour remaining in face drained from it he looked for a moment as though he would quite like to hit fred but when he spoke it was in a voice of determined calm 
 
 i know hard but all got to act as though we know anything yet got to stay put at least until we hear from your mother all right 
 
 fred and george still looked mutinous ginny however took a few steps over to the nearest chair and sank into it harry looked at ron who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and a shrug and they sat down too the twins glared at sirius for another minute then took seats either side of ginny 
 
 right said sirius encouragingly come on lets all all have a drink while waiting accio butterbeer 
 
 he raised his wand as he spoke and half a dozen bottles came flying towards them out of the pantry skidded along the table scattering the debris of meal and stopped neatly in front of the six of them they all drank and for a while the only sounds were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottles on the table 
 
 harry was only drinking to have something to do with his hands his stomach was full of horrible hot bubbling guilt they would not be here if it were not for him they would all still be asleep in bed and it was no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that mr weasley was found because there was also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked mr weasley in the first place 
 
 be stupid you got fangs he told himself trying to keep calm though the hand on his butterbeer bottle was shaking you were lying in bed you attacking anyone 
 
 but then what just happened in office he asked himself i felt like i wanted to attack dumbledore too 
 
 he put the bottle down a little harder than he meant to and it slopped over on to the table no one took any notice then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plates in front of them and as they gave cries of shock a scroll of parchment fell with a thud on to the table accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather 
 
 fawkes said sirius at once snatching up the parchment not writing it must be a message from your motherhere 
 
 he thrust the letter into hand who ripped it open and read aloud dad is still alive i am setting out for st now stay where you are i will send news as soon as i can mum 
 
 george looked around the table 
 
 still alive he said slowly but that makes it sound 
 
 he did not need to finish the sentence it sounded to harry too as though mr weasley was hovering somewhere between life and death still exceptionally pale ron stared at the back of his letter as though it might speak words of comfort to him fred pulled the parchment out of hands and read it for himself then looked up at harry who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling 
 
 if harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could not remember it sirius suggested once without any real conviction that they all go to bed but the weasleys looks of disgust were answer enough they mostly sat in silence around the table watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax occasionally raising a bottle to their lips speaking only to check the time to wonder aloud what was happening and to reassure each other that if there was bad news they would know straightaway for mrs weasley must long since have arrived at st 
 
 fred fell into a doze his head lolling sideways on to his shoulder ginny was curled like a cat on her chair but her eyes were open harry could see them reflecting the firelight ron was sitting with his head in his hands whether awake or asleep it was impossible to tell harry and sirius looked at each other every so often intruders upon the family grief waiting waiting 
 
 at ten past five in the morning by watch the kitchen door swung open and mrs weasley entered the kitchen she was extremely pale but when they all turned to look at her fred ron and harry half rising from their chairs she gave a wan smile 
 
 going to be all right she said her voice weak with tiredness sleeping we can all go and see him later sitting with him now going to take the morning off work 
 
 fred fell back into his chair with his hands over his face george and ginny got up walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer in one 
 
 breakfast said sirius loudly and joyfully jumping to his feet that accursed kreacher kreacher 
 
 but kreacher did not answer the summons 
 
 oh forget it then muttered sirius counting the people in front of him so breakfast seeseven bacon and eggs i think and some tea and toast 
 
 harry hurried over to the stove to help he did not want to intrude on the weasleys happiness and he dreaded the moment when mrs weasley would ask him to recount his vision however he had barely taken plates from the dresser when mrs weasley lifted them out of his hands and pulled him into a hug 
 
 i know what would have happened if it been for you harry she said in a muffled voice they might not have found arthur for hours and then it would have been too late but thanks to you alive and been able to think up a good cover story for arthur being where he was no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise look at poor sturgis 
 
 harry could hardly bear her gratitude but fortunately she soon released him to turn to sirius and thank him for looking after her children through the night sirius said he was very pleased to have been able to help and hoped they would all stay with him as long as mr weasley was in hospital 
 
 oh sirius so grateful they think be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer of course that might mean here for christmas 
 
 the more the merrier said sirius with such obvious sincerity that mrs weasley beamed at him threw on an apron and began to help with breakfast 
 
 sirius harry muttered unable to stand it a moment longer can i have a quick word er now 
 
 he walked into the dark pantry and sirius followed without preamble harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked mr weasley 
 
 when he paused for breath sirius said did you tell dumbledore this 
 
 yes said harry impatiently but he tell me what it meant well he tell me anything any more 
 
 i m sure he would have told you if it was anything to worry about said sirius steadily 
 
 but not all said harry in a voice only a little above a whisper sirius i i think going mad back in office just before we took the portkey for a couple of seconds there i thought i was a snake i felt like onemy scar really hurt when i was looking at dumbledoresirius i wanted to attack him 
 
 he could only see a sliver of face the rest was in darkness 
 
 it must have been the aftermath of the vision all said sirius you were still thinking of the dream or whatever it was and 
 
 it that said harry shaking his head it was like something rose up inside me like a snake inside me 
 
 you need to sleep said sirius firmly going to have breakfast then go upstairs to bed and after lunch you can go and see arthur with the others in shock harry blaming yourself for something you only witnessed and lucky you did witness it or arthur might have died just stop worrying 
 
 he clapped harry on the shoulder and left the pantry leaving harry standing alone in the dark 
 
 everyone but harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping he went up to the bedroom he and ron had shared over the last few weeks of summer but while ron crawled into bed and was asleep within minutes harry sat fully clothed hunched against the cold metal bars of the bedstead keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable determined not to fall into a doze terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and wake to find that he had attacked ron or else slithered through the house after one of the others 
 
 when ron woke up harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too their trunks arrived from hogwarts while they were eating lunch so they could dress as muggles for the trip to st everybody except harry was riotously happy and talkative as they changed out of their robes into jeans and sweatshirts when tonks and turned up to escort them across london they greeted them gleefully laughing at the bowler hat was wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him truthfully that tonks whose hair was short and bright pink again would attract far less attention on the underground 
 
 tonks was very interested in vision of the attack on mr weasley something harry was not remotely interested in discussing 
 
 there any seer blood in your family is there she enquired curiously as they sat side by side on a train rattling towards the heart of the city 
 
 no said harry thinking of professor trelawney and feeling insulted 
 
 no said tonks musingly no i suppose not really prophecy doing is it i mean not seeing the future seeing the present odd it useful though 
 
 harry answer fortunately they got out at the next stop a station in the very heart of london and in the bustle of leaving the train he was able to allow fred and george to get between himself and tonks who was leading the way they all followed her up the escalator moody clunking along at the back of the group his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the buttons of his coat clutching his wand harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him trying to avoid any more questions about his dream he asked where st was hidden 
 
 not far from here grunted moody as they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad street packed with christmas shoppers he pushed harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind harry knew the eye was rolling in all directions under the tilted hat easy to find a good location for a hospital nowhere in diagon alley was big enough and we have it underground like the be healthy in the end they managed to get hold of a building up here theory was sick wizards could come and go and just blend in with the crowd 
 
 he seized shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shoppers plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadgets 
 
 here we go said moody a moment later 
 
 they had arrived outside a large department store called purge dowse ltd the place had a shabby miserable air the window displays consisted of a few chipped dummies with their wigs askew standing at random and modelling fashions at least ten years out of date large signs on all the dusty doors read closed for refurbishment harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bags say to her friend as they passed never open that place 
 
 right said tonks beckoning them towards a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly female dummy its false eyelashes were hanging off and it was modelling a green nylon pinafore dress everybody ready 
 
 they nodded clustering around her moody gave harry another shove between the shoulder blades to urge him forward and tonks leaned close to the glass looking up at the very ugly dummy her breath steaming up the glass wotcher she said here to see arthur weasley 
 
 harry thought how absurd it was for tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking so quietly through a sheet of glass with buses rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shoppers then he reminded himself that dummies hear anyway next second his mouth opened in shock as the dummy gave a tiny nod and beckoned with its jointed finger and tonks had seized ginny and mrs weasley by the elbows stepped right through the glass and vanished 
 
 fred george and ron stepped after them harry glanced around at the jostling crowd not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window displays as ugly as those of purge dowse ltd nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them 
 
 growled moody giving harry yet another poke in the back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water emerging quite warm and dry on the other side 
 
 there was no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood they were in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where rows of witches and wizards sat upon rickety wooden chairs some looking perfectly normal and perusing copies of witch weekly others sporting gruesome disfigurements such as elephant trunks or extra hands sticking out of their chests the room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises a witch in the centre of the front row who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the daily prophet kept letting off a whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth a warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and with each clang his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady 
 
 witches and wizards in robes were walking up and down the rows asking questions and making notes on clipboards like harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chests a wand and bone crossed 
 
 are they doctors he asked ron quietly 
 
 doctors said ron looking startled those muggle nutters that cut people up nah healers 
 
 over here called mrs weasley above the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked wall behind her was covered in notices and posters saying things like a clean cauldron keeps potions from becoming poisons and antidotes are unless approved by a qualified healer there was also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlets which was labelled 
 
 dilys derwent 
 
 st healer 
 
 headmistress of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 
 
 dilys was eyeing the weasley party closely as though counting them when harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink walked sideways out of her portrait and vanished 
 
 meanwhile at the front of the queue a young wizard was performing an odd jig and trying in between yelps of pain to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk 
 
 these ouchshoes my brother gave meowthey re eating myouchfeetlook at them there must be some kind ofaarghjinx on them and i aaaaarghget them off he hopped from one foot to the other as though dancing on hot coals 
 
 the shoes prevent you reading do they said the blonde witch irritably pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk you want spell damage fourth floor just like it says on the floor guide next 
 
 as the wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way the weasley party moved forward a few steps and harry read the floor guide

 if you are unsure where to go incapable of normal speech or unable to remember why you are here our welcomewitch will be pleased to help 
 
 a very old stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now here to see broderick bode he wheezed 
 
 ward but afraid wasting your time said the witch dismissively completely addled you knowstill thinks a teapot next 
 
 a wizard was holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large feathery wings that had sprouted right out through the back of her romper suit 
 
 fourth floor said the witch in a bored voice without asking and the man disappeared through the double doors beside the desk holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon next 
 
 mrs weasley moved forward to the desk 
 
 hello she said my husband arthur weasley was supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning could you tell us 
 
 arthur weasley said the witch running her finger down a long list in front of her yes first floor second door on the right dai llewellyn ward 
 
 thank you said mrs weasley come on you lot 
 
 they followed her through the double doors and along the narrow corridor beyond which was lined with more portraits of famous healers and lit by crystal bubbles full of candles that floated up on the ceiling looking like giant soapsuds more witches and wizards in robes walked in and out of the doors they passed a yellow gas wafted into the passageway as they passed one door and every now and then they heard distant wailing they climbed a flight of stairs and entered the injuries corridor where the second door on the right bore the words dangerous dai llewellyn ward serious this was a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten hippocrates smethwyck trainee healer augustus pye 
 
 wait outside molly tonks said arthur want too many visitors at once it ought to be just the family first 
 
 growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall his magical eye spinning in all directions harry drew back too but mrs weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door saying be silly harry arthur wants to thank you 
 
 the ward was small and rather dingy as the only window was narrow and set high in the wall facing the door most of the light came from more shining crystal bubbles clustered in the middle of the ceiling the walls were of panelled oak and there was a portrait of a rather wizard on the wall captioned urquhart rackharrow inventor of the curse 
 
 there were only three patients mr weasley was occupying the bed at the far end oi the ward beside the tiny window harry was pleased and relieved to see that he was propped up on several pillows and reading the daily prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling on to his bed he looked up as they walked towards him and seeing who it was beamed 
 
 hello he called throwing the prophet aside bill just left molly had to get back to work but he says drop in on you later 
 
 how are you arthur asked mrs weasley bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face still looking a bit peaky 
 
 i feel absolutely fine said mr weasley brightly holding out his good arm to give ginny a hug if they could only take the bandages off be fit to go home 
 
 why they take them off dad asked fred 
 
 well i start bleeding like mad every time they try said mr weasley cheerfully reaching across for his wand which lay on his bedside cabinet and waving it so that six extra chairs appeared at his bedside to seat them all it seems there was some rather unusual kind of poison in that fangs that keeps wounds open sure find an antidote though they say had much worse cases than mine and in the meantime i just have to keep taking a potion every hour but that fellow over there he said dropping his voice and nodding towards the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling bitten by a werewolf poor chap no cure at all 
 
 a werewolf whispered mrs weasley looking alarmed is he safe in a public ward he be in a private room 
 
 two weeks till full moon mr weasley reminded her quietly been talking to him this morning the healers you know trying to persuade him be able to lead an almost normal life i said to mention names of course but i said i knew a werewolf personally very nice man who finds the condition quite easy to manage 
 
 what did he say asked george 
 
 said give me another bite if i shut up said mr weasley sadly and that woman over there he indicated the only other occupied bed which was right beside the door tell the healers what bit her which makes us all think it must have been something she was handling illegally whatever it was took a real chunk out of her leg very nasty smell when they take off the dressings 
 
 so you going to tell us what happened dad asked fred pulling his chair closer to the bed 
 
 well you already know you said mr weasley with a significant smile at harry very had a very long day dozed off got sneaked up on and bitten 
 
 is it in the prophet you being attacked asked fred indicating the newspaper mr weasley had cast aside 
 
 no of course not said mr weasley with a slightly bitter smile the ministry want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got 
 
 arthur mrs weasley warned him 
 
 goter me mr weasley said hastily though harry was quite sure that was not what he had meant to say 
 
 so where were you when it happened dad asked george 
 
 my business said mr weasley though with a small smile he snatched up the daily prophet shook it open again and said i was just reading about willy arrest when you arrived you know willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilets back in the summer one of his jinxes backfired the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in 
 
 when you say you were on duty fred interrupted in a low voice what were you doing 
 
 you heard your father whispered mrs weasley we are not discussing this here go on about willy widdershins arthur 
 
 well ask me how but he actually got off the toilet charge said mr weasley grimly i can only suppose gold changed hands 
 
 you were guarding it you said george quietly the weapon the thing after 
 
 george be quiet snapped mrs weasley 
 
 anyway said mr weasley in a raised voice this time been caught selling biting doorknobs to muggles and i think be able to worm his way out of it because according to this article two muggles have lost fingers and are now in st for emergency bone and memory modification just think of it muggles in st i wonder which ward in 
 
 and he looked eagerly around as though hoping to see a signpost 
 
 you say got a snake harry asked fred looking at his father for a reaction a massive one you saw it the night he returned you 
 
 enough said mrs weasley crossly and tonks are outside arthur they want to come and see you and you lot can wait outside she added to her children and harry you can come and say goodbye afterwards go on 
 
 they trooped back into the corridor and tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them fred raised his eyebrows 
 
 fine he said coolly rummaging in his pockets be like that tell us anything 
 
 looking for these said george holding out what looked like a tangle of string 
 
 you read my mind said fred grinning see if st puts imperturbable charms on its ward doors shall we 
 
 he and george disentangled the string and separated five extendable ears from each other fred and george handed them around harry hesitated to take one 
 
 go on harry take it you saved life if got the right to eavesdrop on him you 
 
 grinning in spite of himself harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done 
 
 ok go fred whispered 
 
 the strings wriggled like long skinny worms and snaked under the door at first harry could hear nothing then he jumped as he heard tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him 
 
 they searched the whole area but find the snake anywhere it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you arthur but have expected a snake to get in can he 
 
 i reckon he sent it as a lookout growled moody cause not had any luck so far has he no i reckon trying to get a clearer picture of what facing and if arthur been there the beast had a lot more time to look around so potter says he saw it all happen 
 
 yes said mrs weasley she sounded rather uneasy you know dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for harry to see something like this 
 
 yeah well said moody something funny about the potter kid we all know that 
 
 dumbledore seemed worried about harry when i spoke to him this morning whispered mrs weasley 
 
 course worried growled moody the seeing things from inside snake obviously potter realise what that means but if possessing him 
 
 harry pulled the extendable ear out of his own his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face he looked around at the others they were all staring at him the strings still trailing from their ears looking suddenly fearful 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter after the burialcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 patches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turrets but these signs of approaching summer did not lift mood he had been thwarted both in his attempts to find out what malfoy was doing and in his efforts to start a conversation with slughorn that might lead somehow to slughorn handing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades 
 
 for the last time just forget about malfoy hermione told harry firmly 
 
 they were sitting with ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch hermione and ron were both clutching a ministry of magic leaflet common apparition mistakes and how to avoid them for they were taking their tests that very afternoon but by and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves ron gave a start and tried to hide behind hermione as a girl came around the corner 
 
 it lavender said hermione wearily 
 
 oh good said ron relaxing 
 
 harry potter said the girl i was asked to give you this 
 
 thanks 
 
 heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment once the girl was out of earshot he said dumbledore said we be having any more lessons until i got the memory 
 
 maybe he wants to check on how doing suggested hermione as harry unrolled the parchment but rather than finding long narrow slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment where the ink had run 
 
 dear harry ron and hermione 
 
 aragog died last night harry and ron you met him and you know how special he was hermione i know have liked him it would mean a lot to me if nip down for the burial later this evening planning on doing it round dusk that was his favorite time of day i know not supposed to be out that late but you can use the cloak ask but i face it alone 
 
 hagrid 
 
 look at this said harry handing the note to hermione 
 
 oh for sake she said scanning it quickly and passing it to ron who read it through looking increasingly incredulous 
 
 mental he said furiously that thing told its mates to eat harry and me told them to help themselves and now hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body 
 
 not just that said hermione asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows a million times tighter and how much trouble be in if we were caught 
 
 been down to see him by night before said harry 
 
 yes but for something like this said hermione risked a lot to help hagrid out but after dead if it were a question of saving him 
 
 want to go even less said ron firmly you meet him hermione believe me being dead will have improved him a lot 
 
 harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it tears had clearly fallen thick and fast upon the parchment 
 
 harry you be thinking of going said hermione such a pointless thing to get detention for 
 
 harry sighed 
 
 yeah i know he said i have to bury aragog without us 
 
 yes he will said hermione looking relieved look potions will be almost empty this afternoon with us all off doing our tests try and soften slughorn up a bit then 
 
 time lucky you think said harry bitterly 
 
 lucky said ron suddenly harry itget lucky 
 
 what mean 
 
 use your lucky potion 
 
 ron it said hermione sounding stunned of course why i think of it 
 
 harry stared at them both felix felicis he said i dunno i was sort of saving it 
 
 what for demanded ron incredulously 
 
 what on earth is more important than this memory harry asked hermione 
 
 harry did not answer the thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time vague and unformulated plans that involved ginny splitting up with dean and ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend had been fermenting in the depths of his brain unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking 
 
 harry are you still with us asked hermione 
 
 wha yeah of course he said pulling himself together well okay if i get slughorn to talk this afternoon take some felix and have another go this evening 
 
 decided then said hermione briskly getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette destination determination deliberation she murmured 
 
 oh stop that ron begged her i feel sick enough as it isquick hide me 
 
 it lavender said hermione impatiently as another couple of girls appeared in the courtyard and ron dived behind her 
 
 cool said ron peering over shoulder to check blimey they look happy do they 
 
 the montgomery sisters and of course they look happy you hear what happened to their little brother said hermione 
 
 losing track of happening to relatives to be honest said ron 
 
 well their brother was attacked by a werewolf the rumor is that their mother refused to help the death eaters anyway the boy was only five and he died in st they save him 
 
 he died repeated harry shocked but surely werewolves kill they just turn you into one of them 
 
 they sometimes kill said ron who looked unusually grave now heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away 
 
 what was the name said harry quickly 
 
 well the rumor is that it was that fenrir greyback said hermione 
 
 i knew itthe maniac who likes attacking kids the one lupin told me about said harry angrily 
 
 hermione looked at him bleakly 
 
 harry got to get that memory she said all about stopping voldemort it these dreadful things that are happening are all down to him 
 
 the bell rang overhead in the castle and both hermione and ron jumped to their feet looking terrified 
 
 do fine harry told them both as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their apparition test good luck 
 
 and you too said hermione with a significant look as harry headed off to the dungeons 
 
 there were only three of them in potions that afternoon harry ernie and draco malfoy 
 
 all too young to apparate just yet said slughorh genially not turned seventeen yet 
 
 they shook their heads 
 
 ah well said slughorn cheerily as so few do something fun i want you all to brew me up something amusing 
 
 that sounds good sir said ernie sycophantically rubbing his hands together malfoy on the other hand did not crack a smile 
 
 what do you mean something amusing he said irritably 
 
 oh surprise me said slughorn airily 
 
 malfoy opened his copy of advanced with a sulky expression it could not have been plainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of time undoubtedly harry thought watching him over the top of his own book malfoy was begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending in the room of requirement 
 
 was it his imagination or did malfoy like tonks look thinner certainly he looked paler his skin still had that grayish tinge probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days but there was no air of smugness excitement or superiority none of the swagger that he had had on the hogwarts express when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by voldemort there could be only one conclusion in opinion the mission whatever it was was going badly 
 
 cheered by this thought harry skimmed through his copy of advanced and found a heavily corrected version of an elixir to induce euphoria which seemed not only to meet instructions but which might heart leapt as the thought struck him put slughorn into such a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over that memory if harry could persuade him to taste some 
 
 well now this looks absolutely wonderful said slughorn an hour and a half later clapping his hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of cauldron euphoria i take it and that i smell mmmm added just a sprig of peppermint you unorthodox but what a stroke of inspiration harry of course that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and i really know where you get these brain waves my boy unless 
 
 harry pushed the book deeper into his bag with his foot 
 
 just your genes coming out in you 
 
 oh yeah maybe said harry relieved 
 
 ernie was looking rather grumpy determined to outshine harry for once he had most rashly invented his own potion which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron malfoy was already packing up slughorn had pronounced his hiccuping solution merely passable 
 
 the bell rang and both ernie and malfoy left at once sir harry began but slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and harry he hurried away as fast as he could 
 
 professorprofessor you want to taste my po called harry desperately 
 
 but slughorn had gone disappointed harry emptied the cauldron packed up his things left the dungeon and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room 
 
 ron and hermione returned in the late afternoon 
 
 harry cried hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole harry i passed 
 
 well done he said and ron 
 
 hehe just failed whispered hermione as ron came slouching into the room looking most morose it was really unlucky a tiny thing the examiner just spotted that left half an eyebrow behind how did it go with slughorn 
 
 no joy said harry as ron joined them bad luck mate but pass next timewe can take it together 
 
 yeah i said ron grumpily but half an eyebrow like that matters 
 
 i know said hermione soothingly it does seem really harsh 
 
 they spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the apparition examiner and ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room now discussing the continuing problem of slughorn and the memory 
 
 so harryyou going to use the felix felicis or what ron demanded 
 
 yeah i better said harry i reckon need all of it not hours worth it take all night just take a mouthful two or three hours should do it 
 
 a great feeling when you take it said ron reminiscently like you do anything wrong 
 
 what are you talking about said hermione laughing never taken any 
 
 yeah but i thought i had i said ron as though explaining the obvious same difference really 
 
 as they had only just seen slughorn enter the great hall and knew that he liked to take time over meals they lingered for a while in the common room the plan being that harry should go to slughorn s office once the teacher had had time to get back there when the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the forbidden forest they decided the moment had come and after checking carefully that neville dean and seamus were all in the common room sneaked up to the boys dormitory 
 
 harry took out the socks at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny gleaming bottle 
 
 well here goes said harry and he raised the little bottle and look a carefully measured gulp 
 
 what does it feel like whispered hermione 
 
 harry did not answer for a moment then slowly but surely an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him he felt as though he could have done anything anything at all and getting the memory from slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible but positively easy 
 
 he got to his feet smiling brimming with confidence 
 
 excellent he said really excellent right going down to 
 
 what said ron and hermione together looking aghast 
 
 no got to go and see slughorn remember said hermione 
 
 no said harry confidently going to got a good feeling about going to 
 
 got a good feeling about burying a giant spider asked ron looking stunned 
 
 yeah said harry pulling his invisibility cloak out of his bag i feel like the place to be tonight you know what i mean 
 
 no said ron and hermione together both looking positively alarmed now 
 
 this is felix felicis i suppose said hermione anxiously holding up the bottle to the light you got another little bottle full of i know 
 
 essence of insanity suggested ron as harry swung his cloak over his shoulders 
 
 harry laughed and ron and hermione looked even more alarmed 
 
 trust me he said i know what doing or at least he strolled confidently to the door felix does 
 
 he pulled the invisibility cloak over his head and set off down the stairs ron and hermione hurrying along behind him at the foot of the stairs harry slid through the open door 
 
 what were you doing up there with her shrieked lavender brown staring right through harry at ron and hermione emerging together from the boys dormitories harry heard ron spluttering behind him as he darted across the room away from them 
 
 getting through the portrait hole was simple as he approached it ginny and dean came through it and harry was able to slip between them as he did so he brushed accidentally against ginny 
 
 push me please dean she said sounding annoyed always doing that i can get through perfectly well on my own 
 
 the portrait swung closed behind harry but not before he had heard dean make an angry retort his feeling of elation increasing harry strode off through the castle he did not have to creep along for he met nobody on his way but this did not surprise him in the slightest this evening he was the luckiest person at hogwarts 
 
 why he knew that going to was the right thing to do he had no idea it was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time he could not see the final destination he could not see where slughorn came in but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory when he reached the entrance hall he saw that filch had forgotten to lock the front door beaming harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk 
 
 it was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to it was not strictly on the way but it seemed clear to harry that this was a whim on which he should act so he directed his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch where he was pleased but not altogether surprised to find professor slughorn in conversation with professor sprout harry lurked behind a low stone wall feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation 
 
 i do thank you for taking the time pomona slughorn was saying courteously most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight 
 
 oh i quite agree said professor sprout warmly that enough for you 
 
 plenty plenty said slughorn who harry saw was carrying an armful of leafy plants this should allow for a few leaves for each of my and some to spare if anybody them well good evening to you and many thanks again 
 
 professor sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses and slughorn directed his steps to the spot where harry stood invisible 
 
 seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself harry pulled off the cloak with a flourish 
 
 good evening professor 
 
 beard harry you made me jump said slughorn stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary how did you get out of the castle 
 
 i think filch forgotten to lock the doors said harry cheerfully and was delighted to see slughorn scowl 
 
 be reporting that man more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me but why are you out then harry 
 
 well sir hagrid said harry who knew that the right thing to do just now was to tell the truth pretty upset but you tell anyone professor i want trouble for him 
 
 curiosity was evidently aroused 
 
 well i promise that he said gruffly but i know that dumbledore trusts hagrid to the hilt so sure he be up to anything very dreadful 
 
 well this giant spider had it for years it lived in the forest it could talk and everything 
 
 i heard rumors there were acromantula in the forest said slughorn softly looking over at the mass of black trees true then 
 
 yes said harry but this one aragog the first one hagrid ever got it died last night devastated he wants company while he buries it and i said go 
 
 touching touching said slughorn absentmindedly his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of cabin but acromantula venom is very valuable if the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out of course i want to do anything insensitive if hagrid is upset but if there was any way to procure some i mean almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while alive 
 
 slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than harry now 
 
 seems an awful waste not to collect it might get a hundred galleons a pint to be frank my salary is not large 
 
 and now harry saw clearly what was to be done 
 
 well he said with a most convincing hesitancy well if you wanted to come professor hagrid would probably be really pleased give aragog a better you know 
 
 yes of course said slughorn his eyes now gleaming with enthusiasm i tell you what harry meet you down there with a bottle or two drink the poor not healthbut send it off in style anyway once buried and change my tie this one is a little exuberant for the occasion 
 
 he bustled back into the castle and harry sped off to delighted with himself 
 
 yeh came croaked hagrid when he opened the door and saw harry emerging from the invisibility cloak in front of him 
 
 yeahron and hermione though said harry really sorry 
 
 matter bin touched here though harry 
 
 hagrid gave a great sob he had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish and his eyes were puffy red and swollen harry patted him consolingly on the elbow which was the highest point of hagrid he could easily reach 
 
 where are we burying him he asked the forest 
 
 blimey no said hagrid wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his shirt the other spiders won let me anywhere near their webs now gone turns out it was only on his orders they didn eat me can yeh believe that harry 
 
 the honest answer was yes harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and ron had come with the aeromantulas they had been quite clear that aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating hagrid 
 
 never bin an area o the forest i couldn go before said hagrid shaking his head it wasn easy gettin body out o there i can tell yehthey usually eat their dead see but i wanted ter give im a nice burial a proper 
 
 he broke into sobs again and harry resumed the patting of his elbow saying as he did so for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do professor slughorn met me coming down here hagrid 
 
 not in trouble are yeh said hagrid looking up alarmed yeh shouldn be outta the castle in the evenin i know it my fault 
 
 no no when he heard what i was doing he said like to come and pay his last respects to aragog too said harry gone to change into something more suitable i think and he said bring some bottles so we can drink to memory 
 
 did he said hagrid looking both astonished and touched righ nice of him that is an not turnin yeh in either never really had a lot ter do with horace slughorn before comin ter see old aragog off though eh well liked that aragog would 
 
 harry thought privately that what aragog would have liked most about slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided but he merely moved to the rear window of hut where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside its legs curled and tangled 
 
 are we going to bury him here hagrid in your garden 
 
 jus beyond the pumpkin patch i thought said hagrid in a choked voice already dug the yeh knowgrave jus thought say a few nice things over himhappy memories yeh know 
 
 his voice quivered and broke there was a knock on the door and he turned to answer it blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so slughorn hurried over the threshold several bottles in his arms and wearing a somber black cravat 
 
 hagrid he said in a deep grave voice so very sorry to hear of your loss 
 
 very nice of yeh said hagrid thanks a lot an thanks fer not givin harry detention neither 
 
 have dreamed of it said slughorn sad night sad night where is the poor creature 
 
 out here said hagrid in a shaking voice shall weshall we do it then 
 
 the three of them stepped out into the back garden the moon was glistening palely through the trees now and its rays mingled with the light spilling from window to illuminate body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a mound of freshly dug earth 
 
 magnificent said slughorn approaching the head where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge curved pincers shone motionless in the moonlight harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as slughorn bent over the pincers apparently examining the enormous hairy head 
 
 not appreciates how they are said hagrid to back tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes i didn know yeh were interested in creatures like aragog horace 
 
 interested my dear hagrid i revere them said slughorn stepping back from the body harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak though hagrid mopping his eyes once more noticed nothing now shall we proceed to the burial 
 
 hagrid nodded and moved forward he heaved the gigantic spider into his arms and with an enormous grunt rolled it into the dark pit it hit the bottom with a rather horrible crunchy thud hagrid started to cry again 
 
 of course difficult for you who knew him best said slughorn who like harry could reach no higher than elbow but patted it all the same why i say a few words 
 
 he must have got a lot of good quality venom from aragog harry thought for slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said in a slow impressive voice farewell aragog king of arachnids whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you forget though your body will decay your spirit lingers on in the quiet places of your forest home may your descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained 
 
 tha wa tha wa howled hagrid and he collapsed onto the compost heap crying harder than ever 
 
 there there said slughorn waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell with a muffled sort of crash onto the dead spider forming a smooth mound lets get inside and have a drink get on his other side harry it up you come hagrid well done 
 
 they deposited hagrid in a chair at the table fang who had been skulking in his basket during the burial now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into lap as usual slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought 
 
 i have had it all tested for poison he assured harry pouring most of the first bottle into one of mugs and handing it to hagrid had a taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend rupert 
 
 harry saw in his eye the expression on face if she ever heard about this abuse of and decided never to mention it to her 
 
 one for harry said slughorn dividing a second bottle between two mugs and one for me well he raised his mug high to aragog 
 
 aragog said harry and hagrid together 
 
 both slughorn and hagrid drank deeply harry however with the way ahead illuminated for him by felix felicis knew that he must not drink so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him 
 
 i had him from an egg yeh know said hagrid morosely tiny little thing he was when he hatched bout the size of a pekingese 
 
 sweet said slughorn 
 
 used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until well 
 
 face darkened and harry knew why tom riddle had contrived to have hagrid thrown out of school blamed for opening the chamber of secrets slughorn however did not seem to be listening he was looking up at the ceiling from which a number of brass pots hung and also a long silky skein of bright white hair 
 
 not unicorn hair hagrid 
 
 oh yeah said hagrid indifferently gets pulled out of their tails they catch it on branches an stuff in the forest yeh know 
 
 but my dear chap do you know how much worth 
 
 i use it fer bindin on bandages an stuff if a creature gets in jured said hagrid shrugging dead useful very strong 
 
 slughorn took another deep draught from his mug his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now looking harry knew for more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful supply of mead crystalized pineapple and velvet smoking jackets he refilled mug and his own and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how hagrid was able to look after them all hagrid becoming expansive under the influence of the drink and flattering interest stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry 
 
 the felix felicis gave harry a little nudge at this point and he noticed that the supply of drink that slughorn had brought was running out fast harry had not yet managed to bring off the refilling charm without saying the incantation aloud but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable indeed harry grinned to himself as unnoticed by either hagrid or slughorn now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill 
 
 after an hour or so hagrid and slughorn began making extravagant toasts to hogwarts to dumbledore to wine and to 
 
 harry potter bellowed hagrid slopping some of his fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it 
 
 yes indeed cried slughorn a little thickly parry otter the chosen boy whowell something of that sort he mumbled and drained his mug too 
 
 not long after this hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon slughorn who pocketed it with cries of to friendship to generosity to ten galleons a hair 
 
 and for a while after that hagrid and slughorn were sitting side by side arms around each other singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called odo 
 
 aaargh the good die young muttered hagrid slumping low onto the table a little while slughorn continued to warble the refrain me dad was no age ter go nor were yer mum an dad harry 
 
 great fat tears oozed out of the corners of crinkled eyes again he grasped arm and shook it 
 
 bes wiz and witchard o their age i never knew terrible thing terrible thing 
 
 slughorn sang plaintively 
 
 and odo the hero they bore him back home 
 
 to the place that known as a lad 
 
 they laid him to rest with his hat inside out 
 
 and his wand snapped in two which was sad 
 
 terrible hagrid grunted and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep snoring deeply 
 
 sorry said slughorn with a hiccup carry a tune to save my life 
 
 hagrid talking about your singing said harry quietly he was talking about my mum and dad dying 
 
 oh said slughorn repressing a large belch oh dear yes that waswas terrible indeed terrible terrible 
 
 he looked quite at a loss for what to say and resorted to refilling their mugs 
 
 i suppose you remember it harry he asked awkwardly 
 
 nowell i was only one when they died said harry his eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in heavy snores but found out pretty much what happened since my dad died first did you know that 
 
 ii said slughorn in a hushed voice 
 
 yeah voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum said harry 
 
 slughorn gave a great shudder but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from face 
 
 he told her to get out of the way said harry remorselessly he told me she have died he only wanted me she could have run 
 
 oh dear breathed slughorn she could have she awful 
 
 it is it said harry in a voice barely more than a whisper but she move dad was already dead but she want me to go too she tried to plead with voldemort but he just laughed 
 
 enough said slughorn suddenly raising a shaking hand really my dear boy enough an old man i need to hear i want to hear 
 
 i forgot lied harry felix felicis leading him on you liked her you 
 
 liked her said slughorn his eyes brimming with tears once more i imagine anyone who met her have liked her very brave very funny it was the most horrible thing 
 
 but you help her son said harry she gave me her life but you give me a memory 
 
 rumbling snores filled the cabin harry looked steadily into eyes the potions master seemed unable to look away 
 
 say that he whispered it a question if it were to help you of course but no purpose can be serve 
 
 it can said harry clearly dumbledore needs information i need information 
 
 he knew he was safe felix was telling him that slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning looking slughorn straight in the eye harry leaned forward a little 
 
 i am the chosen one i have to kill him i need that memory 
 
 slughorn turned paler than ever his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat 
 
 you are the chosen one 
 
 of course i am said harry calmly 
 
 but the my dear boy asking a great deal asking me in fact to aid you in your attempt to destroy 
 
 you want to get rid of the wizard who killed lily evans 
 
 harry harry of course i do but 
 
 scared find out you helped me 
 
 slughorn said nothing he looked terrified 
 
 be brave like my mother professor 
 
 slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby 
 
 i am not proud he whispered through his fingers i am ashamed of whatof what that memory shows i think i may have done great damage that day 
 
 cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory said harry it would be a very brave and noble thing to do 
 
 hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on slughorn and harry stared at each other over the guttering candle there was a long long silence but felix felicis told harry not to break it to wait 
 
 then very slowly slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand he put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small empty bottle still looking into eyes slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it so that a long silver thread of memory came away too clinging to the wand tip longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung silvery bright from the wand slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled then spread swirling like gas he corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to harry 
 
 thank you very much professor 
 
 a good boy said professor slughorn tears trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus mustache and got her eyes just think too badly of me once seen it 
 
 and he too put his head on his arms gave a deep sigh and fell asleep 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter the deathly hallowscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry fell panting onto grass and scrambled up at once they seemed to have landed in the corner of a field at dusk hermione was already running in a circle around them waving her wand 
 
 protego totalumsalvio hexia 
 
 that treacherous old bleeder ron panted emerging from beneath the invisibility cloak and throwing it to harry hermione youre a genius a total genius i cant believe we got out of that 
 
 cave inimicumdidnt i say it was a frumpent horn didnt i tell him and now his house has been blown apart 
 
 serves him right said ron examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs whatd you reckon theyll do to him 
 
 oh i hope they dont kill him groaned hermione thats why i wanted the death eaters to get a glimpse of harry before we left so they knew xenophilius hadnt been lying 
 
 why hide me though asked ron 
 
 youre supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt ron theyve kidnapped luna because her father supported harry what would happen to your family if they knew youre with him 
 
 but what about your mum and dad 
 
 theyre in australia said hermione they should be all right they dont know anything 
 
 youre a genius ron repeated looking awed 
 
 yeah you are hermione agreed harry fervently i dont know what wed do without you 
 
 she beamed but became solemn at once 
 
 what about luna 
 
 well if theyre telling the truth and shes still alive c began ron 
 
 dont say that dont say it squealed hermione she must be alive she must 
 
 then shell be in azkaban i expect said ron whether she survives the place thoughloads dont 
 
 she will said harry he could not bear to contemplate the alternative shes tough luna much tougher than youd think shes probably teaching all the inmates about wrackspurts and nargles 
 
 i hope youre right said hermione she passed a hand over her eyes id feel so sorry for xenophilius if c 
 
 c if he hadnt just tried to sell us to the death eaters yeah said ron 
 
 they put up the tent and retreated inside it where ron made them tea after their narrow escape the chilly musty old place felt like home safe familiar and friendly 
 
 oh why did we go there groaned hermione after a few minutes silence harry you were right it was godrics hollow all over again a complete waste of time the deathly hallowssuch rubbishalthough actually a sudden thought seemed to have struck her he might have made it all up mightnt he he probably doesnt believe in the deathly hallows at all he just wanted to keep us talking until the death eaters arrived 
 
 i dont think so said ron its a damn sight harder making stuff up when youre under stress than youd think i found that out when the snatchers caught me it was much easier pretending to be stan because i knew a bit about him than inventing a whole new person old lovegood was under loads of pressure trying to make sure we stayed put i reckon he told us the truth or what he thinks is the truth just to keep us talking 
 
 well i dont suppose it matters sighed hermione even if he was being honest i never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life 
 
 hang on though said ron the chamber of secrets was supposed to be a myth wasnt it 
 
 but the deathly hallows cant exist ron 
 
 you keep saying that but one of them can said ron harrys invisibility cloak c 
 
 the tale of the three brothers is a story said hermione firmly a story about how humans are frightened of death if surviving was as simple as hiding under the invisibility cloak wed have everything we need already 
 
 i dont know we could do with an unbeatable wand said harry turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers 
 
 theres no such thing harry 
 
 you said there have been loads of wands c the deathstick and whatever they were called c 
 
 all right even if you want to kid yourself the elder wands real what about the resurrection stone her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name and her tone dripped sarcasm no magic can raise the dead and thats that 
 
 when my wand connected with it made my mum and dad appearand cedric 
 
 but they werent really back from the dead were they said hermione those kind of cof pale imitations arent the same as truly bringing someone back to life 
 
 but she the girl in the tale didnt really come back did she the story says that once people are dead they belong with the dead but the second brother still got to see her and talk to her didnt he he even lived with her for a while 
 
 he saw concern and something less easily definable in hermiones expression then as she glanced at ron harry realized that it was fear he had scared her with his talk of living with dead people 
 
 so that peverell bloke whos buried in godrics hollow he said hastily trying to sound robustly sane you dont know anything about him then 
 
 no she replied looking relieved at the change of subject i looked him up after i saw the mark on his grave if hed been anyone famous or done anything important im sure hed be in one of our books the only place ive managed to find the name peverell is natures nobility a wizarding genealogy i borrowed it from kreacher she explained as ron raised his eyebrows it lists the families that are now extinct in the male line apparently the peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish 
 
 extinct in the male line repeated ron 
 
 it means the name died out said hermione centuries ago in the case of the peverells they could still have descendents though theyd just be called something different 
 
 and then it came to harry in one shining piece the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name peverell a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a ministry official and he cried aloud marvolo gaunt 
 
 sorry said ron and hermione together 
 
 marvolo gaunt grandfather in the pensieve with dumbledore marvolo gaunt said he was descended from the peverells 
 
 ron and hermione looked bewildered 
 
 the ring the ring that became the horcrux marvolo gaunt said it had the peverell coat of arms on it i saw him waving it in the bloke from the ministrys face he nearly shoved it up his nose 
 
 the peverell coat of arms said hermione sharply could you see what it looked like 
 
 not really said harry trying to remember there was nothing fancy on there as far as i could see maybe a few scratches i only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open 
 
 harry saw hermiones comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes ron was looking from one to the other astonished 
 
 blimeyyou reckon it was this sign again the sign of the hallows 
 
 why not said harry excitedly marvolo gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig all he cared about was his ancestry if that ring had been passed down through the centuries he might not have known what it really was there were no books in that house and trust me he wasnt the type to read fairy tales to his kids hed have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms because as far as he was concerned having pure blood made you practically royal 
 
 yesand thats all very interesting said hermione cautiously but harry if youre thinking what i think youre think c 
 
 well why not why not said harry abandoning caution it was a stone wasnt it he looked at ron for support what if it was the resurrection stone 
 
 rons mouth fell open 
 
 blimey c but would it still work if dumbledore broke c 
 
 work work ron it never worked theres no such thing as a resurrection stone 
 
 hermione leapt to her feet looking exasperated and angry harry youre trying to fit everything into the hallows story c 
 
 fit everything in he repeated hermione it fits of its own accord i know the sign of the deathly hallows was on that stone gaunt said he was descended from the peverells 
 
 a minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly 
 
 whered you reckon the ring is now ron asked harry what did dumbledore do with it after he broke it open 
 
 but harrys imagination was racing ahead far beyond ron and hermiones 
 
 three objects or hallows which if united will make the possessor master of deathmasterconquerorvanquisherthe last enemy that shall be destroyed is death 
 
 and he saw himself possessor of the hallows facing voldemort whose horcruxes were no matchneither can live while the other surviveswas this the answer hallows versus horcruxes was there a way after all to ensure that he was the one who triumphed if he were the master of the deathly hallows would he be safe 
 
 harry 
 
 but he scarcely heard hermione he had pulled out his invisibility cloak and was running it through his fingers the cloth supple as water light as air he had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the wizarding world the cloak was exactly what xenophilius had described a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible and endures eternally giving constant and impenetrable concealment no matter what spells are cast at it 
 
 and then with a gasp he remembered c 
 
 dumbledore had my cloak the night my parents died 
 
 his voice shook and he could feel the color in his face but he did not care 
 
 my mum told sirius that dumbledore borrowed the cloak this is why he wanted to examine it because he thought it was the third hallow ignotus peverell is buried in godrics hollow harry was walking blindly around the tent feeling as though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him hes my ancestor im descended from the third brother it all makes sense 
 
 he felt armed in certainty in his belief in the hallows as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two 
 
 harry said hermione again but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck his fingers shaking hard 
 
 read it he told her pushing his mothers letter into her hand read it dumbledore had the cloak hermione why else would he want it he didnt need a cloak he could perform a disillusionment charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one 
 
 something fell to the floor and rolled glittering under a chair he had dislodged the snitch when he pulled out the letter he stooped to pick it up and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out 
 
 its in here he left me the ring c its in the snitch 
 
 you c you reckon 
 
 he could not understand why ron looked taken aback it was so obvious so clear to harry everything fit everythinghis cloak was the third hallow and when he discovered how to open the snitch he would have the second and then all he needed to do was find the first hallow the elder wand and then c 
 
 but it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage all his excitement all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke and he stood alone in the darkness and the glorious spell was broken 
 
 thats what hes after 
 
 the change in his voice made ron and hermione look even more scared 
 
 after the elder wand 
 
 he turned his back on their strained incredulous faces he knew it was the truth it all made sense voldemort was not seeking a new wand he was seeking an old wand a very old wand indeed harry walked to the entrance of the tent forgetting about ron and hermione as he looked out into the night thinking 
 
 voldemort had been raised in a muggle orphanage nobody could have told him the tales of beedle the bard when he was a child any more than harry had heard them hardly any wizards believed in the deathly hallows was it likely that voldemort knew about them 
 
 harry gazed into the darknessif voldemort had known about the deathly hallows surely he would have sought them done anything to possess them three objects that made the possessor master of death if he had known about the deathly hallows he might not have needed horcruxes in the first place didnt the simple fact that he had taken a hallow and turned it into a horcrux demonstrate that he did not know this last great wizarding secret 
 
 which meant that voldemort sought the elder wand without realizing its full power without understanding that it was one of threefor the wand was the hallow that could not be hidden whose existence was best knownthe bloody trail of the elder wand is splattered across the pages of wizarding history 
 
 harry watched the cloudy sky curves of and silver sliding over the face of the white moon he felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries 
 
 he turned back into the tent it was a shock to see ron and hermione standing exactly where he had left them hermione still holding lilys letter ron at her side looking slightly anxious didnt they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes 
 
 this is it harry said trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty this explains everything the deathly hallows are real and ive got one c maybe two c 
 
 he held up the snitch 
 
 c and chasing the third but he doesnt realizehe just thinks its a powerful wand c 
 
 harry said hermione moving across to him and handing him back lilys letter im sorry but i think youve got this wrong all wrong 
 
 but dont you see it all fits c 
 
 not it doesnt she said it doesnt harry youre just getting carried away please she said as she started to speak please just answer me this if the deathly hallows really existed and dumbledore knew about them knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of death c harry why wouldnt he have told you why 
 
 he had his answer ready 
 
 but you said it hermione youve got to find out about them for yourself its a quest 
 
 but i only said that to try and persuade you to come to the lovegoods cried hermione in exasperation i didnt really believe it 
 
 harry took no notice 
 
 dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself he let me try my strength take risks this feels like the kind of thing hed do 
 
 harry this isnt a game this isnt practice this is the real thing and dumbledore left you very clear instructions find and destroy the horcruxes that symbol doesnt mean anything forget the deathly hallows we cant afford to get sidetracked c 
 
 harry was barely listening to her he was turning the snitch over and over in his hands half expecting it to break open to reveal the resurrection stone to prove to hermione that he was right that the deathly hallows were real 
 
 she appealed to ron 
 
 you dont believe in this do you 
 
 harry looked up ron hesitated 
 
 i dunnoi meanbits of it sort of fit together said ron awkwardly but when you look at the whole thing he took a deep breath i think were supposed to get rid of horcruxes harry thats what dumbledore told us to do maybemaybe we should forget about this hallows business 
 
 thank you ron said hermione ill take first watch 
 
 and she strode past harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to a fierce full stop 
 
 but harry hardly slept that night the idea of the deathly hallows had taken possession of him and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind the wand the stone and the cloak if he could just possess them all 
 
 i open at the closebut what was the close why couldnt he have the stone now if only he had the stone he could ask dumbledore these questions in personand harry murmured words to the snitch in the darkness trying everything even parseltongue but the golden ball would not open 
 
 and the wand the elder wand where was that hidden where was voldemort searching now harry wished his scar would burn and show him voldemorts thoughts because for the first time ever he and voldemort were united in wanting the very same thinghermione would not like that idea of coursebut then she did not had been right in a waylimited narrow the truth was that she was scared of the idea of the deathly hallows especially of the resurrection stoneand harry pressed his mouth again to the snitch kissing it nearly swallowing it but the cold medal did not yield 
 
 it was nearly dawn when he remembered luna alone in a cell in azkaban surrounded by dementors and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself he had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the hallows if only they could rescue her but dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable now he came to think about it he had not tried casting a patronus with the blackthorn wandhe must try that in the morning 
 
 if only there was a way of getting a better wand 
 
 and desire for the elder wand the deathstick unbeatable invincible swallowed him once more 
 
 
 
 
 they packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain the downpour pursued them to the coast where they pitched the tent that night and persisted through the whole week through sodden landscapes that harry found bleak and depressing he could think only of the deathly hallows it was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing not hermiones flat disbelief nor rons persistent doubts could extinguish and yet the fiercer the longing for the hallows burned inside him the less joyful it made him he blamed ron and hermione their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits but neither could erode his certainty which remained absolute harrys belief in and longing for the hallows consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their obsession with the horcruxes 
 
 obsession said hermione in a low fierce voice when harry was careless enough to use the word one evening after hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more horcruxes were not the one with an obsession harry were the ones trying to do what dumbledore wanted us to do 
 
 but he was impervious to the veiled criticism dumbledore had left the sign of the hallows for hermione to decipher and he had also harry remained convinced of it left the resurrection stone hidden in the golden snitch neither can live while the other survivesmaster of deathwhy didnt ron and hermione understand 
 
 the last enemy shall be destroyed is death harry quoted calmly 
 
 i thought it was we were supposed to be fighting hermione retorted and harry gave up on her 
 
 even the mystery of the silver doe which the other two insisted on discussing seemed less important to harry now a vaguely interesting sideshow the only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two he sought solitude whenever it happened but was disappointed by what he saw the visions he and voldemort were sharing had changed in quality they had become blurred shifting as though they were moving in and out of focus harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance used to images sharp as reality harry was disconcerted by the change he was worried that the connection between himself and voldemort had been damaged a connection that he both feared and whatever he had told hermione prized somehow harry connected these unsatisfying vague images with the destruction of his wand as if it was the blackthorn wands fault that he could no longer see into voldemorts mind as well as before 
 
 as the weeks crept on harry could not help but notice even through his new that ron seemed to be taking charge perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them perhaps because harrys descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action 
 
 three horcruxes left he kept saying we need a plan of action come on where havent we looked lets go through it again the orphanage 
 
 diagon alley hogwarts the riddle house borgin and burkes albania every place that they knew tom riddle had ever lived or worked visited or murdered ron and hermione raked over them again harry joining in only to stop hermione pestering him he would have been happy to sit alone in silence trying to read voldemorts thoughts to find out more about the elder wand but ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply harry was aware to keep them moving 
 
 you never know was rons constant refrain upper flagley is a wizarding village he mightve wanted to live there lets go and have a poke around 
 
 these frequent forays into wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of snatchers 
 
 some of them are supposed to be as bad as death eaters said ron the lot that got me were a bit pathetic but bill recons some of them are really dangerous they said on potterwatch c 
 
 on what said harry 
 
 potterwatch didnt i tell you thats what it was called the program i keep trying to get on the radio the only one that tells the truth about whats going on nearly all of the programs are following line all except potterwatch i really want you to hear it but its tricky tuning in 
 
 ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragonpox and once a few bars of a cauldron full of hot strong love while he taped ron continued to try to hit on the correct password muttering strings of random words under his breath 
 
 theyre normally something to do with the order he told them bill had a real knack for guessing them im bound to get one in the end 
 
 but not until march did luck favor ron at last harry was sitting in the tent entrance on guard duty staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground when ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent ive got it ive got it password was albus get in here harry 
 
 roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the deathly hallows harry hurried back inside the tent to find ron and hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio hermione who had been polishing the sword of gryffindor just for something to do was sitting staring at the tiny speaker from which a most familiar voice was issuing 
 
 apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those charming death eaters 
 
 but thats lee jordan said hermione 
 
 i know beamed ron cool eh 
 
 now found ourselves another secure location lee was saying and im pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening evening boys 
 
 hi 
 
 evening river 
 
 river thats lee ron explained theyve all got code names but you can usually tell c 
 
 shh said hermione 
 
 but before we hear from royal and romulus lee went on lets take a moment to report those deaths that the wizarding wireless network news and daily prophet dont think important enough to mention it is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of ted tonks and dirk cresswell 
 
 harry felt a sick swooping in his belly he ron and hermione gazed at one another in horror 
 
 a goblin by the name of gornuk was also killed it is believed that dean thomas and a second goblin both believed to have been traveling with tonks cresswell and gornuk may have escaped if dean is listening or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts his parents and sisters are desperate for news 
 
 meanwhile in gaddley a muggle family of five has been found dead in their home muggle authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak but members of the order of the phoenix inform me that it was the killing curse c more evidence as if it were needed of the fact that muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime 
 
 finally we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of bathilda bagshot have been discovered in godrics hollow the evidence is that she died several months ago the order of the phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by dark magic 
 
 listeners id like to invite you now to join us in a minutes silence in memory of ted tonks dirk cresswell bathilda bagshot gornuk and the unnamed but no less regretted muggles murdered by the death eaters 
 
 silence fell and harry ron and hermione did not speak half of harry yearned to hear more half of him was afraid of what might come next it was the first time he had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time 
 
 thank you said lees voice and now we can return to regular contributor royal for an update on how the new wizarding order is affecting the muggle world 
 
 thanks river said an unmistakable voice deep measured reassuring 
 
 kingsley burst out ron 
 
 we know said hermione hushing him 
 
 muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties said kingsley however we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect muggle friends and neighbors often without the muggles knowledge id like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example perhaps by casting a protective charm over any muggle dwellings in your street many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken 
 
 and what would you say royal to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times it should be wizards first asked lee 
 
 id say that its one short step from wizards first to purebloods first and then to death eaters replied kingsley were all human arent we every human life is worth the same and worth saving 
 
 excellently put royal and youve got my vote for minister of magic if we ever get out of this mess said lee and now over to romulus for our popular feature pals of potter 
 
 thanks river said another very familiar voice ron started to speak but hermione forestalled him in a whisper 
 
 we know its lupin 
 
 romulus do you maintain as you have every time youve appeared on our program that harry potter is still alive 
 
 i do said lupin firmly there is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the death eaters if it had happened because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime the boy who lived remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting the triumph of good the power of innocence the need to keep resisting 
 
 a mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in harry had lupin forgiven him then for the terrible things he had said when they had last met 
 
 and what would you say to harry if you knew he was listening romulus 
 
 id tell him were all with him in spirit said lupin then hesitated slightly and id tell him to follow his instincts which are good and nearly always right 
 
 harry looked at hermione whose eyes were full of tears 
 
 nearly always right she repeated 
 
 oh didnt i tell you said ron in surprise bill told me lupins living with tonks again and apparently shes getting pretty big too 
 
 and our usual update on those friends of harry potters who are suffering for their allegiance lee was saying 
 
 well as regular listeners will know several of the more outspoken supporters of harry potter have now been imprisoned including xenophilius lovegood erstwhile editor of the quibbler said lupin 
 
 at least hes still alive muttered ron 
 
 we have also heard within the last few hours that rubeus hagrid c all three of them gasped and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence c gamekeeper at hogwarts school has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of hogwarts where he is rumored to have hosted a support harry potter party in his house however hagrid was not taken into custody and is we believe on the run 
 
 i suppose it helps when escaping from death eaters if youve got a half brother asked lee 
 
 it would tend to give you an edge agreed lupin gravely may i just add that while we here at potterwatch applaud hagrids spirit we would urge even the most devoted of harrys supporters against following hagrids lead support harry potter parties are unwise in the present climate 
 
 indeed they are romulus said lee so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to potterwatch and now lets move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as harry potter we like to refer to him as the chief death eater and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him id like to introduce a new correspondent rodent 
 
 rodent said yet another familiar voice and harry ron and hermione cried out together 
 
 fred 
 
 no c is it george 
 
 its fred i think said ron leaning in closer as whichever twin it was said im not being rodent no way i told you i wanted to be rapier 
 
 oh all right then rapier could you please give us your take on the various stories weve been hearing about the chief death eater 
 
 yes river i can said fred as our listeners will know unless theyve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic mind you if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine we must have a good nineteen running around the place 
 
 which suits him of course said kingsley the air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself 
 
 agreed said fred so people lets try and calm down a bit things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well for instance this new idea that can kill people with a single glance from his eyes thats a basilisk listeners one simple test check whether the thing thats glaring at you has got legs if it has its safe to look into its eyes although if it really is thats still likely to be the last thing you ever do 
 
 for the first time in weeks and weeks harry was laughing he could feel the weight of tension leaving him 
 
 and the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad asked lee 
 
 well who wouldnt want a nice little holiday after all the hard work hes been putting in asked fred point is people dont get lulled into a false sense of security thinking hes out of the country maybe he is maybe he isnt but the fact remains he can move faster than severus snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to so dont count on him being a long way away if youre planning to take any risks i never thought id hear myself say it but safety first 
 
 thank you very much for those wise words rapier said lee listeners that brings us to the end of another potterwatch we dont know when it will be possible to broadcast again but you can be sure we shall be back keep twiddling those dials the next password will be keep each other safe keep faith good night 
 
 the radios dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out harry ron and hermione were still beaming hearing familiar friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting voldemort it was like waking from a long sleep 
 
 good eh said ron happily 
 
 brilliant said harry 
 
 its so brave of them sighed hermione admiringly if they were found 
 
 well they keep on the move dont they said ron like us 
 
 but did you hear what fred said asked harry excitedly now the broadcast was over his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession hes abroad hes still looking for the wand i knew it 
 
 harry c 
 
 come on hermione why are you so determined not to admit it vol c 
 
 harry no 
 
 c demorts after the elder wand 
 
 the names taboo ron bellowed leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent i told you harry i told you we cant say it anymore c weve got to put the protection back around us c quickly c its how they find c 
 
 but ron stopped talking and harry knew why the sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer rough excited voices ron pulled the deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it their lamps went out 
 
 come out of there with your hands up came a rasping voice through the darkness we know youre in there youve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we dont care who we curse 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 little tiny or thumbelina 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was once a woman who wished very much to have a little 
 child but she could not obtain her wish at last she went to a fairy 
 and said i should so very much like to have a little child can 
 you tell me where i can find one 
 
 oh that can be easily managed said the fairy here is a 
 barleycorn of a different kind to those which grow in the 
 fields and which the chickens eat put it into a and 
 see what will happen 
 
 thank you said the woman and she gave the fairy twelve 
 shillings which was the price of the barleycorn then she went home 
 and planted it and immediately there grew up a large handsome flower something like a tulip in appearance but with its leaves tightly 
 closed as if it were still a bud it is a beautiful flower said the 
 woman and she kissed the red and leaves and while she did so the flower opened and she could see that it was a real 
 tulip within the flower upon the green velvet stamens sat a very 
 delicate and graceful little maiden she was scarcely half as long 
 as a thumb and they gave her the name of thumbelina or tiny 
 because she was so small a elegantly polished served 
 her for a cradle her bed was formed of blue with a 
 for a counterpane here she slept at night but during the 
 day she amused herself on a table where the woman had placed a 
 plateful of water round this plate were wreaths of flowers with their 
 stems in the water and upon it floated a large which 
 served tiny for a boat here the little maiden sat and rowed herself 
 from side to side with two oars made of white it really 
 was a very pretty sight tiny could also sing so softly and 
 sweetly that nothing like her singing had ever before been heard 
 one night while she lay in her pretty bed a large ugly wet toad 
 crept through a broken pane of glass in the window and leaped right 
 upon the table where tiny lay sleeping under her quilt 
 what a pretty little wife this would make for my son said the 
 toad and she took up the in which little tiny lay 
 asleep and jumped through the window with it into the garden 
 in the swampy margin of a broad stream in the garden lived the 
 toad with her son he was uglier even than his mother and when he 
 saw the pretty little maiden in her elegant bed he could only cry 
 
 croak croak croak 
 
 speak so loud or she will wake said the toad and 
 then she might run away for she is as light as down we will 
 place her on one of the leaves out in the stream it will 
 be like an island to her she is so light and small and then she 
 cannot escape and while she is away we will make haste and 
 prepare the under the marsh in which you are to live 
 when you are married 
 
 far out in the stream grew a number of with broad 
 green leaves which seemed to float on the top of the water the 
 largest of these leaves appeared farther off than the rest and the 
 old toad swam out to it with the in which little tiny 
 lay still asleep the tiny little creature woke very early in the 
 morning and began to cry bitterly when she found where she was for 
 she could see nothing but water on every side of the large green leaf 
 and no way of reaching the land meanwhile the old toad was very 
 busy under the marsh decking her room with rushes and wild yellow 
 flowers to make it look pretty for her new then 
 she swam out with her ugly son to the leaf on which she had placed 
 poor little tiny she wanted to fetch the pretty bed that she might 
 put it in the bridal chamber to be ready for her the old toad bowed 
 low to her in the water and said here is my son he will be your 
 husband and you will live happily in the marsh by the stream 
 croak croak croak was all her son could say for himself so 
 the toad took up the elegant little bed and swam away with it 
 leaving tiny all alone on the green leaf where she sat and wept 
 she could not bear to think of living with the old toad and having 
 her ugly son for a husband the little fishes who swam about in the 
 water beneath had seen the toad and heard what she said so they 
 lifted their heads above the water to look at the little maiden as 
 soon as they caught sight of her they saw she was very pretty and it 
 made them very sorry to think that she must go and live with the 
 ugly toads no it must never be so they assembled together in 
 the water round the green stalk which held the leaf on which the 
 little maiden stood and gnawed it away at the root with their 
 teeth then the leaf floated down the stream carrying tiny far away 
 out of reach of land 
 
 tiny sailed past many towns and the little birds in the bushes 
 saw her and sang what a lovely little creature so the leaf swam 
 away with her farther and farther till it brought her to other lands 
 
 a graceful little white butterfly constantly fluttered round her 
 and at last alighted on the leaf tiny pleased him and she was glad 
 of it for now the toad could not possibly reach her and the 
 country through which she sailed was beautiful and the sun shone upon the water till it glittered like liquid gold she took off her girdle 
 and tied one end of it round the butterfly and the other end of the 
 ribbon she fastened to the leaf which now glided on much faster 
 than ever taking little tiny with it as she stood presently a 
 large cockchafer flew by the moment he caught sight of her he seized her round her delicate waist with his claws and flew with her into a tree the green leaf floated away on the brook and the butterfly 
 flew with it for he was fastened to it and could not get away 
 oh how frightened little tiny felt when the cockchafer flew 
 with her to the tree but especially was she sorry for the beautiful 
 white butterfly which she had fastened to the leaf for if he could 
 not free himself he would die of hunger but the cockchafer did not 
 trouble himself at all about the matter he seated himself by her side 
 on a large green leaf gave her some honey from the flowers to eat 
 and told her she was very pretty though not in the least like a 
 cockchafer after a time all the cockchafers turned up their feelers 
 and said she has only two legs how ugly that looks she has no 
 feelers said another her waist is quite slim pooh she is like 
 a human being 
 
 oh she is ugly said all the lady cockchafers although tiny 
 was very pretty then the cockchafer who had run away with her 
 believed all the others when they said she was ugly and would have 
 nothing more to say to her and told her she might go where she liked 
 then he flew down with her from the tree and placed her on a daisy 
 and she wept at the thought that she was so ugly that even the 
 cockchafers would have nothing to say to her and all the while she 
 was really the loveliest creature that one could imagine and as 
 tender and delicate as a beautiful during the whole 
 summer poor little tiny lived quite alone in the wide forest she wove 
 herself a bed with blades of grass and hung it up under a broad leaf 
 to protect herself from the rain she sucked the honey from the 
 flowers for food and drank the dew from their leaves every morning 
 so passed away the summer and the autumn and then came the winter the long cold winter all the birds who had sung to her so sweetly were flown away and the trees and the flowers had withered 
 the large clover leaf under the shelter of which she had lived was now rolled together and shrivelled up nothing remained but a yellow withered stalk she felt dreadfully cold for her clothes were torn and she was herself so frail and delicate that poor little tiny was nearly 
 frozen to death it began to snow too and the as they 
 fell upon her were like a whole shovelful falling upon one of us for 
 we are tall but she was only an inch high then she wrapped herself 
 up in a dry leaf but it cracked in the middle and could not keep 
 her warm and she shivered with cold near the wood in which she had been living lay a but the corn had been cut a long time 
 nothing remained but the bare dry stubble standing up out of the 
 frozen ground it was to her like struggling through a large wood oh 
 how she shivered with the cold she came at last to the door of a 
 who had a little den under the there 
 dwelt the in warmth and comfort with a whole roomful of corn a kitchen and a beautiful dining room poor little tiny stood 
 before the door just like a little and begged for a small 
 piece of for she had been without a morsel to eat for two 
 days 
 
 you poor little creature said the who was really a 
 good old come into my warm room and dine with me she was very pleased with tiny so she said you are quite welcome to stay with me all the winter if you like but you must keep my rooms clean and neat and tell me stories for i shall like to hear them 
 very much and tiny did all the asked her and found 
 herself very comfortable 
 
 we shall have a visitor soon said the one day 
 my neighbor pays me a visit once a week he is better off than i 
 am he has large rooms and wears a beautiful black velvet coat if 
 you could only have him for a husband you would be well provided 
 for indeed but he is blind so you must tell him some of your 
 prettiest stories 
 
 but tiny did not feel at all interested about this neighbor for 
 he was a mole however he came and paid his visit dressed in his 
 black velvet coat 
 
 he is very rich and learned and his house is twenty times larger 
 than mine said the 
 
 he was rich and learned no doubt but he always spoke slightingly 
 of the sun and the pretty flowers because he had never seen them 
 tiny was obliged to sing to him fly away 
 home and many other pretty songs and the mole fell in love with her because she had such a sweet voice but he said nothing yet for he was very cautious a short time before the mole had dug a long 
 passage under the earth which led from the dwelling of the 
 to his own and here she had permission to walk with 
 tiny whenever she liked but he warned them not to be alarmed at the 
 sight of a dead bird which lay in the passage it was a perfect 
 bird with a beak and feathers and could not have been dead long and was lying just where the mole had made his passage the mole took a piece of phosphorescent wood in his mouth and it glittered like fire in the dark then he went before them to light them through the 
 long dark passage when they came to the spot where lay the dead 
 bird the mole pushed his broad nose through the ceiling the earth 
 gave way so that there was a large hole and the daylight shone 
 into the passage in the middle of the floor lay a dead swallow his 
 beautiful wings pulled close to his sides his feet and his head drawn 
 up under his feathers the poor bird had evidently died of the cold 
 it made little tiny very sad to see it she did so love the little 
 birds all the summer they had sung and twittered for her so 
 beautifully but the mole pushed it aside with his crooked legs and 
 said he will sing no more now how miserable it must be to be born a little bird i am thankful that none of my children will ever be 
 birds for they can do nothing but cry tweet tweet and always die 
 of hunger in the winter 
 
 yes you may well say that as a clever man exclaimed the 
 what is the use of his twittering for when winter comes 
 he must either starve or be frozen to death still birds are very high 
 bred 
 
 tiny said nothing but when the two others had turned their 
 backs on the bird she stooped down and stroked aside the soft 
 feathers which covered the head and kissed the closed eyelids 
 perhaps this was the one who sang to me so sweetly in the summer 
 she said and how much pleasure it gave me you dear pretty bird 
 the mole now stopped up the hole through which the daylight shone 
 and then accompanied the lady home but during the night tiny could 
 not sleep so she got out of bed and wove a large beautiful carpet of 
 hay then she carried it to the dead bird and spread it over him 
 with some down from the flowers which she had found in the 
 room it was as soft as wool and she spread some of 
 it on each side of the bird so that he might lie warmly in the cold 
 earth farewell you pretty little bird said she farewell 
 thank you for your delightful singing during the summer when all 
 the trees were green and the warm sun shone upon us then she laid 
 her head on the breast but she was alarmed immediately for it 
 seemed as if something inside the bird went thump thump it was the heart he was not really dead only benumbed with the cold and the warmth had restored him to life in autumn all the swallows fly away into warm countries but if one happens to linger the cold 
 seizes it it becomes frozen and falls down as if dead it remains 
 where it fell and the cold snow covers it tiny trembled very much 
 she was quite frightened for the bird was large a great deal 
 larger than herself she was only an inch high but she took courage 
 laid the wool more thickly over the poor swallow and then took a leaf 
 which she had used for her own counterpane and laid it over the 
 head of the poor bird the next morning she again stole out to see 
 him he was alive but very weak he could only open his eyes for a 
 moment to look at tiny who stood by holding a piece of decayed wood in her hand for she had no other lantern thank you pretty little maiden said the sick swallow i have been so nicely warmed that i shall soon regain my strength and be able to fly about again in the warm sunshine 
 
 oh said she it is cold out of doors now it snows and 
 freezes stay in your warm bed i will take care of you 
 
 then she brought the swallow some water in a and 
 after he had drank he told her that he had wounded one of his wings 
 in a and could not fly as fast as the others who were 
 soon far away on their journey to warm countries then at last he 
 had fallen to the earth and could remember no more nor how he came to be where she had found him the whole winter the swallow remained underground and tiny nursed him with care and love 
 neither the mole nor the knew anything about it for they did not like swallows very soon the spring time came and the sun warmed the earth then the swallow bade farewell to tiny and she opened the hole in the ceiling which the mole had made the sun shone in upon them so beautifully that the swallow asked her if she would go with him she could sit on his back he said and he would fly away with her into the green woods but tiny knew it would make the very grieved if she left her in that manner so she said no i cannot farewell then farewell you good pretty little maiden said the swallow and he flew out into the sunshine 
 
 tiny looked after him and the tears rose in her eyes she was 
 very fond of the poor swallow 
 
 tweet tweet sang the bird as he flew out into the green 
 woods and tiny felt very sad she was not allowed to go out into 
 the warm sunshine the corn which had been sown in the field over 
 the house of the had grown up high into the air and 
 formed a thick wood to tiny who was only an inch in height 
 
 you are going to be married tiny said the my 
 neighbor has asked for you what good fortune for a poor child like 
 you now we will prepare your wedding clothes they must be both 
 woollen and linen nothing must be wanting when you are the 
 wife 
 
 tiny had to turn the spindle and the hired four 
 spiders who were to weave day and night every evening the mole 
 visited her and was continually speaking of the time when the 
 summer would be over then he would keep his with tiny but now the heat of the sun was so great that it burned the earth and made it quite hard like a stone as soon as the summer was over the wedding should take place but tiny was not at all pleased for she did not like the tiresome mole every morning when the sun rose and every evening when it went down she would creep out at the door and as the wind blew aside the ears of corn so that she could see the blue sky she thought how beautiful and bright it seemed out there and wished so much to see her dear swallow again but he never returned for by this time he had flown far away into the lovely green forest 
 
 when autumn arrived tiny had her outfit quite ready and the 
 said to her in four weeks the wedding must take place 
 then tiny wept and said she would not marry the disagreeable 
 mole 
 
 nonsense replied the now be obstinate or i 
 shall bite you with my white teeth he is a very handsome mole the 
 queen herself does not wear more beautiful velvets and furs his 
 kitchen and cellars are quite full you ought to be very thankful 
 for such good fortune 
 
 so the was fixed on which the mole was to fetch 
 tiny away to live with him deep under the earth and never again to 
 see the warm sun because he did not like it the poor child was 
 very unhappy at the thought of saying farewell to the beautiful sun 
 and as the had given her permission to stand at the 
 door she went to look at it once more 
 
 farewell bright sun she cried stretching out her arm towards 
 it and then she walked a short distance from the house for the 
 corn had been cut and only the dry stubble remained in the fields 
 
 farewell farewell she repeated twining her arm round a little red 
 flower that grew just by her side greet the little swallow from 
 me if you should see him again 
 
 tweet tweet sounded over her head suddenly she looked up and 
 there was the swallow himself flying close by as soon as he spied 
 tiny he was delighted and then she told him how unwilling she felt 
 to marry the ugly mole and to live always beneath the earth and 
 never to see the bright sun any more and as she told him she wept 
 
 cold winter is coming said the swallow and i am going to 
 fly away into warmer countries will you go with me you can sit on my back and fasten yourself on with your sash then we can fly away from the ugly mole and his gloomy rooms far away over the mountains into warmer countries where the sun shines more brightly than here where it is always summer and the flowers bloom in greater beauty fly now with me dear little tiny you saved my life when i lay frozen in that dark passage 
 
 yes i will go with you said tiny and she seated herself on 
 the back with her feet on his outstretched wings and tied her 
 girdle to one of his strongest feathers 
 
 then the swallow rose in the air and flew over forest and over 
 sea high above the highest mountains covered with eternal snow tiny would have been frozen in the cold air but she crept under the warm feathers keeping her little head uncovered so that she might admire the beautiful lands over which they passed at length they reached the warm countries where the sun shines brightly and the sky seems so much higher above the earth here on the hedges and by the wayside grew purple green and white grapes lemons and oranges hung from trees in the woods and the air was fragrant with myrtles and orange blossoms beautiful children ran along the 
 country lanes playing with large gay butterflies and as the 
 swallow flew farther and farther every place appeared still more 
 lovely 
 
 at last they came to a blue lake and by the side of it shaded by 
 trees of the deepest green stood a palace of dazzling white marble 
 built in the olden times vines clustered round its lofty pillars and 
 at the top were many swallows nests and one of these was the home of the swallow who carried tiny 
 
 this is my house said the swallow but it would not do for you 
 to live there you would not be comfortable you must choose for 
 yourself one of those lovely flowers and i will put you down upon it 
 and then you shall have everything that you can wish to make you 
 happy 
 
 that will be delightful she said and clapped her little hands for joy 
 
 a large marble pillar lay on the ground which in falling had 
 been broken into three pieces between these pieces grew the most 
 beautiful large white flowers so the swallow flew down with tiny and placed her on one of the broad leaves but how surprised she was to see in the middle of the flower a tiny little man as white and 
 transparent as if he had been made of crystal he had a gold crown 
 on his head and delicate wings at his shoulders and was not much 
 larger than tiny herself he was the angel of the flower for a tiny 
 man and a tiny woman dwell in every flower and this was the king of 
 them all 
 
 oh how beautiful he is whispered tiny to the swallow 
 the little prince was at first quite frightened at the bird who 
 was like a giant compared to such a delicate little creature as 
 himself but when he saw tiny he was delighted and thought her the 
 prettiest little maiden he had ever seen he took the gold crown 
 from his head and placed it on hers and asked her name and if she 
 would be his wife and queen over all the flowers 
 
 this certainly was a very different sort of husband to the son 
 of a toad or the mole with my black velvet and fur so she said 
 
 yes to the handsome prince then all the flowers opened and out of each came a little lady or a tiny lord all so pretty it was quite a 
 pleasure to look at them each of them brought tiny a present but the best gift was a pair of beautiful wings which had belonged to a large white fly and they fastened them to shoulders so that she 
 might fly from flower to flower then there was much rejoicing and 
 the little swallow who sat above them in his nest was asked to 
 sing a wedding song which he did as well as he could but in his 
 heart he felt sad for he was very fond of tiny and would have liked 
 never to part from her again 
 
 you must not be called tiny any more said the spirit of the 
 flowers to her it is an ugly name and you are so very pretty we 
 will call you maia 
 
 farewell farewell said the swallow with a heavy heart as he 
 left the warm countries to fly back into denmark there he had a 
 nest over the window of a house in which dwelt the writer of fairy 
 tales the swallow sang tweet tweet and from his song came the 
 whole story

 book few pages of history 
 chapter v 
 
 facts whence history springs and which history ignores 
 towards the end of april everything had become aggravated the fermentation entered the boiling state 
 ever since petty partial revolts had been going on here and there which were quickly suppressed but ever bursting forth afresh the sign of a vast underlying conflagration 
 something terrible was in preparation 
 glimpses could be caught of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted of a possible revolution france kept an eye on paris paris kept an eye on the faubourg 
 the faubourg which was in a dull glow was beginning its ebullition 
 the of the rue de charonne were although the union of the two epithets seems singular when applied to grave and stormy 
 the government was there purely and simply called in question there people publicly discussed the question of fighting or of keeping quiet 
 there were back shops where workingmen were made to swear that they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm and that they would fight without counting the number of the enemy this engagement once entered into a man seated in the corner of the assumed a sonorous tone and said you understand you have sworn 
 sometimes they went up stairs to a private room on the first floor and there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted 
 they made the initiated take oaths to render service to himself as well as to the fathers of families 
 that was the formula 
 in the subversive pamphlets were read 
 they treated the government with contempt says a secret report of that time 
 words like the following could be heard there 
 i know the names of the leaders 
 we folks shall not know the day until two hours beforehand 
 one workman said there are three hundred of us let each contribute ten sous that will make one hundred and fifty francs with which to procure powder and shot 
 another said 
 i ask for six months i ask for even two in less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government with thousand men we can face them 
 another said i sleep at night because i make cartridges all night from time to time men of bourgeois appearance and in good coats came and caused embarrassment and with the air of command shook hands with the most important and then went away 
 they never stayed more than ten minutes 
 significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone 
 the plot is ripe the matter is arranged 
 it was murmured by all who were there to borrow the very expression of one of those who were present 
 the exaltation was such that one day a workingman exclaimed efore the whole we have no arms one of his comrades replied 
 the soldiers have thus parodying without being aware of the fact proclamation to the army in italy 
 when they had anything of a more secret nature on hand adds one report they did not communicate it to each other it is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they said 
 these reunions were sometimes periodical 
 at certain ones of them there were never more than eight or ten persons present and they were always the same 
 in others any one entered who wished and the room was so full that they were forced to stand some went thither through enthusiasm and passion others because it was on their way to their work 
 as during the revolution there were patriotic women in some of these who embraced 
 other expressive facts came to light 
 a man would enter a shop drink and go his way with the remark the revolution will pay what is due to you 
 revolutionary agents were appointed in a facing the rue de charonne 
 the balloting was carried on in their caps 
 workingmen met at the house of a who gave lessons in the rue de cotte 
 there there was a trophy of arms formed of wooden broadswords canes clubs and foils 
 one day the buttons were removed from the foils 
 a workman said 
 there are of us but they count on me because i am looked upon as a machine 
 later on that machine became quenisset 
 the indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange and indescribable notoriety 
 a woman sweeping off her doorsteps said to another woman 
 for a long time there has been a strong force busy making cartridges 
 in the open street proclamation could be seen addressed to the national guard in the departments one of these proclamations was signed 
 burtot 
 one day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an italian accent mounted a stone post at the door of a in the marche lenoir and read aloud a singular document which seemed to emanate from an occult power 
 groups formed around him and applauded 
 the passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and noted down 
 our doctrines are trammelled our proclamations torn our are spied upon and thrown into breakdown which has recently taken place in cottons has converted to us many future of nations is being worked out in our obscure ranks here are the fixed terms 
 action or reaction revolution or for at our epoch we no longer believe either in inertia or in immobility 
 for the people against the people that is the question 
 there is no the day when we cease to suit you break us but up to that day help us to march on 
 all this in broad daylight 
 other deeds more audacious still were suspicious in the eyes of the people by reason of their very audacity 
 on the th of april a mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of the rue and shouted 
 i am a babouvist but beneath babeuf the people scented gisquet 
 among other things this man said 
 down with property 
 the opposition of the left is cowardly and treacherous 
 when it wants to be on the right side it preaches revolution it is democratic in order to escape being beaten and royalist so that it may not have to fight the republicans are beasts with feathers 
 distrust the republicans citizens of the laboring classes 
 silence citizen spy cried an artisan 
 this shout put an end to the discourse 
 mysterious incidents occurred 
 at nightfall a workingman encountered near the canal a very well dressed man who said to him 
 whither are you bound citizen 
 sir replied the workingman i have not the honor of your acquaintance 
 i know you very well however 
 and the man added 
 be alarmed i am an agent of the committee you are suspected of not being quite faithful 
 you know that if you reveal anything there is an eye fixed on you 
 then he shook hands with the workingman and went away saying 
 we shall meet again soon 
 the police who were on the alert collected singular dialogues not only in the but in the street 
 get yourself received very soon said a weaver to a 
 why 
 there is going to be a shot to fire 
 two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies fraught with evident jacquerie 
 who governs us 
 m philippe 
 no it is the bourgeoisie 
 the reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word jacquerie in a bad sense 
 the jacques were the poor 
 on another occasion two men were heard to say to each other as they passed by 
 we have a good plan of attack 
 only the following was caught of a private conversation between four men who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the barriere du trone 
 everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about paris any more 
 who was the he 
 menacing obscurity 
 the principal leaders as they said in the faubourg held themselves apart 
 it was supposed that they met for consultation in a near the point a certain aug chief of the society aid for tailors rue mondetour had the reputation of serving as intermediary central between the leaders and the faubourg 
 nevertheless there was always a great deal of mystery about these leaders and no certain fact can invalidate the singular arrogance of this reply made later on by a man accused before the court of peers 
 who was your leader 
 i knew of none and i recognized none 
 there was nothing but words transparent but vague sometimes idle reports rumors hearsay 
 other indications cropped up 
 a carpenter occupied in nailing boards to a fence around the ground on which a house was in process of construction in the rue de reuilly found on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still legible the following lines 
 the committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sections for the different societies 
 and as a postscript 
 we have learned that there are guns in the rue du no bis to the number of five or six thousand in the house of a gunsmith in that court 
 the section owns no arms 
 what excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his neighbors was the fact that a few paces further on he picked up another paper torn like the first and still more significant of which we reproduce a facsimile because of the historical interest attaching to these strange documents 
 q c d e learn this list by heart after so doing you will tear it up the men admitted will do thesame when you have transmitted their orders to them health and fraternity u og a fe l 
 it was only later on that the persons who were in the secret of this find at the time learned the significance of those four capital letters 
 quinturions centurions decurions eclaireurs scouts and the sense of the letters 
 u og a fe which was a date and meant april th 
 under each capital letter were inscribed names followed by very characteristic notes 
 thus 
 q bannerel guns cartridges 
 a safe boubiere 
 pistol rollet 
 foil pistol pound of powder e tessier 
 sword 
 guns brave etc 
 finally this carpenter found still in the same enclosure a third paper on which was written in pencil but very legibly this sort of enigmatical 
 blanchard 
 barra 
 soize 
 
 kosciusko aubry the butcher 
 j j r 
 caius gracchus 
 right of revision 
 dufond 
 four 
 fall of the girondists 
 derbac 
 maubuee 
 washington 
 pinson 
 pistol cartridges 
 marseillaise 
 sovereignty of the people michel quincampoix sword 
 hoche 
 marceau 
 plato 
 
 warsaw 
 tilly crier of the populaire 
 the honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew its significance 
 it appears that this list was the complete nomenclature of the sections of the fourth arondissement of the society of the rights of man with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than history we may publish them 
 it should be added that the foundation of the society of the rights of man seems to have been posterior to the date when this paper was found 
 perhaps this was only a rough draft 
 still according to all the remarks and the words according to written notes material facts begin to make their appearance 
 in the rue popincourt in the house of a dealer in there were seized seven sheets of gray paper all folded alike lengthwise and in four these sheets enclosed squares of this same gray paper folded in the form of a cartridge and a card on which was written the following 
 saltpetre ounces 
 sulphur ounces 
 charcoal 
 ounces and a half 
 water ounces 
 the report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong smell of powder 
 a mason returning from his work left behind him a little package on a bench near the bridge of austerlitz 
 this package was taken to the police station 
 it was opened and in it were found two printed dialogues signed lahautiere a song entitled workmen band together and a tin box full of cartridges 
 one artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see how warm he was the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat 
 in a ditch on the boulevard between and the barriere du trone at the most deserted spot some children while playing discovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of wood a bag containing a a wooden punch for the preparation of cartridges a wooden bowl in which there were grains of and a little pot whose interior presented evident traces of melted lead 
 police agents making their way suddenly and unexpectedly at five in the morning into the dwelling of a certain pardon who was afterwards a member of the section and got himself killed in the insurrection of april found him standing near his bed and holding in his hand some cartridges which he was in the act of preparing 
 towards the hour when workingmen repose two men were seen to meet between the barriere picpus and the barriere charenton in a little lane between two walls near a in front of which there was a jeu de siam one drew a pistol from beneath his blouse and handed it to the other 
 as he was handing it to him he noticed that the perspiration of his chest had made the powder damp he primed the pistol and added more powder to what was already in the pan 
 then the two men parted 
 a game of ninepins in which one side of the ball is smaller than the other so that it does not roll straight but describes a curve on the ground 
 a certain gallais afterwards killed in the rue beaubourg in the affair of april boasted of having in his house seven hundred cartridges and flints 
 the government one day received a warning that arms and two hundred thousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg on the following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed the remarkable point about it was that the police were not able to seize a single one 
 an intercepted letter read 
 the day is not far distant when within four hours by the clock eighty thousand patriots will be under arms 
 all this fermentation was public one might almost say tranquil the approaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the face of the government 
 no singularity was lacking to this still subterranean crisis which was already perceptible 
 the bourgeois talked peaceably to the of what was in preparation they said 
 how is the rising coming along in the same tone in which they would have said 
 how is your wife 
 a of the rue moreau inquired 
 well when are you going to make the attack 
 another said 
 the attack will be made soon 
 i know it 
 a month ago there were fifteen thousand of you now there are thousand 
 he offered his gun and a neighbor offered a small pistol which he was willing to sell for seven francs 
 moreover the revolutionary fever was growing 
 not a point in paris nor in france was exempt from it 
 the artery was beating everywhere like those membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the human body the network of secret societies began to spread all over the country 
 from the associations of the friends of the people which was at the same time public and secret sprang the society of the rights of man which also dated from one of the orders of the day 
 pluviose year of the republican era which was destined to survive even the mandate of the court of assizes which pronounced its dissolution and which did not hesitate to bestow on its sections significant names like the following 
 pikes tocsin signal cannon phrygian cap january the beggars the vagabonds forward march robespierre level ca ira 
 the society of the rights of man engendered the society of action these were impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead other associations sought to recruit themselves from the great mother societies 
 the members of sections complained that they were torn asunder 
 thus the gallic society and the committee of organization of the municipalities 
 thus the associations for the liberty of the press for individual liberty for the instruction of the people against indirect taxes 
 then the society of equal workingmen which was divided into three fractions the levellers the communists the reformers 
 then the army of the bastilles a sort of cohort organized on a military footing four men commanded by a corporal ten by a sergeant twenty by a forty by a lieutenant there were never more than five men who knew each other creation where precaution is combined with audacity and which seemed stamped with the genius of venice 
 the central committee which was at the head had two arms the society of action and the army of the bastilles 
 a legitimist association the chevaliers of fidelity stirred about among these the republican affiliations 
 it was denounced and repudiated there 
 the parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities lyons nantes lille marseilles and each had its society of the rights of man the charbonniere and the free men all had a revolutionary society which was called the cougourde we have already mentioned this word 
 in paris the faubourg kept up an equal buzzing with the faubourg and the schools were no less moved than the faubourgs 
 a cafe in the rue and the of the seven billiards rue des served as rallying points for the students 
 the society of the friends of the a b c affiliated to the mutualists of angers and to the cougourde of aix met as we have seen in the cafe musain these same young men assembled also as we have stated already in a restaurant of the rue mondetour which was called corinthe these meetings were secret 
 others were as public as possible and the reader can judge of their boldness from these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the ulterior prosecutions where was this meeting held 
 in the rue de la paix at whose house 
 in the street 
 what sections were there only one 
 which 
 the manuel section 
 who was its leader i you are too young to have decided alone upon the bold course of attacking the government 
 where did your instructions come from from the central committee 
 the army was mined at the same time as the population as was proved subsequently by the operations of beford luneville and epinard they counted on the regiment on the fifth on the eighth on the and on the twentieth light cavalry in burgundy and in the southern towns they planted the liberty tree that is to say a pole surmounted by a red cap 
 such was the situation 
 the faubourg more than any other group of the population as we stated in the beginning accentuated this situation and made it felt 
 that was the sore point 
 this old faubourg peopled like an laborious courageous and angry as a hive of bees was quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult everything was in a state of agitation there without any interruption however of the regular work 
 it is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yet sombre physiognomy 
 in this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden under attic roofs there also exist rare and ardent minds 
 it is particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it is dangerous to have extremes meet 
 the faubourg had also other causes to tremble for it received the of commercial crises of failures strikes slack seasons all inherent to great political disturbances in times of revolution misery is both cause and effect 
 the blow which it deals rebounds upon it 
 this population full of proud virtue capable to the highest degree of latent heat always ready to fly to arms prompt to explode irritated deep undermined seemed to be only awaiting the fall of a spark 
 whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased by the wind of events it is impossible not to think of the faubourg and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very gates of paris that of suffering and ideas 
 the of the faubourg antoine which have been more than once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused possess historical notoriety 
 in troublous times people grow intoxicated there more on words than on wine 
 a sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus of the future circulates there swelling hearts and enlarging souls 
 the cabarets of the faubourg resemble those taverns of mont aventine erected on the cave of the sibyl and communicating with the profound and sacred breath taverns where the tables were almost tripods and where was drunk what ennius calls the sibylline wine 
 the faubourg is a reservoir of people revolutionary agitations create fissures there through which trickles the popular sovereignty 
 this sovereignty may do evil it can be mistaken like any other but even when led astray it remains great 
 we may say of it as of the blind cyclops ingens 
 in according as the idea which was floating about was good or evil according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm there leaped forth from the faubourg now savage legions now heroic bands 
 savage 
 let us explain this word 
 when these bristling men who in the early days of the revolutionary chaos tattered howling wild with uplifted bludgeon pike on high hurled themselves upon ancient paris in an uproar what did they want 
 they wanted an end to oppression an end to tyranny an end to the sword work for men instruction for the child social sweetness for the woman liberty equality fraternity bread for all the idea for all the edenizing of the world 
 progress and that holy sweet and good thing progress they claimed in terrible wise driven to extremities as they were half naked club in fist a roar in their mouths 
 they were savages yes but the savages of civilization 
 they proclaimed right furiously they were desirous if only with fear and trembling to force the human race to paradise they seemed barbarians and they were saviours 
 they demanded light with the mask of night 
 facing these men who were ferocious we admit and terrifying but ferocious and terrifying for good ends there are other men smiling embroidered gilded beribboned starred in silk stockings in white plumes in yellow gloves in varnished shoes who with their elbows on a velvet table beside a marble insist gently on demeanor and the preservation of the past of the middle ages of divine right of fanaticism of innocence of slavery of the death penalty of war glorifying in low tones and with politeness the sword the stake and the scaffold 
 for our part if we were forced to make a choice between the barbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism we should choose the barbarians 
 but thank heaven still another choice is possible 
 no perpendicular fall is necessary in front any more than in the rear 
 neither despotism nor terrorism 
 we desire progress with a gentle slope 
 god takes care of that 
 whole policy consists in rendering slopes less steep

 chapter i 
 
 absolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion but at the same time a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements there is a well known sophism of the ancients consisting in this that achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise by the time achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the tortoise the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of him when achilles has covered that tenth the tortoise has covered another one hundredth and so on forever this problem seemed to the ancients insoluble the absurd answer that achilles could never overtake the tortoise resulted from this that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements whereas the motion both of achilles and of the tortoise was continuous 
 by adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a solution of the problem but never reach it only when we have admitted the conception of the infinitely small and the resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth and have found the sum of this progression to infinity do we reach a solution of the problem 
 a modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble 
 this modern branch of mathematics unknown to the ancients when dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small and so conforms to the chief condition of motion absolute continuity and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of examining continuous motion 
 in seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens the movement of humanity arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary human wills is continuous 
 to understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of history but to arrive at these laws resulting from the sum of all those human wills mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected units the first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others though there is and can be no beginning to any event for one event always flows uninterruptedly from another 
 the second method is to consider the actions of some one man a king or a commander as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single historic personage 
 historical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination but however small the units it takes we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage is in itself false 
 it needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions drawn from history it is merely necessary to select some larger or smaller unit as the subject of observation as criticism has every right to do seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be arbitrarily selected 
 only by taking infinitesimally small units for observation the differential of history that is the individual tendencies of men and attaining to the art of integrating them that is finding the sum of these infinitesimals can we hope to arrive at the laws of history 
 the first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in europe present an extraordinary movement of millions of people men leave their customary pursuits hasten from one side of europe to the other plunder and slaughter one another triumph and are plunged in despair and for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive movement which first increases and then slackens what was the cause of this movement by what laws was it governed asks the mind of man 
 the historians replying to this question lay before us the sayings and doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of paris calling these sayings and doings the revolution then they give a detailed biography of napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him tell of the influence some of these people had on others and say that is why this movement took place and those are its laws 
 but the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger the sum of human wills produced the revolution and napoleon and only the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them 
 but every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been great men says history and indeed human reason replies every time conquerors appear there have been wars but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single man whenever i look at my watch and its hands point to ten i hear the bells of the neighboring church but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten i have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position of the hands of the watch 
 whenever i see the movement of a locomotive i hear the whistle and see the valves opening and wheels turning but i have no right to conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the movement of the engine 
 the peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks are budding and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak is budding but though i do not know what causes the cold winds to blow when the oak buds unfold i cannot agree with the peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds i see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of life and i see that however much and however carefully i observe the hands of the watch and the valves and wheels of the engine and the oak i shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing the engine moving or of the winds of spring to that i must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam of the bells and of the wind history must do the same and attempts in this direction have already been made 
 to study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of our observation must leave aside kings ministers and generals and the common infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved no one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history but it is evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie and that as yet not a millionth part as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has been devoted to describing the actions of various kings commanders and ministers and propounding the historians own reflections concerning these actions

 enjolras and his lieutenants 
 it was about this epoch that enjolras in view of a possible catastrophe instituted a kind of mysterious census 
 all were present at a secret meeting at the cafe musain 
 enjolras said mixing his words with a few but significant metaphors 
 it is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we may count 
 if combatants are required they must be provided it can do no harm to have something with which to strike always have more chance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when there are none 
 let us therefore reckon a little on the herd 
 how many of us are there there is no question of postponing this task until revolutionists should always be hurried progress has no time to lose let us mistrust the unexpected 
 let us not be caught unprepared we must go over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast 
 this business ought to be concluded courfeyrac you will see the polytechnic students 
 it is their day to go out is wednesday 
 feuilly you will see those of the glaciere will you not 
 combeferre has promised me to go to picpus there is a perfect swarm and an excellent one there 
 bahorel will visit the estrapade 
 prouvaire the masons are growing lukewarm you will bring us news from the lodge of the rue de joly will go to clinical lecture and feel the pulse of the medical school 
 bossuet will take a little turn in the court and talk with the young law licentiates 
 i will take charge of the cougourde myself 
 that arranges everything said courfeyrac 
 no 
 what else is there 
 a very important thing 
 what is that asked courfeyrac 
 the barriere du maine replied enjolras 
 enjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection then he resumed 
 at the barriere du maine there are painters and journeymen in the studios of sculptors 
 they are an enthusiastic family but liable to cool off 
 i know what has been the matter with them for some time past 
 they are thinking of something else they are becoming extinguished 
 they pass their time playing dominoes there is urgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little but with firmness 
 they meet at they are to be found there between twelve and one those ashes must be fanned into a glow 
 for that errand i had counted on that abstracted marius who is a good fellow on the whole but he no longer comes to us i need some one for the barriere du maine 
 i have no one 
 what about me said grantaire 
 here am i 
 you 
 i 
 you indoctrinate republicans you warm up hearts that have grown cold in the name of principle 
 why not 
 are you good for anything 
 i have a vague ambition in that direction said grantaire 
 you do not believe in everything 
 i believe in you 
 grantaire will you do me a service 
 anything 
 black your boots 
 well meddle with our affairs 
 sleep yourself sober from your absinthe 
 you are an ingrate enjolras 
 you the man to go to the barriere du maine 
 you capable of it 
 i am capable of descending the rue de gres of crossing the place of sloping through the rue of taking the rue de vaugirard of passing the carmelites of turning into the rue of reaching the rue du of leaving behind me the conseil de guerre of pacing the rue des vielles tuileries of striding across the boulevard of following the chaussee du maine of passing the barrier and entering i am capable of that my shoes are capable of that 
 do you know anything of those comrades who meet at 
 not much 
 we only address each other as thou 
 what will you say to them 
 i will speak to them of robespierre pardi 
 of danton of principles 
 you 
 i but i receive justice 
 when i set about it i am terrible i have read prudhomme i know the social contract i know my constitution of the year two by heart 
 the liberty of one citizen ends where the liberty of another citizen begins 
 do you take me for a brute 
 i have an old of the republic in my drawer the rights of man the sovereignty of the people sapristi 
 i am even a bit of a hebertist 
 i can talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock watch in hand 
 be serious said enjolras 
 i am wild replied grantaire 
 enjolras meditated for a few moments and made the gesture of a man who has taken a resolution 
 grantaire he said gravely i consent to try you 
 you shall go to the barriere du maine 
 grantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the cafe musain he went out and five minutes later he returned 
 he had gone home to put on a robespierre waistcoat 
 red said he as he entered and he looked intently at enjolras then with the palm of his energetic hand he laid the two scarlet points of the waistcoat across his breast 
 and stepping up to enjolras he whispered in his ear 
 be easy 
 he jammed his hat on resolutely and departed 
 a quarter of an hour later the back room of the cafe musain was deserted 
 all the friends of the a b c were gone each in his own direction each to his own task 
 enjolras who had reserved the cougourde of aix for himself was the last to leave 
 those members of the cougourde of aix who were in paris then met on the plain of issy in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous in that side of paris 
 as enjolras walked towards this place he passed the whole situation in review in his own mind 
 the gravity of events was when facts the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady move heavily the slightest complication stops and entangles them a phenomenon whence arises ruin and new births 
 enjolras descried a luminous uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the future who knows 
 perhaps the moment was at hand 
 the people were again taking possession of right and what a fine spectacle the revolution was again majestically taking possession of france and saying to the world 
 the sequel enjolras was content the furnace was being heated 
 he had at that moment a powder train of friends scattered all over paris 
 he composed in his own mind with philosophical and penetrating eloquence cosmopolitan enthusiasm dash smile jean melancholy science sarcasms a sort of electric spark which took fire nearly everywhere at once all hands to work 
 surely the result would answer to the effort this was well 
 this made him think of grantaire 
 hold said he to himself the barriere du maine will not take me far out of my way 
 what if i were to go on as far as let us have a look at what grantaire is about and see how he is getting on 
 one was striking from the vaugirard steeple when enjolras reached the richefeu 
 he pushed open the door entered folded his arms letting the door fall to and strike his shoulders and gazed at that room filled with tables men and smoke 
 a voice broke forth from the mist of smoke interrupted by another voice it was grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary 
 grantaire was sitting opposite another figure at a marble table strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos 
 he was hammering the table with his fist and this is what enjolras heard 
 
 fours

 book eleven 
 chapter ii 
 
 the forces of a dozen european nations burst into russia the russian army and people avoided a collision till smolensk was reached and again from smolensk to borodino the french army pushed on to moscow its goal its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim just as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth behind it were seven hundred miles of hostile country ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal every soldier in army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum 
 the more the russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred of the enemy flared up and while it retreated the army increased and consolidated at borodino a collision took place neither army was broken up but the russian army retreated immediately after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another having a greater momentum and with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some distance though the collision had deprived it of all its force 
 the russians retreated eighty miles to beyond moscow and the french reached moscow and there came to a standstill for five weeks after that there was not a single battle the french did not move as a bleeding mortally wounded animal licks its wounds they remained inert in moscow for five weeks and then suddenly with no fresh reason fled back they made a dash for the kaluga road and after a victory for at the field of conflict again remained theirs without undertaking a single serious battle they fled still more rapidly back to smolensk beyond smolensk beyond the berezina beyond vilna and farther still 
 on the evening of the of august kutuzov and the whole russian army were convinced that the battle of borodino was a victory kutuzov reported so to the emperor he gave orders to prepare for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone but because he knew that the enemy was beaten as everyone who had taken part in the battle knew it 
 but all that evening and next day reports came in one after another of losses of the loss of half the army and a fresh battle proved physically impossible 
 it was impossible to give battle before information had been collected the wounded gathered in the supplies of ammunition replenished the slain reckoned up new officers appointed to replace those who had been killed and before the men had had food and sleep and meanwhile the very next morning after the battle the french army advanced of itself upon the russians carried forward by the force of its own momentum now seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from its aim wish was to attack next day and the whole army desired to do so but to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient there must also be a possibility of doing it and that possibility did not exist it was impossible not to retreat a march and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third march and at last on the first of september when the army drew near moscow despite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in all ranks the force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond moscow and the troops retired one more last march and abandoned moscow to the enemy 
 for people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by generals as any one of us sitting over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle the questions present themselves why did kutuzov during the retreat not do this or that why did he not take up a position before reaching fili why did he not retire at once by the kaluga road abandoning moscow and so on people accustomed to think in that way forget or do not know the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander in chief the activity of a commander in chief does not all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at case in our studies examining some campaign on the map with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality and begin our plans from some given moment a commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any event the position from which we always contemplate it the commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that is occurring moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping itself and at every moment of this continuous uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex play of intrigues worries contingencies authorities projects counsels threats and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him which constantly conflict with one another 
 learned military authorities quite seriously tell us that kutuzov should have moved his army to the kaluga road long before reaching fili and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him but a commander in chief especially at a difficult moment has always before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously and all these proposals based on strategics and tactics contradict each other 
 a commander in business it would seem is simply to choose one of these projects but even that he cannot do events and time do not wait for instance on the it is suggested to him to cross to the kaluga road but just then an adjutant gallops up from miloradovich asking whether he is to engage the french or retire an order must be given him at once that instant and the order to retreat carries us past the turn to the kaluga road and after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go and a courier from petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of abandoning moscow and the commander in rival the man who is undermining him and there are always not merely one but several such presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning to the kaluga road and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain and the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent and a spy a prisoner and a general who has been on reconnaissance all describe the position of the army differently people accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a commander in actions describe to us for instance the position of the army at fili and assume that the commander in chief could on the first of september quite freely decide whether to abandon moscow or defend it whereas with the russian army less than four miles from moscow no such question existed when had that question been settled at drissa and at smolensk and most palpably of all on the of august at shevardino and on the at borodino and each day and hour and minute of the retreat from borodino to fili

 the meadow 
 marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose track he had set javert but javert had no sooner quitted the building bearing off his prisoners in three than marius also glided out of the house 
 it was only nine in the evening 
 marius betook himself to courfeyrac courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the latin quarter he had gone to live in the rue de la verrerie for political reasons this quarter was one where at that epoch insurrection liked to install itself 
 marius said to courfeyrac i have come to sleep with you 
 courfeyrac dragged a mattress off his bed which was furnished with two spread it out on the floor and said 
 there 
 at seven on the following morning marius returned to the hovel paid the rent which he owed to bougon had his books his bed his table his commode and his two chairs loaded on a and went off without leaving his address so that when javert returned in the course of the morning for the purpose of questioning marius as to the events of the preceding evening he found only bougon who answered moved away 
 bougon was convinced that marius was to some extent an accomplice of the robbers who had been seized the night before who would ever have said it she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter a young man like that who had the air of a girl 
 marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence the first was that he now had a horror of that house where he had beheld so close at hand and in its most repulsive and most ferocious development a social deformity which is perhaps even more terrible than the wicked rich man the wicked poor man the second was that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all probability and be brought in to testify against thenardier 
 javert thought that the young man whose name he had forgotten was afraid and had fled or perhaps had not even returned home at the time of the ambush he made some efforts to find him however but without success 
 a month passed then another 
 marius was still with courfeyrac he had learned from a young licentiate in law an habitual frequenter of the courts that thenardier was in close confinement 
 every monday marius had five francs handed in to the office of la force for thenardier 
 as marius had no longer any money he borrowed the five francs from courfeyrac 
 it was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed money 
 these periodical five francs were a double riddle to courfeyrac who lent and to thenardier who received them 
 to whom can they go thought courfeyrac 
 whence can this come to me thenardier asked himself 
 moreover marius was everything had plunged through a once more 
 he no longer saw anything before him his life was again buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly he had for a moment beheld very close at hand in that obscurity the young girl whom he loved the old man who seemed to be her father those unknown beings who were his only interest and his only hope in this world and at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them a gust had swept all these shadows away not a spark of certainty and truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions 
 no conjecture was possible 
 he no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew 
 it certainly was not ursule 
 and the lark was a nickname 
 and what was he to think of the old man 
 was he actually in hiding from the police the workman whom marius had encountered in the vicinity of the invalides recurred to his mind 
 it now seemed probable that that workingman and m leblanc were one and the same person 
 so he disguised himself 
 that man had his heroic and his equivocal sides why had he not called for help 
 why had he fled 
 was he or was he not the father of the young girl 
 was he in short the man whom thenardier thought that he recognized 
 thenardier might have been mistaken 
 these formed so many insoluble problems all this it is true detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the luxembourg 
 distress marius bore a passion in his heart and night over his eyes he was thrust onward he was drawn and he could not stir all had vanished save love 
 of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations 
 ordinarily this flame which burns us lights us also a little and casts some useful gleams without but marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion he never said to himself 
 what if i were to go to such a place what if i were to try such and such a thing 
 the girl whom he could no longer call ursule was evidently somewhere nothing warned marius in what direction he should seek her 
 his whole life was now summed up in two words absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog to see her once again he still aspired to this but he no longer expected it 
 to crown all his poverty had returned 
 he felt that icy breath close to him on his heels 
 in the midst of his torments and long before this he had discontinued his work and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work it is a habit which vanishes a habit which is easy to get rid of and difficult to take up again 
 a certain amount of dreaming is good like a narcotic in discreet doses it lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor which are sometimes severe and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects the contours of pure thought fills in gaps here and there binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas 
 but too much dreaming sinks and drowns woe to the who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into revery 
 he thinks that he can with equal ease and he tells himself that after all it is the same thing 
 error 
 thought is the toil of the intelligence revery its voluptuousness to replace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a food 
 marius had begun in that way as the reader will remember passion had supervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimaeras without object or bottom 
 one no longer emerges from self except for the purpose of going off to dream idle production 
 tumultuous and stagnant gulf 
 and in proportion as labor diminishes needs increase 
 this is a law 
 man in a state of revery is generally prodigal and slack the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds 
 there is in that mode of life good mingled with evil for if enervation is baleful generosity is good and healthful but the poor man who is generous and noble and who does not work is lost 
 resources are exhausted needs crop up 
 fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn and which ends in one of two holds suicide or crime 
 by dint of going outdoors to think the day comes when one goes out to throw self in the water 
 excess of revery breeds men like escousse and lebras 
 marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace with his eyes fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw 
 what we have just written seems strange and yet it is true 
 the memory of an absent being kindles in the darkness of the heart the more it has disappeared the more it beams the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon the star of the inner night 
 was marius whole thought 
 he meditated of nothing else he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was becoming an impossible coat and that his new coat was growing old that his shirts were wearing out that his hat was wearing out that his boots were giving out and he said to himself 
 if i could but see her once again before i die 
 one sweet idea alone was left to him that she had loved him that her glance had told him so that she did not know his name but that she did know his soul and that wherever she was however mysterious the place she still loved him perhaps who knows whether she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her 
 sometimes in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced by every heart that loves though he had no reasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy he said to himself it is her thoughts that are coming to me 
 then he added perhaps my thoughts reach her also 
 this illusion at which he shook his head a moment later was sufficient nevertheless to throw beams which at times resembled hope into his soul 
 from time to time especially at that evening hour which is the most depressing to even the dreamy he allowed the purest the most impersonal the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else 
 he called this writing to her 
 it must not be supposed that his reason was deranged quite the contrary 
 he had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly towards any fixed goal but he was endowed with more and rectitude than ever 
 marius surveyed by a calm and real although peculiar light what passed before his eyes even the most indifferent deeds and men he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness 
 his judgment which was almost wholly disassociated from hope held itself aloof and soared on high 
 in this state of mind nothing escaped him nothing deceived him and every moment he was discovering the foundation of life of humanity and of destiny 
 happy even in the midst of anguish is he to whom god has given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness he who has not viewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this double light has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true 
 the soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity 
 however day followed day and nothing new presented itself it merely seemed to him that the sombre space which still remained to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant he thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss 
 what he repeated to himself shall i not see her again before then 
 when you have ascended the rue left the barrier on one side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance you reach the rue de la sante then the glaciere and a little while before arriving at the little river of the gobelins you come to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of paris where ruysdeel would be tempted to sit down 
 there is something indescribable there which exhales grace a green meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines from which flutter rags drying in the wind and an old house built in the time of louis xiii with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer windows dilapidated palisades a little water amid women voices laughter on the horizon the pantheon the pole of the the black squat fantastic amusing magnificent and in the background the severe square crests of the towers of notre dame 
 as the place is worth looking at no one goes thither 
 hardly one cart or wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour 
 it chanced that marius solitary strolls led him to this plot of ground near the water 
 that day there was a rarity on the boulevard a marius vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the place asked this is the name of this spot 
 the person replied 
 it is the meadow 
 and he added 
 it was here that ulbach killed the shepherdess of ivry 
 but after the word lark marius heard nothing more 
 these sudden congealments in the state of revery which a single word suffices to evoke do occur 
 the entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else 
 the lark was the appellation which had replaced ursule in the depths of marius said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor peculiar to these mysterious asides this is her meadow i shall know where she lives now 
 it was absurd but irresistible 
 and every day he returned to that meadow of the lark

 when ermolov having been sent by kutuzov to inspect the position told the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before moscow and that they must retreat kutuzov looked at him in silence 
 give me your hand said he and turning it over so as to feel the pulse added you are not well my dear fellow think what you are saying 
 kutuzov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond moscow without a battle 
 on the poklonny hill four miles from the dorogomilov gate of moscow kutuzov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside a great crowd of generals gathered round him and count rostopchin who had come out from moscow joined them this brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the position the state of the army the plans suggested the situation of moscow and military questions generally though they had not been summoned for the purpose and though it was not so called they all felt that this was really a council of war the conversations all dealt with public questions if anyone gave or asked for personal news it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters no jokes or laughter or smiles even were seen among all these men they evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded and all these groups while talking among themselves tried to keep near the commander in chief whose bench formed the center of the gathering and to speak so that he might overhear them the commander in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks but did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion after hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned away with an air of disappointment as though they were not speaking of anything he wished to hear some discussed the position that had been chosen criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it others argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days before others again spoke of the battle of salamanca which was described by crosart a newly arrived frenchman in a spanish uniform this frenchman and one of the german princes serving with the russian army were discussing the siege of saragossa and considering the possibility of defending moscow in a similar manner count rostopchin was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the capital but that he still could not help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening and that had he known it sooner things would have been different a fifth group displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions discussed the direction the troops would now have to take a sixth group was talking absolute nonsense expression grew more and more preoccupied and gloomy from all this talk he saw only one thing that to defend moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of those words that is to say so utterly impossible that if any senseless commander were to give orders to fight confusion would result but the battle would still not take place it would not take place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible but in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its inevitable abandonment how could the commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered it impossible to hold the officers and even the soldiers who too reason also considered the position impossible and therefore could not go to fight fully convinced as they were of defeat if bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still discussed it the question was no longer important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue this kutuzov knew well 
 bennigsen who had chosen the position warmly displayed his russian patriotism kutuzov could not listen to this without wincing by insisting that moscow must be defended his aim was as clear as daylight to kutuzov if the defense failed to throw the blame on kutuzov who had brought the army as far as the sparrow hills without giving battle if it succeeded to claim the success as his own or if battle were not given to clear himself of the crime of abandoning moscow but this intrigue did not now occupy the old mind one terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone the question for him now was have i really allowed napoleon to reach moscow and when did i do so when was it decided can it have been yesterday when i ordered platov to retreat or was it the evening before when i had a nap and told bennigsen to issue orders or was it earlier still when when was this terrible affair decided moscow must be abandoned the army must retreat and the order to do so must be given to give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army and not only did he love power to which he was accustomed the honours awarded to prince prozorovski under whom he had served in turkey galled him but he was convinced that he was destined to save russia and that that was why against the wish and by the will of the people he had been chosen commander in chief he was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in these difficult circumstances and that in all the world he alone could encounter the invincible napoleon without fear and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue but something had to be decided and these conversations around him which were assuming too free a character must be stopped 
 he called the most important generals to him 
 my head be it good or bad must depend on itself said he rising from the bench and he rode to fili where his carriages were waiting

 chapter ii 
 
 embryonic formation of crimes in the incubation of prisons 
 triumph in the gorbeau hovel seemed complete but had not been so 
 in the first place and this constituted the principal anxiety javert had not taken the prisoner prisoner 
 the assassinated man who flees is more suspicious than the assassin and it is probable that this personage who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians would be no less fine a prize for the authorities 
 and then montparnasse had escaped javert 
 another opportunity of laying hands on that dandy must be waited for 
 montparnasse had in fact encountered eponine as she stood on the watch under the trees of the boulevard and had led her off preferring to play nemorin with the daughter rather than schinderhannes with the father 
 it was well that he did so he was free 
 as for eponine javert had caused her to be seized a mediocre consolation 
 eponine had joined azelma at les madelonettes 
 and finally on the way from the gorbeau house to la force one of the principal prisoners claquesous had been lost 
 it was not known how this had been effected the police agents and the sergeants could not understand it at all 
 he had converted himself into vapor he had slipped through the handcuffs he had trickled through the crevices of the carriage the fiacre was cracked and he had fled all that they were able to say was that on arriving at the prison there was no claquesous 
 either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it 
 had claquesous melted into the shadows like a in water 
 had there been unavowed connivance of the police agents did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder was he concentric with infraction and repression 
 had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority javert did not accept such comminations and would have bristled up against such compromises but his squad included other inspectors besides himself who were more initiated than he perhaps although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the prefecture and claquesous had been such a villain that he might make a very good agent it is an excellent thing for ruffianism and an admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night these rascals do exist 
 however that may be claquesous had gone astray and was not found again 
 javert appeared to be more irritated than amazed at this 
 as for marius that booby of a lawyer who had probably become frightened and whose name javert had forgotten javert attached very little importance to him 
 moreover a lawyer can be hunted up at any time 
 but was he a lawyer after all 
 the investigation had begun 
 the magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men of the band of patron minette in close confinement in the hope that he would chatter 
 this man was brujon the man of the rue du he had been let loose in the charlemagne courtyard and the eyes of the watchers were fixed on him 
 this name of brujon is one of the souvenirs of la force in that hideous courtyard called the court of the new building which the administration called the court and which the robbers called the the ditch on that wall covered with scales and leprosy which rose on the left to a level with the roofs near an old door of rusty iron which led to the ancient chapel of the ducal residence of la force then turned in a dormitory for ruffians there could still be seen twelve years ago a sort of fortress roughly carved in the stone with a nail and beneath it this signature 
 brujon 
 the brujon of was the father of the brujon of 
 the latter of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the gorbeau house was a very cunning and very adroit young spark with a bewildered and plaintive air 
 it was in consequence of this plaintive air that the magistrate had released him thinking him more useful in the charlemagne yard than in close confinement 
 robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands of justice 
 they do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as that 
 to be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning on another crime 
 they are artists who have one picture in the salon and who toil none the less on a new work in their studios 
 brujon seemed to be stupefied by prison 
 he could sometimes be seen standing by the hour together in front of the window in the charlemagne yard staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices which began with 
 garlic centimes and ended with 
 cigar centimes 
 or he passed his time in trembling chattering his teeth saying that he had a fever and inquiring whether one of the eight and twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant 
 all at once towards the end of february it was discovered that brujon that somnolent fellow had had three different commissions executed by the of the establishment not under his own name but in the name of three of his comrades and they had cost him in all fifty sous an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of the prison corporal 
 inquiries were instituted and on consulting the tariff of commissions posted in the parlor it was learned that the fifty sous could be analyzed as follows 
 three commissions one to the pantheon ten sous one to fifteen sous and one to the barriere de grenelle sous 
 this last was the dearest of the whole tariff 
 now at the pantheon at the and at the barriere de grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable prowlers of the barriers kruideniers alias bizarre glorieux an and upon whom the attention of the police was directed by this incident it was thought that these men were members of patron minette two of those leaders babet and gueulemer had been captured it was supposed that the messages which had been addressed not to houses but to people who were waiting for them in the street must have contained information with regard to some crime that had been plotted 
 they were in possession of other indications they laid hand on the three prowlers and supposed that they had circumvented some one or other of machinations 
 about a week after these measures had been taken one night as the superintendent of the watch who had been inspecting the lower dormitory in the was about to drop his chestnut in the was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their duties punctually every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all the boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories a watchman looked through the of the dormitory and beheld brujon sitting on his bed and writing something by the light of the the guardian entered brujon was put in a solitary cell for a month but they were not able to seize what he had written the police learned nothing further about it 
 what is certain is that on the following morning a postilion was flung from the charlemagne yard into the lions ditch over the building which separated the two 
 what prisoners call a postilion is a pallet of bread artistically moulded which is sent into ireland that is to say over the roofs of a prison from one courtyard to another etymology 
 over england from one land to another into ireland this little pellet falls in the yard 
 the man who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note addressed to some prisoner in that yard if it is a prisoner who finds the treasure he forwards the note to its destination if it is a keeper or one of the prisoners secretly sold who are called sheep in prisons and foxes in the galleys the note is taken to the office and handed over to the police 
 on this occasion the postilion reached its address although the person to whom it was addressed was at that moment in solitary confinement 
 this person was no other than babet one of the four heads of patron minette 
 the postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lines were written 
 babet 
 there is an affair in the rue plumet 
 a gate on a garden 
 this is what brujon had written the night before 
 in spite of male and female searchers babet managed to pass the note on from la force to the salpetriere to a good friend whom he had and who was shut up there 
 this woman in turn transmitted the note to another woman of her acquaintance a certain magnon who was strongly suspected by the police though not yet arrested this magnon whose name the reader has already seen had relations with the thenardier which will be described in detail later on and she could by going to see eponine serve as a bridge between the salpetriere and les madelonettes 
 it happened that at precisely that moment as proofs were wanting in the investigation directed against thenardier in the matter of his daughters eponine and azelma were released 
 when eponine came out magnon who was watching the gate of the madelonettes handed her note to babet charging her to look into the matter 
 eponine went to the rue plumet recognized the gate and the garden observed the house spied lurked and a few days later brought to magnon who delivers in the rue clocheperce a biscuit which magnon transmitted to mistress in the salpetriere a biscuit in the shady symbolism of prisons signifies 
 nothing to be done 
 so that in less than a week from that time as brujon and babet met in the circle of la force the one on his way to the examination the other on his way from it 
 well asked brujon the rue p 
 biscuit replied babet 
 thus did the foetus of crime engendered by brujon in la force miscarry 
 this miscarriage had its consequences however which were perfectly distinct from programme 
 the reader will see what they were 
 often when we think we are knotting one thread we are tying quite another

 chapteriv iv 
 
 the council of war began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the better and roomier part of andrew hut the men women and children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across the passage only malasha granddaughter whom his serene highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar while drinking his tea remained on the top of the brick oven in the larger room malasha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the faces uniforms and decorations of the generals who one after another came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner under the icons granddad himself as malasha in her own mind called kutuzov sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven he sat sunk deep in a folding armchair and continually cleared his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat which though it was unbuttoned still seemed to pinch his neck those who entered went up one by one to the field marshal he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others his adjutant kaysarov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing kutuzov but the latter moved his hand angrily and kaysarov understood that his serene highness did not wish his face to be seen 
 round the deal table on which lay maps plans pencils and papers so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another bench and put it beside the table ermolov kaysarov and toll who had just arrived sat down on this bench in the foremost place immediately under the icons sat barclay de tolly his high forehead merging into his bald crown he had a st cross round his neck and looked pale and ill he had been feverish for two days and was now shivering and in pain beside him sat uvarov who with rapid gesticulations was giving him some information speaking in low tones as they all did chubby little dokhturov was listening attentively with eyebrows raised and arms folded on his stomach on the other side sat count seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts his broad head with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand raevski twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habit glanced now at kutuzov and now at the door with a look of impatience firm handsome and kindly face was lit up by a tender sly smile his glance met and the expression of his eyes caused the little girl to smile 
 they were all waiting for bennigsen who on the pretext of inspecting the position was finishing his savory dinner they waited for him from four till six and did not begin their deliberations all that time talked in low tones of other matters 
 only when bennigsen had entered the hut did kutuzov leave his corner and draw toward the table but not near enough for the candles that had been placed there to light up his face 
 bennigsen opened the council with the question are we to abandon ancient and sacred capital without a struggle or are we to defend it a prolonged and general silence followed there was a frown on every face and only angry grunts and occasional cough broke the silence all eyes were gazing at him malasha too looked at granddad she was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered he seemed about to cry but this did not last long 
 ancient and sacred capital he suddenly said repeating words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the false note in them allow me to tell you your excellency that that question has no meaning for a russian he lurched his heavy body forward such a question cannot be put it is senseless the question i have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one the question is that of saving russia is it better to give up moscow without a battle or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well as moscow that is the question on which i want your opinion and he sank back in his chair 
 the discussion began bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost admitting the view of barclay and others that a defensive battle at fili was impossible but imbued with russian patriotism and the love of moscow he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank during the night and attack the french right flank the following day opinions were divided and arguments were advanced for and against that project ermolov dokhturov and raevski agreed with bennigsen whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital or guided by other personal considerations these generals seemed not to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course of events and that moscow was in effect already abandoned the other generals however understood it and leaving aside the question of moscow of the direction the army should take in its retreat malasha who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her understood the meaning of the council differently it seemed to her that it was only a personal struggle between granddad and as she termed bennigsen she saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one another and in her heart she sided with granddad in the midst of the conversation she noticed granddad give bennigsen a quick subtle glance and then to her joys he saw that granddad said something to which settled him bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room what so affected him was calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to attack the french right wing 
 gentlemen said kutuzov i cannot approve of the plan moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous and military history supports that view for instance kutuzov seemed to reflect searching for an example then with a clear naive look at bennigsen he added oh yes take the battle of friedland which i think the count well remembers and which was not fully successful only because our troops were rearranged too near the enemy 
 there followed a momentary pause which seemed very long to them all 
 the discussion recommenced but pauses frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to be said 
 during one of these pauses kutuzov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to speak they all looked at him 
 well gentlemen i see that it is i who will have to pay for the broken crockery said he and rising slowly he moved to the table gentlemen i have heard your views some of you will not agree with me but i he paused by the authority entrusted to me by my sovereign and country order a retreat 
 after that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and circumspect silence of people who are leaving after a funeral 
 some of the generals in low tones and in a strain very different from the way they had spoken during the council communicated something to their commander in chief 
 malasha who had long been expected for supper climbed carefully backwards down from the oven her bare little feet catching at its projections and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted out of the room 
 when he had dismissed the generals kutuzov sat a long time with his elbows on the table thinking always of the same terrible question when when did the abandonment of moscow become inevitable when was that done which settled the matter and who was to blame for it 
 i did not expect this said he to his adjutant schneider when the latter came in late that night i did not expect this i did not think this would happen 
 you should take some rest your serene highness replied schneider 
 but no they shall eat horseflesh yet like the turks exclaimed kutuzov without replying striking the table with his podgy fist they shall too if only

 apparition to father mabeuf 
 marius no longer went to see any one but he sometimes encountered father mabeuf by chance 
 while marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may be called the cellar stairs and which lead to places without light where the happy can be heard walking overhead m mabeuf was descending on his side 
 the flora of cauteretz no longer sold at all 
 the experiments on indigo had not been successful in the little garden of austerlitz which had a bad exposure 
 m mabeuf could cultivate there only a few plants which love shade and dampness 
 nevertheless he did not become discouraged 
 he had obtained a corner in the jardin des plantes with a good exposure to make his trials with indigo at his own expense 
 for this purpose he had pawned his copperplates of the flora 
 he had reduced his breakfast to two eggs and he left one of these for his old servant to whom he had paid no wages for the last fifteen months 
 and often his breakfast was his only meal he no longer smiled with his infantile smile he had grown morose and no longer received visitors 
 marius did well not to dream of going thither 
 sometimes at the hour when m mabeuf was on his way to the jardin des plantes the old man and the young man passed each other on the boulevard de they did not speak and only exchanged a melancholy sign of the head 
 a thing it is that there comes a moment when misery looses bonds two men who have been friends become two chance 
 royal the bookseller was dead 
 m mabeuf no longer knew his books his garden or his indigo 
 these were the three forms which happiness pleasure and hope had assumed for him 
 this sufficed him for his living 
 he said to himself

 in the meantime he toiled all day over his plot of indigo and at night he returned home to water his garden and to read his books 
 at that epoch m mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age 
 one evening he had a singular apparition 
 he had returned home while it was still broad daylight mother plutarque whose health was declining was ill and in bed he had dined on a bone on which a little meat lingered and a bit of bread that he had found on the kitchen table and had seated himself on an overturned stone post which took the place of a bench in his garden 
 near this bench there rose after the fashion in a sort of large chest of beams and planks much dilapidated a on the ground floor a on the first there was nothing in the hutch but there were a few apples in the remains of the provision 
 m mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading with the aid of his glasses two books of which he was passionately fond and in which a serious thing at his age he was interested his natural timidity rendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain degree 
 the first of these books was the famous treatise of president delancre de des demons the other was a quarto by mutor de la rubaudiere sur les diables de vauvert et les gobelins de la bievre 
 this old volume interested him all the more because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in former times 
 the twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and to blacken all below as he read over the top of the book which he held in his hand father mabeuf was surveying his plants and among others a magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations four days of heat wind and sun without a drop of rain had passed the stalks were bending the buds drooping the leaves falling all this needed water the rhododendron was particularly sad father mabeuf was one of those persons for whom plants have souls the old man had toiled all day over his indigo plot he was worn out with fatigue but he rose laid his books on the bench and walked all bent over and with tottering footsteps to the well but when he had grasped the chain he could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it 
 then he turned round and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars 
 the evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man beneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy 
 the night promised to be as arid as the day had been 
 stars everywhere thought the old man not the tiniest cloud not a drop of water 
 and his head which had been upraised for a moment fell back upon his breast 
 he raised it again and once more looked at the sky murmuring 
 a tear of dew 
 a little pity 
 he tried again to unhook the chain of the well and could not 
 at that moment he heard a voice saying 
 father mabeuf would you like to have me water your garden for you 
 at the same time a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible in the hedge and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall slender girl who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly at him 
 she had less the air of a human being than of a form which had just blossomed forth from the twilight 
 before father mabeuf who was easily terrified and who was as we have said quick to take alarm was able to reply by a single syllable this being whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness had unhooked the chain plunged in and withdrawn the bucket and filled the and the goodman beheld this apparition which had bare feet and a tattered petticoat running about among the distributing life around her 
 the sound of the on the leaves filled father soul with ecstasy it seemed to him that the rhododendron was happy now 
 the first bucketful emptied the girl drew a second then a third she watered the whole garden 
 there was something about her as she thus ran about among paths where her outline appeared perfectly black waving her angular arms and with her fichu all in rags that resembled a bat 
 when she had finished father mabeuf approached her with tears in his eyes and laid his hand on her brow 
 god will bless you said he you are an angel since you take care of the flowers 
 no she replied 
 i am the devil but all the same to me 
 the old man exclaimed without either waiting for or hearing her response 
 what a pity that i am so unhappy and so poor and that i can 
 do nothing for you 
 you can do something said she 
 what 
 tell me where m marius lives 
 the old man did not understand 
 what monsieur marius 
 he raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that had vanished 
 a young man who used to come here 
 in the meantime m mabeuf had searched his memory 
 ah yes he exclaimed 
 i know what you mean 
 wait monsieur baron marius pontmercy parbleu 
 he lives or rather he no longer well i know 
 as he spoke he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron and he continued 
 hold i know now 
 he very often passes along the boulevard and goes in the direction of the glaciere rue croulebarbe the meadow of the lark 
 go there 
 it is not hard to meet him 
 when m mabeuf straightened himself up there was no longer any one there the girl had disappeared 
 he was decidedly terrified 
 really he thought if my garden had not been watered i should think that she was a spirit 
 an hour later when he was in bed it came back to him and as he fell asleep at that confused moment when thought like that fabulous bird which changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea little by little assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber he said to himself in a bewildered way 
 in sooth that greatly resembles what rubaudiere narrates of the goblins 
 could it have been a goblin

 wait monsieur baron marius pontmercy parbleu 
 he lives or rather he no longer well i know 
 as he spoke he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron and he continued 
 hold i know now 
 he very often passes along the boulevard and goes in the direction of the glaciere rue croulebarbe the meadow of the lark 
 go there 
 it is not hard to meet him 
 when m mabeuf straightened himself up there was no longer any one there the girl had disappeared 
 he was decidedly terrified 
 really he thought if my garden had not been watered i should think that she was a spirit 
 an hour later when he was in bed it came back to him and as he fell asleep at that confused moment when thought like that fabulous bird which changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea little by little assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber he said to himself in a bewildered way 
 in sooth that greatly resembles what rubaudiere narrates of the goblins 
 could it have been a goblin

 at that very time in circumstances even more important than retreating without a battle namely the evacuation and burning of moscow rostopchin who is usually represented as being the instigator of that event acted in an altogether different manner from kutuzov 
 after the battle of borodino the abandonment and burning of moscow was as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond moscow without fighting 
 every russian might have predicted it not by reasoning but by the feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers 
 the same thing that took place in moscow had happened in all the towns and villages on russian soil beginning with smolensk without the participation of count rostopchin and his broadsheets the people awaited the enemy unconcernedly did not riot or become excited or tear anyone to pieces but faced its fate feeling within it the strength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment and as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left 
 the consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and is present in the heart of every russian and a consciousness of this and a foreboding that moscow would be taken was present in russian moscow society in those who had quitted moscow already in july and at the beginning of august showed that they expected this those who went away taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits but unobtrusively simply organically and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results 
 it is disgraceful to run away from danger only cowards are running away from moscow they were told in his broadsheets rostopchin impressed on them that to leave moscow was shameful they were ashamed to be called cowards ashamed to leave but still they left knowing it had to be done why did they go it is impossible to suppose that rostopchin had scared them by his accounts of horrors napoleon had committed in conquered countries the first people to go away were the rich educated people who knew quite well that vienna and berlin had remained intact and that during occupation the inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming frenchmen whom the russians and especially the russian ladies then liked so much 
 they went away because for russians there could be no question as to whether things would go well or ill under french rule in moscow it was out of the question to be under french rule it would be the worst thing that could happen they went away even before the battle of borodino and still more rapidly after it despite calls to defend moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the icon of the iberian mother of god and go to fight or of the balloons that were to destroy the french and despite all the nonsense rostopchin wrote in his broadsheets they knew that it was for the army to fight and that if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house serfs to the three hills quarter of moscow to fight napoleon and that they must go away sorry as they were to abandon their property to destruction they went away without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to destruction for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned they went away each on his own account and yet it was only in consequence of their going away that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the greatest glory of the russian people the lady who afraid of being stopped by count orders had already in june moved with her negroes and her women jesters from moscow to her saratov estate with a vague consciousness that she was not servant was really simply and truly carrying out the great work which saved russia but count rostopchin who now taunted those who left moscow and now had the government offices removed now distributed quite useless weapons to the drunken rabble now had processions displaying the icons and now forbade father augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints now seized all the private carts in moscow and on one hundred and of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by leppich now hinted that he would burn moscow and related how he had set fire to his own house now wrote a proclamation to the french solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his orphanage now claimed the glory of having hinted that he would burn moscow and now repudiated the deed now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him and now reproached them for doing so now expelled all the french residents from moscow and now allowed madame the center of the whole french colony in moscow to remain but ordered the venerable old postmaster klyucharev to be arrested and exiled for no particular offense now assembled the people at the three hills to fight the french and now to get rid of them handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by a back gate now declared that he would not survive the fall of moscow and now wrote french verses in albums concerning his share in the affair this man did not understand the meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would astonish people to perform some patriotically heroic feat and like a child he made sport of the momentous and unavoidable event the abandonment and burning of moscow and tried with his puny hand now to speed and now to stay the enormous popular tide that bore him along with it

 an apparition to marius 
 some days after this visit of a spirit to farmer mabeuf one morning it was on a monday the day when marius borrowed the piece from courfeyrac for had put this coin in his pocket and before carrying it to the office he had gone to take a little stroll in the hope that this would make him work on his return 
 it was always thus however 
 as soon as he rose he seated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in order to scribble some translation his task at that epoch consisted in turning into french a celebrated quarrel between germans the gans and savigny controversy he took savigny he took gans read four lines tried to write one could not saw a star between him and his paper and rose from his chair saying 
 i shall go out that will put me in spirits 
 and off he went to the meadow 
 there he beheld more than ever the star and less than ever savigny and gans 
 he returned home tried to take up his work again and did not succeed there was no means of a single one of the threads which were broken in his brain then he said to himself 
 i will not go out it prevents my working 
 and he went out every day 
 he lived in the meadow more than in lodgings that was his real address 
 boulevard de la sante at the seventh tree from the rue croulebarbe 
 that morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on the parapet of the river des gobelins 
 a cheerful sunlight penetrated the freshly unfolded and luminous leaves 
 he was dreaming of her 
 and his meditation turning to a reproach fell back upon himself he reflected dolefully on his idleness his paralysis of soul which was gaining on him and of that night which was growing more dense every moment before him to such a point that he no longer even saw the sun 
 nevertheless athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas which was not even a monologue so feeble had action become in him and he had no longer the force to care to despair athwart this melancholy absorption sensations from without did reach him he heard behind him beneath him on both banks of the river the laundresses of the gobelins beating their linen and above his head the birds chattering and singing in the on the one hand the sound of liberty the careless happiness of the leisure which has wings on the other the sound of toil what caused him to meditate deeply and almost reflect were two cheerful sounds 
 all at once in the midst of his dejected ecstasy he heard a familiar voice saying 
 come 
 here he is 
 he raised his eyes and recognized that wretched child who had come to him one morning the elder of the thenardier daughters eponine he knew her name now 
 strange to say she had grown poorer and prettier two steps which it had not seemed within her power to take she had accomplished a double progress towards the light and towards distress 
 she was barefooted and in rags as on the day when she had so resolutely entered his chamber only her rags were two months older now the holes were larger the tatters more sordid it was the same harsh voice the same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan the same free wild and vacillating glance 
 she had besides more than formerly in her face that indescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in a prison adds to wretchedness 
 she had bits of straw and hay in her hair not like ophelia through having gone mad from the contagion of madness but because she had slept in the loft of some stable 
 and in spite of it all she was beautiful 
 what a star art thou o youth 
 in the meantime she had halted in front of marius with a trace of joy in her livid countenance and something which resembled a smile 
 she stood for several moments as though incapable of speech 
 so i have met you at last she said at length 
 father mabeuf was right it was on this boulevard 
 how i have hunted for you if you only knew 
 do you know 
 i have been in the jug 
 a fortnight they let me out seeing that there was nothing against me and that moreover i had not reached years of discretion 
 i lack two months of it 
 oh how i have hunted for you 
 these six weeks so you live down there any more

 why do you wear old hats like this 
 a young man like you ought to have fine clothes do you know monsieur marius father mabeuf calls you baron marius i know what 
 it true that you are a baron 
 barons are old fellows they go to the luxembourg in front of the chateau where there is the most sun and they read the quotidienne for a sou i once carried a letter to a baron of that sort 
 he was over a hundred years old 
 say where do you live now 
 marius made no reply 
 ah she went on you have a hole in your shirt 
 i must sew it up for you 
 she resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over 
 you seem glad to see me 
 marius held his peace she remained silent for a moment then exclaimed 
 but if i choose nevertheless i could force you to look glad 
 what demanded marius 
 what do you mean 
 ah you used to call me thou she retorted 
 well then what dost thou mean 
 she bit her lips she seemed to hesitate as though a prey to some sort of inward conflict 
 at last she appeared to come to a decision 
 so much the worse i care 
 you have a melancholy air i want you to be pleased 
 only promise me that you will smile i want to see you smile and hear you say 
 ah well good poor mr marius you know 
 you promised me that you would give me anything i like 
 yes 
 only speak 
 she looked marius full in the eye and said

 marius turned pale 
 all the blood flowed back to his heart 
 what address 
 the address that you asked me to get 
 she added as though with an effort 
 the know very well 
 yes stammered marius 
 of that young lady 
 this word uttered she sighed deeply 
 marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized her hand distractedly 
 oh 
 well lead me thither 
 tell me 
 ask of me anything you wish where is it 
 come with me she responded 
 i know the street or number very well it is in quite the other direction from here but i know the house well i will take you to it 
 she withdrew her hand and went on in a tone which could have rent the heart of an observer but which did not even graze marius in his intoxicated and ecstatic state 
 oh how glad you are 
 a cloud swept across marius brow 
 he seized eponine by the arm 
 swear one thing to me 
 swear said she what does that mean 
 come 
 you want me to swear 
 and she laughed 
 your father promise me eponine 
 swear to me that you will not give this address to your father 
 she turned to him with a stupefied air 
 eponine 
 how do you know that my name is eponine 
 promise what i tell you 
 but she did not seem to hear him 
 nice 
 you have called me eponine 
 marius grasped both her arms at once 
 but answer me in the name of heaven pay attention to what i am saying to you swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that you know 
 my father said she 
 ah yes my father

 after a few steps she halted 
 you are following me too closely monsieur marius 
 let me go on ahead and follow me so without seeming to do it 
 a nice young man like you must not be seen with a woman like me 
 no tongue can express all that lay in that word woman thus pronounced by that child 
 she proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more marius joined her she addressed him sideways and without turning towards him 
 by the way you know that you promised me something 
 marius fumbled in his pocket 
 all that he owned in the world was the five francs intended for thenardier the father 
 he took them and laid them in hand 
 she opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground and gazed at him with a gloomy air 
 i want your money said she

 book eleven 
 chapter vi 
 
 helene having returned with the court from vilna to petersburg found herself in a difficult position 
 in petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who occupied one of the highest posts in the empire in vilna she had formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince when she returned to petersburg both the magnate and the prince were there and both claimed their rights helene was faced by a new problem how to preserve her intimacy with both without offending either 
 what would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did not cause the least embarrassment to countess bezukhova who evidently deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman had she attempted concealment or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position by cunning she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself guilty but helene like a really great man who can do whatever he pleases at once assumed her own position to be correct as she sincerely believed it to be and that everyone else was to blame 
 the first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her she lifted her beautiful head and half turning to him said firmly just like a man selfish and cruel i expected nothing else a woman sacrifices herself for you she suffers and this is her reward what right have you monseigneur to demand an account of my attachments and friendships he is a man who has been more than a father to me the prince was about to say something but helene interrupted him 
 well yes said she it may be that he has other sentiments for me than those of a father but that is not a reason for me to shut my door on him i am not a man that i should repay kindness with ingratitude know monseigneur that in all that relates to my intimate feelings i render account only to god and to my conscience she concluded laying her hand on her beautiful fully expanded bosom and looking up to heaven 
 but for sake listen to me 
 marry me and i will be your slave 
 but impossible 
 you deign to demean yourself by marrying me you said helene beginning to cry 
 the prince tried to comfort her but helene as if quite distraught said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying that there were precedents there were up to that time very few but she mentioned napoleon and some other exalted personages that she had never been her wife and that she had been sacrificed 
 but the law religion said the prince already yielding 
 the law religion what have they been invented for if they arrange that said helene 
 the prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the society of jesus with whom he was on intimate terms 
 a few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which helene gave at her country house on the stone island the charming monsieur de jobert a man no longer young with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes a jesuit a robe courte was presented to her and in the garden by the light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a long time of the love of god of christ of the sacred heart and of the consolations the one true catholic religion affords in this world and the next helene was touched and more than once tears rose to her eyes and to those of monsieur de jobert and their voices trembled a dance for which her partner came to seek her put an end to her discourse with her future directeur de conscience but the next evening monsieur de jobert came to see helene when she was alone and after that often came again 
 lay member of the society of jesus 
 one day he took the countess to a roman catholic church where she knelt down before the altar to which she was led the enchanting frenchman laid his hands on her head and as she herself afterward described it she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her soul it was explained to her that this was la grace 
 after that a abbe was brought to her she confessed to him and he absolved her from her sins next day she received a box containing the sacred host which was left at her house for her to partake of a few days later helene learned with pleasure that she had now been admitted to the true catholic church and that in a few days the pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document 
 all that was done around her and to her at this time all the attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant refined ways and the state of purity she was now in she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time gave her pleasure but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim and as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones helene having realized that the main object of all these words and all this trouble was after converting her to catholicism to obtain money from her for jesuit institutions as to which she received indications before parting with her money insisted that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband should be performed in her view the aim of every religion was merely to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to human desires and with this aim in one of her talks with her father confessor she insisted on an answer to the question in how far was she bound by her marriage 
 they were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room the scent of flowers came in at the window helene was wearing a white dress transparent over her shoulders and bosom the abbe a man with a plump chin a pleasant firm mouth and white hands meekly folded on his knees sat close to helene and with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the subject helene with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his plump blackish cheeks and every moment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn but the abbe though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion was absorbed in his mastery of the matter 
 the course of the father arguments ran as follows ignorant of the import of what you were undertaking you made a vow of conjugal fidelity to a man who on his part by entering the married state without faith in the religious significance of marriage committed an act of sacrilege that marriage lacked the dual significance it should have had yet in spite of this your vow was binding you swerved from it what did you commit by so acting a venial or a mortal sin a venial sin for you acted without evil intention if now you married again with the object of bearing children your sin might be forgiven but the question is again a twofold one firstly 
 but suddenly helene who was getting bored said with one of her bewitching smiles but i think that having espoused the true religion i cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me 
 the director of her conscience was astounded at having the case presented to him thus with the simplicity of columbus egg he was delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his progress but could not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed 
 let us understand one another countess said he with a smile and began refuting his spiritual arguments

 book house in the rue plumet 
 chapter i 
 
 the house with a secret 
 about the middle of the last century a chief justice in the parliament of paris having a mistress and concealing the fact for at that period the grand seignors displayed their mistresses and the bourgeois concealed them had a little house built in the faubourg in the deserted rue blomet which is now called rue plumet not far from the spot which was then designated as combat des animaux 
 this house was composed of a pavilion two rooms on the ground floor two chambers on the first floor a kitchen down stairs a boudoir up stairs an attic under the roof the whole preceded by a garden with a large gate opening on the street this garden was about an acre and a half in extent 
 this was all that could be seen by but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard and at the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and a cellar a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and nurse in case of need 
 this building communicated in the rear by a masked door which opened by a secret spring with a long narrow paved winding corridor open to the sky hemmed in with two lofty walls which hidden with wonderful art and lost as it were between garden enclosures and cultivated land all of whose angles and detours it followed ended in another door also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league away almost in another quarter at the solitary extremity of the rue du babylone 
 through this the chief justice entered so that even those who were spying on him and following him would merely have observed that the justice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere and would never have suspected that to go to the rue de babylone was to go to the rue blomet 
 thanks to clever purchasers of land the magistrate had been able to make a secret passage on his own property and consequently without interference 
 later on he had sold in little parcels for gardens and market gardens the lots of ground adjoining the corridor and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought they had a party wall before their eyes and did not even suspect the long paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their and their orchards only the birds beheld this curiosity 
 it is probable that the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal about the chief justice 
 the pavilion built of stone in the taste of mansard wainscoted and furnished in the watteau style rocaille on the inside on the outside walled in with a triple hedge of flowers had something discreet coquettish and solemn about it as befits a caprice of love and magistracy 
 this house and corridor which have now disappeared were in existence fifteen years ago 
 in a coppersmith had purchased the house with the idea of demolishing it but had not been able to pay the price the nation made him bankrupt 
 so that it was the house which demolished the coppersmith 
 after that the house remained uninhabited and fell slowly to ruin as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does not communicate life it had remained fitted with its old furniture was always for sale or to let and the ten or a dozen people who passed through the rue plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 
 towards the end of the restoration these same might have noticed that the bill had disappeared and even that the shutters on the first floor were open 
 the house was occupied in fact the windows had short curtains a sign that there was a woman about 
 in the month of october a man of a certain age had presented himself and had hired the house just as it stood including of course the back building and the lane which ended in the rue de babylone he had had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired the house as we have just mentioned was still very nearly furnished with the old fitting the new tenant had ordered some repairs had added what was lacking here and there had replaced the in the yard bricks in the floors steps in the stairs missing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows and had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderly without commotion rather like a person who is slipping in than like a man who is entering his own house

 at the same time he hired two other apartments in paris in order that he might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the same quarter and so that he could at need take himself off at the slightest disquietude which should assail him and in short so that he might not again be caught unprovided as on the night when he had so miraculously escaped from javert these two apartments were very pitiable poor in appearance and in two quarters which were far remote from each other the one in the rue de the other in the rue de arme 
 he went from time to time now to the rue de arme now to the rue de to pass a month or six weeks without taking toussaint 
 he had himself served by the porters and gave himself out as a gentleman from the suburbs living on his funds and having a little temporary in town this lofty virtue had three domiciles in paris for the sake of escaping from the police 
 the house with a secret 
 about the middle of the last century a chief justice in the parliament of paris having a mistress and concealing the fact for at that period the grand seignors displayed their mistresses and the bourgeois concealed them had a little house built in the faubourg in the deserted rue blomet which is now called rue plumet not far from the spot which was then designated as combat des animaux 
 this house was composed of a pavilion two rooms on the ground floor two chambers on the first floor a kitchen down stairs a boudoir up stairs an attic under the roof the whole preceded by a garden with a large gate opening on the street this garden was about an acre and a half in extent 
 this was all that could be seen by but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard and at the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and a cellar a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and nurse in case of need 
 this building communicated in the rear by a masked door which opened by a secret spring with a long narrow paved winding corridor open to the sky hemmed in with two lofty walls which hidden with wonderful art and lost as it were between garden enclosures and cultivated land all of whose angles and detours it followed ended in another door also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league away almost in another quarter at the solitary extremity of the rue du babylone 
 through this the chief justice entered so that even those who were spying on him and following him would merely have observed that the justice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere and would never have suspected that to go to the rue de babylone was to go to the rue blomet 
 thanks to clever purchasers of land the magistrate had been able to make a secret passage on his own property and consequently without interference 
 later on he had sold in little parcels for gardens and market gardens the lots of ground adjoining the corridor and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought they had a party wall before their eyes and did not even suspect the long paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their and their orchards only the birds beheld this curiosity 
 it is probable that the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal about the chief justice 
 the pavilion built of stone in the taste of mansard wainscoted and furnished in the watteau style rocaille on the inside on the outside walled in with a triple hedge of flowers had something discreet coquettish and solemn about it as befits a caprice of love and magistracy 
 this house and corridor which have now disappeared were in existence fifteen years ago 
 in a coppersmith had purchased the house with the idea of demolishing it but had not been able to pay the price the nation made him bankrupt 
 so that it was the house which demolished the coppersmith 
 after that the house remained uninhabited and fell slowly to ruin as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does not communicate life it had remained fitted with its old furniture was always for sale or to let and the ten or a dozen people who passed through the rue plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 
 towards the end of the restoration these same might have noticed that the bill had disappeared and even that the shutters on the first floor were open 
 the house was occupied in fact the windows had short curtains a sign that there was a woman about 
 in the month of october a man of a certain age had presented himself and had hired the house just as it stood including of course the back building and the lane which ended in the rue de babylone he had had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired the house as we have just mentioned was still very nearly furnished with the old fitting the new tenant had ordered some repairs had added what was lacking here and there had replaced the in the yard bricks in the floors steps in the stairs missing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows and had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderly without commotion rather like a person who is slipping in than like a man who is entering his own house 
 the neighbors did not gossip about him for the reason that there were no neighbors 
 this unobtrusive tenant was jean valjean the young girl was cosette the servant was a woman named toussaint whom jean valjean had saved from the hospital and from wretchedness and who was elderly a stammerer and from the provinces three qualities which had decided jean valjean to take her with him

 book eleven 
 chapter vii 
 
 helene understood that the question was very simple and easy from the ecclesiastical point of view and that her directors were making difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter would be regarded by the secular authorities 
 so she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society she provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she had told her other suitor that is she put the matter so that the only way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her the elderly magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage with a woman whose husband was alive as the younger man had been but imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him too had helene herself shown the least sign of hesitation shame or secrecy her cause would certainly have been lost but not only did she show no signs of secrecy or shame on the contrary with naivete she told her intimate friends and these were all petersburg that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was afraid of grieving either 
 a rumor immediately spread in petersburg not that helene wanted to be divorced from her husband had such a report spread many would have opposed so illegal an intention but simply that the unfortunate and interesting helene was in doubt which of the two men she should marry the question was no longer whether this was possible but only which was the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court there were it is true some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of such a question who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage but there were not many such and they remained silent while the majority were interested in good fortune and in the question which match would be the more advantageous whether it was right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not discuss for that question had evidently been settled by people wiser than you or me as they said and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk exposing stupidity and incapacity to live in society 
 only marya dmitrievna akhrosimova had come to petersburg that summer to see one of her sons allowed herself plainly to express an opinion contrary to the general one meeting helene at a ball she stopped her in the middle of the room and amid general silence said in her gruff voice so wives of living men have started marrying again perhaps you think you have invented a novelty you have been forestalled my dear it was thought of long ago it is done in all the brothels and with these words marya dmitrievna turning up her wide sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round moved across the room 
 though people were afraid of marya dmitrievna she was regarded in petersburg as a buffoon and so of what she had said they only noticed and repeated in a whisper the one coarse word she had used supposing the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word 
 prince vasili who of late very often forgot what he had said and repeated one and the same thing a hundred times remarked to his daughter whenever he chanced to see her 
 helene i have a word to say to you and he would lead her aside drawing her hand downward i have heard of certain projects concerning you know well my dear child you know how your heart rejoices to know that you you have suffered so much but my dear child consult only your own heart that is all i have to say and concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his and move away 
 bilibin who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man and who was one of one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as helene always has men friends who can never change into lovers once gave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering 
 listen bilibin said helene she always called friends of that sort by their surnames and she touched his coat sleeve with her white beringed fingers tell me as you would a sister what i ought to do which of the two 
 bilibin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered with a smile on his lips 
 you are not taking me unawares you know said he as a true friend i have thought and thought again about your affair you see if you marry the prince he meant the younger man and he crooked one finger you forever lose the chance of marrying the other and you will displease the court besides you know there is some kind of connection but if you marry the old count you will make his last days happy and as widow of the grand the prince would no longer be making a mesalliance by marrying you and bilibin smoothed out his forehead 
 a true friend said helene beaming and again touching sleeve but i love them you know and want to distress either of them i would give my life for the happiness of them both 
 bilibin shrugged his shoulders as much as to say that not even he could help in that difficulty 
 une what is called putting things squarely she would like to be married to all three at the same time thought he 
 a masterly woman 
 but tell me how will your husband look at the matter bilibin asked his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so naive a question will he agree 
 oh he loves me so said helene who for some reason imagined that pierre too loved her he will do anything for me 
 bilibin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty 
 even divorce you said he 
 helene laughed 
 among those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed marriage was mother princess kuragina she was continually tormented by jealousy of her daughter and now that jealousy concerned a subject near to her own heart she could not reconcile herself to the idea she consulted a russian priest as to the possibility of divorce and remarriage during a lifetime and the priest told her that it was impossible and to her delight showed her a text in the gospel which as it seemed to him plainly remarriage while the husband is alive 
 armed with these arguments which appeared to her unanswerable she drove to her early one morning so as to find her alone 
 having listened to her objections helene smiled blandly and ironically 
 but it says plainly whosoever shall marry her that is divorced said the old princess 
 ah maman ne dites pas de betises vous ne comprenez rein dans ma position des devoirs said helene changing from russian in which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear into french which suited it better 
 oh mamma talk nonsense you understand anything in my position i have obligations 
 but my dear 
 oh mamma how is it you understand that the holy father who has the right to grant dispensations 
 just then the lady companion who lived with helene came in to announce that his highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her 
 non que je ne veux pas le voir que je suis furieuse contre lui parce m a manque parole 
 no tell him i wish to see him i am furious with him for not keeping his word to me 
 comtesse a tout peche misericorde said a young man with a long face and nose as he entered the room 
 countess there is mercy for every sin 
 the old princess rose respectfully and curtsied the young man who had entered took no notice of her the princess nodded to her daughter and sidled out of the room 
 yes she is right thought the old princess all her convictions dissipated by the appearance of his highness she is right but how is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it yet it is so simple she thought as she got into her carriage 
 by the beginning of august affairs were clearly defined and she wrote a letter to her husband who as she imagined loved her very much informing him of her intention to marry and of her having embraced the one true faith and asking him to carry out all the formalities necessary for a divorce which would be explained to him by the bearer of the letter 
 and so i pray god to have you my friend in his holy and powerful keeping your friend helene 
 this letter was brought to house when he was on the field of borodino

 book house in the rue plumet 
 chapter ii 
 
 jean valjean as a national guard 
 however properly speaking he lived in the rue plumet and he had arranged his existence there in the following fashion 
 cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion she had the big with the painted the boudoir with the gilded fillets the furnished with tapestries and vast she had the garden 
 jean valjean had a canopied bed of antique damask in three colors and a beautiful persian rug purchased in the rue du at mother put into chamber and in order to redeem the severity of these magnificent old things he had amalgamated with this all the gay and graceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young girls an etagere a bookcase filled with books an inkstand a paper a incrusted with mother of pearl a a toilet service in japanese porcelain long damask curtains with a red foundation and three colors like those on the bed hung at the windows of the first floor on the ground floor the curtains were of tapestry 
 all winter long little house was heated from top to bottom 
 jean valjean inhabited the sort of lodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard with a mattress on a a white wood table two straw chairs an earthenware a few old volumes on a shelf his beloved valise in one corner and never any fire 
 he dined with cosette and he had a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use 
 when toussaint came he had said to her 
 it is the young lady who is the mistress of this you monsieur 
 toussaint replied in am a much better thing than the master i am the father 
 cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent and she regulated their expenditure which was very modest 
 every day jean valjean put his arm through and took her for a walk he led her to the luxembourg to the least frequented walk and every sunday he took her to mass at because that was a long way off 
 as it was a very poor quarter he bestowed alms largely there and the poor people surrounded him in church which had drawn down upon him epistle to the benevolent gentleman of the church of he was fond of taking cosette to visit the poor and the sick no stranger ever entered the house in the rue plumet 
 toussaint brought their provisions and jean valjean went himself for water to a fountain near by on the boulevard 
 their wood and wine were put into a hollow lined with which lay near the rue de babylone and which had formerly served the as a grotto for at the epoch of follies and little houses no love was without a grotto 
 in the door opening on the rue de babylone there was a box destined for the reception of letters and papers only as the three inhabitants of the pavilion in the rue plumet received neither papers nor letters the entire usefulness of that box formerly the of a love affair and the confidant of a lawyer was now limited to the notices and the summons of the guard for m fauchelevent independent gentleman belonged to the national guard he had not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of 
 the municipal information collected at that time had even reached the convent of the a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud whence jean valjean had emerged in venerable guise and consequently worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall 
 three or four times a year jean valjean donned his uniform and mounted guard he did this willingly however it was a correct disguise which mixed him with every one and yet left him solitary jean valjean had just attained his sixtieth birthday the age of legal exemption but he did not appear to be over fifty moreover he had no desire to escape his nor to quibble with comte de lobau he possessed no civil status he was concealing his name he was concealing his identity so he concealed his age he concealed everything and as we have just said he willingly did his duty as a national guard the sum of his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his taxes this man had for his ideal within the angel without the bourgeois 
 let us note one detail however when jean valjean went out with cosette he dressed as the reader has already seen and had the air of a retired officer 
 when he went out alone which was generally at night he was always dressed in a trousers and blouse and wore a cap which concealed his face 
 was this precaution or humility both 
 cosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny and hardly noticed her peculiarities 
 as for toussaint she venerated jean valjean and thought everything he did right 
 one day her butcher who had caught a glimpse of jean valjean said to her 
 a queer fish 
 she replied 
 a saint 
 neither jean valjean nor cosette nor toussaint ever entered or emerged except by the door on the rue de babylone 
 unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the rue plumet 
 that gate was always closed 
 jean valjean had left the garden uncultivated in order not to attract attention 
 in this possibly he made a mistake

 book eleven 
 chapter viii 
 
 toward the end of the battle of borodino pierre having run down from battery a second time made his way through a gully to knyazkovo with a crowd of soldiers reached the dressing station and seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on still entangled in the crowds of soldiers 
 the one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own bed he felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt but such ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found 
 though shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he was going still on all sides there was what there had been on the field of battle there were still the same suffering exhausted and sometimes strangely indifferent faces the same blood the same soldiers overcoats the same sounds of firing which though distant now still aroused terror and besides this there were the foul air and the dust 
 having gone a couple of miles along the mozhaysk road pierre sat down by the roadside 
 dusk had fallen and the roar of guns died away pierre lay leaning on his elbow for a long time gazing at the shadows that moved past him in the darkness he was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying toward him with a terrific whizz and then he shuddered and sat up he had no idea how long he had been there in the middle of the night three soldiers having brought some firewood settled down near him and began lighting a fire 
 the soldiers who threw sidelong glances at pierre got the fire to burn and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and put a little dripping the pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with the smell of smoke pierre sat up and sighed the three soldiers were eating and talking among themselves taking no notice of him 
 and who may you be one of them suddenly asked pierre evidently meaning what pierre himself had in mind namely if you want to eat give you some food only let us know whether you are an honest man 
 i i said pierre feeling it necessary to minimize his social position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and better understood by them by rights i am a militia officer but my men are not here i came to the battle and have lost them 
 there now said one of the soldiers 
 another shook his head 
 would you like a little mash the first soldier asked and handed pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean 
 pierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash as they called the food in the cauldron and he thought it more delicious than any food he had ever tasted as he sat bending greedily over it helping himself to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another his was lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence 
 where have you to go to tell us said one of them 
 to mozhaysk 
 a gentleman you 
 yes 
 and your name 
 peter kirilych 
 well then peter kirilych come along with us take you there 
 in the total darkness the soldiers walked with pierre to mozhaysk 
 by the time they got near mozhaysk and began ascending the steep hill into the town the cocks were already crowing pierre went on with the soldiers quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill and that he had already passed it he would not soon have remembered this such was his state of forgetfulness had he not halfway up the hill stumbled upon his groom who had been to look for him in the town and was returning to the inn the groom recognized pierre in the darkness by his white hat 
 your excellency he said why we were beginning to despair how is it you are on foot and where are you going please 
 oh yes said pierre 
 the soldiers stopped 
 so found your folk said one of them well peter kirilych it 
 peter kirilych pierre heard the other voices repeat 
 he said and turned with his groom toward the inn 
 i ought to give them something he thought and felt in his pocket no better not said another inner voice 
 there was not a room to be had at the inn they were all occupied pierre went out into the yard and covering himself up head and all lay down in his carriage

 book house in the rue plumet 
 chapter iii 
 
 foliis ac frondibus 
 the garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become extraordinary and charming 
 the of forty years ago halted to gaze at it without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant depths 
 more than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of that ancient padlocked gate twisted tottering fastened to two green and pillars and oddly crowned with a pediment of undecipherable arabesque 
 there was a stone bench in one corner one or two mouldy statues several lattices which had lost their nails with time were rotting on the wall and there were no walks nor turf but there was enough grass everywhere 
 gardening had taken its departure and nature had returned 
 weeds abounded which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land 
 the festival of gilliflowers was something splendid 
 nothing in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life venerable growth reigned there among them 
 the trees had bent over towards the nettles the plant had sprung upward the branch had inclined that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that which expands in the air that which floats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails in the moss trunks boughs leaves fibres clusters tendrils shoots spines thorns had mingled crossed married confounded themselves in each other vegetation in a deep and close embrace had celebrated and accomplished there under the eye of the creator in that enclosure three hundred feet square the holy mystery of fraternity symbol of the human fraternity this garden was no longer a garden it was a colossal thicket that is to say something as impenetrable as a forest as peopled as a city quivering like a nest sombre like a cathedral fragrant like a bouquet solitary as a tomb living as a throng 
 in floreal this enormous thicket free behind its gate and within its four walls entered upon the secret labor of germination quivered in the rising sun almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love and which feels the sap of april rising and boiling in its veins and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks sprinkled on the damp earth on the defaced statues on the crumbling steps of the pavilion and even on the pavement of the deserted street flowers like stars dew like pearls fecundity beauty life joy perfumes 
 at midday a thousand white butterflies took refuge there and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about there in flakes amid the shade 
 there in those gay shadows of verdure a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul and what the twittering forgot to say the humming completed 
 in the evening a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it a shroud of mist a calm and celestial sadness covered it the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it like an exquisite and subtle poison the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees by day the wings rejoice the leaves by night the leaves protect the wings 
 from april to may 
 in winter the thicket was black dripping bristling shivering and allowed some glimpse of the house 
 instead of flowers on the branches 
 and dew in the flowers the long silvery tracks of the snails were visible on the cold thick carpet of yellow leaves but in any fashion under any aspect at all seasons spring winter summer autumn this tiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy contemplation solitude liberty the absence of man the presence of god and the rusty old gate had the air of saying 
 this garden belongs to me 
 it was of no avail that the pavements of paris were there on every side the classic and splendid hotels of the rue de varennes a couple of paces away the dome of the invalides close at hand the chamber of deputies not far off the carriages of the rue de bourgogne and of the rue rumbled luxuriously in vain in the vicinity in vain did the yellow brown white and red omnibuses cross each course at the neighboring the rue plumet was the desert and the death of the former proprietors the revolution which had passed over it the crumbling away of ancient fortunes absence forgetfulness forty years of abandonment and widowhood had sufficed to restore to this privileged spot ferns mulleins hemlock yarrow tall weeds great crimped plants with large leaves of pale green cloth lizards beetles uneasy and rapid insects to cause to spring forth from the depths of the earth and to reappear between those four walls a certain indescribable and savage grandeur and for nature which disconcerts the petty arrangements of man and which sheds herself always thoroughly where she diffuses herself at all in the ant as well as in the eagle to blossom out in a petty little parisian garden with as much rude force and majesty as in a virgin forest of the new world 
 nothing is small in fact any one who is subject to the profound and penetrating influence of nature knows this 
 although no absolute satisfaction is given to philosophy either to circumscribe the cause or to limit the effect the contemplator falls into those unfathomable ecstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity 
 everything toils at everything

 chapter ix 
 
 scarcely had pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself falling asleep but suddenly almost with the distinctness of reality he heard the boom boom boom of firing the thud of projectiles groans and cries and smelled blood and powder and a feeling of horror and dread of death seized him filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak all was tranquil in the yard only orderly passed through the gateway splashing through the mud and talked to the innkeeper above head some pigeons disturbed by the movement he had made in sitting up fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse the whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable yards delightful to pierre at that moment he could see the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses 
 thank god there is no more of that he thought covering up his head again oh what a terrible thing is fear and how shamefully i yielded to it but they they were steady and calm all the time to the end thought he 
 they in mind were the soldiers those who had been at the battery those who had given him food and those who had prayed before the icon they those strange men he had not previously known stood out clearly and sharply from everyone else 
 to be a soldier just a soldier thought pierre as he fell asleep to enter communal life completely to be imbued by what makes them what they are but how cast off all the superfluous devilish burden of my outer man there was a time when i could have done it i could have run away from my father as i wanted to or i might have been sent to serve as a soldier after the duel with dolokhov and the memory of the dinner at the english club when he had challenged dolokhov flashed through mind and then he remembered his benefactor at torzhok and now a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind it was taking place at the english club and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table yes that is he it is my benefactor but he died thought pierre yes he died and i did not know he was alive how sorry i am that he died and how glad i am that he is alive again on one side of the table sat anatole dolokhov nesvitski denisov and others like them in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of those he termed they and he heard those people anatole and dolokhov shouting and singing loudly yet through their shouting the voice of his benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield but pleasant and comforting pierre did not understand what his benefactor was saying but he knew the categories of thoughts were also quite distinct in his dream that he was talking of goodness and the possibility of being what they were and they with their simple kind firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides but though they were kindly they did not look at pierre and did not know him wishing to speak and to attract their attention he got up but at that moment his legs grew cold and bare he felt ashamed and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact slipped for a moment as he was rearranging his cloak pierre opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs posts and yard but now they were all bluish lit up and glittering with frost or dew 
 it is dawn thought pierre but not what i want i want to hear and understand my words again he covered himself up with his cloak but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there there were only thoughts clearly expressed in words thoughts that someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating 
 afterwards when he recalled those thoughts pierre was convinced that someone outside himself had spoken them though the impressions of that day had evoked them he had never it seemed to him been able to think and express his thoughts like that when awake 
 to endure war is the most difficult subordination of freedom to the law of god the voice had said simplicity is submission to the will of god you cannot escape from him and they are simple they do not talk but act the spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden man can be master of nothing while he fears death but he who does not fear it possesses all if there were no suffering man would not know his limitations would not know himself the hardest thing pierre went on thinking or hearing in his dream is to be able in your soul to unite the meaning of all to unite all he asked himself no not to unite thoughts cannot be united but to harness all these thoughts together is what we need yes one must harness them must harness them he repeated to himself with inward rapture feeling that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented him 
 yes one must harness it is time to harness 
 time to harness time to harness your excellency your excellency some voice was repeating we must harness it is time to harness 
 it was the voice of the groom trying to wake him the sun shone straight into face he glanced at the dirty innyard in the middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump while carts were passing out of the gate pierre turned away with repugnance and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat no i want that i want to see and understand that i want to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream one second more and i should have understood it all but what am i to do harness but how can i harness everything and pierre felt with horror that the meaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed 
 the groom the coachman and the innkeeper told pierre that an officer had come with news that the french were already near mozhaysk and that our men were leaving it 
 pierre got up and having told them to harness and overtake him went on foot through the town 
 the troops were moving on leaving about ten thousand wounded behind them there were wounded in the yards at the windows of the houses and the streets were crowded with them in the streets around carts that were to take some of the wounded away shouts curses and blows could be heard pierre offered the use of his carriage which had overtaken him to a wounded general he knew and drove with him to moscow on the way pierre was told of the death of his anatole and of that of prince andrew

 book house in the rue plumet 
 chapter iv 
 
 change of gate 
 it seemed that this garden created in olden days to conceal wanton mysteries had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries 
 there were no longer either arbors or bowling greens or tunnels or grottos there was a magnificent dishevelled obscurity falling like a veil over all 
 paphos had been made over into eden it is impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreat wholesome 
 this now offered her blossom to the soul 
 this coquettish garden formerly decidedly compromised had returned to virginity and modesty 
 a justice assisted by a gardener a goodman who thought that he was a continuation of lamoignon and another goodman who thought that he was a continuation of lenotre had turned it about cut ruffled decked moulded it to gallantry nature had taken possession of it once more had filled it with shade and had arranged it for love 
 there was also in this solitude a heart which was quite ready love had only to show himself he had here a temple composed of verdure grass moss the sight of birds tender shadows agitated branches and a soul made of sweetness of faith of candor of hope of aspiration and of illusion 
 cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child she was a little more than fourteen and she was at the ungrateful age we have already said that with the exception of her eyes she was homely rather than pretty she had no ungraceful feature but she was awkward thin timid and bold at once a little girl in short 
 her education was finished that is to say she has been taught religion and even and above all devotion then history that is to say the thing that bears that name in convents geography grammar the participles the kings of france a little music a little drawing etc but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant which is a great charm and a great peril 
 the soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark later on mirages that are too abrupt and too lively are formed there as in a dark chamber she should be gently and discreetly enlightened rather with the reflection of realities than with their harsh and direct light a useful and graciously austere which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls 
 there is nothing but the maternal instinct that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman which knows how this is to be created and of what it should consist 
 nothing supplies the place of this instinct 
 all the nuns in the world are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young soul 
 cosette had had no mother 
 she had only had many mothers in the plural 
 as for jean valjean he was indeed all tenderness all solicitude but he was only an old man and he knew nothing at all 
 
 now in this work of education in this grave matter of preparing a woman for life what science is required to combat that vast ignorance which is called innocence 
 nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent the convent turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown the heart thus thrown back upon itself works downward within itself since it cannot overflow and grows deep since it cannot expand hence visions suppositions conjectures outlines of romances a desire for adventures fantastic constructions edifices built wholly in the inner obscurity of the mind sombre and secret abodes where the passions immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to enter 
 the convent is a compression which in order to triumph over the human heart should last during the whole life 
 on quitting the convent cosette could have found nothing more sweet and more dangerous than the house in the rue plumet it was the continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty a garden that was closed but a nature that was acrid rich voluptuous and fragrant the same dreams as in the convent but with glimpses of young men a grating but one that opened on the street 
 still when she arrived there we repeat she was only a child jean valjean gave this neglected garden over to her 
 do what you like with it he said to her 
 this amused cosette she turned over all the clumps and all the stones she hunted for beasts she played in it while awaiting the time when she would dream in it she loved this garden for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass while awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see through the boughs above her head 
 and then she loved her father that is to say jean valjean with all her soul with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a beloved and charming companion to her 
 it will be remembered that m madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal 
 jean valjean had continued this practice he had come to converse well he possessed the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself he retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness his mind was rough and his heart was soft 
 during their conversations in the luxembourg he gave her explanations of everything drawing on what he had read and also on what he had suffered as she listened to him eyes wandered vaguely about 
 this simple man sufficed for thought the same as the wild garden sufficed for her eyes 
 when she had had a good chase after the butterflies she came panting up to him and said 
 ah 
 how i have run 
 he kissed her brow 
 cosette adored the goodman 
 she was always at his heels where jean valjean was there happiness was 
 jean valjean lived neither in the pavilion nor the garden she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard than in the enclosure filled with flowers and in his little lodge furnished with chairs than in the great hung with tapestry against which stood tufted jean valjean sometimes said to her smiling at his happiness in being importuned 
 do go to your own quarters leave me alone a little 
 she gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful when they come from a daughter to her father 
 father i am very cold in your rooms why you have a carpet here and a stove 
 dear child there are so many people who are better than i and who have not even a roof over their heads 
 then why is there a fire in my rooms and everything that is needed 
 because you are a woman and a child 
 bah must men be cold and feel uncomfortable 
 certain men 
 that is good i shall come here so often that you will be obliged to have a fire 
 and again she said to him 
 father why do you eat horrible bread like that 
 because my daughter 
 well if you eat it i will eat it too 
 then in order to prevent cosette eating black bread jean valjean ate white bread 
 cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood 
 she prayed morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known the thenardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream 
 she remembered that she had gone one day at night to fetch water in a forest 
 she thought that it had been very far from paris 
 it seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss and that it was jean valjean who had rescued her from it her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds spiders and serpents when she meditated in the evening before falling asleep as she had not a very clear idea that she was jean daughter and that he was her father she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into that good man and had come to dwell near her 
 when he was seated she leaned her cheek against his white hair and dropped a silent tear saying to herself 
 perhaps this man is my mother 
 cosette although this is a strange statement to make in the profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent maternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity had ended by fancying that she had had as little mother as possible she did not even know her name 
 whenever she asked jean valjean jean valjean remained silent 
 if she repeated her question he responded with a smile 
 once she insisted the smile ended in a tear 
 this silence on the part of jean valjean covered fantine with darkness 
 was it prudence 
 was it respect 
 was it a fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own 
 so long as cosette had been small jean valjean had been willing to talk to her of her mother when she became a young girl it was impossible for him to do so 
 it seemed to him that he no longer dared 
 was it because of cosette 
 was it because of fantine 
 he felt a certain religious horror at letting that shadow enter thought and of placing a third in their destiny 
 the more sacred this shade was to him the more did it seem that it was to be feared he thought of fantine and felt himself overwhelmed with silence 
 through the darkness he vaguely perceived something which appeared to have its finger on its lips 
 had all the modesty which had been in fantine and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime returned to rest upon her after her death to watch in indignation over the peace of that dead woman and in its shyness to keep her in her grave 
 was jean valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure we who believe in death are not among the number who will reject this mysterious explanation 
 hence the impossibility of uttering even for cosette that name of fantine 
 one day cosette said to him 
 father i saw my mother in a dream last night 
 she had two big wings my mother must have been almost a saint during her life 
 through martyrdom replied jean valjean 
 however jean valjean was happy 
 when cosette went out with him she leaned on his arm proud and happy in the plenitude of her heart 
 jean valjean felt his heart melt within him with delight at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive so wholly satisfied with himself alone 
 the poor man trembled inundated with angelic joy he declared to himself ecstatically that this would last all their lives he told himself that he really had not suffered sufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss and he thanked god in the depths of his soul for having permitted him to be loved thus he a wretch by that innocent being

 chapter x 
 on the thirteenth of august pierre reached moscow close to the gates of the city he was met by count adjutant 
 we have been looking for you everywhere said the adjutant the count wants to see you particularly he asks you to come to him at once on a very important matter 
 without going home pierre took a cab and drove to see the moscow commander in chief 
 count rostopchin had only that morning returned to town from his summer villa at sokolniki the anteroom and reception room of his house were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders vasilchikov and platov had already seen the count and explained to him that it was impossible to defend moscow and that it would have to be surrendered though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants the officials the heads of the various government departments knew that moscow would soon be in the hands just as count rostopchin himself knew it and to escape personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various departments 
 as pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came out of private room 
 in answer to questions with which he was greeted the courier made a despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room 
 while waiting in the reception room pierre with weary eyes watched the various officials old and young military and civilian who were there they all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy pierre went up to a group of men one of whom he knew after greeting pierre they continued their conversation 
 if sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm but as things are now one answer for anything 
 but you see what he writes said another pointing to a printed sheet he held in his hand 
 another matter necessary for the people said the first 
 what is it asked pierre 
 oh a fresh broadsheet 
 pierre took it and began reading 
 his serene highness has passed through mozhaysk in order to join up with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where the enemy will not soon attack him forty eight guns with ammunition have been sent him from here and his serene highness says he will defend moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in the streets do not be upset brothers that the law courts are closed things have to be put in order and we will deal with villains in our own way when the time comes i shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day or two beforehand but they are not wanted yet so i hold my peace an ax will be useful a hunting spear not bad but a fork will be best of all a frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye tomorrow after dinner i shall take the iberian icon of the mother of god to the wounded in the catherine hospital where we will have some water blessed that will help them to get well quicker i too am well now one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookout with both 
 but military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the town said pierre and that the position 
 well of course what we were saying replied the first speaker 
 and what does he mean by one of my eyes was sore but now i am on the lookout with both asked pierre 
 the count had a sty replied the adjutant smiling and was very much upset when i told him people had come to ask what was the matter with him by the by count he added suddenly addressing pierre with a smile we heard that you have family troubles and that the countess your wife 
 i have heard nothing pierre replied unconcernedly but what have you heard 
 oh well you know people often invent things i only say what i heard 
 but what did you hear 
 well they say continued the adjutant with the same smile that the countess your wife is preparing to go abroad i expect nonsense 
 possibly remarked pierre looking about him and who is that he asked indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant overcoat with a big beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face 
 he a tradesman that is to say the restaurant keeper vereshchagin perhaps you have heard of that affair with the proclamation 
 oh so that is vereshchagin said pierre looking at the firm calm face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor 
 not he himself the father of the fellow who wrote the proclamation said the adjutant the young man is in prison and i expect it will go hard with him 
 an old gentleman wearing a star and another official a german wearing a cross round his neck approached the speaker 
 a complicated story you know said the adjutant that proclamation appeared about two months ago the count was informed of it he gave orders to investigate the matter gabriel ivanovich here made the inquiries the proclamation had passed through exactly hands he asked one from whom did you get it from he went to the next one from whom did you get it and so on till he reached vereshchagin a half educated tradesman you know a pet of a trader said the adjutant smiling they asked him who gave it you and the point is that we knew whom he had it from he could only have had it from the postmaster but evidently they had come to some understanding he replied from no one i made it up myself they threatened and questioned him but he stuck to that i made it up myself and so it was reported to the count who sent for the man from whom did you get the proclamation i wrote it myself well you know the count said the adjutant cheerfully with a smile of pride he flared up dreadfully and just think of the audacity lying and obstinacy 
 and the count wanted him to say it was from klyucharev i understand said pierre 
 not at all rejoined the adjutant in dismay klyucharev had his own sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished but the point is that the count was much annoyed how could you have written it yourself said he and he took up the hamburg gazette that was lying on the table here it is you did not write it yourself but translated it and translated it abominably because you even know french you fool and what do you think no said he i have not read any papers i made it up myself if so a traitor and have you tried and be hanged say from whom you had it i have seen no papers i made it up myself and that was the end of it the count had the father fetched but the fellow stuck to it he was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor i believe now the father has come to intercede for him but a lad you know that sort of son a dandy and he attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match for him the sort of fellow he is his father keeps a cookshop here by the stone bridge and you know there was a large icon of god almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other well he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do he found some scoundrel of a painter

 of wisdom for a self 
 an ant is a wise creature for itself but it is a shrewd thing in an orchard or garden and certainly men that are great lovers of themselves waste the public 
 divide with reason between and society and be so true to thy self as thou be not false to others specially to thy king and country it is a poor centre of a actions himself 
 it is right earth for that only stands fast upon his own centre whereas all things that have affinity with the heavens move upon the centre of another which they benefit the referring of all to a self is more tolerable in a sovereign prince because themselves are not only themselves but their good and evil is at the peril 
 of the public fortune but it is a desperate evil in a servant to a prince or a citizen in a republic 
 for whatsoever affairs pass such a hands he crooketh them to 
 his own ends which must needs be often eccentric to the ends of his master or state therefore let princes or states choose such servants as have not this mark except they mean their service should be made but the accessory that which maketh the effect more pernicious is that all proportion is lost it were disproportion enough for the good to be preferred before the but yet it is a greater extreme when a little good of the servant shall cany things against a great good of the 
 and yet that is the case of bad officers treasurers ambassadors generals and other false and corrupt servants which set a bias upon their bowl of their own petty ends and envies to the overthrow of their great and important affairs and for the most part the good such servants receive is after the model of their own fortune 
 but the hurt they sell for mat good is after the model of their fortune 
 
 and certainly it is the nature of extreme as they will set an house on fire and it were but to roast their eggs and yet these men many times hold credit with their masters because their study is but to please them and profit themselves and for either respect they will abandon the good of their affairs 
 wisdom for a self is in many branches thereof a depraved thing it is the wisdom of rats that will be sure to leave a house somewhat before it fall it is the wisdom of the fox that thrusts out the badger who digged and made room for him 
 
 it is the wisdom of crocodiles that shed tears when they would devour but that which is specially to be noted is that those which as cicero says of pompey are sui amantes sine rivali are many times unfortunate and whereas they have all their time sacrificed to themselves they become in the end themselves sacrifices to the 
 inconstancy of fortune whose wings they thought by their to have pinioned

 billows and shadows 
 a man overboard 
 what matters it 
 the vessel does not halt 
 the wind blows that sombre ship has a path which it is forced to pursue it passes on 
 the man disappears then reappears he plunges he rises again to the surface he calls he stretches out his arms he is not heard the vessel trembling under the hurricane is wholly absorbed in its own workings the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves he gives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths 
 what a spectre is that retreating sail 
 he gazes and gazes at it frantically it retreats it grows dim it diminishes in size 
 he was there but just now he was one of the crew he went and came along the deck with the rest he had his part of breath and of sunlight he was a living man 
 now what has taken place 
 he has slipped he has fallen all is at an end 
 he is in the tremendous sea 
 under foot he has nothing but what flees and crumbles 
 the billows torn and lashed by the wind encompass him hideously the tossings of the abyss bear him away all the tongues of water dash over his head a populace of waves spits upon him confused openings half devour him every time that he sinks he catches glimpses of precipices filled with night frightful and unknown vegetations seize him knot about his feet draw him to them he is conscious that he is becoming an abyss that he forms part of the foam the waves toss him from one to another he drinks in the bitterness the cowardly ocean attacks him furiously to drown him the enormity plays with his agony 
 it seems as though all that water were hate 
 nevertheless he struggles 
 he tries to defend himself he tries to sustain himself he makes an effort he swims 
 he his petty strength all exhausted instantly combats the inexhaustible 
 where then is the ship 
 yonder 
 barely visible in the pale shadows of the horizon 
 the wind blows in gusts all the foam overwhelms him he raises his eyes and beholds only the lividness of the clouds he witnesses amid his the immense madness of the sea he is tortured by this madness he hears noises strange to man which seem to come from beyond the limits of the earth and from one knows not what frightful region beyond 
 there are birds in the clouds just as there are angels above human distresses but what can they do for him 
 they sing and fly and float and he he rattles in the death agony 
 he feels himself buried in those two infinities the ocean and the sky at one and the same time 
 the one is a tomb the other is a shroud 
 night descends he has been swimming for hours his strength is exhausted that ship that distant thing in which there were men has vanished he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf he sinks he stiffens himself he twists himself he feels under him the monstrous billows of the invisible he shouts 
 there are no more men 
 where is god 
 he shouts 
 help 
 help 
 he still shouts on 
 nothing on the horizon nothing in heaven 
 he implores the expanse the waves the seaweed the reef they are deaf 
 he beseeches the tempest the imperturbable tempest obeys only the infinite 
 around him darkness fog solitude the stormy and nonsentient tumult the undefined curling of those wild waters 
 in him horror and fatigue beneath him the depths 
 not a point of support 
 he thinks of the gloomy adventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow the bottomless cold paralyzes him 
 his hands contract convulsively they close and grasp nothingness 
 winds clouds whirlwinds gusts useless stars 
 what is to be done 
 the desperate man gives up he is weary he chooses the alternative of death he resists not he lets himself go he abandons his grip and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary depths of engulfment 
 oh implacable march of human societies 
 oh losses of men and of souls on the way 
 ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip disastrous absence of help 
 oh moral death 
 the sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling their condemned 
 the sea is the immensity of wretchedness 
 the soul going down stream in this gulf may become a corpse who shall resuscitate it

 the empire strikes back 
 ix 
 
 only one being in the entire universe could instill fear in the dark spirit of darth he stood silent and alone in his dim chamber the dark lord of sith waited for avisit from his own dreaded master 
 as he waited his imperial star destroyer floated through a vast ocean of one on his ship would have dared disturb darth vader in his private cubicle butif they had they might have detected a slight trembling in that there might even have been a hint of terror to be seen upon his visage hadanyone been able to see through his concealing black breath mask 
 but no one approached and vader remained motionless as he kept his vigil soon a strange electronic whine broke the dead silence of the room anda flickering light began to glimmer on the dark cloak vader immediatelybowed deeply in homage to his royal master 
 the visitor arrived in the form of a hologram that materialized before vader andtowered above him the figure was clad in simple robes and itsface was concealed behind an enormous hood 
 when the hologram of the galactic emperor finally spoke it did so with a voiceeven deeper than the presence was awesome enough but thesound of his voice sent a thrill of terror coursing through powerful may rise my servant the emperor commanded 
 immediately vader straightened up but he did not dare gaze into his and instead cast his eyes down at his own black boots 
 what is thy bidding my master vader asked with all the solemnity of a priestattending his god 
 there is a grave disturbance in the force the emperor said 
 i have felt it the dark lord replied solemnly 
 the emperor emphasized the danger as he continued our situation is mostprecarious we have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction 
 our destruction who 
 the son of skywalker you must destroy him or he will be our undoing 
 skywalker 
 the thought was impossible how could the emperor be concerned with thisinsignificant youth 
 not a jedi vader reasoned just a boy could not havetaught him so much that 
 the emperor broke in the force is strong in him he insisted he must bedestroyed 
 the dark lord reflected for a moment perhaps there was another way to dealwith the boy a way that might benefit the imperial cause if he could be turned hewould be a powerful ally vader suggested 
 silently the emperor considered the possibility 
 after a moment he spoke again yesyes he said thoughtfully hewould be a great asset can it be done 
 for the first time in their meeting vader lifted his head to face his master will join us he answered firmly or die my master 
 with that the encounter had come to an end vader kneeled before the galacticemperor who passed his hand over his obedient servant in the next moment theholographic image had completely disappeared leaving darth vader alone toformulate what would be perhaps his most subtle plan of attack

 just then the princess rushed breathlessly into the hold 
 something out there leia cried 
 han looked up from his work where 
 outside she said in the cave 
 as she spoke they heard a sharp banging against the hull chewbaccalooked up and let out a loud bark of concern 
 whatever it sounds like trying to get in threepio observed worriedly 
 the captain began to move out of the hold going to see what it is heannounced 
 are you crazy leia looked at him in astonishment 
 the banging was getting louder 
 look we just got this bucket going again han explained not about tolet some varmint tear it apart 
 before leia could protest he had grabbed a breath mask off a supply rack andpulled it down over his head as han walked out the wookiee hurried up behindhim and grabbed his own face mask leia realized that as part of the crew she to join then 
 if more than one she told the captain going to need help 
 han looked at her affectionately as she removed a third breath mask and placed itover her lovely but determined face 
 then the three of them rushed out leaving the protocol droid to complainpitifully to the empty hold but that leave me here all alone 
 the darkness outside the millennium falcon was thick and dank it surroundedthe three figures as they carefully moved around their ship with each step theyheard unsettling noises squishing sounds that echoes through the dripping cavern 
 it was too dark to tell where the creature might be hiding they movedcautiously peering as well as they could into the deep gloom suddenly could see better in the dark than either his captain or the princess emitted amuffled bark and pointed toward the thing that moved along the hull 
 a shapeless leathery mass scurried over the top of the ship apparently startled bythe yelp han leveled his blaster at the creature and blasted the thing witha laser bolt the black shape screeched stumbled then fell off the with a thud at the feet 
 she leaned over to get a better look at the black mass looks like some kindof mynock she told han and chewbacca 
 han glanced quickly around the dark tunnel there will be more of them hepredicted they always travel in groups and nothing they like better thanto attach themselves to ships just what we need right now 
 but leia was more distracted by the consistency of the tunnel floor the tunnelitself struck her as peculiar the smell of the place was unlike that of any cave she hadever known the floor was especially cold and seemed to cling her feet 
 as she stamped her foot against the floor she felt the ground give a bit beneathher heel this asteroid has the strangest consistency she said look at theground not like rock at all 
 han knelt to inspect the floor more closely and noted how pliable it was as hestudied the floor he tried to make out how far it reached and to see the contours of thecave 
 an awful lot of moisture in here he said he stood up and aimed hishand blaster at the far side of the cave then fired toward the sound of a screechingmynock in the distance as soon as he shot the bolt the entire cavern began to shakeand the ground began to buckle i was afraid of that he shouted get outof here 
 chewbacca barked in agreement and bolted toward the millennium behind him leia and han rushed toward the ship covering their faces as aswarm of mynocks flew past them they reached the falcon and ran up theplatform into the ship as soon as they were on board chewbacca closed the hatchafter them careful that none of the mynocks could slip inside 
 chewie fire her up han yelled as he and leia darted through the getting out of here 
 chewbacca hurriedly lumbered to his seat in the cockpit while han rushed tocheck the scopes on the hold control panel 
 leia running to keep up warned they would spot us long before we could getup to speed 
 han seem to hear her he checked the controls then turned to rush backto the cockpit but as he passed her his comment made it clear he had heard everyword no time to discuss this in the committee 
 and with that he was gone racing to his chair where he began workingthe engine throttles the next minute the whine of the main engines resoundedthrough the ship 
 but leia hurried after him i am not a committee she shouted indignantly 
 it appear that he heard her the sudden was beginning tosubside but han was determined to get his ship out fast 
 leia began to strap herself into her seat 
 you make the jump to in the asteroid field she called overthe engine roar 
 solo grinned at her over his shoulder strap yourself in sweetheart he taking off 
 but the tremors have stopped 
 han was not about to stop his ship now already the craft moved passing the craggy walls of the tunnel suddenly chewbacca barked inhorror as he stared out the front windscreen 
 directly in front of them stood a jagged white row of stalactites and stalagmitescompletely surrounding the entrance 
 i see it chewie han shouted he pulled hard on the throttle and themillennium falcon surged forward hang on 
 the cave is collapsing leia screamed as she saw the entrance ahead growsmaller 
 this is no cave 
 what 
 threepio began jabbering in terror oh my no doomed leia captain 
 mouth dropped open as she stared at the rapidly approaching tunnelopening 
 han was right they were not in a cave as they came nearer the opening itwas apparent that the white mineral formations were giant teeth and it was veryapparent that as they soared out of this giant mouth those teeth were beginning toclose 
 chewbacca roared 
 bank chewie 
 it was an impossible maneuver but chewbacca responded immediately andonce again accomplished the impossible he rolled the millennium falcon steeplyon its side tilting the ship as he accelerated it between two of those gleaming whitefangs and not a second too soon for just as the falcon flew from that living jaws clamped shut 
 the falcon sped through the rocky crevice of the asteroid pursued by a titanicspace slug the enormous pink bulk intend to lose its tasty meal and pusheditself out of its crater to swallow the escaping ship but the monster was too another moment the freighter had soared out away from the slimy pursuer andinto space as it did so the ship plunged into yet another danger the millenniumfalcon had the deadly asteroid field 
 luke was panting nearly out of breath in this the latest of his endurance jedi taskmaster had ordered him out on a marathon run through the dense growthof his jungle not only had yoda sent luke on the exhausting run but hehad invited himself along for the ride as the puffed and sweated hisway on his rugged race the little jedi master observed his progress from a pouchstrapped to back 
 yoda shook his head and muttered to himself disparagingly about the of endurance 
 by the time they returned to the clearing where was patientlywaiting exhaustion had nearly overcome him as he stumbled into theclearing yoda had yet another test planned for him 
 before luke had caught his breath the little jedi on his back tossed a metal barin front of eyes in an instant luke ignited his laser sword and swungfrantically at the bar but he was not fast enough and the bar ground with a thud luke collapsed on the wet earth in complete exhaustion he moaned too tired 
 yoda who showed no sign of sympathy retorted it would be in seven you a jedi 
 but luke knew that he was not a yet anyway and the rigoroustraining program devised by yoda had left him nearly out of breath i thought i wasin good shape he gasped 
 yes but by what standard ask i the little instructor quizzed forget yourold measures unlearn unlearn 
 luke truly felt ready to unlearn all his old ways and willing to free himself tolearn all this jedi master had to teach it was rigorous training but as time strength and abilities increased and even his skeptical little master began to seehope but it was not easy 
 yoda spent long hours lecturing his student about the ways of the jedi as theysat under the trees near little house luke listened intently to all the of lessons and as luke listened yoda chewed on his gimer stick a shorttwig with three small branches at the far end 
 and there were physical tests of all kinds in particular luke was workinghard to perfect his leap once he felt ready to show yoda his improvement as themaster sat on a log next to a wide pond he heard the loud rustling of someoneapproaching through the vegetation 
 suddenly luke appeared on the other side of the pond coming toward the waterat a run as he approached the shore he made a running leap toward yoda risinghigh above the water as he hurtled himself through the air but he fell short of theother side and landed in the water with a loud splash completely soaking yoda 
 blue lips turned down in disappointment 
 but luke was not about to give up he was determined to become a jedi matter how foolish he might feel in the attempt would pass every test yoda set forhim so he complain when yoda told him to stand on his head a bitawkwardly at first luke inverted his body and after a few wobbly moments wasstanding firmly on his hands it seemed he had been in this position for hours but itwas less difficult than it would have been before his training his concentration hadimproved so much that he was able to maintain a perfect with yodaperched on the soles of his feet 
 but that was only part of the test yoda signaled luke by tapping on his legwith his gimer stick slowly carefully and with full concentration luke raised onehand off the ground his body wavered slightly with the weight lukekept his balance and concentrating started to lift a small rock in front of him butsuddenly a whistling and beeping r unit came rushing up to his youthful master 
 luke collapsed and yoda jumped clear of his falling body annoyed theyoung jedi student asked oh artoo what is it 
 rolled about in frantic circles as he tried to communicate hismessage through a series of electronic chirps luke watched as the droid scooted tothe edge of the swamp he hurried to follow and then saw what it was the littlerobot was trying to tell him 
 standing at the edge luke saw that all but the tip of the nosehad disappeared beneath the surface 
 oh no moaned luke never get it out now 
 yoda had joined them and stamped his foot in irritation at remark sosure are you yoda scolded tried have you always with you it be you nothing that i say his little wrinkled face puckered with a furious scowl 
 luke glanced at his master then looked doubtfully toward the sunken ship 
 master he said skeptically lifting rocks is one thing but this is a littledifferent yoda was really angry now no no different he shouted thedifferences are in your mind throw them out no longer of use are they to you 
 luke trusted his master if yoda said this could be done then maybe he shouldtry he looked at the downed and readied himself for maximumconcentration okay he said at last give it a try 
 again he had spoken the wrong words no yoda said impatiently try do or do not there is no try 
 luke close his eyes he tried to envision the contours the shape to feel theweight of his fighter and he concentrated on the movement it would makeas it rose from the murky waters 
 as he concentrated he began to hear the waters churn and gurgle and then beginto bubble with the emerging nose of the the tip of the fighter was slowlylifting from the water and it hovered there for a moment then sank back beneath thesurface with a loud splash 
 luke was drained and had to gasp for breath i he said too big 
 size has no meaning yoda insisted it matters not look at me judgeme by my size do you 
 luke chastened just shook his head 
 and well you the jedi master advised for my ally is the a powerful ally it is life creates it and make it grow its energy surrounds usand binds us luminous beings we are not this crude matter he said as he skin 
 yoda made a grand sweeping gesture to indicate the vastness of the universeabout him feel it you must feel the flow feel the force around you said as he pointed between you and me and that tree and that rock 
 while yoda gave his explanation of the force artoo spun his domed headaround trying without success to register this force on his scanners he whistledand beeped in bafflement 
 yes everywhere yoda continued ignoring the little droid waiting to be feltand used yes even between this land the that ship 
 then yoda turned and looked at the swamp and as he did the water began toswirl slowly from the gently bubbling waters the nose of the fighter appearedagain 
 luke gaped in astonishment as the gracefully rose from its watery tomband moved majestically toward the shore 
 he silently vowed never to use the word impossible again for on his tree root pedestal was tiny yoda effortlessly gliding the ship from thewater onto the shore it was a sight that luke could scarcely believe but he knewthat it was a potent example of jedi mastery over the force 
 artoo equally astounded but not so philosophical issued a series of loudwhistles then bolted off to hide behind some giant roots 
 the seemed to float onto the beach then gently came to a stop 
 luke was humbled by the feat he had witnessed and approached yoda in he began dazzled i believe it 
 that yoda stated emphatically is why you fail 
 bewildered luke shook his head wondering if he would ever rise to the stationof a jedi

 pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch its walls hung round with persian carpets the part of the room behind the columns with a high mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons was brightly illuminated with red light like a russian church during evening service under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chair on smooth pillows evidently freshly changed pierre saw covered to the waist by a bright green quilt the familiar majestic figure of his father count bezukhov with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome ruddy face he lay just under the icons his large thick hands outside the quilt into the right hand which was lying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb and an old servant bending over from behind the chair held it in position by the chair stood the priests their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments with lighted tapers in their hands slowly and solemnly conducting the service a little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and just in front of them their eldest sister catiche with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round anna mikhaylovna with a meek sorrowful and expression on her face stood by the door near the strange lady prince vasili in front of the door near the invalid chair a wax taper in his left hand was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose and was crossing himself with his right hand turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead his face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of god if you do not understand these sentiments he seemed to be saying so much the worse for you 
 behind him stood the the doctors and the menservants the men and women had separated as in church all were silently crossing themselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chanting of deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard anna mikhaylovna with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about went across the room to where pierre was standing and gave him a taper he lit it and distracted by observing those around him began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper 
 sophie the rosy youngest princess with the mole watched him she smiled hid her face in her handkerchief and remained with it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing pierre she again began to laugh she evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns in the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased they whispered to one another and the old servant who was holding the hand got up and said something to the ladies anna mikhaylovna stepped forward and stooping over the dying man beckoned to lorrain from behind her back the french doctor held no taper he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he a foreigner in spite of all differences of faith understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it he now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment the sick man was given something to drink there was a stir around him then the people resumed their places and the service continued during this interval pierre noticed that prince vasili left the chair on which he had been leaning and with air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them did not go up to the dying man but passed by him joined the eldest princess and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings on leaving the bed both prince vasili and the princess passed out by a back door but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential 
 the chanting of the service ceased and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before around him everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers among which anna was the most distinct 
 pierre heard her say 
 certainly he must be moved onto the bed here it will be impossible 
 the sick man was so surrounded by doctors princesses and servants that pierre could no longer see the face with its gray mane which though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service he judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him 
 catch hold of my arm or drop him he heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper catch hold from underneath here exclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as if the weight they were carrying were too much for them 
 as the bearers among whom was anna mikhaylovna passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised by those who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curly leonine head this head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones its handsome sensual mouth and its cold majestic expression was not disfigured by the approach of death it was the same as pierre remembered it three months before when the count had sent him to petersburg but now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing 
 after a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead those who had carried the sick man dispersed anna mikhaylovna touched hand and said come pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed he lay with his head propped high on the pillows his hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt the palms downward when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere or it meant too much pierre hesitated not knowing what to do and glanced inquiringly at his guide anna mikhaylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the sick hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss pierre carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned fleshy hand neither the hand nor a single muscle of the face stirred once more pierre looked questioningly at anna mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next anna mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed pierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he were doing right anna mikhaylovna nodded approvingly again pierre fell into the naively symmetrical pose of an egyptian statue evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible he looked at the count who still gazed at the spot where face had been before he sat down anna mikhaylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son this lasted about two minutes which to pierre seemed an hour suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the face began to twitch the twitching increased the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now did pierre realize how near death his father was and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct hoarse sound anna mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick eyes trying to guess what he wanted she pointed first to pierre then to some drink then named prince vasili in an inquiring whisper then pointed to the quilt the eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience he made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed 
 wants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and got up to turn the heavy body toward the wall 
 pierre rose to help him 
 while the count was being turned over one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward whether he noticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless arm or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm at face and again at the arm and on his face a feeble piteous smile appeared quite out of keeping with his features that seemed to deride his own helplessness at sight of this smile pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose and tears dimmed his eyes the sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall he sighed 
 he is dozing said anna mikhaylovna observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching let us go 
 pierre went out

 chapter 
 
 the rainy night had ushered in a misty frost half drizzle and temporary brooks crossed our from the uplands my feet were thoroughly wetted i was cross and low exactly the humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things we entered the farmhouse by the kitchen way to ascertain whether mr heathcliff were really absent because i put slight faith in his own affirmation 
 joseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone beside a roaring fire a quart of ale on the table near him bristling with large pieces of toasted oatcake and his black short pipe in his mouth catherine ran to the hearth to warm herself i asked if the master was in my question remained so long unanswered that i thought the old man had grown deaf and repeated it louder 
 he snarled or rather screamed through his nose yah muh goa back whear yah coom frough 
 joseph cried a peevish voice simultaneously with me from the inner room how often am i to call you there are only a few red ashes now joseph come this moment 
 vigorous puffs and a resolute stare into the grate declared he had no ear for this appeal the housekeeper and hareton were invisible one gone on an errand and the other at his work probably we knew tones and entered 
 oh i hope die in a garret starved to death said the boy mistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant 
 he stopped on observing his error his cousin flew to him 
 is that you miss linton he said raising his head from the arm of the great chair in which he reclined kiss me it takes my breath dear me papa said you would call continued he after recovering a little from embrace while she stood by liking very contrite will you shut the door if you please you left it open and detestable creatures bring coals to the fire so cold 
 i stirred up the cinders and fetched a scuttleful myself the invalid complained of being covered with ashes but he had a tiresome cough and looked feverish and ill so i did not rebuke his temper 
 well linton murmured catherine when his corrugated brow relaxed are you glad to see me can i do you any good 
 why you come before he asked you should have come instead of writing it tired me dreadfully writing those long letters far rather have talked to you now i can neither bear to talk nor anything else i wonder where zillah is will you looking at me step into the kitchen and see 
 i had received no thanks for my other service and being unwilling to run out to and fro at his behest i replied 
 nobody is out there but joseph 
 i want to drink he exclaimed fretfully turning away zillah is constantly gadding off to gimmerton since papa went miserable and obliged to come down resolved never to hear me upstairs 
 is your father attentive to you master heathcliff i asked perceiving catherine to be checked in her friendly advances 
 attentive he makes them a little more attentive at least he cried the wretches do you know miss linton that brute hareton laughs at me i hate him indeed i hate them all they are odious beings 
 cathy began searching for some water she lighted on a pitcher in the dresser filled a tumbler and brought it he bid her add a spoonful of wine from a bottle on the table and having swallowed a small portion appeared more tranquil and said she was very kind 
 and are you glad to see me asked she reiterating her former question and pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile 
 yes i am something new to hear a voice like yours he replied but i have been vexed because you come and papa swore it was owing to me he called me a pitiful shuffling worthless thing and said you despised me and if he had been in my place he would be more the master of the grange than your father by this time but you despise me do you miss 
 i wish you would say catherine or cathy interrupted my young lady despise you no next to papa and ellen i love you better than anybody living i love mr heathcliff though and i dare not come when he returns will he stay away many days 
 not many answered linton but he goes on to the moors frequently since the shooting season commenced and you might spend an hour or two with me in his absence do say you will i think i should not be peevish with you not provoke me and always be ready to help me you 
 yes said catherine stroking his long soft hair if i could only get consent spend half my time with you pretty linton i wish you were my brother 
 and then you would like me as well as your father observed he more cheerfully but papa says you would love me better than him and all the world if you were my wife so rather you were that 
 no i should never love anybody better than papa she returned gravely and people hate their wives sometimes but not their sisters and brothers and if you were the latter you would live with us and papa would be as fond of you as he is of me 
 linton denied that people ever hated their wives but cathy affirmed they did and in her wisdom instanced his own aversion to her aunt i endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue i succeed till everything she knew was out master heathcliff much irritated asserted her relation was false 
 papa told me and papa does not tell falsehoods she answered pertly 
 ny papa scorns yours cried linton he calls him a sneaking fool 
 yours is a wicked man retorted catherine and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says he must be wicked to have made aunt isabella leave him as she did 
 she leave him said the boy you contradict me 
 she did cried my young lady 
 well tell you something said linton your mother hated your father now then 
 oh exclaimed catherine too enraged to continue and she loved mine added he 
 you little liar i hate you now she panted and her face grew red with passion 
 she did she did sang linton sinking into the recess of his chair and leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant who stood behind 
 hush master heathcliff i said your tale too i suppose 
 it you hold your tongue he answered she did she did catherine she did she did 
 cathy beside herself gave the chair a violent push and caused him to fall against one arm he was immediately seized by a suffocating cough that soon ended his triumph it lasted so long that it frightened even me as to his cousin she wept with all her might aghast at the mischief she had done though she said nothing i held him till the fit exhausted itself then he thrust me away and leant his head down silently catherine quelled her lamentations also took a seat opposite and looked solemnly into the fire 
 how do you feel now master heathcliff i inquired after waiting ten minutes 
 i wish she felt as i do he replied spiteful cruel thing hareton never touches me he never struck me in his life and i was better today and there his voice died in a whimper 
 i strike you muttered cathy chewing her lip to prevent another burst of emotion 
 he sighed and moaned like one under great suffering and kept it up for a quarter of an hour on purpose to distress his cousin apparently for whenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos into the inflections of his voice 
 sorry i hurt you linton she said at length racked beyond endurance but i have been hurt by that little push and i had no idea that you could either not much are you linton let me go home thinking done you harm answer speak to me 
 i speak to you he murmured hurt me so that i shall lie awake all night choking with this cough if you had it know what it was but be comfortably asleep while in agony and nobody near me i wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights and he began to wail aloud for very pity of himself 
 since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights i said it be miss who spoils your ease be the same had she never come however she shall not disturb you again and perhaps get quieter when we leave you 
 must i go asked catherine dolefully bending over him do you want me to go linton 
 you alter what done he replied pettishly shrinking from her unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever 
 well then i must go she repeated 
 let me alone at least said he i bear your talking 
 she lingered and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while but as he neither looked up nor spoke she finally made a movement to the door and i followed we were recalled by a scream linton had slid from his seat on to the hearthstone and lay writhing in the mere perverseness of an indulged plague of a child determined to be as grievous and harassing as it can i thoroughly gauged his disposition from his behaviour and saw at once it would be folly to attempt humouring him not so my companion she ran back in terror knelt down and cried and soothed and entreated till he grew quiet from lack of breath by no means from compunction at distressing her 
 i shall lift him on the settle i said and he may roll about as he pleases we stop to watch him i hope you are satisfied miss cathy that you are not the person to benefit him and that his condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you now then there he is come away as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his nonsense be glad to lie still 
 she placed a cushion under his head and offered him some water he rejected the latter and tossed uneasily on the former as if it were a stone or a block of wood she tried to put it more comfortably 
 i do with that he said not high enough 
 catherine brought another to lay above it 
 too high murmured the provoking thing 
 how must i arrange it then she asked despairingly 
 he twined himself up to her as she half knelt by the settle and converted her shoulder into a support 
 no that do i said be content with the cushion master heathcliff miss has wasted too much time on you already we cannot remain five minutes longer 
 yes yes we can replied cathy good and patient now beginning to think i shall have far greater misery than he will tonight if i believe he is the worse for my visit and then i dare not come again tell the truth about it linton for i come if i have hurt you 
 you must come to cure me he answered you ought to come because you have hurt me you know you have extremely i was not as ill when you entered as i am at i 
 but made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion 
 i do it at all said his cousin however be friends 
 now and you want me you would wish to see me sometimes really 
 i told you i did he replied impatiently sit on the settle and let me lean on your knee as mamma used to do whole afternoons together sit quite still and talk but you may sing a song if you can sing or you may say a nice long interesting of those you promised to teach me or a story rather have a ballad though begin 
 catherine repeated the longest she could remember the employment pleased both mightily linton would have another and after that another notwithstanding my strenuous objections and so they went on until the clock struck twelve and we heard hareton in the court returning for his dinner 
 and tomorrow catherine will you be here tomorrow asked young heathcliff holding her frock as she rose reluctantly 
 no i answered nor next day neither she however gave a different response evidently for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered in his ear 
 you go tomorrow recollect miss i commenced when we were out of the house you are not dreaming of it are you 
 oh take good care i continued have that lock mended and you can escape by no way else 
 i can get over the wall she said laughing the grange is not a prison ellen and you are not my jailer and besides almost seventeen a woman and certain linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him older than he is you know and wiser less childish am i not and soon do as i direct him with some slight coaxing a pretty little darling when good make such a pet of him if he were mine we should never quarrel should we after we were used to each other you like him ellen 
 like him i exclaimed the bit of a sickly slip that ever struggled into its teens happily as mr heathcliff conjectured not win twenty i doubt whether see spring indeed and small loss to his family whenever he drops off and lucky it is for us that his father took him the kinder he was treated the more tedious and selfish be glad you have no chance of having him for a husband miss catherine 
 my companion waxed serious at hearing this speech to speak of his death so regardlessly wounded her feelings 
 younger than i she answered after a protracted pause of meditation and he ought to live the longest he must live as long as i do as strong now as when he first came into the north positive of that only a cold that ails him the same as papa has you say papa will get better and why he 
 well well i cried after all we trouble ourselves for listen miss and mind keep my you attempt going to wuthering heights again with or without me i shall inform mr linton and unless he allow it the intimacy with your cousin must not be revived 
 it has been revived muttered cathy sulkily must not be continued then i said 
 see was her reply and she set off at a gallop leaving me to toil in the rear 
 we both reached home before our dinner time my master supposed we had been wandering through the park and therefore he demanded no explanation of our absence as soon as i entered i hastened to change my soaked shoes and stockings but sitting such a while at the heights had done the mischief on the succeeding morning i was laid up and during three weeks i remained incapacitated for attending to my duties a calamity never experienced prior to that period and never i am thankful to say since 
 my little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me and cheer my solitude the confinement brought me exceedingly low it is wearisome to a stirring active body but few have slighter reasons for complaint than i had the moment catherine left mr room she appeared at my bedside her day was divided between us no amusement usurped a minute she neglected her meals her studies and her play and she was the fondest nurse that ever watched she must have had a warm heart when she loved her father so to give so much to me i said her days were divided between us but the master retired early and i generally needed nothing after six thus the evening was her own poor thing i never considered what she did with herself after tea and though frequently when she looked in to bid me good night i remarked a fresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers instead of fancying the hue borrowed from a cold ride across the moors i laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library

 chapter 
 
 like bees swarming after their queen mother and daughters hovered about mr march the next day neglecting everything to look at wait upon and listen to the new invalid who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness as he sat propped up in a big chair by sofa with the other three close by and hannah popping in her head now and then to peek at the dear man nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness but something was needed and the elder ones felt it though none confessed the fact mr and mrs march looked at one another with an anxious expression as their eyes followed meg jo had sudden fits of sobriety and was seen to shake her fist at mr umbrella which had been left in the hall meg was shy and silent started when the bell rang and colored when name was mentioned amy said everyone seemed waiting for something and settle down which was queer since father was safe at home and beth innocently wondered why their neighbors run over as usual 
 laurie went by in the afternoon and seeing meg at the window seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit for he fell down on one knee in the snow beat his breast tore his hair and clasped his hands imploringly as if begging some boon and when meg told him to behave himself and go away he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair 
 what does the goose mean said meg laughing and trying to look unconscious 
 showing you how your john will go on touchin it answered jo scornfully 
 say my john it proper or true but voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her please plague me jo told you i care much about him and there to be anything said but we are all to be friendly and go on as before 
 we for something has been said and mischief has spoiled you for me i see it and so does mother you are not like your old self a bit and seem ever so far away from me i mean to plague you and will bear it like a man but i do wish it was all settled i hate to wait so if you mean ever to do it make haste and have it over quickly said jo pettishly 
 i say anything till he speaks and he because father said i was too young began meg bending over her work with a queer little smile which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on that point 
 if he did speak you know what to say but would cry or blush or let him have his own way instead of giving a good decided no 
 not so silly and weak as you think i know just what i should say for planned it all so i be taken unawares no knowing what may happen and i wished to be prepared 
 jo help smiling at the important air which meg had unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color varying in her cheeks 
 would you mind telling me what say asked jo more respectfully 
 not at all you are sixteen now quite old enough to be my confidente and my experience will be useful to you perhaps in your own affairs of this sort 
 mean to have any fun to watch other people philander but i should feel like a fool doing it myself said jo looking alarmed at the thought 
 i think not if you liked anyone very much and he liked you meg spoke as if to herself and glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight 
 i thought you were going to tell your speech to that man said jo rudely shortening her little reverie 
 oh i should merely say quite calmly and decidedly thank you mr brooke you are very kind but i agree with father that i am too young to enter into any engagement at present so please say no more but let us be friends as we were 
 hum stiff and cool enough i believe ever say it and i know he be satisfied if you do if he goes on like the rejected lovers in books give in rather than hurt his feelings 
 no i i shall tell him made up my mind and shall walk out of the room with dignity 
 meg rose as she spoke and was just going to rehearse the dignified exit when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given time jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change and when someone gave a modest tap opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable 
 good afternoon i came to get my umbrella that is to see how your father finds himself today said mr brooke getting a trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other 
 very well in the rack get him and tell it you are here and having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply jo slipped out of the room to give meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity but the instant she vanished meg began to sidle toward the door murmuring 
 mother will like to see you pray sit down call her 
 go are you afraid of me margaret and mr brooke looked so hurt that meg thought she must have done something very rude she blushed up to the little curls on her forehead for he had never called her margaret before and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it anxious to appear friendly and at her ease she put out her hand with a confiding gesture and said gratefully 
 how can i be afraid when you have been so kind to father i only wish i could thank you for it 
 shall i tell you how asked mr brooke holding the small hand fast in both his own and looking down at meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen 
 oh no please rather not she said trying to withdraw her hand and looking frightened in spite of her denial 
 i trouble you i only want to know if you care for me a little meg i love you so much dear added mr brooke tenderly 
 this was the moment for the calm proper speech but meg make it she forgot every word of it hung her head and answered i know so softly that john had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply 
 he seemed to think it was worth the trouble for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied pressed the plump hand gratefully and said in his most persuasive tone will you try and find out i want to know so much for i go to work with any heart until i learn whether i am to have my reward in the end or not 
 too young faltered meg wondering was she was so fluttered yet rather enjoying it 
 wait and in the meantime you could be learning to like me would it be a very hard lesson dear 
 not if i chose to learn it but 
 please choose to learn meg i love you to teach and this is easier than german broke in john getting possession of the other hand so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent to look into it 
 his tone was properly beseeching but stealing a shy look at him meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success this nettled her annie foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind and the love of power which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her she felt excited and strange and not knowing what else to do followed a capricious impulse and withdrawing her hands said petulantly i choose please go away and let me be 
 poor mr brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air was tumbling about his ears for he had never seen meg in such a mood before and it rather bewildered him 
 do you really mean that he asked anxiously following her as she walked away 
 yes i do i want to be worried about such things father says i too soon and rather not 
 i hope change your mind wait and say nothing till you have had more time play with me meg i think that of you 
 think of me at all rather you said meg taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her patience and her own power he was grave and pale now and looked decidedly more like the novel heroes whom she admired but he neither slapped his forehead nor tramped about the room as they did he just stood looking at her so wistfully so tenderly that she found her heart relenting in spite of herself what would have happened next i cannot say if aunt march had not come hobbling in at this interesting minute 
 the old lady resist her longing to see her nephew for she had met laurie as she took her airing and hearing of mr arrival drove straight out to see him the family were all busy in the back part of the house and she had made her way quietly in hoping to surprise them she did surprise two of them so much that meg started as if she had seen a ghost and mr brooke vanished into the study 
 bless me all this cried the old lady with a rap of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the scarlet young lady 
 friend so surprised to see you stammered meg feeling that she was in for a lecture now 
 evident returned aunt march sitting down but what is friend saying to make you look like a peony mischief going on and i insist upon knowing what it is with another rap 
 we were only talking mr brooke came for his umbrella began meg wishing that mr brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house 
 brooke that tutor ah i understand now i know all about it jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your letters and i made her tell me you gone and accepted him child cried aunt march looking scandalized 
 hush hear i call mother said meg much troubled 
 not yet something to say to you and i must free my mind at once tell me do you mean to marry this cook if you do not one penny of my money ever goes to you remember that and be a sensible girl said the old lady impressively 
 now aunt march possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people and enjoyed doing it the best of us have a spice of perversity in us especially when we are young and in love if aunt march had begged meg to accept john brooke she would probably have declared she think of it but as she was preemptorily ordered not to like him she immediately made up her mind that she would inclination as well as perversity made the decision easy and being already much excited meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit i shall marry whom i please aunt march and you can leave your money to anyone you like she said nodding her head with a resolute air 
 is that the way you take my advice miss be sorry for it when tried love in a cottage and found it a failure 
 it be a worse one than some people find in big houses retorted meg 
 aunt march put on her glasses and took a look at the girl for she did not know her in this new mood meg hardly knew herself she felt so brave and independent so glad to defend john and assert her right to love him if she liked aunt march saw that she had begun wrong and after a little pause made a fresh start saying as mildly as she could now meg my dear be reasonable and take my advice i mean it kindly and want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning you ought to marry well and help your family your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed upon you 
 father and mother think so they like john though he is poor 
 your parents my dear have no more worldly wisdom than a pair of babies 
 glad of it cried meg stoutly 
 aunt march took no notice but went on with her lecture this rook is poor and got any rich relations has he 
 no but he has many warm friends 
 you live on friends try it and see how cool grow he any business has he 
 not yet mr laurence is going to help him 
 that last long james laurence is a crotchety old fellow and not to be depended on so you intend to marry a man without money position or business and go on working harder than you do now when you might be comfortable all your days by minding me and doing better i thought you had more sense meg 
 i do better if i waited half my life john is good and wise got heaps of talent willing to work and sure to get on so energetic and brave everyone likes and respects him and proud to think he cares for me though so poor and young and silly said meg looking prettier than ever in her earnestness 
 he knows you have got rich relations child the secret of his liking i suspect 
 aunt march how dare you say such a thing john is above such meanness and i listen to you a minute if you talk so cried meg indignantly forgetting everything but the injustice of the old suspicions my john marry for money any more than i would we are willing to work and we mean to wait not afraid of being poor for been happy so far and i know i shall be with him because he loves me and i 
 meg stopped there remembering all of a sudden that she made up her mind that she had told her john to go away and that he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks 
 aunt march was very angry for she had set her heart on having her pretty niece make a fine match and something in the happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour 
 well i wash my hands of the whole affair you are a willful child and lost more than you know by this piece of folly no i stop disappointed in you and spirits to see your father now expect anything from me when you are married your mr friends must take care of you done with you forever 
 and slamming the door in face aunt march drove off in high dudgeon she seemed to take all the courage with her for when left alone meg stood for a moment undecided whether to laugh or cry before she could make up her mind she was taken possession of by mr brooke who said all in one breath i help hearing meg thank you for defending me and aunt march for proving that you do care for me a little bit 
 i know how much till she abused you began meg 
 and i go away but my stay and be happy may i dear 
 here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately exit but meg never thought of doing either and disgraced herself forever in eyes by meekly whispering yes john and hiding her face on mr waistcoat 
 fifteen minutes after aunt departure jo came softly downstairs paused an instant at the parlor door and hearing no sound within nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression saying to herself she has seen him away as we planned and that affair is settled go and hear the fun and have a good laugh over it 
 but poor jo never got her laugh for she was transfixed upon the threshold by a spectacle which held her there staring with her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes going in to exult over a fallen enemy and to praise a sister for the banishment of an objectionable lover it certainly was a shock to behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa with thestrongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression of the most abject submission jo gave a sort of gasp as if a cold shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away at the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her meg jumped up looking both proud and shy but that man as jo called him actually laughed and said coolly as he kissed the astonished newcomer sister jo congratulate us 
 that was adding insult to injury it was altogether too much and making some wild demonstration with her hands jo vanished without a word rushing upstairs she startled the invalids by exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room oh do somebody go down quick john brooke is acting dreadfully and meg likes it 
 mr and mrs march left the room with speed and casting herself upon the be jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful news to beth and amy the little girls however considered it a most agreeable and interesting event and jo got little comfort from them so she went up to her refuge in the garret and confided her troubles to the rats 
 nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon but a great deal of talking was done and quiet mr brooke astonished his friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit told his plans and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he wanted it 
 the tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise which he meant to earn for meg and he proudly took her in to supper both looking so happy that jo the heart to be jealous or dismal amy was very much impressed by devotion and dignity beth beamed at them from a distance while mr and mrs march surveyed the young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly evident aunt march was right in calling them as unworldly as a pair of babies no one ate much but everyone looked very happy and the old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of the family began there 
 you say nothing pleasant ever happens now can you meg said amy trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch she was planning to make no sure i how much has happened since i said that it seems a year ago answered meg who was in a blissful dream lifted far above such common things as bread and butter 
 the joys come close upon the sorrows this time and i rather think the changes have begun said mrs march in most families there comes now and then a year full of events this has been such a one but it ends well after all 
 hope the next will end better muttered jo who found it very hard to see meg absorbed in a stranger before her face for jo loved a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost or lessened in any way i hope the third year from this will end better i mean it shall if i live to work out my plans said mr brooke smiling at meg as if everything had become possible to him now 
 it seem very long to wait asked amy who was in a hurry for the wedding 
 got so much to learn before i shall be ready it seems a short time to me answered meg with a sweet gravity in her face never seen there before 
 you have only to wait i am to do the work said john beginning his labors by picking up napkin with an expression which caused jo to shake her head and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged here comes laurie now we shall have some sensible conversation 
 but jo was mistaken for laurie came prancing in overflowing with good spirits bearing a great bouquet for mrs john brooke and evidently laboring under the delusion that the whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management 
 i knew brooke would have it all his own way he always does for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything done though the sky falls said laurie when he had presented his offering and his congratulations 
 much obliged for that recommendation i take it as a good omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot answered mr brooke who felt at peace with all mankind even his mischievous pupil 
 come if at the ens of the earth for the sight of face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey you look festive the matter asked laurie following her into a corner of the parlor whither all had adjourned to greet mr laurence 
 i approve of the match but made up my mind to bear it and shall not say a word against it said jo solemnly you know how hard it is for me to give up meg she continued with a little quiver in her voice you give her up you only go halves said laurie consolingly 
 it can never be the same again lost my dearest friend sighed jo 
 got me anyhow not good for much i know but stand by you jo all the days of my life upon my word i will and laurie meant what he said 
 i know you will and ever so much obliged you are always a great comfort to me teddy returned jo gratefully shaking hands well now be dismal a good fellow all right you see meg is happy brooke will fly round and get settled immediately grandpa will attend to him and it will be very jolly to see meg in her own little house have capital times after she is gone for i shall be through college before long and then go abroad on some nice trip or other that console you 
 i rather think it would but no knowing what may happen in three years said jo thoughtfully 
 true you wish you could take a look forward and wee where we shall all be then i do returned laurie 
 i think not for i might see something sad and everyone looks so happy now i believe they could be much improved and eyes went slowly round the room brightening as they looked for the prospect was a pleasant one 
 father and mother sat together quietly reliving the first chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago amy was drawing the lovers who sat apart in a beautiful world of their own the light of which touched their faces with a grace the little artist could not copy beth lay on her sofa talking cheerily with her old friend who held her little hand as if he felt that it possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked jo lounged in her favorite low seat with the grave quiet look which best became her and laurie leaning on the back of her chair his chin on a level with her curly head smiled with his friendliest aspect and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both 
 so the curtain falls upon meg jo beth and amy whether it ever rises again depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called little women

lionfish nov chapter the yule ballcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 despite the very heavy load of homework that the fourth years had been given for the holidays harry was in no mood to work when term ended and spent the week leading up to christmas enjoying himself as fully as possible along with everyone else gryffindor tower was hardly less crowded now than during it seemed to have shrunk slightly too as its inhabitants were being so much rowdier than usual fred and george had had a great success with their canary creams and for the first couple of days of the holidays people kept bursting into feather all over the place before long however all the gryffindors had learned to treat food anybody else offered them with extreme caution in case it had a canary cream concealed in the center and george confided to harry that he and fred were now working on developing something else harry made a mental note never to accept so much as a crisp from fred and george in future he still forgotten dudley and the toffee 
 
 snow was falling thickly upon the castle and its grounds now the pale blue beauxbatons carriage looked like a large chilly frosted pumpkin next to the iced gingerbread house that was cabin while the durmstrang portholes were glazed with ice the rigging white with frost the down in the kitchen were outdoing themselves with a series of rich warming stews and savory puddings and only fleur delacour seemed to be able to find anything to complain about 
 
 it is too eavy all zis ogwarts food they heard her saying grumpily as they left the great hall behind her one evening ron skulking behind harry keen not to be spotted by fleur i will not fit into my dress robes 
 
 oooh a tragedy hermione snapped as fleur went out into the entrance hall she really thinks a lot of herself that one she 
 
 hermione who are you going to the ball with said ron 
 
 he kept springing this question on her hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it however hermione merely frowned and said not telling you just make fun of me 
 
 joking weasley said malfoy behind them not telling me asked that to the ball not the mudblood 
 
 harry and ron both whipped around but hermione said loudly waving to somebody over shoulder hello professor moody 
 
 malfoy went pale and jumped backward looking wildly around for moody but he was still up at the staff table finishing his stew 
 
 twitchy little ferret you malfoy said hermione scathingly and she harry and ron went up the marble staircase laughing heartily 
 
 hermione said ron looking sideways at her suddenly frowning your teeth 
 
 what about them she said 
 
 well just noticed 
 
 of course they are did you expect me to keep those fangs malfoy gave me 
 
 no i mean different to how they were before he put that hex on allstraight and and 
 
 hermione suddenly smiled very mischievously and harry noticed it too it was a very different smile from the one he remembered 
 
 wellwhen i went up to madam pomfrey to get them shrunk she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were she said and i justlet her carry on a bit she smiled even more widely mum and dad be too pleased been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages but they wanted me to carry on with my braces you know dentists they just think teeth and magic should look back 
 
 tiny owl was twittering madly on the top of the banisters a scroll of parchment tied to his leg people passing him were pointing and laughing and a group of girls paused and said oh look at the weeny owl he cute 
 
 stupid little feathery git ron hissed hurrying up the stairs and snatching up pigwidgeon you bring letters to the addressee you hang around showing off 
 
 pigwidgeon hooted happily his head protruding over fist the girls all looked very shocked 
 
 clear off ron snapped at them waving the fist holding pigwidgeon who hooted more happily than ever as he soared through the air here take it harry ron added in an undertone as the girls scuttled away looking scandalized he pulled reply off pigwidgeons leg harry pocketed it and they hurried back to gryffindor tower to read it 
 
 everyone in the common room was much too busy in letting off more holiday steam to observe what anyone else was up to ron harry and hermione sat apart from everyone else by a dark window that was gradually filling up with snow and harry read out 
 
 dear harry 
 congratulations on getting past the horntail whoever put your name in that goblet be feeling too happy right now i was going to suggest a conjunctivitus curse as a eyes are its weakest point what krum did hermione whispered but your way was better impressed 
 get complacent though harry only done one task whoever put you in for the got plenty more opportunity if trying to hurt you keep your eyes open particularly when the person we discussed is around and concentrate on keeping yourself out of trouble 
 keep in touch i still want to hear about anything unusual 
 sirius 
 he sounds exactly like moody said harry quietly tucking the letter away again inside his robes constant vigilance think i walk around with my eyes shut banging off the walls 
 
 but right harry said hermione you have still got two tasks to do you really ought to have a look at that egg you know and start working out what it means 
 
 hermione got ages snapped ron want a game of chess harry 
 
 yeah okay said harry then spotting the look on face he said come on i supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on i even be able to hear the egg over this lot 
 
 oh i suppose not she sighed and she sat down to watch their chess match which culminated in an exciting checkmate of involving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent bishop 
 
 
 
 harry awoke very suddenly on christmas day wondering what had caused his abrupt return to consciousness he opened his eyes and saw something with very large round green eyes staring back at him in the darkness so close they were almost nose to nose 
 
 dobby harry yelled scrambling away from the elf so fast he almost fell out of bed do that 
 
 dobby is sorry sir squeaked dobby anxiously jumping backward with his long fingers over his mouth dobby is only wanting to wish harry potter merry christmas and bring him a present sir harry potter did say dobby could come and see him sometimes sir 
 
 okay said harry still breathing rather faster than usual while his heart rate returned to normal just just prod me or something in future all right bend over me like that 
 
 harry pulled back the curtains around his took his glasses from his bedside table and put them on his yell had awoken ron seamus dean and neville all of them were peering through the gaps in their own hangings and 
 
 someone attacking you harry seamus asked sleepily 
 
 no just dobby harry muttered go back to sleep 
 
 nahpresents said seamus spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed ron dean and neville decided that now they were awake they might as well get down to some too harry turned back to dobby who was now standing nervously next to bed still looking worried that he had upset harry there was a christmas bauble tied to the loop on top of his tea cozy 
 
 can dobby give harry potter his present he squeaked tentatively 
 
 course you can said harry got something for you too 
 
 it was a lie he bought anything for dobby at all but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly pair of socks they were his oldest and foulest mustard yellow and had once belonged to uncle vernon the reason they were was that harry had been using them to cushion his sneakoscope for over a year now he pulled out the and handed the socks to dobby saying sorry i forgot to wrap them 
 
 but dobby was utterly delighted 
 
 socks are favorite favorite clothes sir he said ripping off his odd ones and pulling on uncle i has seven now sir he said his eyes widening having pulled both socks up to their highest extent so that they reached to the bottom of his shorts they has made a mistake in the shop harry potter they is giving you two the same 
 
 ah no harry how come you spot that said ron grinning over from his own bed which was now strewn with wrapping paper tell you what dobby here you go take these two and you can mix them up properly and your sweater 
 
 he threw dobby a pair of violet socks he had just unwrapped and the sweater mrs weasley had sent dobby looked quite overwhelmed 
 
 sir is very kind he squeaked his eyes brimming with tears again bowing deeply to ron dobby knew sir must be a great wizard for he is harry greatest friend but dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit as noble as selfless 
 
 only socks said ron who had gone slightly pink around the ears though he looked rather pleased all the same wow harry he had just opened present a chudley cannon hat cool he jammed it onto his head where it clashed horribly with his hair 
 
 dobby now handed harry a small package which turned out to be socks 
 
 dobby is making them himself sir the elf said happily he is buying the wool out of his wages sir 
 
 the left sock was bright red and had a pattern of broomsticks upon it the right sock was green with a pattern of snitches 
 
 reallywell thanks dobby said harry and he pulled them on causing eyes to leak with happiness again 
 
 dobby must go now sir we is already making christmas dinner in the kitchens said dobby and he hurried out of the dormitory waving to ron and the others as he passed 
 
 other presents were much more satisfactory than odd socks with the obvious exception of the dursleys which consisted of a single tissue an low harry supposed they too were remember ing the toffee hermione had given harry a book called quidditch teams of britain and ireland ron a bulging bag of dungbombs sirius a handy penknife with attachments to unlock any lock and undo any knot and hagrid a vast box of sweets including all favorites bertie every flavor beans chocolate frogs best blowing gum and fizzing whizbees there was also of course mrs usual package including a new sweater green with a picture of a dragon on it harry supposed charlie had told her all about the horntail and a large quantity of homemade mince pies 
 
 harry and ron met up with hermione in the common room and they went down to breakfast together they spent most of the morning in gryffindor tower where everyone was enjoying their presents then returned to the great hall for a magnificent lunch which included at least a hundred turkeys and christmas puddings and large piles of wizarding crackers 
 
 they went out onto the grounds in the afternoon the snow was untouched except for the deep channels made by the durmstrang and beauxbatons students on their way up to the castle hermione chose to watch harry and the weasleys snowball fight rather than join in and at five said she was going back upstairs to get ready for the ball 
 
 what you need three hours said ron looking at her incredulously and paying for his lapse in concentration when a large snowball thrown by george hit him hard on the side of the head you going with he yelled after hermione but she just waved and disappeared up the stone steps into the castle 
 
 there was no christmas tea today as the ball included a feast so at seven when it had become hard to aim properly the others abandoned their snowball fight and trooped back to the common room the fat lady was sitting in her frame with her friend violet from downstairs both of them extremely tipsy empty boxes of chocolate liqueurs littering the bottom other picture 
 
 lairy fights the one she giggled when they gave the password and she swung forward to let them inside 
 
 harry ron seamus dean and neville changed into their dress robes up in their dormitory all of them looking very but none as much as ron who surveyed himself in the long mirror in the corner with an appalled look on his face there was just no getting around the fact that his robes looked more like a dress than anything else in a desperate attempt to make them look more manly he used a severing charm on the ruff and cuffs it worked fairly well at least he was now although he done a very neat job and the edges still looked depressingly frayed as the boys set off downstairs 
 
 i still work out how you two got the girls in the year muttered dean 
 
 animal magnetism said ron gloomily pulling stray threads out of his cuffs 
 
 the common room looked strange full of people wearing different colors instead of the usual mass of black parvati was waiting for harry at the foot of the stairs she looked very pretty indeed in robes of shocking pink with her long dark plait braided with gold and gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists harry was relieved to see that she giggling 
 
 you er look nice he said awkwardly 
 
 thanks she said going to meet you in the entrance hall she added to ron 
 
 right said ron looking around hermione 
 
 parvati shrugged shall we go down then harry 
 
 okay said harry wishing he could just stay in the common room fred winked at harry as he passed him on the way out of the portrait hole 
 
 the entrance hall was packed with students too all milling around waiting for eight when the doors to the great hall would be thrown open those people who were meeting partners from different houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another parvati found her sister padma and led her over to harry and ron 
 
 hi said padma who was looking just as pretty as parvati in robes of bright turquoise she look too enthusiastic about having ron as a partner though her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down 
 
 hi said ron not looking at her but staring around at the crowd oh no 
 
 he bent his knees slightly to hide behind harry because fleur delacour was passing looking stunning in robes of satin and accompanied by the ravenclaw quidditch captain roger davies when they had disappeared ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd 
 
 where is hermione he said again 
 
 a group of slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon common room malfoy was in front he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar which in opinion made him look like a vicar pansy parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching arm crabbe and goyle were both wearing green they resembled boulders and neither of them harry was pleased to see had managed to find a partner 
 
 the oak front doors opened and everyone turned to look as the durmstrang students entered with professor karkaroff krum was at the front of the party accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes harry know over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be father christmas and his reindeer 
 
 then professor voice called champions over here please 
 
 parvati readjusted her bangles beaming she and harry said see you in a minute to ron and padma and walked forward the chattering crowd parting to let them through professor mcgonagall who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim other hat told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside they were to enter the great hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down fleur delacour and roger davies stationed themselves nearest the doors davies looked so stunned by his good fortune in having fleur for a partner that he could hardly take his eyes off her cedric and cho were close to harry too he looked away from them so he have to talk to them his eyes fell instead on the girl next to krum his jaw dropped 
 
 it was hermione 
 
 but she look like hermione at all she had done something with her hair it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head she was wearing robes made of a floaty material and she was holding herself differently somehow or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back she was also smiling rather nervously it was true but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever harry understand how he spotted it before 
 
 hi harry she said hi parvati 
 
 parvati was gazing at hermione in unflattering disbelief she the only one either when the doors to the great hall opened fan club from the library stalked past throwing hermione looks of deepest loathing pansy parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with malfoy and even he seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her ron however walked right past hermione without looking at her 
 
 once everyone else was settled in the hall professor mcgonagall told the champions and their partners to get in line in pairs and to follow her they did so and everyone in the great hall applauded as they entered and started walking up toward a large round table at the top of the hall where the judges were sitting 
 
 the walls of the hall had all been covered in sparkling silver frost with hundreds of garlands of mistletoe and ivy crossing the starry black ceiling the house tables had vanished instead there were about a hundred smaller ones each seating about a dozen people 
 
 harry concentrated on not tripping over his feet parvati seemed to be enjoying herself she was beaming around at everybody steering harry so forcefully that he felt as though he were a show dog she was putting through its paces he caught sight of ron and padma as he neared the top table ron was watching hermione pass with narrowed eyes padma was looking sulky 
 
 dumbledore smiled happily as the champions approached the top table but karkaroff wore an expression remarkably like as he watched krum and hermione draw nearer ludo bagman tonight in robes of bright purple with large yellow stars was clapping as enthusiastically as any of the students and madame maxime who had changed her usual uniform of black satin for a flowing gown of lavender silk was applauding them politely but mr crouch harry suddenly realized was not there the fifth seat at the table was occupied by percy weasley 
 
 when the champions and their partners reached the table percy drew out the empty chair beside him staring pointedly at harry harry took the hint and sat down next to percy who was wearing dress robes and an expression of such smugness that harry thought it ought to be fined 
 
 been promoted percy said before harry could even ask and from his tone he might have been announcing his election as supreme ruler of the universe now mr personal assistant and here representing him 
 
 why he come harry asked he looking forward to being lectured on cauldron bottoms all through dinner 
 
 afraid to say mr crouch well not well at all been right since the world cup hardly surprising overwork not as young as he was though still quite brilliant of course the mind remains as great as it ever was but the world cup was a fiasco for the whole ministry and then mr crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that of his blinky or whatever she was called naturally he dismissed her immediately afterward but well as i say getting on he needs looking after and i think found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left and then we had the tournament to arrange and the aftermath of the cup to deal with that revolting skeeter woman buzzing around no poor man having a well earned quiet christmas just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place 
 
 harry wanted very much to ask whether mr crouch had stopped calling percy weatherby yet but resisted the temptation 
 
 there was no food as yet on the glittering golden plates but small menus were lying in front of each of them harry picked his up uncertainly and looked around there were no waiters dumbledore however looked carefully down at his own menu then said very clearly to his plate pork chops 
 
 and pork chops appeared getting the idea the rest of the table placed their orders with their plates too harry glanced up at hermione to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining surely it meant plenty of extra work for the but for once hermione seem to be thinking about she was deep in talk with viktor krum and hardly seemed to notice what she was eating 
 
 it now occurred to harry that he had never actually heard krum speak before but he was certainly talking now and very enthusiastically at that 
 
 veil ve have a castle also not as big as this nor as comfortable i am thinking he was telling hermione ve have just four floors and the fires are lit only for magical purposes but ve have grounds larger even than these though in vinter ve have very little daylight so ve are not enjoying them but in summer ve are flying every day over the lakes and the mountains 
 
 now now viktor said karkaroff with a laugh that reach his cold eyes go giving away anything else now or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us 
 
 dumbledore smiled his eyes twinkling igor all this secrecy one would almost think you want visitors 
 
 well dumbledore said karkaroff displaying his yellowing teeth to their fullest extent we are all protective of our private domains are we not do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us are we not right to be proud that we alone know our secrets and right to protect them 
 
 oh i would never dream of assuming i know all hogwarts secrets igor said dumbledore amicably only this morning for instance i took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room i have never seen before containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots when i went back to investigate more closely i discovered that the room had vanished but i must keep an eye out for it possibly it is only accessible at in the morning or it may only appear at the quarter moon or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder 
 
 harry snorted into his plate of goulash percy frowned but harry could have sworn dumbledore had given him a very small wink 
 
 meanwhile fleur delacour was criticizing the hogwarts decorations to roger davies 
 
 zis is nothing she said dismissively looking around at the sparkling walls of the great hall at ze palace of beauxbatons we ave ice sculptures all around ze dining chamber at chreestmas zey do not melt of coursezey are like uge statues of diamond glittering around ze place and ze food is seemply superb and we ave choirs of wood nymphs oo serenade us as we eat we ave none of zis ugly armor in ze alls and eef a poltergeist ever entaired into beauxbatons e would be expelled like zat she slapped her hand onto the table impatiently 
 
 roger davies was watching her talk with a very dazed look on his face and he kept missing his mouth with his fork harry had the impression that davies was too busy staring at fleur to take in a word she was saying 
 
 absolutely right he said quickly slapping his own hand down on the table in imitation of fleur like that yeah 
 
 harry looked around the hall hagrid was sitting at one of the other staff tables he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top table harry saw him give a small wave and looking around saw madame maxime return it her opals glittering in the candlelight 
 
 hermione was now teaching krum to say her name properly he kept calling her 
 
 she said slowly and clearly 
 
 
 
 close enough she said catching eye and grinning 
 
 when all the food had been consumed dumbledore stood up and asked the students to do the same then with a wave of his wand all the tables zoomed back along the walls leaving the floor clear and then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall a set of drums several guitars a lute a cello and some bagpipes were set upon it 
 
 the weird sisters now trooped up onto the stage to wildly enthusiastic applause they were all extremely hairy and dressed in black robes that had been artfully ripped and torn they picked up their instruments and harry who had been so interested in watching them that he had almost forgotten what was coming suddenly realized that the lanterns on all the other tables had gone out and that the other champions and their partners were standing up 
 
 come on parvati hissed supposed to dance 
 
 harry tripped over his dress robes as he stood up the weird sisters struck up a slow mournful tune harry walked onto the brightly lit dance floor carefully avoiding catching eye he could see seamus and dean waving at him and sniggering and next moment parvati had seized his hands placed one around her waist and was holding the other tightly in hers 
 
 it as bad as it could have been harry thought revolving slowly on the spot parvati was steering he kept his eyes fixed over the heads of the watching people and very soon many of them too had come onto the dance floor so that the champions were no longer the center of attention neville and ginny were dancing nearby he could see ginny wincing frequently as neville trod on her feet and dumbledore was waltzing with madame maxime he was so dwarfed by her that the top of his pointed hat barely tickled her chin however she moved very gracefully for a woman so large moody was doing an extremely ungainly with professor sinistra who was nervously avoiding his wooden leg 
 
 nice socks potter moody growled as he passed his magical eye staring through robes 
 
 oh yeah dobby the knitted them for me said harry grinning 
 
 he is so creepy parvati whispered as moody clunked away i think that eye should be allowed 
 
 
 
 harry heard the final quavering note from the bagpipe with relief the weird sisters stopped playing applause filled the hall once more and harry let go of parvati at once 
 
 sit down shall we 
 
 oh but this is a really good one parvati said as the weird sisters struck up a new song which was much faster 
 
 no i like it harry lied and he led her away from the dance floor past fred and angelina who were dancing so exhuberantly that people around them were backing away in fear of injury and over to the table where ron and padma were sitting 
 
 it going harry asked ron sitting down and opening a bottle of butterbeer 
 
 ron answer he was glaring at hermione and krum who were dancing nearby padma was sitting with her arms and legs crossed one foot jiggling in time to the music every now and then she threw a disgruntled look at ron who was completely ignoring her parvati sat down on other side crossed her arms and legs too and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from beauxbatons 
 
 you mind do you harry parvati said 
 
 what said harry who was now watching cho and cedric 
 
 oh never mind snapped parvati and she went off with the boy from beauxbatons when the song ended she did not return 
 
 hermione came over and sat down in empty chair she was a bit pink in the face from dancing 
 
 hi said harry ron say anything 
 
 hot it said hermione fanning herself with her hand just gone to get some drinks 
 
 ron gave her a withering look viktor he said he asked you to call him vicky yet 
 
 hermione looked at him in surprise up with you she said 
 
 if you know said ron scathingly not going to tell you 
 
 hermione stared at him then at harry who shrugged 
 
 ron what 
 
 from durmstrang spat ron competing against harry against hogwarts you ron was obviously casting around for words strong enough to describe crime fraternizing with the enemy what doing 
 
 mouth fell open 
 
 be so stupid she said after a moment the enemy honestly who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive who was the one who wanted his autograph got a model of him up in their dormitory 
 
 ron chose to ignore this i he asked you to come with him while you were both in the library 
 
 yes he did said hermione the pink patches on her cheeks glowing more brightly so what 
 
 what happened trying to get him to join spew were you 
 
 no i if you really want to know he he said been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me but he been able to pluck up the courage 
 
 hermione said this very quickly and blushed so deeply that she was the same color as robes 
 
 yeah well his story said ron nastily 
 
 and that supposed to mean 
 
 obvious it student he he knows who you hang around just trying to get closer to harry get inside information on him or get near enough to jinx him 
 
 hermione looked as though ron had slapped her when she spoke her voice quivered 
 
 for your information he asked me one single thing about harry not one 
 
 ron changed tack at the speed of light 
 
 then hoping help him find out what his egg means i suppose been putting your heads together during those cozy little library sessions 
 
 never help him work out that egg said hermione looking outraged never how could you say something like that i want harry to win the tournament harry knows that you harry 
 
 got a funny way of showing it sneered ron 
 
 this whole supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them said hermione hotly 
 
 no it shouted ron about winning 
 
 people were starting to stare at them 
 
 ron said harry quietly i got a problem with hermione coming with krum 
 
 but ron ignored harry too 
 
 why you go and find vicky be wondering where you are said ron 
 
 call him vicky 
 
 hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor disappearing into the crowd ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face 
 
 are you going to ask me to dance at all padma asked him 
 
 no said ron still glaring after hermione 
 
 fine snapped padma and she got up and went to join parvati and the beauxbatons boy who conjured up one of his friends to join them so fast that harry could have sworn he had zoomed him there by a summoning charm 
 
 vare is said a voice 
 
 krum had just arrived at their table clutching two butterbeers 
 
 no idea said ron mulishly looking up at him lost her have you 
 
 krum was looking surly again 
 
 veil if you see her tell her i haff drinks he said and he slouched off 
 
 made friends with viktor krum have you ron 
 
 percy had bustled over rubbing his hands together and looking extremely pompous excellent the whole point you know international magical cooperation 
 
 to displeasure percy now took vacated seat the top table was now empty professor dumbledore was dancing with professor sprout ludo bagman with professor mcgonagall madame maxime and hagrid were cutting a wide path around the dance floor as they waltzed through the students and karkaroff was nowhere to be seen when the next song ended everybody applauded once more and harry saw ludo bagman kiss professor hand and make his way back through the crowds at which point fred and george accosted him 
 
 what do they think doing annoying senior ministry members percy hissed watching fred and george suspiciously no respect 
 
 ludo bagman shook off fred and george fairly quickly however and spotting harry waved and came over to their table 
 
 i hope my brothers bothering you mr bagman said percy at once 
 
 what oh not at all not at all said bagman no they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs wondering if i could advise them on the marketing promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at joke shop 
 
 percy look happy about this at all and harry was prepared to bet he would be rushing to tell mrs weasley about this the moment he got home apparently fred and plans had grown even more ambitious lately if they were hoping to sell to the public bagman opened his mouth to ask harry something but percy diverted him 
 
 how do you feel the going mr bagman our quite satisfied the hitch with the goblet of fire he glanced at harry was a little unfortunate of course but it seems to have gone very smoothly since you think 
 
 oh yes bagman said cheerfully all been enormous fun old barty doing shame he come 
 
 oh sure mr crouch will be up and about in no time said percy importantly but in the meantime more than willing to take up the slack of course not all attending balls he laughed airily oh no had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence you heard ali bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country and then been trying to persuade the transylvanians to sign the international ban on dueling got a meeting with their head of magical cooperation in the new year 
 
 go for a walk ron muttered to harry get away from percy 
 
 pretending they wanted more drinks harry and ron left the table edged around the dance floor and slipped out into the entrance hall the front doors stood open and the fluttering fairy lights in the rose garden winked and twinkled as they went down the front steps where they found themselves surrounded by bushes winding ornamental paths and large stone statues harry could hear splashing water which sounded like a fountain here and there people were sitting on carved benches he and ron set off along one of the winding paths through the rosebushes but they had gone only a short way when they heard an unpleasantly familiar voice 
 
 see what there is to fuss about igor 
 
 severus you cannot pretend this happening karkaroffs voice sounded anxious and hushed as though keen not to be overheard been getting clearer and clearer for months i am becoming seriously concerned i deny it 
 
 then flee said voice curtly flee i will make your excuses i however am remaining at hogwarts 
 
 snape and karkaroff came around the corner snape had his wand out and was blasting rosebushes apart his expression most squeals issued from many of the bushes and dark shapes emerged from them 
 
 ten points from ravenclaw fawcett snape snarled as a girl ran past him and ten points from hufflepuff too stebbins as a boy went rushing after her and what are you two doing he added catching sight of harry and ron on the path ahead karkaroff harry saw looked slightly discomposed to see them standing there his hand went nervously to his goatee and he began winding it around his finger 
 
 we re walking ron told snape shortly not against the law is it 
 
 keep walking then snape snarled and he brushed past them his long black cloak billowing out behind him karkaroff hurried away after snape harry and ron continued down the path 
 
 got karkaroff all worried ron muttered 
 
 and since when have he and snape been on harry slowly 
 
 they had reached a large stone reindeer now over which they could see the sparkling jets of a tall fountain the shadowy outlines of two enormous people were visible on a stone bench watching the water in the moonlight and then harry heard hagrid speak 
 
 momen i saw yeh i knew he was saying in an oddly husky voice 
 
 harry and ron froze this sound like the sort of scene they ought to walk in on looked around back up the path and saw fleur delacour and roger davies standing in a rosebush nearby he tapped ron on the shoulder and jerked his head toward them meaning that they could easily sneak off that way without being noticed fleur and davies looked very busy to harry but ron eyes widening in horror at the sight of fleur shook his head vigorously and pulled harry deeper into the shadows behind the reindeer 
 
 what did you know agrid said madame maxime a purr in her low voice 
 
 harry definitely want to listen to this he knew hagrid would hate to be overheard in a situation like this he certainly would have if it had been possible he would have put his fingers in his ears and hummed loudly but that really an option instead he tried to interest himself in a beetle crawling along the stone back but the beetle just interesting enough to block out next words 
 
 i jus knewknew you were like it yer mother or yer father 
 
 i i know what you mean agrid 
 
 it was my mother said hagrid quietly she was one o the las ones in britain course i can remember her too wellshe left see when i was abou three she wasn really the maternal sort not in their natures is it dunno what happened to hermight be dead fer all i know 
 
 madame maxime say anything and harry in spite of himself took his eyes off the beetle and looked over the top of the antlers had never heard hagrid talk about his childhood before 
 
 me dad was when she wen tiny little bloke my dad was by the time i was six i could lift him up an put him on top o the dresser if he annoyed me used ter make him deep voice broke madame maxime was listening motionless apparently staring at the silvery fountain dad raised mebut he died o course jus after i started school sorta had ter make me own way after that dumbledore was a real help mind very kind ter me he was 
 
 hagrid pulled out a large spotted silk handkerchief and blew his nose heavily 
 
 soanywayenough abou me what about you which side you got it on 
 
 but madame maxime had suddenly got to her feet 
 
 it is chilly she said but whatever the weather was doing it was nowhere near as cold as her voice i think i will go in now 
 
 eh said hagrid blankly no don go never met another one before 
 
 anuzzer what precisely said madame maxime her tone icy 
 
 harry could have told hagrid it was best not to answer he stood there in the shadows gritting his teeth hoping against hope he but it was no good 
 
 another o course said hagrid 
 
 ow dare you shrieked madame maxime her voice exploded through the peaceful night air like a foghorn behind him harry heard fleur and roger fall out of their rosebush i ave nevair been more insulted in my life moi i ave i ave big bones 
 
 she stormed away great multicolored swarms of fairies rose into the air as she passed angrily pushing aside bushes hagrid was still sitting on the bench staring after her it was much too dark to make out his expression then after about a minute he stood up and strode away not back to the castle but off out into the dark grounds in the direction of his cabin 
 
 harry said very quietly to ron go 
 
 but ron move 
 
 up said harry looking at him 
 
 ron looked around at harry his expression very serious indeed 
 
 did you know he whispered about hagrid being 
 
 no harry said shrugging so what 
 
 he knew immediately from the look ron was giving him that he was once again revealing his ignorance of the wizarding world brought up by the dursleys there were many things that wizards took for granted that were revelations to harry but these surprises had become fewer with each successive year now however he could tell that most wizards would not have said so what upon finding out that one of their friends had a giantess for a mother 
 
 explain inside said ron quietly 
 
 fleur and roger davies had disappeared probably into a more private clump of bushes harry and ron returned to the great hall parvati and padma were now sitting at a distant table with a whole crowd of beauxbatons boys and hermione was once more dancing with krum harry and ron sat down at a table far removed from the dance floor 
 
 so harry prompted ron the problem with giants 
 
 well ron struggled for words not very nice he finished lamely 
 
 who cares harry said nothing wrong with hagrid 
 
 i know there butblimey no wonder he keeps it quiet ron said shaking his head i always thought got in the way of a bad engorgement charm when he was a kid or something like to mention it 
 
 but it matter if his mother was a giantess said harry 
 
 wellno one who knows him will care cos know not dangerous said ron slowly butharry just vicious giants like hagrid said in their natures like trollsthey just like killing everyone knows that there any left in britain now though 
 
 what happened to them 
 
 well they were dying out anyway and then loads got themselves killed by aurors supposed to be giants abroad hide out in mountains mostly 
 
 i know who maxime thinks kidding harry said watching madame maxime sitting alone at the judges table looking very somber if she definitely is big only thing got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur 
 
 harry and ron spent the rest of the ball discussing giants in their corner neither of them having any inclination to dance harry tried not to watch cho and cedric too much it gave him a strong desire to kick something 
 
 when the weird sisters finished playing at midnight everyone gave them a last loud round of applause and started to wend their way into the entrance hall many people were expressing the wish that the ball could have gone on longer but harry was perfectly happy to be going to bed as far as he was concerned the evening been much fun 
 
 out in the entrance hall harry and ron saw hermione saying good night to krum before he went back to the durmstrang ship she gave ron a very cold look and swept past him up the marble staircase without speaking harry and ron followed her but halfway up the staircase harry heard someone calling him 
 
 
 
 it was cedric diggory harry could see cho waiting for him in the entrance hall below 
 
 yeah said harry coldly as cedric ran up the stairs toward him 
 
 cedric looked as though he want to say whatever it was in front of ron who shrugged looking and continued to climb the stairs 
 
 listen cedric lowered his voice as ron disappeared i owe you one for telling me about the dragons you know that golden egg does yours wail when you open it 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 welltake a bath okay 
 
 what 
 
 take a bath and er take the egg with you and er just mull things over in the hot water help you me 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 tell you what cedric said use the prefects bathroom fourth door to the left of that statue of boris the bewildered on the fifth floor pine fresh gotta gowant to say good night 
 
 he grinned at harry again and hurried back down the stairs to cho 
 
 harry walked back to gryffindor tower alone that had been extremely strange advice why would a bath help him to work out what the wailing egg meant was cedric pulling his leg was he trying to make harry look like a fool so cho would like him even more by comparison 
 
 the fat lady and her friend vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole harry had to yell fairy lights before he woke them up and when he did they were extremely irritated he climbed into the common room and found ron and hermione having a blazing row standing ten feet apart they were bellowing at each other each scarlet in the face 
 
 well if you like it you know what the solution is you yelled hermione her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now and her face was screwed up in anger 
 
 oh yeah ron yelled back that 
 
 next time a ball ask me before someone else does and not as a last resort 
 
 ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls staircase to bed ron turned to look at harry 
 
 well he sputtered looking thunderstruck well that just proves completely missed the point 
 
 harry say anything he liked being back on speaking terms with ron too much to speak his mind right now but he somehow thought that hermione had gotten the point much better than ron had

lionfish nov chapter christmas on the closed wardcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 was this why dumbledore would no longer meet eyes did he expect to see voldemort staring out of them afraid perhaps that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet with catlike slits for pupils harry remembered how the snakelike face of voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of professor head and ran his hand over the back of his own wondering what it would feel like if voldemort burst out of his skull 
 
 he felt dirty contaminated as though he were carrying some deadly germ unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the hospital with innocent clean people whose minds and bodies were free of the taint of voldemort he had not merely seen the snake he had been the snake he knew it now 
 
 a truly terrible thought then occurred to him a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind one that made his insides writhe and squirm like serpents 
 
 he after apart from followers 
 
 stuff he can only get by stealth like a weapon something he have last time 
 
 the weapon harry thought and it was as though poison were pumping through his veins chilling him bringing him out in a sweat as he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel the one trying to use why got guards around me everywhere i go not for my protection for other only not working they have someone on me all the time at hogwarts i did attack mr weasley last night it was me voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me listening to my right now 
 
 are you all right harry dear whispered mrs weasley leaning across ginny to speak to him as the train rattled along through its dark tunnel you look very well are you feeling sick 
 
 they were all watching him he shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance 
 
 harry dear are you sure all right said mrs weasley in a worried voice as they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of grimmauld place you look ever so pale are you sure you slept this morning you go upstairs to bed right now and you can have a couple of hours of sleep before dinner all right 
 
 he nodded here was a excuse not to talk to any of the others which was precisely what he wanted so when she opened the front door he hurried straight past the umbrella stand up the stairs and into his and bedroom 
 
 here he began to pace up and down past the two beds and phineas empty picture frame his brain teeming and seething with questions and ever more dreadful ideas 
 
 how had he become a snake perhaps he was an animagus no he be he would know perhaps voldemort was an animagus yes thought harry that would fit he would turn into a snake of course and when possessing me then we both transform that still explain how i got to london and back to my bed in the space of about five minutes but then about the most powerful wizard in the world apart from dumbledore probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that 
 
 and then with a terrible stab of panic he thought but this is insaneif possessing me giving him a clear view into the headquarters of the order of the phoenix right now know in the order and where sirius is and heard loads of stuff i have everything sirius told me the first night i was here 
 
 there was only one thing for it he would have to leave grimmauld place straightaway he would spend christmas at hogwarts without the others which would keep them safe over the holidays at least but no that do there were still plenty of people at hogwarts to maim and injure what if it was seamus dean or neville next time he stopped his pacing and stood staring at phineas empty frame a leaden sensation was settling in the pit of his stomach he had no alternative he was going to have to return to privet drive cut himself off from other wizards entirely 
 
 well if he had to do it he thought there was no point hanging around trying with all his might not to think how the dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six months earlier than they had expected he strode over to his trunk slammed the lid shut and locked it then glanced around automatically for hedwig before remembering that she was still at hogwartswell her cage would be one less thing to carryhe seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway towards the door when a snide voice said running away are we 
 
 he looked around phineas nigellus had appeared on the canvas of his portrait and was leaning against the frame watching harry with an amused expression on his face 
 
 not running away no said harry shortly dragging his trunk a few more feet across the room 
 
 i thought said phineas nigellus stroking his pointed beard that to belong in gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave it looks to me as though you would have been better off in my own house we slytherins are brave yes but not stupid for instance given the choice we will always choose to save our own necks 
 
 not my own neck saving said harry tersely tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven carpet right in front of the door 
 
 oh i see said phineas nigellus still stroking his beard this is no cowardly flightyou are being noble 
 
 harry ignored him his hand was on the doorknob when phineas nigellus said lazily i have a message for you from albus dumbledore 
 
 harry span round 
 
 what is it 
 
 stay where you are 
 
 i moved said harry his hand still upon the doorknob so the message 
 
 i have just given it to you dolt said phineas nigellus smoothly dumbledore says stay where you are 
 
 why said harry eagerly dropping the end of his trunk why does he want me to stay what else did he say 
 
 nothing whatsoever said phineas nigellus raising a thin black eyebrow as though he found harry impertinent 
 
 temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass he was exhausted he was confused beyond measure he had experienced terror relief then terror again in the last twelve hours and still dumbledore did not want to talk to him 
 
 so it is it he said loudly stay where you are all anyone could tell me after i got attacked by those dementors too just stay put while the sort it out harry we bother telling you anything though because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it 
 
 you know said phineas nigellus even more loudly than harry this is precisely why i loathed being a teacher young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything has it not occurred to you my poor popinjay that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you have you never paused while feeling to note that following orders has never yet led you into harm like all young people you are quite sure that you alone feel and think you alone recognise danger you alone are the only one clever enough to realise what the dark lord may be planning 
 
 he is planning something to do with me then said harry swiftly 
 
 did i say that said phineas nigellus idly examining his silk gloves now if you will excuse me i have better things to do than listen to adolescent agonising to you 
 
 and he strolled to the edge of his frame and out of sight 
 
 fine go then harry bellowed at the empty frame and tell dumbledore thanks for nothing 
 
 the empty canvas remained silent fuming harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed then threw himself face down on the covers his eyes shut his body heavy and aching 
 
 he felt as though he had journeyed for miles and miles it seemed impossible that less than hours ago cho chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe he was so tired he was scared to sleep yet he did not know how long he could fight it dumbledore had told him to stay that must mean he was allowed to sleep but he was scared what if it happened again 
 
 he was sinking into shadows 
 
 it was as though a film in his head had been waiting to start he was walking down a deserted corridor towards a plain black door past rough stone walls torches and an open doorway on to a flight of stone steps leading downstairs on the left 
 
 he reached the black door but could not open it he stood gazing at it desperate for entry something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond a prize beyond his dreams if only his scar would stop prickling then he would be able to think more clearly 
 
 harry said voice from far far away mum says dinners ready but save you something if you want to stay in bed 
 
 harry opened his eyes but ron had already left the room 
 
 he want to be on his own with me harry thought not after what he heard moody say 
 
 he supposed none of them would want him there any more now that they knew what was inside him 
 
 he would not go down to dinner he would not inflict his company on them he turned over on to his other side and after a while dropped back off to sleep he woke much later in the early hours of the morning his insides aching with hunger and ron snoring in the next bed squinting around the room he saw the dark outline of phineas nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to harry that dumbledore had probably sent phineas nigellus to watch over him in case he attacked somebody else 
 
 the feeling of being unclean intensified he he had not obeyed dumbledore if this was how life was going to be for him in grimmauld place from now on maybe he would be better off in privet drive after all 
 
 everybody else spent the following morning putting up christmas decorations harry could not remember sirius ever being in such a good mood he was actually singing carols apparently delighted that he was to have company over christmas harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold drawing room where he was sitting alone watching the sky growing whiter outside the windows threatening snow all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he was giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him as they were bound to be doing when he heard mrs weasley calling his name softly up the stairs around lunchtime he retreated further upstairs and ignored her 
 
 around six in the evening the doorbell rang and mrs black started screaming again assuming that mundungus or some other order member had come to call harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of room where he was hiding trying to ignore how hungry he felt as he fed dead rats to the hippogriff it came as a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minutes later 
 
 i know in there said voice will you please come out i want to talk to you 
 
 what are you doing here harry asked her pulling open the door as buckbeak resumed his scratching at the floor for any fragments of rat he may have dropped i thought you were skiing with your mum and dad 
 
 well to tell the truth not really my thing said hermione so come here for christmas there was snow in her hair and her face was pink with cold but tell ron i told him really good because he kept laughing so much mum and dad are a bit disappointed but told them that everyone who is serious about the exams is staying at hogwarts to study they want me to do well understand anyway she said briskly go to your bedroom mum has lit a fire in there and sent up sandwiches 
 
 harry followed her back to the second floor when he entered the bedroom he was rather surprised to see both ron and ginny waiting for them sitting on bed 
 
 i came on the knight bus said hermione airily pulling off her jacket before harry had time to speak dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning but i had to wait for term to end officially before setting off umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose even though dumbledore told her mr weasley was in st and given you all permission to visit so 
 
 she sat down next to ginny and the two girls and ron all looked up at harry 
 
 you feeling asked hermione 
 
 fine said harry stiffly 
 
 oh lie harry she said impatiently ron and ginny say been hiding from everyone since you got back from st 
 
 they do do they said harry glaring at ron and ginny ron looked down at his feet but ginny seemed quite unabashed 
 
 well you have she said and you look at any of us 
 
 you lot who look at me said harry angrily 
 
 maybe taking it in turns to look and keep missing each other suggested hermione the corners of her mouth twitching 
 
 very funny snapped harry turning away 
 
 oh stop feeling all misunderstood said hermione sharply look the others have told me what you overheard last night on the extendable ears 
 
 yeah growled harry his hands deep in his pockets as he watched the snow now falling thickly outside all been talking about me have you well getting used to it 
 
 we wanted to talk toyou harry said ginny but as been hiding ever since we got back 
 
 i want anyone to talk to me said harry who was feeling more and more nettled 
 
 well that was a bit stupid of you said ginny angrily seeing as you know anyone but me been possessed by and i can tell you how it feels 
 
 harry remained quite still as the impact of these words hit him then he wheeled round 
 
 i forgot he said 
 
 lucky you said ginny coolly 
 
 sorry harry said and he meant it so so do you think being possessed then 
 
 well can you remember everything been doing ginny asked are there big blank periods where you know what been up to 
 
 harry racked his brains 
 
 no he said 
 
 then ever possessed you said ginny simply when he did it to me i remember what been doing for hours at a time find myself somewhere and not know how i got there 
 
 harry hardly dared believe her yet his heart was lightening almost in spite of himself 
 
 that dream i had about your dad and the snake though 
 
 harry had these dreams before hermione said you had flashes of what voldemort was up to last year 
 
 this was different said harry shaking his head i was inside that snake it was like i was the snake what if voldemort somehow transported me to london 
 
 one day said hermione sounding thoroughly exasperated read hogwarts a history and perhaps it will remind you that you apparate or disapparaie inside hogwarts even voldemort just make you fly out of your dormitory harry 
 
 you leave your bed mate said ron i saw you thrashing around in your sleep for at least a minute before we could wake you up 
 
 harry started pacing up and down the room again thinking what they were all saying was not only comforting it made sense without really thinking he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth 
 
 not the weapon after all thought harry his heart swelled with happiness and relief and he felt like joining in as they heard sirius tramping past their door towards room singing god rest ye merry hippogriffs at the top of his voice 
 
 how could he have dreamed of returning to privet drive for christmas delight at having the house full again and especially at having harry back was infectious he was no longer their sullen host of the summer now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves as much if not more than they would have done at hogwarts and he worked tirelessly in the to christmas day cleaning and decorating with their help so that by the time they all went to bed on christmas eve the house was barely recognisable the tarnished chandeliers were no longer hung with cobwebs but with garlands of holly and gold and silver streamers magical snow glittered in heaps over the threadbare carpets a great christmas tree obtained by mundungus and decorated with live fairies blocked family tree from view and even the stuffed on the hall wall wore father christmas hats and beards 
 
 harry awoke on christmas morning to find a stack of presents at the foot of his bed and ron already halfway through opening his own rather larger pile 
 
 good haul this year he informed harry through a cloud of paper thanks for the broom compass excellent beats got me a homework planner 
 
 harry sorted through his presents and found one with handwriting on it she had given him too a book that resembled a diary except that every time he opened a page it said aloud things like do it today or later pay 
 
 sirius and lupin had given harry a set of excellent books entitled practical defensive magic and its use against the dark arts which had superb moving colour illustrations of all the and hexes it described harry flicked through the first volume eagerly he could see it was going to be highly useful in his plans for the da hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fangs which were presumably supposed to be an device but unfortunately prevented harry putting any money in without getting his fingers ripped off present was a small working model of a firebolt which harry watched fly around the room wishing he still had his version ron had given him an enormous box of beans mr and mrs weasley the usual jumper and some mince pies and dobby a truly dreadful painting that harry suspected had been done by the elf himself he had just turned it to see whether it looked better that way when with a loud crack fred and george apparated at the foot of his bed 
 
 merry christmas said george go downstairs for a bit 
 
 why not said ron 
 
 crying again said fred heavily percy sent back his christmas jumper 
 
 without a note added george asked how dad is or visited him or anything 
 
 we tried to comfort her said fred moving around the bed to look at portrait told her nothing more than a humungous pile of rat droppings 
 
 work said george helping himself to a chocolate frog so lupin took over best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast i reckon 
 
 that supposed to be anyway asked fred squinting at dobbys painting looks like a gibbon with two black eyes 
 
 harry said george pointing at the back of the picture says so on the back 
 
 good likeness said fred grinning harry threw his new homework diary at him it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily if dotted the and crossed the then you may do whatever you please 
 
 they got up and dressed they could hear the various inhabitants of the house calling merry christmas to one another on their way downstairs they met hermione 
 
 thanks for the book harry she said happily been wanting that new theory of numerology for ages and that really unusual ron 
 
 no problem said ron that for anyway he added nodding at the neatly wrapped present she was carrying 
 
 kreacher said hermione brightly 
 
 it had better not be clothes ron warned her you know what sirius said kreacher knows too much we set him free 
 
 it clothes said hermione although if i had my way certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag no a patchwork quilt i thought it would brighten up his bedroom 
 
 what bedroom said harry dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of mother 
 
 well sirius says not so much a bedroom more a kind ofden said hermione apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen 
 
 mrs weasley was the only person in the basement when they arrived there she was standing at the stove and sounded as though she had a bad head cold as she wished them merry christmas and they all averted their eyes 
 
 so is this bedroom said ron strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry harry had never seen it open 
 
 yes said hermione now sounding a little nervous er i think better knock 
 
 ron rapped on the door with his knuckles but there was no reply 
 
 he must be sneaking around upstairs he said and without further ado pulled open the door urgh 
 
 harry peered inside most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and boiler but in the foot of space underneath the pipes kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest a jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where kreacher curled up to sleep every night here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese in a far corner glinted small objects and coins that harry guessed kreacher had saved from purge of the house and he had also managed to retrieve the family photographs that sirius had thrown away over the summer their glass might be shattered but still the little people inside them peered up at him haughtily includinghe felt a little jolt in his stomachthe dark woman whose trial he had witnessed in pensieve bellatrix lestrange by the looks of it hers was favourite photograph he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with spellotape 
 
 i think just leave his present here said hermione laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rags and blankets and closing the door quietly find it later be fine 
 
 come to think of it said sirius emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey as they closed the cupboard door has anyone actually seen kreacher lately 
 
 i seen him since the night we came back here said harry you were ordering him out of the kitchen 
 
 yeah said sirius frowning you know i think the last time i saw him too he must be hiding upstairs somewhere 
 
 he have left could he said harry i mean when you said out maybe he thought you meant get out of the house 
 
 no no leave unless given clothes tied to their house said sirius 
 
 they can leave the house if they really want to harry contradicted him dobby did he left the to give me warnings two years ago he had to punish himself afterwards but he still managed it 
 
 sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment then said look for him later i expect find him upstairs crying his eyes out over my old bloomers or something of course he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died but i get my hopes up 
 
 fred george and ron laughed hermione however looked reproachful 
 
 once they had eaten their christmas lunch the weasleys harry and hermione were planning to pay mr weasley another visit escorted by and lupin mundungus turned up in time for christmas pudding and trifle having managed to borrow a car for the occasion as the underground did not run on christmas day the car which harry doubted very much had been taken with the consent of its owner had been enlarged with a spell like the weasleys old ford anglia had once been although normally proportioned outside ten people with mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably mrs weasley hesitated before getting insideharry knew her disapproval of mundungus was battling with her dislike of travelling without magicbut finally the cold outside and her pleading triumphed and she settled herself into the back seat between fred and bill with good grace 
 
 the journey to st was quite quick as there was very little traffic on the roads a small trickle of witches and wizards was creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital harry and the others got out of the car and mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them they strolled casually towards the window where the dummy in green nylon stood then one by one stepped through the glass 
 
 the reception area looked pleasantly festive the crystal orbs that illuminated st had been coloured red and gold to become gigantic glowing christmas baubles holly hung around every doorway and shining white christmas trees covered in magical snow and icicles glittered in every corner each one topped with a gleaming gold star it was less crowded than the last time they had been there although halfway across the room harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a satsuma jammed up her left nostril 
 
 family argument eh smirked the blonde witch behind the desk the third seen today spell damage fourth floor 
 
 they found mr weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray on his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face 
 
 everything all right arthur asked mrs weasley after they had all greeted mr weasley and handed over their presents 
 
 fine fine said mr weasley a little too heartily seen healer smethwyck have you 
 
 no said mrs weasley suspiciously why 
 
 nothing nothing said mr weasley airily starting to unwrap his pile of gifts well everyone had a good day what did you all get for christmas oh harry this is absolutely wonderful for he had just opened gift of and screwdrivers 
 
 mrs weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with mr answer as her husband leaned over to shake hand she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt 
 
 arthur she said with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap had your bandages changed why have you had your bandages changed a day early arthur they told me they need doing until tomorrow 
 
 what said mr weasley looking rather frightened and pulling the bed covers higher up his chest no 
 
 he seemed to deflate under mrs piercing gaze 
 
 wellnow get upset molly but augustus pye had an idea the trainee healer you know lovely young chap and very interested in um complementary medicine i mean some of these old muggle remedies well called stitches molly and they work very well onon muggle wounds 
 
 mrs weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf who had no visitors and was looking rather wistfully at the crowd around mr weasley bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and fred and george leapt up to accompany him grinning 
 
 do you mean to tell me said mrs weasley her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover that you have been messing about with muggle remedies 
 
 not messing about molly dear said mr weasley imploringly it was justjust something pye and i thought tryonly most unfortunatelywell with these particular kinds of woundsit seem to work as well as hoped 
 
 meaning 
 
 well well i know whether you know whatwhat stitches are 
 
 it sounds as though been trying to sew your skin back together said mrs weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter but even you arthur be that stupid 
 
 i fancy a cup of tea too said harry jumping to his feet 
 
 hermione ron and ginny almost sprinted to the door with him as it swung closed behind them they heard mrs weasley shriek what do you mean the general idea 
 
 typical dad said ginny shaking her head as they set off up the corridor stitches i ask you 
 
 well you know they do work well on wounds said hermione fairly i suppose something in that venom dissolves them or something i wonder where the tearoom is 
 
 fifth floor said harry remembering the sign over the desk 
 
 they walked along the corridor through a set of double doors and found a rickety staircase lined with more portraits of healers as they climbed it the various healers called out to them diagnosing odd complaints and suggesting horrible remedies ron was seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit 
 
 and that supposed to be he asked angrily as the healer pursued him through six more portraits shoving the occupants out of the way 
 
 tis a most grievous affliction of the skin young master that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now 
 
 watch who calling gruesome said ron his ears turning red 
 
 the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad bind it tight about your throat stand naked at the full moon in a barrel of eels eyes 
 
 i have not got spattergroit 
 
 but the unsightly blemishes upon your visage young master 
 
 freckles said ron furiously now get back in your own picture and leave me alone 
 
 he rounded on the others who were all keeping determinedly straight faces 
 
 what this 
 
 i think the fifth said hermione 
 
 nah the fourth said harry one more 
 
 but as he stepped on to the landing he came to an abrupt halt staring at the small window set into the double doors that marked the start of a corridor signposted spell damage a man was peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass he had wavy blond hair bright blue eyes and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth 
 
 blimey said ron also staring at the man 
 
 oh my goodness said hermione suddenly sounding breathless professor lockhart 
 
 their against the dark arts teacher pushed open the doors and moved towards them wearing a long lilac dressing gown 
 
 well hello there he said i expect like my autograph would you 
 
 changed much has he harry muttered to ginny who grinned 
 
 erhow are you professor said ron sounding slightly guilty it had been malfunctioning wand that had damaged professor memory so badly that he had landed in st in the first place though as lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe harry and memories at the time sympathy was limited 
 
 very well indeed thank you said lockhart exuberantly palling a rather battered quill from his pocket now how many autographs would you like i can do writing now you know 
 
 erwe want any at the moment thanks said ron raising his eyebrows at harry who asked professor should you be wandering around the corridors you be in a ward 
 
 the smile faded slowly from face for a few moments he gazed intently at harry then he said we met 
 
 er yeah we have said harry you used to teach us at hogwarts remember 
 
 teach repeated lockhart looking faintly unsettled me did i 
 
 and then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming 
 
 taught you everything you know i expect did i well how about those autographs then shall we say a round dozen you can give them to all your little friends then and nobody will be left out 
 
 but just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice called gilderoy you naughty boy where have you wandered off to 
 
 a healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor smiling warmly at harry and the others 
 
 oh gilderoy got visitors how lovely and on christmas day too do you know he never gets visitors poor lamb and i think why such a sweetie you 
 
 doing autographs gilderoy told the healer with another glittering smile they want loads of them take no for an answer i just hope got enough photographs 
 
 listen to him said the healer taking arm and beaming fondly at him as though he were a precocious he was rather well known a few years ago we very much hope that this liking for giving autographs is a sign that his memory might be starting to come back will you step this way in a closed ward you know he must have slipped out while i was bringing in the christmas presents the usually kept locked not that dangerous but she lowered her voice to a whisper a bit of a danger to himself bless him know who he is you see wanders off and remember how to get back it is nice of you to have come to see him 
 
 er said ron gesturing uselessly at the floor above actually we were juster 
 
 but the healer was smiling expectantly at them and feeble mutter of going to have a cup of tea trailed away into nothingness they looked at each other helplessly then followed lockhart and his healer along the corridor 
 
 not stay long ron said quietly 
 
 the healer pointed her wand at the door of the janus thickey ward and muttered alohomora the door swung open and she led the way inside keeping a firm grasp on arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed 
 
 this is our residents ward she informed harry ron hermione and ginny in a low voice for permanent spell damage you know of course with intensive remedial potions and charms and a bit of luck we can produce some improvement gilderoy does seem to be getting back some sense of himself and seen a real improvement in mr bode he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well though he speaking any language we recognise yet well i must finish giving out the christmas presents leave you all to chat 
 
 harry looked around the ward bore unmistakeable signs of being a permanent home to its residents they had many more personal effects around their beds than in mr ward the wall around headboard for instance was papered with pictures of himself all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrivals he had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed childish writing the moment he had been deposited in his chair by the healer gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photographs towards him seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly 
 
 you can put them in envelopes he said to ginny throwing the signed pictures into her lap one by one as he finished them i am not forgotten you know no i still receive a very great deal of fan mail gladys gudgeon writes weekly i just wish i knew why he paused looking faintly puzzled then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigour i suspect it is simply my good looks 
 
 a wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling he was mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him two beds along was a woman whose entire head was covered in fur harry remembered something similar happening to hermione during their second year although fortunately the damage in her case had not been permanent at the far end of the ward flowery curtains had been drawn around two beds to give the occupants and their visitors some privacy 
 
 here you are agnes said the healer brightly to the woman handing her a small pile of christmas presents see not forgotten are you and your sent an owl to say visiting tonight so nice it 
 
 agnes gave several loud barks 
 
 and look broderick been sent a pot plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month brighten things up they said the healer bustling along to the mumbling man setting a rather ugly plant with long swaying tentacles on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand andoh mrs longbottom are you leaving already 
 
 head span round the curtains had been drawn back from the two beds at the end of the ward and two visitors were walking back down the aisle between the beds a old witch wearing a long green dress a fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what was unmistakeably a stuffed vulture and trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressedneville 
 
 with a sudden rush of understanding harry realised who the people in the end beds must be he cast around wildly for some means of distracting the others so that neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned but ron had also looked up at the sound of the name longbottom and before harry could stop him had called out neville 
 
 neville jumped and cowered as though a bullet had narrowly missed him 
 
 us neville said ron brightly getting to his feet have you seen here you been visiting 
 
 friends of yours neville dear said grandmother graciously bearing down upon them all 
 
 neville looked as though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here a dull purple flush was creeping up his plump face and he was not making eye contact with any of them 
 
 ah yes said his grandmother looking closely at harry and sticking out a shrivelled clawlike hand for him to shake yes yes i know who you are of course neville speaks most highly of you 
 
 erthanks said harry shaking hands neville did not look at him but surveyed his own feet the colour deepening in his face all the while 
 
 and you two are clearly weasleys mrs longbottom continued proffering her hand regally to ron and ginny in turn yes i know your parentsnot well of coursebut fine people fine people and you must be hermione granger 
 
 hermione looked rather startled that mrs longbottom knew her name but shook hands all the same 
 
 yes told me all about you helped him out of a few sticky spots you a good boy she said casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at neville but be got his talent afraid to say and she jerked her head in the direction of the two beds at the end of the ward so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly 
 
 what said ron looking amazed harry wanted to stamp on foot but that sort of thing is much harder to bring off unnoticed when wearing jeans rather than robes is that your dad down the end neville 
 
 this said mrs longbottom sharply you told your friends about your parents neville 
 
 neville took a deep breath looked up at the ceiling and shook his head harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone but he could not think of any way of helping neville out of the situation 
 
 well nothing to be ashamed of said mrs longbottom angrily you should be proud neville give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them you know 
 
 not ashamed said neville very faintly still looking anywhere but at harry and the others ron was now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitants of the two beds 
 
 well got a funny way of showing it said mrs longbottom my son and his wife she said turning haughtily to harry ron hermione and ginny were tortured into insanity by followers 
 
 hermione and ginny both clapped their hands over their mouths ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of parents and looked mortified 
 
 they were aurors you know and very well respected within the wizarding community mrs longbottom went on highly gifted the pair of them iyes alice dear what is it 
 
 mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress she no longer had the plump face harry had seen in old photograph of the original order of the phoenix her face was thin and worn now her eyes seemed overlarge and her hair which had turned white was wispy and she did not seem to want to speak or perhaps she was not able to but she made timid motions towards neville holding something in her outstretched hand 
 
 again said mrs longbottom sounding slightly weary very well alice dear very well neville take it whatever it is 
 
 but neville had already stretched out his hand into which his mother dropped an empty best blowing gum wrapper 
 
 very nice dear said grandmother in a falsely cheery voice patting his mother on the shoulder 
 
 but neville said quietly thanks mum 
 
 his mother tottered away back up the ward humming to herself neville looked around at the others his expression defiant as though daring them to laugh but harry did not think ever found anything less funny in his life 
 
 well better get back sighed mrs longbottom drawing on long green gloves very nice to have met you all neville put that wrapper in the bin she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now 
 
 but as they left harry was sure he saw neville slip the sweet wrapper into his pocket 
 
 the door closed behind them 
 
 i never knew said hermione who looked tearful 
 
 nor did i said ron rather hoarsely 
 
 nor me whispered ginny 
 
 they all looked at harry 
 
 i did he said glumly dumbledore told me but i promised i tell anyone what bellatrix lestrange got sent to azkaban for using the cruciatus curse on parents until they lost their minds 
 
 bellatrix lestrange did that whispered hermione horrified that woman got a photo of in his den 
 
 there was a long silence broken by angry voice

 harry could feel the felix felicis wearing off as he creeped back into the castle the front door had remainedun locked for him but on the third floor he met peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts by the time he got up to the portrait of the fat lady and pulled off his invisibility cloak he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood 
 
 what sort of time do you call this 
 
 really sorryi had to go out for something important 
 
 well the password changed at midnight so just have to sleep in the corridor you 
 
 joking said harry why did it have to change at midnight 
 
 the way it is said the fat lady if angry go and take it up with the headmaster the one tightened security 
 
 fantastic said harry bitterly looking around at the hard floor really brilliant yeah i would go and take it up with dumbledore if he was here because the one who wanted me to 
 
 he is here said a voice behind harry professor dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago 
 
 nearly headless nick was gliding toward harry his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff 
 
 i had it from the bloody baron who saw him arrive said nick he appeared according to the baron to be in good spirits though a little tired of course 
 
 where is he said harry his heart leaping 
 
 oh groaning and clanking up on the astronomy tower a favorite pastime of his 
 
 not the bloody baron dumbledore 
 
 ohin his office said nick i believe from what the baron said that he had business to attend to before turning in 
 
 yeah he has said harry excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling dumbledore he had secured the memory he wheeled about and sprinted off again ignoring the fat lady who was calling after him 
 
 come back all right i lied i was annoyed you woke me up the still tapeworm 
 
 but harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes he was saying toffee eclairs to gargoyle which leapt aside permitting harry entrance onto the spiral staircase 
 
 enter said dumbledore when harry knocked he sounded exhausted 
 
 harry pushed open the door there was office looking the same as ever but with black skies beyond the windows 
 
 good gracious harry said dumbledore in surprise to what do i owe this very late pleasure 
 
 got it got the memory from slughorn 
 
 harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to dumbledore for a moment or two the headmaster looked stunned then his face split in a wide smile 
 
 harry this is spectacular news very well done indeed i knew you could do it 
 
 all thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten he hurried around his desk took the bottle with memory in his uninjured hand and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the pensieve 
 
 and now said dumbledore placing the stone basin upon the desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it now at last we shall see harry quickly 
 
 harry bowed obediently over the pensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor once again he fell through darkness and landed in horace office many years before 
 
 there was the much younger slughorn with his thick shiny hair and his mustache sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe a small glass of wine in one hand the other rummaging in a box of crystallized pineapple and there were the half dozen teenage boys sitting around slughorn with tom riddle in the midst of them ring gleaming on his finger 
 
 dumbledore landed beside harry just as riddle asked sir is it true that professor merrythought is retiring 
 
 tom tom if i knew i tell you said slughorn wagging his finger reprovingly at riddle though winking at the same time i must say like to know where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are 
 
 riddle smiled the other boys laughed and cast him admiring looks 
 
 what with your uncanny ability to know things you and your careful flattery of the people who matterthank you for the pineapple by the way quite right it is my favorite 
 
 several of the boys tittered again 
 
 i confidently expect you to rise to minister of magic within twenty years fifteen if you keep sending me pineapple i have excellent contacts at the ministry 
 
 tom riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader 
 
 i know that politics would suit me sir he said when the laughter had died away i have the right kind of background for one thing 
 
 a couple of the boys around him smirked at each other harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke undoubtedly about what they knew or suspected regarding their gang famous ancestor 
 
 nonsense said slughorn briskly be plainer you come from decent wizarding stock abilities like yours no go far tom never been wrong about a student yet 
 
 the small golden clock standing upon desk chimed eleven behind him and he looked around 
 
 good gracious is it that time already better get going boys or all be in trouble lestrange i want your essay by in morrow or detention same goes for you avery 
 
 one by one the boys filed out of the room slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk a movement behind him made him look around riddle was still standing there 
 
 look sharp tom you want to be caught out of bed out of hours and you a prefect 
 
 sir i wanted to ask you something 
 
 ask away then ask away 
 
 sir i wondered what you know about about horcruxes 
 
 slughorn stared at him his thick ringers absentmindedly clawing the stem of his wine glass 
 
 project for defense against the dark arts is it 
 
 but harry could tell that slughorn knew perfectly well that this was not schoolwork 
 
 not exactly sir said riddle i came across the term while reading and i fully understand it 
 
 no well be to find a book at hogwarts give you details on horcruxes tom very dark stuff very dark indeed said slughorn 
 
 but you obviously know all about them sir i mean a wizard like yousorry i mean if you tell me obviouslyi just knew if anyone could tell me you couldso i just thought ask 
 
 it was very well done thought harry the hesitancy the casual tone the careful flattery none of it overdone he harry had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work he could tell that riddle wanted the information very very much perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks 
 
 well said slughorn not looking at riddle but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystallized pineapple well it hurt to give you an overview of course just so that you understand the term a horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul 
 
 i quite understand how that works though sir said riddle 
 
 his voice was carefully controlled but harry could sense his excitement 
 
 well you split your soul you see said slughorn and hide part of it in an object outside the body then even if body is attacked or destroyed one cannot die for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged but of course existence in such a form 
 
 face crumpled and harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before 
 
 i was ripped from my body i was less than spirit less than the meanest ghost but still i was alive 
 
 few would want it tom very few death would be preferable 
 
 but hunger was now apparent his expression was greedy he could no longer hide his longing 
 
 how do you split your soul 
 
 well said slughorn uncomfortably you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole splitting it is an act of violation it is against nature 
 
 but how do you do it 
 
 by an act of evilthe supreme act of evil by commiting murder killing rips the soul apart the wizard intent upon creating a horcrux would use the damage to his advantage he would encase the torn portion 
 
 encase but how 
 
 there is a spell do not ask me i know said slughoin shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes do i look as though i have tried itdo i look like a killer 
 
 no sir of course not said riddle quickly sorry i mean to offend 
 
 not at all not at all not offended said slughorn gruffly it is natural to feel some curiosity about these things wizards of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic 
 
 yes sir said riddle what i understand thoughjust out of curiosity i mean would one horcrux be much use can you only split your soul once it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more pieces i mean for instance seven the most powerfully magical number seven 
 
 beard tom yelped slughorn seven it bad enough to think of killing one person and in any case bad enough to divide the soul but to rip it into seven pieces 
 
 slughorn looked deeply troubled now he was gazing at riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before and harry could tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all 
 
 of course he muttered this is all hypothetical what discussing it all academic 
 
 yes sir of course said riddle quickly 
 
 but all the same tom keep it quiet what to say what discussed people like to think been chatting about horcruxes a banned subject at hogwarts you know particularly fierce about it 
 
 i say a word sir said riddle and he left but not before harry had glimpsed his face which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wizard the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features but made them somehow less human 
 
 thank you harry said dumbledore quietly let us go 
 
 when harry landed back on the office floor dumbledore was already sitting down behind his desk harry sat too and waited for dumbledore to speak 
 
 i have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time said dumbledore at last it confirms the theory on which i have been working it tells me that i am right and also how very far there is still to go 
 
 harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation a corpulent red nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet 
 
 well harry said dumbledore i am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard at the same age as you are now give or take a few months tom riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal 
 
 you think he succeeded then sir asked harry he made a horcrux and why he die when he attacked me he had a horcrux hidden somewhere a bit of his soul was safe 
 
 a bit or more said dumbledore you heard voldemort what he particularly wanted from horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one horcrux what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times rip his soul repeatedly so as to store it in many separately concealed horcruxes no book would have given him that information as far as i knowas far i am sure as voldemort knewno wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two 
 
 dumbledore paused for a moment marshaling his thought and then said four years ago i received what i considered certain proof that voldemort had split his soul 
 
 where asked harry how 
 
 you handed it to me harry said dumbledore the diary diary the one giving instructions on how to reopen the chamber of secrets 
 
 i understand sir said harry 
 
 well although i did not see the riddle who came out of the diary what you described to me was a phenomenon i had never witnessed a mere memory starting to act and think for itself a mere memory sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen no something much more sinister had lived inside that book a fragment of soul i was almost sure of it the diary had been a horcrux but this raised as many questions as it answered what intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard 
 
 i still understand said harry 
 
 well it worked as a horcrux is supposed to workin other words the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner but there could be no doubt that riddle really wanted that diary read wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess somebody else so that monster would be unleashed again 
 
 well he want his hard work to be wasted said harry he wanted people to know he was heir because he take credit at the time 
 
 quite correct said dumbledore nodding but you see harry that if he intended the diary to be passed to or planted on some future hogwarts student he was being remarkably blas about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it the point of a horcrux is as professor slughorn explained to keep part of the self hidden and safe not to fling it into somebody path and run the risk that they might destroy itas indeed happened that particular fragment of soul is no more you saw to that 
 
 the careless way in which voldemort regarded this horcrux seemed most ominous to me it suggested that he must have madeor had been planning to makemore horcruxes so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental i did not wish to believe it but nothing else seemed to make sense then you told me two years later that on the night that voldemort returned to his body he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his death eaters i who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality that was what you told me he said further than anybody and i thought i knew what that meant though the death eaters did not he was referring to his horcruxes horcruxes in the plural harry which i believe any other wizard has ever had yet it fitted lord voldomort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years and the transformation he had undergone seemed to me to be only explainable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call usual evil 
 
 so made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people said harry why he make a stone or steal one if he was so interested in immortality 
 
 well we know that he tried to do just that five years ago said dumbledore but there are several reasons why i think a stone would appeal less than horcruxes to lord voldemort 
 
 while the elixir of life does indeed extend life it must be drunk regularly for all eternity if the drinker is to maintain the immortality therefore voldemort would be entirely dependant on the elixir and if it ran out or was contaminated or if the stone was stolen he would die just like any other man voldemort likes to operate alone remember i believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent even on the elixir intolerable of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible to which he was condemned after attacking you but only to regain a body thereafter i am convinced he intended to continue to rely on his horcruxes he would need nothing more if only he could regain a human form he was already immortal you see or as close to immortal as any man can be 
 
 but now harry armed with this information the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us we are closer to the secret of finishing lord voldemort than anyone has ever been before you heard him harry it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more piece seven the most powerfully magical numbe seven the most powerfully magical number yes i think the idea of a soul would greatly appeal to lord voldemort 
 
 he made seven horcruxes said harry while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage but they could be anywhere in the worldhiddenburied or invisible 
 
 i am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem said dumbledore calmly but firstly no harry not seven horcruxes six the seventh part of his soul however maimed resides inside his regenerated body that was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile without that he has no self at all that seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill voldemort must attackthe piece that lives in his body 
 
 but the six horcruxes then said harry a little desperately how are we supposed to find them 
 
 you are forgetting you have already destroyed one of them and i have destroyed another 
 
 you have said harry eagerly 
 
 yes indeed said dumbledore and he raised his blackened hand the ring harry ring and a terrible curse there was upon it too had it not beenforgive me the lack of seemly modestyfor my own prodigious skill and for professor timely action when i returned to hogwarts desperately injured i might not have lived to tell the tale however a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of soul the ring is no longer a horcrux 
 
 but how did you find it 
 
 well as you now know for many years i have made it my business to discover as much as i can about past life i have traveled widely visiting those places he once knew i stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the house it seem that once voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in side it he did not want to wear it anymore he hid it protected by many powerful enchantments in the shack where his ancestors had once lived morfin having been carted off to azkaban of course never guessing that i might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin or that i might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment 
 
 however we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily you destroyed the diary and i the ring but if we are right in our theory of a soul four horcruxes remain 
 
 and they could be anything said harry they could be oh in tin cans or i dunno empty potion bottles 
 
 you are thinking of portkeys harry which must be ordinary objects easy to overlook but would lord voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul you are forgetting what i have showed you lord voldemort liked to collect trophies and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history his pride his belief in his own superiority his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history these things suggest to me that voldemort would have chosen his horcruxes with some care favoring objects worthy of the honor 
 
 the diary that special 
 
 the diary as you have said yourself was proof that he was the heir of slytherin i am sure that voldemort considered it of stupendous importance 
 
 so the other horcruxes said harry do you think you know what they are sir 
 
 i can only guess said dumbledore for the reasons i have already given i believe that lord voldemort would prefer objects that in themselves have a certain grandeur i have therefore trawled back through past to see if i can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him 
 
 the locket said harry loudly cup 
 
 yes said dumbledore smiling i would be prepared to betperhaps not my other handbut a couple of fingers that they became horcruxes three and four the remaining two assuming again that he created a total of six are more of a problem but i will hazard a guess that having secured objects from hufflepuff and slytherin he set out to track down objects owned by gryffindor or ravenclaw four objects from the four founders would i am sure have exerted a powerful pull over imagination i cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of i am confident however that the only known relic of gryffindor remains safe 
 
 dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him where a sword reposed within a glass case 
 
 do you think why he really wanted to come back to hogwarts sir said harry to try and find something from one of the other founders 
 
 my thoughts precisely said dumbledore but unfortunately that does not advance us much further for he was turned away or so i believe without the chance to search the school i am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders objects he definitely had twohe may have found threethat is the best we can do for now 
 
 even if he got something of or of that leaves a sixth horcrux said harry counting on his fingers unless got both 
 
 i think so said dumbledore i think i know what the sixth horcrux is i wonder what you will say when i confess that i have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake nagini 
 
 the snake said harry startled you can use animals as horcruxes 
 
 well it is inadvisable to do so said dumbledore because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business however if my calculations are correct voldemort was still at least one horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered your parents house with the intention of killing you 
 
 he seems to have reserved the process of making horcruxes for particularly significant deaths you would certainly have been that he believed that in killing you he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined he believed he was making himself invincible i am sure that he was intending to make his final horcrux with your death as we know he failed after an interval of some years however he used nagini to kill an old muggle man and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last horcrux she underlines the slytherin connection which enhances lord mystique i think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything he certainly likes to keep her close and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her even for a parselmouth 
 
 so said harry the gone the gone the cup the locket and the snake are still intact and you think there might be a horcrux that was once or 
 
 an admirably succinct and accurate summary yes said dumbledore bowing his head 
 
 so are you still looking for them sir is that where been going when been leaving the school 
 
 correct said dumbledore i have been looking for a very long time i think perhaps i may be close to finding another one there are hopeful signs 
 
 and if you do said harry quickly can i come with you and help get rid of it 
 
 dumbledore looked at harry very intently for a moment before saying yes i think so 
 
 i can said harry thoroughly taken aback 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore smiling slightly i think you have earned that right 
 
 harry felt his heart lift it was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for once the headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by decision harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and phineas nigellus actually snorted 
 
 does voldemort know when a horcrux is destroyed sir can he feel it harry asked ignoring the portraits 
 
 a very interesting question harry i believe not i believe that voldemort is now so immersed in evil and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long he does not feel as we do perhaps at the point of death he might be aware of his loss but he was not aware for instance that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of lucius malfoy when voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers i am told that his anger was terrible to behold 
 
 but i thought he meant lucius malfoy to smuggle it into hogwarts 
 
 yes he did years ago when he was sure he would be able to create more horcruxes but still lucius was supposed to wait for voldemorts and he never received it for voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary no doubt he thought that lucius would not dare do anything with the horcrux other than guard it carefully but he was counting too much upon fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom lucius believed dead of course lucius did not know what the diary really was i understand that voldemort had told him the diary would cause the chamber of secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted had lucius known he held a portion of his soul in his hands he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverencebut instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends by planting the diary upon arthur daughter he hoped to discredit arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke ah poor lucius what with fury about the fact that he threw away the horcrux for his own gain and the fiasco at the ministry last year i would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in azkaban at the moment 
 
 harry sat in thought for a moment then asked so if all of his horcruxes are destroyed voldemort could be killed 
 
 yes i think so said dumbledore without his horcruxes voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul never forget though that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair his brain and his magical powers remain intact it will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like voldemort even without his horcruxes 
 
 but i got uncommon skill and power said harry before he could stop himself 
 
 yes you have said dumbledore firmly you have a power that voldemort has never had you can 
 
 i know said harry impatiently i can love it was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding big deal 
 
 yes harry you can love said dumbledore who looked as though he knew perfectly well what harry had just refrained from saying which given everything that has happened to you is a great and remarkable thing you are still too young to understand how unusual you are harry 
 
 so when the prophecy says that have power the dark lord knows not it just meanslove asked harry feeling a little let down 
 
 yesjust love said dumbledore but harry never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because voldemort made it so i told you this at the end of last year voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to himand in doing so he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him 
 
 but it comes to the same 
 
 no it said dumbledore sounding impatient now pointing at harry with his black withered hand he said you are setting too much store by the prophecy 
 
 but spluttered harry but you said the prophecy means 
 
 if voldemort had never heard of the prophecy would it have been fulfilled would it have meant anything of course not do you think every prophecy in the hall of prophecy has been fulfilled 
 
 but said harry bewildered but last year you said one of us would have to kill the other 
 
 harry harry only because voldemort made a grave error and acted on professor words if voldemort had never murdered your father would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge of course not if he had not forced your mother to die for you would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate of course not harry you see voldemort himself created his worst enemy just as tyrants everywhere do have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress all of them realize that one day amongst their many victims there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back voldemort is no different always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him he heard the prophecy and he leapt into action with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him he handed him uniquely deadly weapons 
 
 but 
 
 it is essential that you understand this said dumbledore standing up and striding about the room his glittering robes swooshing in his wake harry had never seen him so agitated by attempting to kill you voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me and gave him the tools for the job it is fault that you were able to see into his thoughts his ambitions that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders and yet harry despite your privileged insight into world which incidentally is a gift any death eater would kill to have you have never been seduced by the dark arts never even for a second shown the slightest desire to become one of followers 
 
 of course i said harry indignantly he killed my mum and dad 
 
 you are protected in short by your ability to love said dumbledore loudly the only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like in spite of all the temptation you have endured all the suffering you remain pure of heart just as pure as you were at the age of eleven when you stared into a mirror that reflected your desire and it showed you only the way to thwart lord voldemort and not immortality or riches harry have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with but he did not 
 
 but he knows it now you have flitted into lord mind without damage to yourself but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony as he discovered in the ministry i do not think he understands why harry but then he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole 
 
 but sir said harry making valiant efforts not to sound argumentative it all comes to the same thing it got to try and kill him or 
 
 got to said dumbledore of course got to but not because of the prophecy because you yourself will never rest until tried we both know it imagine please just for a moment that you had never heard that prophecy how would you feel about voldemort now think 
 
 harry watched dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him and thought he thought of his mother his father and sinus he thought of cedric diggory he thought of all the terrible deeds he knew lord voldemort had done a flame seemed to leap inside his chest searing his throat 
 
 want him finished said harry quietly and want to do it 
 
 of course you would cried dumbledore you see the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything but the prophecy caused lord voldemort to mark you as his equal in other words you are free to choose your way quite free to turn your back on the prophecy but voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy he will continue to hunt you which makes it certain really that 
 
 that one of us is going to end up killing the other said harry 
 
 yes 
 
 but he understood at last what dumbledore had been trying to tell him it was he thought the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high some people perhaps would say that there was little to choose between the two ways but dumbledore knewand so do i thought harry with a rush of fierce pride and so did my parentsthat there was all the difference in the world

 harry looked around at the other two now mere outlines in the darkness he saw hermione point her wand set toward the outside but into his face there was a bang a burst of white light and he buckled in agony unable to see he could feel his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls surrounded him 
 
 get up vermin 
 
 unknown hands dragged harry roughly off the ground before he could stop them someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand harry clutched at his excruciatingly painful face which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers tight swollen and puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction his eyes had been reduced to slits through which he could barely see his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling ron and hermione outside too 
 
 get c off c her ron shouted there was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh ron grunted in pain and hermione screamed no leave him alone leave him alone 
 
 your boyfriends going to have worse than that done to him if hes on my list said the horribly familiar rasping voice delicious girl what a treat i do enjoy the softness of the skin 
 
 harrys stomach turned over he knew who this was fenrit greyback the werewolf who was permitted to wear death eater robes in return for his hired savagery 
 
 search the tent said another voice 
 
 harry was thrown face down onto the ground a thud told him that ron had been cast down beside him they could hear footsteps and crashes the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent as they searched 
 
 now lets see who weve got said greybacks gloating voice from overhead and harry was rolled over onto his back a beam of wand light fell onto his face and greyback laughed 
 
 ill be needing butterbeer to wash this one down what happened to you ugly 
 
 harry did not answer immediately 
 
 i said repeated greyback and harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double over in pain what happened to you 
 
 stung harry muttered been stung 
 
 yeah looks like it said a second voice 
 
 whats your name snarled greyback 
 
 dudley said harry 
 
 and your first name 
 
 i c vernon vernon dudley

 like ell you are said the man called scabior we know stan shunpike es put a bit of work our way 
 
 there was another thud 
 
 ib bardy said ron and harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood bardy weasley 
 
 a weasley rasped greyback so youre related to blood traitors even if youre not a mudblood and lastly your pretty little friend the relish in his voice made harrys flesh crawl 
 
 easy greyback said scabior over the jeering of the others 
 
 oh im not going to bite just yet well see if shes a bit quicker at remembering her name than barny who are you girly 
 
 penelope clearwater said hermione she sounded terrified but convincing 
 
 whats your blood status

 easy enough to check said scabior but the ole lot of em look like they could still be ogwarts age c 
 
 web lebt said ron 
 
 left ave you ginger said scabior and you decided to go camping and you thought just for a laugh youd use the dark lords name 
 
 nod a laugh said ron aggiden 
 
 accident there was more jeering laughter 
 
 you know who used to like using the dark lords name weasley growled greyback the order of the phoenix mean anything to you 
 
 doh 
 
 well they dont show the dark lord proper respect so the names been tabooed a few order members have been tracked that way well see bind them up with the other two prisoners 
 
 someone yanked harry up by the hair dragged him a short way pushed him down into a sitting position then started binding him with other people harry was still half blind barely able to see anything through his eyes when at last the man tying then had walked away harry whispered to the other prisoners 
 
 anyone still got a wand 
 
 no said ron and hermione from either side of him 
 
 this is all my fault i said the name im sorry c 
 
 harry 
 
 it was a new but familiar voice and it came from directly behind harry from the person tied to hermiones left 
 
 dean 
 
 it is you if they find out who theyve got theyre snatchers theyre only looking for truants to sell for gold c 
 
 not a bad little haul for one night greyback was saying as a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by harry and they heard more crashes from inside the tent a mudblood a runaway goblin and these truants you checked their names on the list yet scabior he roared 
 
 yeah theres no vernon dudley un ere greyback 
 
 interesting said greyback thats interesting 
 
 he crouched down beside harry who saw through the infinitesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers with pointed brown teeth and sores in the corners of his mouth greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where dumbledore had died of dirt sweat and blood 
 
 so you arent wanted then vernon or are you on that list under a different name what house were you in at hogwarts 
 
 slytherin said harry automatically 
 
 funny ow they all thinks we wants to ear that leered scabior out of the shadows but none of em can tell us where the common room is 
 
 its in the dungeons said harry clearly you enter through the wall its full of skulls and stuff and its under the lake so the lights all green 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 well well looks like we really ave caught a little slytherin said scabior good for you vernon cause there aint a lot of mudblood slytherins whos your father 
 
 he works at the ministry harry lied he knew that his whole story would collapse with the smallest investigation but on the other hand he only had until his face regained its usual appearance before the game was up in any case department of magical accidents and catastrophes 
 
 you know what greyback said scabior i think there is a dudley in there 
 
 harry could barely breathe could luck sheer luck get them safely out of this 
 
 well well said greyback and harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous voice and knew that greyback was wondering whether he had just indeed just attacked and bound the son of a ministry official harrys heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs he would not have been surprised to know that greyback could see it if youre telling the truth ugly youve got nothing to fear from a trip to the ministry i expect your fatherll reward us just for picking you up 
 
 but said harry his mouth bone dry if you just let us c 
 
 hey came a shout from inside the tent look at this greyback 
 
 a dark figure came bustling toward them and harry saw a glint of silver to the light of their wands they had found gryffindors sword 
 
 nice said greyback appreciatively taking it from his companion oh very nice indeed looks that where did you get something like this 
 
 its my fathers harry lied hoping against hope that it was too dark for greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt we borrowed it to cut firewood c 
 
 ang on a minute greyback look at this in the prophet 
 
 as scabior said it harrys scar which was stretched tight across his distended forehead burned savagely more clearly than he could make out anything around him he saw a towering building a grim fortress and forbidding voldemorts thoughts had suddenly become again he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose 
 
 so close so close with a huge effort of will harry closed his mind to voldemorts thoughts pulling himself back to where he sat tied to ron hermione dean and griphook in the darkness listening to greyback and scabior 
 
 hermione granger scabior was saying the mudblood who is known to be traveling with arry potter 
 
 harrys scar burned in the silence but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present nor to slip into voldemorts mind he heard the creak of greybacks boots as he crouched down in front of hermione 
 
 you know what little girly this picture looks a hell of a lot like you 
 
 it isnt it isnt me 
 
 hermiones terrified squeak was as good as a confession 
 
 known to be traveling with harry potter repeated greyback quietly 
 
 a stillness had settled over the scene harrys scar was exquisitely painful but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of voldemorts thoughts it had never been so important to remain in his own right mind 
 
 well this changed things doesnt it whispered greyback nobody spoke harry sensed the gang of snatchers watching frozen and felt hermiones arm trembling against his greyback got up and took a couple of steps to where harry sat crouching down again to stare closely at his misshapen features 
 
 whats that on your forehead vernon he asked softly his breath foul in harrys nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taught scar 
 
 dont touch it harry yelled he could not stop himself he thought he might be sick from the pain of it 
 
 i thought you wore glasses potter breathed greyback 
 
 i found glasses yelped one of the snatchers skulking in the background there was glasses in the tent greyback wait c 
 
 and seconds later harrys glasses had been rammed back onto his face the snatchers were closing in now peering at him 
 
 it is rasped greyback weve caught potter 
 
 they all took several steps backward stunned by what they had done harry still fighting to remain present in his own splitting head could think of nothing to say fragmented visions were breaking across the surface of his mind 
 
 che was hiding around the high walls of the black fortressc 
 
 no he was harry tied up and wandless in grave dangerc 
 
 clooking up up to the topmost window the highest towerc 
 
 he was harry and they were discussing his fate in low voicesc 
 
 ctime to fly 
 
 to the ministry 
 
 to hell with the ministry growled greyback theyll take the credit and we wont get a look in i say we take him straight to 
 
 will you summon im ere said scabior sounding awed terrified 
 
 no snarled greyback i havent got c they say hes using the malfoys place as a base well take the boy there 
 
 harry thought he knew why greyback was not calling voldemort the werewolf might be allowed to wear death eater robes when they wanted to use him but only voldemorts inner circle were branded with the dark mark greyback had not been granted this highest honor 
 
 harrys scar seared again c 
 
 c and he rose into the night flying straight up to the windows at the very top of the tower c 
 
 completely sure its him cause if it aint greyback were dead 
 
 whos in charge here roared greyback covering his moment of inadequacy i say thats potter and him plus his wand thats two hundred thousand galleons right there but if youre too gutless to come along any of you its all for me and with any luck ill get the girl thrown in 
 
 c the window was the merest slit in the black rock not big enough for a man to enter a skeletal figure was just visible through it curled beneath a blanket dead or sleeping 
 
 all right said scabior all right were in and what about the rest of em greyback whatll we do with em 
 
 might as well take the lot weve got two mudbloods thats another ten galleons give me the sword as well if theyre rubies thats another small fortune right there 
 
 the prisoners were dragged to their feet harry could hear hermiones breathing fast and terrified 
 
 grab hold and make it tight ill do potter said greyback seizing a fistful of harrys hair harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp on three one c two c three c 
 
 they disapparated pulling the prisoners with them harry struggled trying to throw off greybacks hand but it was hopeless ron and hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side he could not separate from the group and as the breath was squeezed out of him his scar seared more painfully still c 
 
 c as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed lightly as vapor inside the room c 
 
 the prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane harrys eyes still puffy took a moment to acclimatize then he saw a pair of gates at the foot of what looked like a long drive he experienced the tiniest trickle of relief the worst had not happened yet voldemort was not here he was harry knew for he was fighting to resist the vision in some strange fortresslike place at the top of a tower how long it would take voldemort to get to this place once he knew that harry was here was another matter 
 
 one of the snatchers strode to the gates and shook them 
 
 how do we get in theyre locked greyback i cant c blimey 
 
 he whipped his hands away in fright the iron was contorting twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frightening face which spoke in a clanging echoing voice state your purpose 
 
 weve got potter greyback roared triumphantly weve captured harry potter 
 
 the gates swung open 
 
 come on said greyback to his men and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up the drive between high hedges that muffled their footsteps harry saw a ghostly white shape above him and realized it was an albino peacock he stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by greyback now he was staggering along sideways tied to the four other prisoner closing his puffy eyes he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a moment wanting to know what voldemort was doing whether he knew yet that harry was caught 
 
 the emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him eyes opening in a skull of a face the frail man sat up great sunken eyes fixed upon him upon voldemort and then he smiled most of his teeth were gone 
 
 so you have come i thought you would one day but your journey was pointless i never had it 
 
 you lie 
 
 as voldemorts anger throbbed inside him harrys scar threatened to burst with pain and he wrenched his mind back to his own body fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed over gravel 
 
 light spilled out over all of them 
 
 what is this said a womans cold voice 
 
 were here to see rasped greyback 
 
 who are you 
 
 you know me there was resentment in the werewolfs voice fenrit greyback weve caught harry potter 
 
 greyback seized harry and dragged him around to face the light forcing the other prisoners to shuffle around too 
 
 i know es swollen maam but its im piped up scabior if you look a bit closer youll see is scar and this ere see the girl the mudblood whos been traveling around with im maam theres no doubt its im and weve got is wand as well ere maam c 
 
 through his puffy eyelids harry saw narcissa malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her she raised her eyebrows 
 
 bring them in she said 
 
 harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with portraits 
 
 follow me said narcissa leading the way across the hall my son draco is home for his easter holidays if that is harry potter he will know 
 
 the drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside even with his eyes almost closed harry could make out the wide proportions of the room a crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling more portraits against the dark purple walls two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the snatchers 
 
 what is this 
 
 the dreadfully familiar drawling voice of lucius malfoy fell on harrys ears he was panicking now he could see no way out and it was easier as his fear mounted to block out voldemorts thoughts though his scar was still burning 
 
 they say theyve got potter said narcissas cold voice draco come here 
 
 harry did not dare look directly at draco but saw him obliquely a figure slightly taller than he was rising from an armchair his face a pale and pointed blur beneath hair 
 
 greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place harry directly beneath the chandelier 
 
 well boy rasped the werewolf 
 
 harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace a great gilded thing in an intricately scrolled frame through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time since leaving grimmauld place 
 
 his face was huge shiny and pink every feature distorted by hermiones jinx his black hair reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw had he not known that it was he who stood there he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses he resolved not to speak for his voice was sure to give him away yet he still avoided eye contact with draco as the latter approached 
 
 well draco said lucius malfoy he sounded avid is it is it harry potter 
 
 i cant c i cant be sure said draco he was keeping his distance from greyback and seemed as scared of looking at harry as harry was of looking at him 
 
 but look at him carefully look come closer 
 
 harry had never heard lucius malfoy so excited 
 
 draco if we are the ones who hand potter over to the dark lord everything will be forgiv c 
 
 now we wont be forgetting who actually caught him i hope mr malfoy said greyback menacingly 
 
 of course not of course not said lucius impatiently he approached harry himself came so close that harry could see the usually languid pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen eyes with his face a puffy mask harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of a cage 
 
 what did you do to him lucius asked greyback how did he get into this state 
 
 that wasnt us 
 
 looks more like a stinging jinx to me said lucius 
 
 his gray eyes raked harrys forehead 
 
 theres something there he whispered it could be the scar stretched tight 
 
 draco come here look properly what do you think 
 
 harry saw dracos face up close now right beside his fathers they were extraordinarily alike except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement dracos expression was full of reluctance even fear 
 
 i dont know he said and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood watching 
 
 we had better be certain lucius narcissa called to her husband in her cold clear voice completely sure that it is potter before we summon the dark lord they say this is his c she was looking closely at the blackthorn wand c but it does not resemble ollivanders description if we are mistaken if we call the dark lord here for nothing remember what he did to rowle and dolohov 
 
 what about the mudblood then growled greyback harry was nearly thrown off his feet as the snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again so that the light fell on hermione instead 
 
 wait said narcissa sharply yes c yes she was in madam malkins with potter i saw her picture in the prophet look draco isnt it the granger girl 
 
 i maybe yeah 
 
 but then thats the weasley boy shouted lucius striding around the bound prisoners to face ron its them potters friends c draco look at him isnt it arthur weasleys son whats his name c 
 
 yeah said draco again his back to the prisoners it could be 
 
 the drawing room door opened behind harry a woman spoke and the sound of the voice wound harrys fear to an even higher pitch 
 
 what is this whats happened cissy 
 
 bellatrix lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners and stopped on harrys right staring at hermione through her heavily lidded eyes but surely she said quietly this is the mudblood girl this is grander 
 
 yes yes its granger cried lucius and beside her we think potter potter and his friends caught at last 
 
 potter shrieked bellatrix and she backed away the better to take in harry 
 
 are you sure well then the dark lord must be informed at once 
 
 she dragged back her left sleeve harry saw the dark mark burned into the flesh of her arm and knew that she was about to touch it to summon her beloved masterc 
 
 i was about to call him said lucius and his hand actually closed upon bellatrixs wrist preventing her from touching the mark i shall summon him bella potter has been brought to my house and it is therefore upon my authority c 
 
 your authority she sneered attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp you lost your authority when you lost your wand lucius how dare you take your hands off me 
 
 this is nothing to do with you you did not capture the boy c 
 
 begging your pardon mr malfoy interjected greyback but its us that caught potter and its us thatll be claiming the gold c 
 
 gold laughed bellatrix still attempting to throw off her her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand take your gold filthy scavenger what do i want with gold i seek only the honor of his c of c 
 
 she stopped struggling her dark eyes fixed upon something harry could not see jubilant at her capitulation lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve c 
 
 stop shrieked bellatrix do not touch it we shall all perish if the dark lord comes now 
 
 lucius froze his index finger hovering over his own mark bellatrix strode out of harrys limited line of vision 
 
 what is that he heard her say 
 
 sword grunted an snatcher 
 
 give it to me 
 
 its not yours missus its mine i reckon i found it 
 
 there was a bang and a flash of red light harry knew that the snatcher had been stunned there was a roar of anger from his fellows scabior drew his wand 
 
 what dyou think youre playing at woman 
 
 stupefy she screamed stupefy 
 
 they were no match for her even thought there were four of them against one of her she was a witch as harry knew with prodigious skill and no conscience they fell where they stood all except greyback who had been forced into a kneeling position his arms outstretched out of the corners of his eyes harry saw bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf the sword of gryffindor gripped tightly in her hand her face waxen 
 
 where did you get this sword she whispered to greyback as she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip 
 
 how dare you he snarled his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze up at her he bared his pointed teeth release me woman 
 
 where did you find this sword she repeated brandishing it in his face snape sent it to my vault in gringotts 
 
 it was in their tent rasped greyback release me i say 
 
 she waved her wand and the werewolf sprang to his feet but appeared too wary to approach her he prowled behind an armchair his filthy curved nails clutching its back 
 
 draco move this scum outside said bellatrix indicating the unconscious men if you havent got the guts to finish them then leave them in the courtyard for me 
 
 dont you dare speak to draco like c said narcissa furiously but bellatrix screamed 
 
 be quiet the situation is graver than you can possibly imagine cissy we have a very serious problem 
 
 she stood panting slightly looking down at the sword examining its hilt then she turned to look at the silent prisoners 
 
 if it is indeed potter he must not be harmed she muttered more to herself than to the others the dark lord wishes to dispose of potter himself but if he finds out i must i must know 
 
 she turned back to her sister again 
 
 the prisoners must be placed in the cellar while i think what to do 
 
 this is my house bella you dont give orders in my c 
 
 do it you have no idea of the danger were in shrieked bellatrix she looked frightening mad a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet 
 
 narcissa hesitated for a moment then addressed the werewolf 
 
 take these prisoners down to the cellar greyback 
 
 wait said bellatrix sharply all except except for the mudblood 
 
 greyback gave a grunt of pleasure 
 
 no shouted ron you can have me keep me 
 
 bellatrix hit him across the face the blow echoed around the room 
 
 if she dies under questioning ill take you next she said blood traitor is next to mudblood in my book take them downstairs greyback and make sure they are secure but do nothing more to them c yet 
 
 she threw greybacks wand back to him then took a short silver knife from under her robes she cut hermione free from the other prisoners then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room while greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door into a dark passageway his wand held out in front of him projecting an invisible and irresistible force 
 
 reckon shell let me have a bit of the girl when shes finished with her greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor id say ill get a bite or two wouldnt you ginger 
 
 harry could feel ron shaking they were forced down a steep flight of stairs still tied and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment at the bottom was a heavy door greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand then forced them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness the echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away before there was a terrible drawn out scream from directly above them 
 
 hermione ron bellowed and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying them together so that harry staggered hermione 
 
 be quiet harry said shut up ron we need to work out a way c 
 
 hermione hermione 
 
 we need a plan stop yelling c we need to get these ropes off c 
 
 harry came a whisper through the darkness ron is that you 
 
 ron stopped shouting there was a sound of movement close by them then harry saw a shadow moving closer 
 
 harry ron 
 
 luna 
 
 yes its me oh no i didnt want you to be caught 
 
 luna can you help us get these ropes off said harry 
 
 oh yes i expect so theres an old nail we use if we need to break anything just a moment 
 
 hermione screamed again from overhead and they could hear bellatrix screaming too but her words were inaudible for ron shouted again hermione hermione 
 
 mr ollivander harry could hear luna saying mr ollivander have you got the nail if you just move over a little bit i think it was beside the water jug 
 
 she was back within seconds 
 
 youll need to stay still she said 
 
 harry could feel her digging at the ropes tough fibers to work the knots free from upstairs they heard bellatrixs voice 
 
 im going to ask you again where did you get this sword where 
 
 we found it c we found it c please hermione screamed again ron struggled harder than ever and the rusty nail slipped onto harrys wrist 
 
 ron please stay still luna whispered i cant see what im doing c 
 
 my pocket said ron in my pocket theres a deluminator and its full of light 
 
 a few seconds later there was a click and the luminescent spheres the deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar unable to rejoin their sources they simply hung there like tiny suns flooding the underground room with light harry saw luna all eyes in her white face and the motionless figure of ollivander the wandmaker curled up on the floor in the corner craning around he caught sight of their fellow prisoners dean and griphook the goblin who seemed barely conscious kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans 
 
 oh thats much easier thanks ron said luna and she began hacking at their bindings again hello dean 
 
 from above came bellatrixs voice 
 
 youre lying filthy mudblood and i know it you have been inside my vault at gringotts tell the truth tell the truth 
 
 another terrible screamc 
 
 hermione 
 
 what else did you take what else have you got tell me the truth or i swear i shall run you through with this knife 
 
 there 
 
 harry felt the ropes fall away and turned rubbing his wrists to see ron running around the cellar looking up at the low ceiling searching for a trapdoor dean his face bruised and bloody said thanks to luna and stood there shivering but griphook sank onto the cellar floor looking groggy and disoriented many welts across his swarthy face 
 
 ron was now trying to disapparate without a wand 
 
 theres no way out ron said luna watching his fruitless efforts the cellar is completely i tried at first mr ollivander has been here for a long time hes tried everything 
 
 hermione was screaming again the sound went through harry like physical pain barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar he too started to run around the cellar feeling the walls for he hardly knew what knowing in his heart that it was useless 
 
 what else did you take what else answer me crucio 
 
 hermiones screams echoed off the walls upstairs ron was half sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists and harry in utter desperation seized hagrids pouch from around his neck and groped inside it he pulled out dumbledores snitch and shook it hoping for he did not know what c nothing happened c he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand but they were lifeless c the mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor and he saw a gleam of brightest blue c 
 
 dumbledores eye was gazing at him out of the mirror 
 
 help us he yelled at it in mad desperation were in the cellar of malfoy manor help us 
 
 the eye blinked and was gone 
 
 harry was not even sure that it had really been there he tilted the shard of mirror this way and that and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison and upstairs hermione was screaming worse than ever and next to him ron was bellowing hermione hermione 
 
 how did you get into my vault they heard bellatrix scream did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you 
 
 we only met him tonight hermione sobbed weve never been inside your vault it isnt the real sword its a copy just a copy 
 
 a copy screeched bellatrix oh a likely story 
 
 but we can find out easily came luciuss voice draco fetch the goblin he can tell us whether the sword is real or not 
 
 harry dashed across the cellar to where griphook was huddled on the floor 
 
 griphook he whispered into the goblins pointed ear you must tell them that swords a fake they mustnt know its the real one griphook please c 
 
 he could hear someone scuttling own the cellar steps next moment dracos shaking voice spoke from behind the door 
 
 stand back line up against the back wall dont try anything or ill kill you 
 
 they did as they were bidden as the lock turned ron clicked the deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket restoring the cellars darkness the door flew open malfoy marched inside wand held out in front of him pale and determined he seized the little goblin by the arm and backed out again dragging griphook with him the door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar 
 
 ron clicked the deluminator three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket revealing dobby the who had just apparated into their midst 
 
 dob c 
 
 harry hit ron on the arm to stop him shouting and ron looked terrified at his mistake footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead draco marching griphook to bellatrix 
 
 dobbys enormous shaped eyes were wide he was trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears he was back in the home of his old masters and it was clear that he was petrified 
 
 harry potter he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice dobby has come to rescue you 
 
 but how did you c 
 
 an awful scream drowned harrys words hermione was being tortured again he cut to the essentials 
 
 you can disapparate out of this cellar he asked dobby who nodded his ears flapping 
 
 and you can take humans with you 
 
 dobby nodded again 
 
 right dobby i want you to grab luna dean and mr ollivander and take them c take them to c 
 
 bill and fleurs said ron shell cottage on the outskirts of tinworth 
 
 the elf nodded for a third time 
 
 and then come back said harry can you do that dobby 
 
 of course harry potter whispered the little elf he hurried over to mr ollivander who appeared to be barely conscious he took one of the wandmakers hands in his own then held out the other to luna and dean neither of whom moved 
 
 harry we want to help you luna whispered 
 
 we cant leave you here said dean 
 
 go both of you well see you at bill and fleurs 
 
 as harry spoke his scar burned worse than ever and for a few seconds he looked down not upon the wandmaker but on another man who was just as old just as thin but laughing scornfully 
 
 kill me then voldemort i welcome death but my death will not bring you what you seek there is so much you do not understand 
 
 he felt voldemorts fury but as hermione screamed again he shut it out returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present 
 
 go harry beseeched to luna and dean go well follow just go 
 
 they caught hold of the elfs outstretched fingers there was another loud crack and dobby luna dean and ollivander vanished 
 
 what was that shouted lucius malfoy from over their heads did you hear that what was that noise in the cellar 
 
 harry and ron stared at each other 
 
 draco c no call wormtail make him go and check 
 
 footsteps crossed the room overhead then there was silence harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar 
 
 were going to have to try and tackle him he whispered to ron they had no choice the moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners they were lost leave the lights on harry added and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door they backed against the wall on either side of it 
 
 stand back came wormtails voice stand away from the door im coming in 
 
 the door flew open for a split second wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar ablaze with light from the three miniature suns floating in midair then harry and ron launched themselves upon him ron seized wormtails wand arm and forced it upwards harry slapped a hand to his mouth muffling his voice silently they struggled wormtails wand emitted sparks his silver hand closed around harrys throat 
 
 what is it wormtail called lucius malfoy from above 
 
 nothing ron called back in a passable imitation of wormtails wheezy voice all fine 
 
 harry could barely breathe 
 
 youre going to kill me harry choked attempting to prise off the metal fingers after i saved your life you owe me wormtail 
 
 the silver fingers slackened harry had not expected it he wrenched himself free astonished keeping his hand over wormtails mouth he saw the ratlike mans small watery eyes widen with fear and surprise he seemed just as shocked as harry at what his hand had done at the tiny merciful impulse it had betrayed and he continued to struggle more powerfully as though to undo that moment of weakness 
 
 and well have that whispered ron tugging wormtails wand from his other hand 
 
 wandless helpless pettigrews pupils dilated in terror his eyes had slid from harrys face to something else his own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat 
 
 no c 
 
 without pausing to think harry tried to drag back the hand but there was no stopping it the silver tool that voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and useless owner pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation his moment of pity he was being strangled before their eyes 
 
 no 
 
 ron had released wormtail too and together he and harry tried to pull the crushing metal fingers from around wormtails throat but it was no use pettigrew was turning blue 
 
 relashio said ron pointing the wand at the silver hand but nothing happened pettigrew dropped to his knees and at the same moment hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead wormtails eyes rolled upward in his purple face he gave a last twitch and was still 
 
 harry and ron looked at each other then leaving wormtails body on the floor behind them ran up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room cautiously they crept along it until they reached the drawing room door which was ajar now they had a clear view of bellatrix looking down at griphook who was holding gryffindors sword in his hands hermione was lying at bellatrixs feet she was barely stirring 
 
 well bellatrix said to griphook is it the true sword 
 
 harry waited holding his breath fighting against the prickling of his scar 
 
 no said griphook it is a fake 
 
 are you sure panted bellatrix quite sure 
 
 yes said the goblin 
 
 relief broke across her face all tension drained from it 
 
 good she said and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the goblins face and he dropped with a yell at her feet she kicked him aside and now she said in a voice that burst with triumph we call the dark lord 
 
 and she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the dark mark 
 
 at once harrys scar felt as though it had split open again his true surroundings vanished he was voldemort and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him he was enraged at the summons he felt c he had warned them he had told them to summon him for nothing less than potter if they were mistaken 
 
 kill me then demanded the old man you will not win you cannot win that wand will never ever be yours c 
 
 and voldemorts fury broke a burst of green light filled the prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back lifeless and voldemort returned to the window his wrath barely controllable they would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling him back 
 
 and i think said bellatrixs voice we can dispose of the mudblood greyback take her if you want her 
 
 noooooooooooo 
 
 ron had burst into the drawing room bellatrix looked around shocked she turned her wand to face ron instead c 
 
 expelliarmus he roared pointing wormtails wand at bellatrix and hers flew into the air and was caught by harry who had sprinted after ron lucius narcissa draco and greyback wheeled about harry yelled stupefy and lucius malfoy collapsed onto the hearth jets of light flew from dracos narcissas and greybacks wands harry threw himself to the floor rolling behind a sofa to avoid them 
 
 stop or she dies 
 
 panting harry peered around the edge of the sofa bellatrix was supporting hermione who seemed to be unconscious and was holding her short silver knife to hermiones throat 
 
 drop your wands she whispered drop them or well see exactly how filthy her blood is 
 
 ron stood rigid clutching wormtails wand harry straightened up still holding bellatrixs 
 
 i said drop them she screeched pressing the blade into hermiones throat harry saw beads of blood appear there 
 
 all right he shouted and he dropped bellatrixs wand onto the floor at his feet ron did the same with wormtails both raised their hands to shoulder height 
 
 good she leered draco pick them up the dark lord is coming harry potter your death approaches 
 
 harry knew it his scar was bursting with the pain of it and he could feel voldemort flying through the sky from far away over a dark and stormy sea and soon he would be close enough to apparate to them and harry could see no way out 
 
 now said bellatrix softly as draco hurried back to her with the wands cissy i think we ought to tie these little heroes up again while greyback takes care of miss mudblood i am sure the dark lord will not begrudge you the girl greyback after what you have done tonight 
 
 at the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above all of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier tremble then with a creak and an ominous jingling it began to fall bellatrix was directly beneath it dropping hermione she threw herself aside with a scream the chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains falling on top of hermione and the goblin who still clutched the sword of gryffindor glittering shards of crystal flew in all directions draco doubled over his hands covering his bloody face 
 
 as ron ran to pull hermione out of the wreckage harry took the chance he leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from dracos grip pointed all of them at greyback and yelled stupefy the werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell flew up to the ceiling and then smashed to the ground 
 
 as narcissa dragged draco out of the way of further harm bellatrix sprang to her feet her hair flying as she brandished the silver knife but narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway 
 
 dobby she screamed and even bellatrix froze you you dropped the chandelier c 
 
 the tiny elf trotted into the room his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress 
 
 you must not hurt harry potter he squeaked 
 
 kill him cissy shrieked bellatrix but there was another loud crack and narcissas wand too flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room 
 
 you dirty little monkey bawled bellatrix how dare you take a witchs wand how dare you defy your masters 
 
 dobby has no master squealed the elf dobby is a free elf and dobby has come to save harry potter and his friends 
 
 harrys scar was blinding him with pain dimly he knew that they had moments seconds before voldemort was with them 
 
 ron catch c and go he yelled throwing one of the wands to him then he bent down to tug griphook out from under the chandelier hoisting the groaning goblin who still clung to the sword over one shoulder harry seized dobbys hand and spun on the spot to disapparate 
 
 as he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the pale frozen figures of narcissa and draco of the streak of red that was rons hair and a blue of flying silver as bellatrixs knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing c 
 
 bill and fleurs shell cottage bill and fleurs 
 
 he had disappeared into the unknown all he could do was repeat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice to take him there the pain in his forehead pierced him and the weight of the goblin bore down upon him he could feel the blade of gryffindors sword bumping against his back dobbys hand jerked in his he wondered whether the elf was trying to take charge to pull them in the right direction and tried by squeezing the fingers to indicate that that was fine with them 
 
 and then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air harry fell to his knees relinquished dobbys hand and attempted to lower griphook gently to the ground 
 
 are you all right he said as the goblin stirred but griphook merely whimpered 
 
 harry squinted around through the darkness there seemed to be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky and he thought he saw movement outside it 
 
 dobby is this shell cottage he whispered clutching the two wands he had brought from the malfoys ready to fight if he needed to have we come to the right place dobby 
 
 he looked around the little elf stood feet from him 
 
 dobby 
 
 the elf swayed slightly stars reflected in his wide shining eyes together he and harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elfs heaving chest 
 
 dobby c no c help harry bellowed toward the cottage toward the people moving there help 
 
 he did not know or care whether they were wizards or muggles friends or foes all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading across dobbys front and that he had stretched out his own arms to harry with a look of supplication harry caught him and laid him sideways on the cool grass 
 
 dobby no dont die dont die c 
 
 the elfs eyes found him and his lips trembled with the effort to form words 
 
 harry potter 
 
 and then with a little shudder the elf became quite still and his eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 little tuk 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 yes they called him little tuk but it was not his real name 
 he had called himself so before he could speak plainly and he meant 
 it for charles it was all very well for those who knew him but not 
 for strangers 
 
 little tuk was left at home to take care of his little sister gustava who was much younger than himself and he had to learn his lessons at the same time and the two things could not very well be performed together the poor boy sat there with his sister on his lap and sung to her all the songs he knew and now and then he looked into 
 his geography lesson that lay open before him by the next morning 
 he had to learn by heart all the towns in zealand and all that could be described of them 
 
 his mother came home at last and took little gustava in her arms 
 then tuk ran to the window and read so eagerly that he nearly read 
 his eyes out for it had become darker and darker every minute and 
 his mother had no money to buy a light 
 
 there goes the old washerwoman up the lane said the mother 
 as she looked out of the window the poor woman can hardly drag 
 herself along and now she had to drag a pail of water from the 
 well be a good boy tuk and run across and help the old woman you 
 
 so tuk ran across quickly and helped her but when he came back 
 into the room it was quite dark and there was not a word said about a 
 light so he was obliged to go to bed on his little truckle bedstead and there he lay and thought of his geography lesson and of zealand and of all the master had told him he ought really to have read it over again but he could not for want of light so he put the geography book under his pillow for he had heard that this was a great help towards learning a lesson but not always to be depended upon he still lay thinking and thinking when all at once it seemed as if some one kissed him on his eyes and mouth he slept and 
 yet he did not sleep and it appeared as if the old washerwoman looked at him with kind eyes and said it would be a great pity if you did not know your lesson morning you helped me and now i will help you and providence will always keep those who help 
 themselves and at the same time the book under pillow began to move about cluck cluck cluck cried a hen as she crept towards him i am a hen from kjoge and then she told him how many inhabitants the town contained and about a battle that had been 
 fought there which really was not worth speaking of crack crack down fell something it was a wooden bird the parrot which is used as a target as prastoe he said there were as many inhabitants in that town as he had nails in his body he was very proud and said thorwalsden lived close to me and here i am now quite comfortable 
 
 but now little tuk was no longer in bed all in a moment he 
 found himself on horseback gallop gallop away he went seated in 
 front of a knight with a waving plume who held him on 
 the saddle and so they rode through the wood by the old town of 
 wordingburg which was very large and busy the castle was 
 surrounded by lofty towers and radiant light streamed from all the 
 windows within there were songs and dancing king waldemar and the young ladies of the court were dancing together morning dawned and as the sun rose the whole city and the castle sank suddenly down together one tower after another fell till at last only one remained standing on the hill where the castle had formerly been 
 
 the town now appeared small and poor and the read 
 in their books which they carried under their arms that it contained 
 two thousand inhabitants but this was a mere boast for it did not 
 contain so many 
 
 and again little tuk lay in his bed scarcely knowing whether he 
 was dreaming or not for some one stood by him 
 
 tuk little tuk said a voice it was a very little person who 
 spoke he was dressed as a sailor and looked small enough to be a 
 middy but he was not one i bring you many greetings from corsor it is a rising town full of life it has steamships and in 
 times past they used to call it ugly but that is no longer true i 
 lie on the said corsor i have and 
 i have given birth to a poet who was witty and 
 entertaining which they are not all i once wanted to fit out a 
 ship to sail round the world but i did not accomplish it though most 
 likely i might have done so but i am fragrant with perfume for close 
 to my gates most lovely roses bloom 
 
 then before the eyes of little tuk appeared a confusion of colors 
 red and green but it cleared off and he could distinguish a cliff 
 close to the bay the slopes of which were quite overgrown with 
 verdure and on its summit stood a fine old church with pointed 
 towers springs of water flowed out of the cliff in thick waterspouts 
 so that there was a continual splashing close by sat an old king with 
 a golden crown on his white head this was king hroar of the springs and near the springs stood the town of roeskilde as it is called 
 
 then all the kings and queens of denmark went up the ascent to the old church hand in hand with golden crowns on their heads while the organ played and the fountains sent forth jets of water 
 
 little tuk saw and heard it all forget the names of these towns said king hroar 
 
 all at once everything vanished but where it seemed to him 
 like turning over the leaves of a book and now there stood before him an old peasant woman who had come from soroe where the grass grows in the she had a green linen apron thrown over her head and shoulders and it was quite wet as if it had been raining heavily 
 
 yes that it has said she and then just as she was going to 
 tell him a great many pretty stories from comedies and 
 about waldemar and absalom she suddenly shrunk up together and 
 wagged her head as if she were a frog about to spring croak she 
 cried it is always wet and as quiet as death in soroe then little 
 tuk saw she was changed into a frog croak and again she was an old woman one must dress according to the weather said she it is wet and my town is just like a bottle by the cork we must go in and by the cork we must come out again in olden times i had beautiful fish and now i have fresh boys in the bottom of the bottle and they learn wisdom hebrew and greek 
 
 croak how it sounded like the cry of the frogs on the moor 
 or like the creaking of great boots when some one is marching always the same tone so monotonous and wearing that little tuk at length fell fast asleep and then the sound could not annoy him but even in this sleep came a dream or something like it his little sister 
 gustava with her blue eyes and fair curly hair had grown up a 
 beautiful maiden all at once and without having wings she could 
 fly and they flew together over zealand over green forests and 
 blue lakes 
 
 hark so you hear the cock crow little tuk 
 the fowls are flying out of kjoge you shall have a large 
 you shall never suffer hunger or want the bird of good omen shall 
 be yours and you shall become a rich and happy man your house 
 shall rise up like king towers and shall be richly adorned 
 with marble statues like those at prastoe understand me well your 
 name shall travel with fame round the world like the ship that was 
 to sail from corsor and at roeskilde forget the names of 
 the towns as king hroar said you shall speak well and clearly 
 little tuk and when at last you lie in your grave you shall sleep 
 peacefully as 
 
 as if i lay in soroe said little tuk awaking it was bright 
 daylight and he could not remember his dream but that was not 
 necessary for we are not to know what will happen to us in the 
 future then he sprang out of bed quickly and read over his lesson in 
 the book and knew it all at once quite correctly the old washerwoman put her head in at the door and nodded to him quite kindly and said many thanks you good child for your help yesterday i hope all your beautiful dreams will come true 
 
 little tuk did not at all know what he had dreamt but one above 
 did

 book house in the rue plumet 
 chapter v 
 
 the rose perceives that it is an engine of war 
 one day cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror and she said to herself 
 really 
 it seemed to her almost that she was pretty 
 this threw her in a singularly troubled state of mind 
 up to that moment she had never thought of her face she saw herself in her mirror but she did not look at herself and then she had so often been told that she was homely jean valjean alone said gently 
 no indeed no indeed at all events cosette had always thought herself homely and had grown up in that belief with the easy resignation of childhood and here all at once was her mirror saying to her as jean valjean had said 
 no indeed 
 that night she did not sleep 
 what if i were pretty she thought 
 how odd it would be if i were pretty and she recalled those of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent and she said to herself 
 what 
 am i to be like mademoiselle 
 the next morning she looked at herself again not by accident this time and she was assailed with doubts 
 where did i get such an idea said she no i am ugly 
 she had not slept well that was all her eyes were sunken and she was pale 
 she had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer she did not look at herself again and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror 
 in the evening after dinner she generally embroidered in wool or did some convent needlework in the and jean valjean read beside her 
 once she raised her eyes from her work and was rendered quite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her 
 on another occasion she was passing along the street and it seemed to her that some one behind her whom she did not see said 
 a pretty woman but badly dressed bah she thought he does not mean me 
 i am well dressed and ugly 
 she was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown 
 at last one day when she was in the garden she heard poor old toussaint saying 
 do you notice how pretty cosette is growing sir cosette did not hear her reply but words caused a sort of commotion within her 
 she fled from the garden ran up to her room flew to the was three months since she had looked at gave vent to a cry she had just dazzled herself 
 she was beautiful and lovely she could not help agreeing with toussaint and her mirror 
 her figure was formed her skin had grown white her hair was lustrous an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes 
 the consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant like the sudden advent of daylight other people noticed it also toussaint had said so it was evidently she of whom the had spoken there could no longer be any doubt of that she descended to the garden again thinking herself a queen imagining that she heard the birds singing though it was winter seeing the sky gilded the sun among the trees flowers in the thickets distracted wild in inexpressible delight 
 jean valjean on his side experienced a deep and undefinable oppression at heart 
 in fact he had for some time past been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on sweet face 
 the dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him 
 cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became aware of it herself 
 but from the very first day that unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young person wounded jean sombre eye he felt that it was a change in a happy life a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear of disarranging something this man who had passed through all manner of distresses who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint who after having dragged the chain of the galleys was now dragging the invisible but heavy chain of indefinite misery this man whom the law had not released from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public opprobrium this man accepted all excused all pardoned all and merely asked of providence of man of the law of society of nature of the world one thing that cosette might love him 
 that cosette might continue to love him 
 that god would not prevent the heart of the child from coming to him and from remaining with him beloved by cosette he felt that he was healed rested appeased loaded with benefits recompensed crowned 
 beloved by cosette it was well with him 
 he asked nothing more 
 had any one said to him 
 do you want anything better he would have answered no god might have said to him 
 do you desire heaven and he would have replied 
 i should lose by it 
 everything which could affect this situation if only on the surface made him shudder like the beginning of something new 
 he had never known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means but he understood instinctively that it was something terrible 
 he gazed with terror on this beauty which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him beneath his very eyes on the innocent and formidable brow of that child from the depths of her homeliness of his old age of his misery of his reprobation 
 he said to himself 
 how beautiful she is 
 what is to become of me 
 there moreover lay the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother 
 what he beheld with anguish a mother would have gazed upon with joy 
 the first symptoms were not long in making their appearance 
 on the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself decidedly i am beautiful 
 cosette began to pay attention to her toilet 
 she recalled the remark of that pretty but badly dressed the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had vanished after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are destined later on to fill the whole life of woman coquetry 
 love is the other 
 with faith in her beauty the whole feminine soul expanded within her she conceived a horror for her merinos and shame for her plush hat her father had never refused her anything 
 she at once acquired the whole science of the bonnet the gown the mantle the boot the cuff the stuff which is in fashion the color which is becoming that science which makes of the parisian woman something so charming so deep and so dangerous 
 the words heady woman were invented for the parisienne 
 in less than a month little cosette in that thebaid of the rue de babylone was not only one of the prettiest but one of the best dressed women in paris which means a great deal more 
 she would have liked to encounter her to see what he would say and to teach him a lesson 
 the truth is that she was ravishing in every respect and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from gerard and one from herbaut in the most marvellous way 
 jean valjean watched these ravages with anxiety 
 he who felt that he could never do anything but crawl walk at the most beheld wings sprouting on cosette 
 moreover from the mere inspection of toilet a woman would have recognized the fact that she had no mother certain little proprieties certain special conventionalities were not observed by cosette 
 a mother for instance would have told her that a young girl does not dress in damask 
 the first day that cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle and her white crape bonnet she took jean arm gay radiant rosy proud dazzling 
 father she said how do you like me in this guise 
 jean valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious man 
 charming 
 he was the same as usual during their walk 
 on their return home he asked cosette 
 you put on that other gown and bonnet know the ones i mean 
 this took place in chamber 
 cosette turned towards the wardrobe where her clothes were hanging 
 that disguise said she 
 father what do you want me to do with it oh no the idea 
 i shall never put on those horrors again with that machine on my head i have the air of madame 
 jean valjean heaved a deep sigh 
 from that moment forth he noticed that cosette who had always heretofore asked to remain at home saying 
 father i enjoy myself more here with you now was always asking to go out 
 in fact what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them 
 he also noticed that cosette had no longer the same taste for the back garden 
 now she preferred the garden and did not dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the railed fence jean valjean who was shy never set foot in the garden he kept to his back yard like a dog 
 cosette in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful lost the grace of ignoring it 
 an exquisite grace for beauty enhanced by ingenuousness is ineffable and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent creature who walks along holding in her hand the key to paradise without being conscious of it 
 but what she had lost in ingenuous grace she gained in pensive and serious charm her whole person permeated with the joy of youth of innocence and of beauty breathed forth a splendid melancholy 
 it was at this epoch that marius after the lapse of six months saw her once more at the luxembourg

 book eleven 
 chapter xi 
 
 in the middle of this fresh tale pierre was summoned to the commander in chief 
 when he entered the private room count rostopchin puckering his face was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand a short man was saying something but when pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out 
 ah how do you do great warrior said rostopchin as soon as the short man had left the room we have heard of your prowess but not the point between ourselves mon cher do you belong to the masons he went on severely as though there were something wrong about it which he nevertheless intended to pardon pierre remained silent i am well informed my friend but i am aware that there are masons and masons and i hope that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to ruin russia 
 yes i am a mason pierre replied 
 there you see mon cher i expect you know that messrs speranski and magnitski have been deported to their proper place mr klyucharev has been treated in the same way and so have others who on the plea of building up the temple of solomon have tried to destroy the temple of their fatherland you can understand that there are reasons for this and that i could not have exiled the postmaster had he not been a harmful person it has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his removal from town and that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody i like you and wish you any harm and as you are only half my age i advise you as a father would to cease all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as possible 
 but what did klyucharev do wrong count asked pierre 
 that is for me to know but not for you to ask shouted rostopchin 
 if he is accused of circulating proclamation it is not proved that he did so said pierre without looking at rostopchin and vereshchagin 
 there we are rostopchin shouted at pierre louder than before frowning suddenly vereshchagin is a renegade and a traitor who will be punished as he deserves said he with the vindictive heat with which people speak when recalling an insult but i did not summon you to discuss my actions but to give you advice or an order if you prefer it i beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such men as klyucharev and i will knock the nonsense out of anybody but probably realizing that he was shouting at bezukhov who so far was not guilty of anything he added taking hand in a friendly manner we are on the eve of a public disaster and i time to be polite to everybody who has business with me my head is sometimes in a whirl well mon cher what are you doing personally 
 why nothing answered pierre without raising his eyes or changing the thoughtful expression of his face 
 the count frowned 
 a word of friendly advice mon cher be off as soon as you can all i have to tell you happy he who has ears to hear my dear fellow oh by the by he shouted through the doorway after pierre is it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers of the society of jesus 
 pierre did not answer and left room more sullen and angry than he had ever before shown himself 
 when he reached home it was already getting dark some eight people had come to see him that evening the secretary of a committee the colonel of his battalion his steward his and various petitioners they all had business with pierre and wanted decisions from him pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these people when left alone at last he opened and read his letter 
 they the soldiers at the battery prince andrew killed that old man simplicity is submission to god suffering is necessary the meaning of all one must harness my wife is getting married one must forget and understand and going to his bed he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep 
 when he awoke next morning the came to inform him that a special messenger a police officer had come from count rostopchin to know whether count bezukhov had left or was leaving the town 
 a dozen persons who had business with pierre were awaiting him in the drawing room pierre dressed hurriedly and instead of going to see them went to the back porch and out through the gate 
 from that time till the end of the destruction of moscow no one of household despite all the search they made saw pierre again or knew where he was

 book house in the rue plumet 
 chapter vi 
 
 the battle begun 
 cosette in her shadow like marius in his was all ready to take fire destiny with its mysterious and fatal patience slowly drew together these two beings all charged and all languishing with the stormy electricity of passion these two souls which were laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning and which were bound to overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire 
 the glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finally fallen into disrepute 
 one hardly dares to say nowadays that two beings fell in love because they looked at each other that is the way people do fall in love nevertheless and the only way 
 the rest is nothing but the rest comes afterwards nothing is more real than these great shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of that spark 
 at that particular hour when cosette unconsciously darted that glance which troubled marius marius had no suspicion that he had also launched a look which disturbed cosette 
 he caused her the same good and the same evil 
 she had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time and she had scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see while looking elsewhere marius still considered cosette ugly when she had already begun to think marius handsome 
 but as he paid no attention to her the young man was nothing to her 
 still she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautiful hair beautiful eyes handsome teeth a charming tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades that he held himself badly when he walked if you like but with a grace that was all his own that he did not appear to be at all stupid that his whole person was noble gentle simple proud and that in short though he seemed to be poor yet his air was fine 
 on the day when their eyes met at last and said to each other those first obscure and ineffable things which the glance lisps cosette did not immediately understand 
 she returned thoughtfully to the house in the rue de where jean valjean according to his custom had come to spend six weeks 
 the next morning on waking she thought of that strange young man so long indifferent and icy who now seemed to pay attention to her and it did not appear to her that this attention was the least in the world agreeable to her she was on the contrary somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual 
 a substratum of war stirred within her it struck her and the idea caused her a wholly childish joy that she was going to take her revenge at last 
 knowing that she was beautiful she was thoroughly conscious though in an indistinct fashion that she possessed a weapon women play with their beauty as children do with a knife they wound themselves 
 the reader will recall marius hesitations his palpitations his terrors 
 he remained on his bench and did not approach this vexed cosette 
 one day she said to jean valjean father let us stroll about a little in that direction seeing that marius did not come to her she went to him 
 in such cases all women resemble mahomet 
 and then strange to say the first symptom of true love in a young man is timidity in a young girl it is boldness 
 this is surprising and yet nothing is more simple it is the two sexes tending to approach each other and assuming each the qualities 
 that day glance drove marius beside himself and marius glance set cosette to trembling 
 marius went away confident and cosette uneasy 
 from that day forth they adored each other 
 the first thing that cosette felt was a confused and profound melancholy it seemed to her that her soul had become black since the day before she no longer recognized it 
 the whiteness of soul in young girls which is composed of coldness and gayety resembles snow 
 it melts in love which is its sun 
 cosette did not know what love was 
 she had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense 
 on the books of profane music which entered the convent amour love was replaced by tambour drum or pandour 
 this created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big girls such as 
 ah how delightful is the drum or pity is not a pandour 
 but cosette had left the convent too early to have occupied herself much with the drum 
 therefore she did not know what name to give to what she now felt 
 is any one the less ill because one does not know the name of malady 
 she loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly she did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing useful or dangerous eternal or temporary allowable or prohibited she loved 
 she would have been greatly astonished had any one said to her 
 you do not sleep 
 but that is forbidden you do not eat 
 why that is very bad 
 you have oppressions and palpitations of the heart 
 that must not be 
 you blush and turn pale when a certain being clad in black appears at the end of a certain green walk 
 but that is abominable she would not have understood and she would have replied what fault is there of mine in a matter in which i have no power and of which i know nothing 
 it turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to the state of her soul 
 it was a sort of admiration at a distance a mute contemplation the deification of a stranger it was the apparition of youth to youth the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining a dream the phantom realized and made flesh at last but having as yet neither name nor fault nor spot nor exigence nor defect in a word the distant lover who lingered in the ideal a chimaera with a form any nearer and more palpable meeting would have alarmed cosette at this first stage when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister 
 she had all the fears of children and all the fears of nuns combined 
 the spirit of the convent with which she had been permeated for the space of five years was still in the process of slow evaporation from her person and made everything tremble around her 
 in this situation he was not a lover he was not even an admirer he was a vision she set herself to adoring marius as something charming luminous and impossible 
 as extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry she smiled at him with all frankness 
 every day she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience she found marius there she felt herself unspeakably happy and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to jean valjean 
 what a delicious garden that luxembourg is 
 marius and cosette were in the dark as to one another 
 they did not address each other they did not salute each other they did not know each other they saw each other and like stars of heaven which are separated by millions of leagues they lived by gazing at each other 
 it was thus that cosette gradually became a woman and developed beautiful and loving with a consciousness of her beauty and in ignorance of her love 
 she was a coquette to boot through her ignorance

 the rostovs remained in moscow till the first of september that is till the eve of the entry into the city 
 after petya had joined regiment of cossacks and left for belaya tserkov where that regiment was forming the countess was seized with terror the thought that both her sons were at the war had both gone from under her wing that today or tomorrow either or both of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances struck her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness she tried to get nicholas back and wished to go herself to join petya or to get him an appointment somewhere in petersburg but neither of these proved possible petya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on active service nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with princess mary the countess did not sleep at night or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead after many consultations and conversations the count at last devised means to tranquillize her he got petya transferred from regiment to which was in training near moscow though petya would remain in the service this transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her wing and she hoped to arrange matters for her petya so as not to let him go again but always get him appointed to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle as long as nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her more than all her other children and even reproached herself for it but when her youngest the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons was always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody that petya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show when he was thrown amid those big dreadful cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it then his mother thought she loved him more much more than all her other children the nearer the time came for petya to return the more uneasy grew the countess she began to think she would never live to see such happiness the presence of sonya of her beloved natasha or even of her husband irritated her what do i want with them i want no one but petya she thought 
 at the end of august the rostovs received another letter from nicholas he wrote from the province of voronezh where he had been sent to procure remounts but that letter did not set the countess at ease knowing that one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about petya 
 though by the twentieth of august nearly all the rostovs acquaintances had left moscow and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible she would not bear of leaving before her treasure her adored petya returned on the of august he arrived the passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did not please the officer though she concealed from him her intention of keeping him under her wing petya guessed her designs and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion when with her might become womanish as he termed it to himself he treated her coldly avoided her and during his stay in moscow attached himself exclusively to natasha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly tenderness almost 
 owing to the customary carelessness nothing was ready for their departure by the of august and the carts that were to come from their ryazan and moscow estates to remove their household belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth 
 from the till the all moscow was in a bustle and commotion every day thousands of men wounded at borodino were brought in by the dorogomilov gate and taken to various parts of moscow and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions out by the other gates in spite of broadsheets or because of them or independently of them the strangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town some said that no one was to be allowed to leave the city others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave some said there had been another battle after borodino at which the french had been routed while others on the contrary reported that the russian army bad been destroyed some talked about the moscow militia which preceded by the clergy would go to the three hills others whispered that augustin had been forbidden to leave that traitors had been seized that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their way from moscow and so on but all this was only talk in reality though the council of fili at which it was decided to abandon moscow had not yet been held both those who went away and those who remained behind felt though they did not show it that moscow would certainly be abandoned and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save their belongings it was felt that everything would suddenly break up and change but up to the first of september nothing had done so as a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die immediately but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is awry on his head so moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would be completely upset 
 during the three days preceding the occupation of moscow the whole rostov family was absorbed in various activities the head of the family count ilya rostov continually drove about the city collecting the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders at home about the preparations for their departure 
 the countess watched the things being packed was dissatisfied with everything was constantly in pursuit of petya who was always running away from her and was jealous of natasha with whom he spent all his time sonya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting things packed but of late sonya had been particularly sad and silent nicholas letter in which he mentioned princess mary had elicited in her presence joyous comments from the countess who saw an intervention of providence in this meeting of the princess and nicholas 
 i was never pleased at engagement to natasha said the countess but i always wanted nicholas to marry the princess and had a presentiment that it would happen what a good thing it would be 
 sonya felt that this was true that the only possibility of retrieving the rostovs affairs was by nicholas marrying a rich woman and that the princess was a good match it was very bitter for her but despite her grief or perhaps just because of it she took on herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and was busy for whole days the count and countess turned to her when they had any orders to give petya and natasha on the contrary far from helping their parents were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone almost all day long the house resounded with their running feet their cries and their spontaneous laughter they laughed and were gay not because there was any reason to laugh but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them petya was in high spirits because having left home a boy he had returned as everybody told him a fine young man because he was at home because he had left belaya tserkov where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days and chiefly because natasha whose lead he always followed was in high spirits natasha was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness and because she was feeling well she was also happy because she had someone to adore her the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freely and petya adored her above all they were gay because there was a war near moscow there would be fighting at the town gates arms were being given out everybody was escaping going away somewhere and in general something extraordinary was happening and that is always exciting especially to the young

 chapter vii 
 
 to one sadness oppose a sadness and a half 
 all situations have their instincts 
 old and eternal mother nature warned jean valjean in a dim way of the presence of marius jean valjean shuddered to the very bottom of his soul 
 jean valjean saw nothing knew nothing and yet he scanned with obstinate attention the darkness in which he walked as though he felt on one side of him something in process of construction and on the other something which was crumbling away 
 marius also warned and in accordance with the deep law of god by that same mother nature did all he could to keep out of sight of the father 
 nevertheless it came to pass that jean valjean sometimes espied him 
 marius manners were no longer in the least natural 
 he exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring 
 he no longer came quite close to them as formerly he seated himself at a distance and pretended to be reading why did he pretend that 
 formerly he had come in his old coat now he wore his new one every day jean valjean was not sure that he did not have his hair curled his eyes were very queer he wore gloves in short jean valjean cordially detested this young man 
 cosette allowed nothing to be divined 
 without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it and that it must be concealed 
 there was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had recently come to cosette and the habit of new clothes developed by that stranger which was very repugnant to jean valjean 
 it might be accidental no doubt certainly but it was a menacing accident 
 he never opened his mouth to cosette about this stranger 
 one day however he could not refrain from so doing and with that vague despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair he said to her 
 what a very pedantic air that young man has 
 cosette but a year before only an indifferent little girl would have replied 
 why no he is charming 
 ten years later with the love of marius in her heart she would have answered a pedant and insufferable to the sight 
 you are right at the moment in life and the heart which she had then attained she contented herself with replying with supreme calmness that young man 
 as though she now beheld him for the first time in her life 
 how stupid i am thought jean valjean 
 she had not noticed him it is i who have pointed him out to her 
 oh simplicity of the old oh the depth of children 
 it is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble of those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever and that the young man falls into every one jean valjean had instituted an undeclared war against marius which marius with the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age did not divine 
 jean valjean laid a host of ambushes for him he changed his hour he changed his bench he forgot his handkerchief he came alone to the luxembourg marius dashed headlong into all these snares and to all the interrogation marks planted by jean valjean in his pathway he ingenuously answered yes but cosette remained immured in her apparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity so that jean valjean arrived at the following conclusion 
 that ninny is madly in love with cosette but cosette does not even know that he exists 
 none the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor the minute when cosette would love might strike at any moment does not everything begin with indifference 
 only once did cosette make a mistake and alarm him 
 he rose from his seat to depart after a stay of three hours and she said what already 
 jean valjean had not discontinued his trips to the luxembourg as he did not wish to do anything out of the way and as above all things he feared to arouse cosette but during the hours which were so sweet to the lovers while cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated marius who perceived nothing else now and who now saw nothing in all the world but an adored and radiant face jean valjean was fixing on marius flashing and terrible eyes 
 he who had finally come to believe himself incapable of a malevolent feeling experienced moments when marius was present in which he thought he was becoming savage and ferocious once more and he felt the old depths of his soul which had formerly contained so much wrath opening once more and rising up against that young man 
 it almost seemed to him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom 
 what he was there that creature 
 what was he there for he came creeping about smelling out examining trying he came saying 
 hey 
 why not 
 he came to prowl about his jean life to prowl about his happiness with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away 
 jean valjean added 
 yes it 
 what is he in search of an adventure 
 what does he want 
 a love affair 
 a love affair and i 
 what 
 i have been first the most wretched of men and then the most unhappy and i have traversed sixty years of life on my knees i have suffered everything that man can suffer i have grown old without having been young i have lived without a family without relatives without friends without life without children i have left my blood on every stone on every bramble on every along every wall i have been gentle though others have been hard to me and kind although others have been malicious i have become an honest man once more in spite of everything i have repented of the evil that i have done and have forgiven the evil that has been done to me and at the moment when i receive my recompense at the moment when it is all over at the moment when i am just touching the goal at the moment when i have what i desire it is well it is good i have paid i have earned it all this is to take flight all this will vanish and i shall lose cosette and i shall lose my life my joy my soul because it has pleased a great booby to come and lounge at the luxembourg 
 then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam 
 it was no longer a man gazing at a man it was no longer an enemy surveying an enemy 
 it was a dog scanning a thief 
 the reader knows the rest 
 marius pursued his senseless course one day he followed cosette to the rue de another day he spoke to the porter 
 the porter on his side spoke and said to jean valjean 
 monsieur who is that curious young man who is asking for you 
 on the morrow jean valjean bestowed on marius that glance which marius at last perceived 
 a week later jean valjean had taken his departure 
 he swore to himself that he would never again set foot either in the luxembourg or in the rue de he returned to the rue plumet 
 cosette did not complain she said nothing she asked no questions she did not seek to learn his reasons she had already reached the point where she was afraid of being divined and of betraying herself jean valjean had no experience of these miseries the only miseries which are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted the consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of silence 
 he merely noticed that she had grown sad and he grew gloomy on his side and on hers inexperience had joined issue 
 once he made a trial 
 he asked cosette 
 would you like to come to the luxembourg 
 a ray illuminated pale face 
 yes said she 
 they went thither 
 three months had elapsed 
 marius no longer went there 
 marius was not there 
 on the following day jean valjean asked cosette again 
 would you like to come to the luxembourg 
 she replied sadly and gently 
 no 
 jean valjean was hurt by this sadness and at this gentleness 
 what was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable 
 what was on its way there within 
 what was taking place in soul 
 sometimes instead of going to bed jean valjean remained seated on his pallet with his head in his hands and he passed whole nights asking himself 
 what has cosette in her mind and in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about 
 oh at such moments what mournful glances did he cast towards that cloister that chaste peak that abode of angels that inaccessible glacier of virtue 
 how he contemplated with despairing ecstasy that convent garden full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins where all perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven how he adored that eden forever closed against him whence he had voluntarily and madly emerged 
 how he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought cosette back into the world poor hero of sacrifice seized and hurled to the earth by his very how he said to himself what have i done 
 however nothing of all this was perceptible to cosette no no harshness 
 his face was always serene and kind jean manners were more tender and more paternal than ever if anything could have betrayed his lack of joy it was his increased suavity 
 on her side cosette languished 
 she suffered from the absence of marius as she had rejoiced in his presence peculiarly without exactly being conscious of it 
 when jean valjean ceased to take her on their customary strolls a feminine instinct murmured confusedly at the bottom of her heart that she must not seem to set store on the luxembourg garden and that if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her her father would take her thither once more but days weeks months elapsed 
 jean valjean had tacitly accepted tacit consent 
 she regretted it 
 it was too late so marius had disappeared all was over 
 the day on which she returned to the luxembourg marius was no longer there 
 what was to be done should she ever find him again 
 she felt an anguish at her heart which nothing relieved and which augmented every day she no longer knew whether it was winter or summer whether it was raining or shining whether the birds were singing whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies whether the luxembourg was more charming than the tuileries whether the linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not enough whether toussaint had 
 done her marketing well or ill and she remained dejected absorbed attentive to but a single thought her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished 
 however she did not allow jean valjean to perceive anything of this except her pallor 
 she still wore her sweet face for him 
 this pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble jean valjean sometimes he asked her 
 what is the matter with you 
 she replied 
 there is nothing the matter with me 
 and after a silence when she divined that he was sad also she would add 
 and you there anything wrong with you 
 with me 
 nothing said he 
 these two beings who had loved each other so exclusively and with so touching an affection and who had lived so long for each other now suffered side by side each on the account without acknowledging it to each other without anger towards each other and with a smile

 chapter xiii 
 
 on saturday the of august everything in the rostovs house seemed all the doors were open all the furniture was being carried out or moved about and the mirrors and pictures had been taken down there were trunks in the rooms and hay wrapping paper and ropes were scattered about the peasants and house serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors the yard was crowded with peasant carts some loaded high and already corded up others still empty 
 the voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in the yard and in the house the count bad been out since morning the countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head petya was not at home he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army sonya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china natasha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses ribbons and scarves strewn all about her gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress already out of fashion which she had worn at her first petersburg ball 
 natasha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy and several times that morning had tried to set to work but her heart was not in it and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with all her heart and all her might for a while she had stood beside sonya while the china was being packed and tried to help but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things at first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids but when that was done and what was left had still to be packed she found it dull 
 dunyasha you pack you will you dear and when dunyasha willingly promised to do it all for her natasha sat down on the floor took her old ball dress and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now she was roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room which was theirs and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch natasha got up and looked out of the window an enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the street 
 the housekeeper the old nurse the cooks coachmen maids footmen postilions and scullions stood at the gate staring at the wounded 
 natasha throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding an end of it in each hand went out into the street 
 the former housekeeper old mavra kuzminichna had stepped out of the crowd by the gate gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside natasha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly still holding her handkerchief and listened to what the housekeeper was saying 
 then you have nobody in moscow she was saying you would be more comfortable somewhere in a house in ours for instance the family are leaving 
 i know if it would be allowed replied the officer in a weak voice here is our commanding officer ask him and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts 
 natasha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer and at once went to meet the major 
 may the wounded men stay in our house she asked 
 the major raised his hand to his cap with a smile 
 which one do you want said he screwing up his eyes and smiling 
 natasha quietly repeated her question and her face and whole manner were so serious though she was still holding the ends of her handkerchief that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection as if considering in how far the thing was possible replied in the affirmative 
 oh yes why not they may he said 
 with a slight inclination of her head natasha stepped back quickly to mavra kuzminichna who stood talking compassionately to the officer 
 they may he says they may whispered natasha 
 the cart in which the officer lay was turned into the rostovs yard and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in povarskaya street natasha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life she and mavra kuzminichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their yard 
 your papa must be told though said mavra kuzminichna 
 never mind never mind what does it matter for one day we can move into the drawing room they can have all our half of the house 
 there now young lady you do take things into your head even if we put them into the wing the room or the room we must ask permission 
 well ask 
 natasha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the door into the sitting room where there was a smell of vinegar and drops 
 are you asleep mamma 
 oh what sleep said the countess waking up just as she was dropping into a doze 
 mamma darling said natasha kneeling by her mother and bringing her face close to her i am sorry forgive me never do it again i woke you up mavra kuzminichna has sent me they have brought some wounded here officers will you let them come they have nowhere to go i knew let them come she said quickly all in one breath 
 what officers whom have they brought i understand anything about it said the countess 
 natasha laughed and the countess too smiled slightly 
 i knew give permission so tell them and having kissed her mother natasha got up and went to the door 
 in the hall she met her father who had returned with bad news 
 stayed too long said the count with involuntary vexation the club is closed and the police are leaving 
 papa is it all right invited some of the wounded into the house said natasha 
 of course it is he answered absently not the point i beg you not to indulge in trifles now but to help to pack and tomorrow we must go go go 
 and the count gave a similar order to the and the servants 
 at dinner petya having returned home told them the news he had heard he said the people had been getting arms in the kremlin and that though broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three days in advance the order had certainly already been given for everyone to go armed to the three hills tomorrow and that there would be a big battle there 
 the countess looked with timid horror at her eager excited face as he said this she realized that if she said a word about his not going to the battle she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement he would say something about men honor and the fatherland something senseless masculine and obstinate which there would be no contradicting and her plans would be spoiled and so hoping to arrange to leave before then and take petya with her as their protector and defender she did not answer him but after dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly that very night if possible with a involuntary loving cunning she who till then had not shown any alarm said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very night without any pretense she was now afraid of everything

 book house in the rue plumet 
 chapter viii 
 
 the 
 jean valjean was the more unhappy of the two 
 youth even in its sorrows always possesses its own peculiar radiance 
 at times jean valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile it is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear 
 he had an unconquerable conviction that cosette was escaping from him 
 he would have liked to resist to retain her to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter these ideas puerile as we have just said and at the same time senile conveyed to him by their very childishness a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls he once chanced to see a general on horseback in full uniform pass along the street comte coutard the commandant of paris he envied that gilded man what happiness it would be he said to himself if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing and if cosette could behold him thus she would be dazzled and when he had cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the tuileries the guard would present arms to him and that would suffice for cosette and would dispel her idea of looking at young men 
 an unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections 
 in the isolated life which they led and since they had come to dwell in the rue plumet they had contracted one habit they sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sun rise a mild species of enjoyment which befits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it 
 for those who love solitude a walk in the early morning is equivalent to a stroll by night with the cheerfulness of nature added the streets are deserted and the birds are singing 
 cosette a bird herself liked to rise early 
 these matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding evening 
 he proposed and she agreed it was arranged like a plot they set out before daybreak and these trips were so many small delights for cosette these innocent eccentricities please young people 
 jean inclination led him as we have seen to the least frequented spots to solitary nooks to forgotten places there then existed in the vicinity of the barriers of paris a sort of poor meadows which were almost confounded with the city where grew in summer sickly grain and which in autumn after the harvest had been gathered presented the appearance not of having been reaped but peeled 
 jean valjean loved to haunt these fields 
 cosette was not bored there 
 it meant solitude to him and liberty to her 
 there she became a little girl once more she could run and almost play she took off her hat laid it on jean knees and gathered bunches of flowers she gazed at the butterflies on the flowers but did not catch them gentleness and tenderness are born with love and the young girl who cherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly 
 she wove garlands of poppies which she placed on her head and which crossed and penetrated with sunlight glowing until they flamed formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers 
 even after their life had grown sad they kept up their custom of early strolls 
 one morning in october therefore tempted by the serene perfection of the autumn of they set out and found themselves at break of day near the barriere du maine 
 it was not dawn it was daybreak a delightful and stern moment 
 a few constellations here and there in the deep pale azure the earth all black the heavens all white a quiver amid the blades of grass everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight 
 a lark which seemed mingled with the stars was carolling at a prodigious height and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity 
 in the east the projected its dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape from a gloomy edifice 
 all was peace and silence there was no one on the road a few stray laborers of whom they caught barely a glimpse were on their way to their work along the 
 jean valjean was sitting in a on some planks deposited at the gate of a his face was turned towards the highway his back towards the light he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated which imprison even the eye and which are equivalent to four walls 
 there are meditations which may be called vertical when one is at the bottom of them time is required to return to earth 
 jean valjean had plunged into one of these reveries 
 he was thinking of cosette of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her of the light with which she filled his life a light which was but the emanation of her soul 
 he was almost happy in his revery 
 cosette who was standing beside him was gazing at the clouds as they turned rosy 
 all at once cosette exclaimed 
 father i should think some one was coming yonder 
 jean valjean raised his eyes 
 cosette was right 
 the causeway which leads to the ancient barriere du maine is a prolongation as the reader knows of the rue de sevres and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard at the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard at the spot where it branches they heard a noise which it was difficult to account for at that hour and a sort of confused pile made its appearance some shapeless thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning into the road 
 it grew larger it seemed to move in an orderly manner though it was bristling and quivering it seemed to be a vehicle but its load could not be distinctly made out 
 there were horses wheels shouts whips were cracking 
 by degrees the outlines became fixed although bathed in shadows 
 it was a vehicle in fact which had just turned from the boulevard into the highway and which was directing its course towards the barrier near which sat jean valjean a second of the same aspect followed then a third then a fourth seven chariots made their appearance in succession the heads of the horses touching the rear of the wagon in front figures were moving on these vehicles flashes were visible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there a clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains and as this something advanced the sound of voices waxed louder and it turned into a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams 
 as it drew nearer it assumed a form and was outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition the mass grew white the day which was slowly dawning cast a wan light on this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses and this is what it proved to be 
 seven wagons were driving in a file along the road 
 the first six were singularly constructed 
 they resembled coopers drays they consisted of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities 
 each dray or rather let us say each ladder was attached to four horses harnessed tandem on these ladders strange clusters of men were being drawn in the faint light these men were to be divined rather than seen on each vehicle twelve on a side back to back facing the their legs dangling in the was the manner in which these men were travelling and behind their backs they had something which clanked and which was a chain and on their necks something which shone and which was an iron collar each man had his collar but the chain was for all so that if these four and twenty men had occasion to alight from the dray and walk they were seized with a sort of inexorable unity and were obliged to wind over the ground with the chain for a backbone somewhat after the fashion of millepeds 
 in the back and front of each vehicle two men armed with muskets stood erect each holding one end of the chain under his foot 
 the iron necklets were square the seventh vehicle a huge baggage wagon without a hood had four wheels and six horses and carried a sonorous pile of iron boilers pots braziers and chains among which were mingled several men who were pinioned and stretched at full length and who seemed to be ill 
 this wagon all was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served for former punishments 
 these vehicles kept to the middle of the road on each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect wearing hats like the soldiers under the directory shabby covered with spots and holes muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers of undertakers men half gray half blue which were almost hanging in rags with red epaulets yellow shoulder belts short sabres muskets and cudgels they were a species of these myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the authority of the executioner the one who appeared to be their chief held a whip in his hand 
 all these details blurred by the dimness of dawn became more and more clearly outlined as the light increased at the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted gendarmes serious and with sword in fist 
 this procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the barrier the last was barely debauching from the boulevard a throng sprung it is impossible to say whence and formed in a twinkling as is frequently the case in paris pressed forward from both sides of the road and looked on 
 in the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to each other and the wooden shoes of hastening up to gaze were audible 
 the men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in silence 
 they were livid with the chill of morning they all wore linen trousers and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes 
 the rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness their accoutrements were horribly incongruous nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in rags 
 battered felt hats tarpaulin caps hideous woollen nightcaps and side by side with a short blouse a black coat broken at the elbow many wore headgear others had baskets on their heads hairy breasts were visible and through the rent in their garments tattooed designs could be descried temples of love flaming hearts cupids eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen 
 two or three had a straw rope attached to the of the dray and suspended under them like a stirrup which supported their feet 
 one of them held in his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance of a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing it was bread which he was eating there were no eyes there which were not either dry dulled or flaming with an evil light 
 the escort troop cursed the men in chains did not utter a syllable from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on or skulls some of these men were yawning their rags were terrible their feet hung down their shoulders oscillated their heads clashed together their fetters clanked their eyes glared ferociously their fists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses in the rear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter 
 this file of vehicles whatever its nature was was mournful it was evident that that an hour hence a pouring rain might descend that it might be followed by another and another and that their dilapidated garments would be drenched that once soaked these men would not get dry again that once chilled they would not again get warm that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the downpour that the water would fill their shoes that no lashes from the whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering that the chain would continue to bind them by the neck that their legs would continue to dangle and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight of these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of autumn and delivered over to the rain to the blast to all the furies of the air like trees and stones 
 blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with misery 
 suddenly the sun made its appearance the immense light of the orient burst forth and one would have said that it had set fire to all those ferocious heads 
 their tongues were unloosed a conflagration of grins oaths and songs exploded 
 the broad horizontal sheet of light severed the file in two parts illuminating heads and bodies leaving feet and wheels in the obscurity 
 thoughts made their appearance on these faces it was a terrible moment visible demons with their masks removed fierce souls laid bare 
 though lighted up this wild throng remained in gloom 
 some who were gay had in their mouths quills through which they blew vermin over the crowd picking out the women the dawn accentuated these lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of wretchedness and the whole was so monstrous that one would have said that the brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the lightning the which headed the line had struck up a song and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality a potpourri by desaugiers then famous called the vestal the trees shivered mournfully in the countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by spectres 
 all sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos here were to be found the facial angles of every sort of beast old men youths bald heads gray beards cynical monstrosities sour resignation savage grins senseless attitudes snouts surmounted by caps heads like those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples infantile visages and by reason of that horrible thin skeleton faces to which death alone was lacking 
 on the first cart was a negro who had been a slave in all probability and who could make a comparison of his chains 
 the frightful leveller from below shame had passed over these brows at that degree of abasement the last transformations were suffered by all in their extremest depths and ignorance converted into dulness was the equal of intelligence converted into despair 
 there was no choice possible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud it was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that unclean procession had not classified them 
 these beings had been fettered and coupled in alphabetical disorder probably and loaded on those carts 
 nevertheless horrors when grouped together always end by evolving a result all additions of wretched men give a sum total each chain exhaled a common soul and each had its own physiognomy 
 by the side of the one where they were singing there was one where they were howling a third where they were begging one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth another load menaced the spectators another blasphemed god the last was as silent as the tomb dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell on the march 
 the march of the damned to their tortures performed in sinister wise not on the formidable and flaming chariot of the apocalypse but what was more mournful than that on the gibbet cart 
 one of the guards who had a hook on the end of his cudgel made a pretence from time to time of stirring up this mass of human filth an old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years old and said to him 
 rascal let that be a warning to you 
 as the songs and blasphemies increased the man who appeared to be the captain of the escort cracked his whip and at that signal a fearful dull and blind flogging which produced the sound of hail fell upon the seven many roared and foamed at the mouth which redoubled the delight of the street urchins who had hastened up a swarm of flies on these wounds 
 jean eyes had assumed a frightful expression they were no longer eyes they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the glance in the case of certain wretched men which seem unconscious of reality and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of catastrophes 
 he was not looking at a spectacle he was seeing a vision 
 he tried to rise to flee to make his escape he could not move his feet 
 sometimes the things that you see seize upon you and hold you fast 
 he remained nailed to the spot petrified stupid asking himself athwart confused and inexpressible anguish what this sepulchral persecution signified and whence had come that pandemonium which was pursuing him all at once he raised his hand to his brow a gesture habitual to those whose memory suddenly returns he remembered that this was in fact the usual itinerary that it was customary to make this detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the road to fontainebleau and that five and thirty years before he had himself passed through that barrier 
 cosette was no less terrified but in a different way 
 she did not understand what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible at length she cried 
 father 
 what are those men in those carts 
 jean valjean replied 
 convicts 
 whither are they going 
 to the galleys 
 at that moment the cudgelling multiplied by a hundred hands became zealous blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it it was a perfect storm of whips and clubs the convicts bent before it a hideous obedience was evoked by the torture and all held their peace darting glances like chained wolves 
 cosette trembled in every limb she resumed 
 father are they still men 
 sometimes answered the unhappy man 
 it was the in fact which had set out before daybreak from bicetre and had taken the road to mans in order to avoid fontainebleau where the king then was 
 this caused the horrible journey to last three or four days longer but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personage a sight of it 
 jean valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed 
 such encounters are shocks and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough shaking up 
 nevertheless jean valjean did not observe that on his way back to the rue de babylone with cosette the latter was plying him with other questions on the subject of what they had just seen perhaps he was too much absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply to them 
 but when cosette was leaving him in the evening to betake herself to bed he heard her say in a low voice and as though talking to herself 
 it seems to me that if i were to find one of those men in my pathway oh my god i should die merely from the sight of him close at hand 
 fortunately chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day there was some official solemnity apropos of i know not what fetes in paris a review in the champ de mars jousts on the seine theatrical performances in the fireworks at the arc de illuminations everywhere 
 jean valjean did violence to his habits and took cosette to see these rejoicings for the purpose of diverting her from the memory of the day before and of effacing beneath the smiling tumult of all paris the abominable thing which had passed before her 
 the review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms perfectly natural jean valjean donned his uniform of a national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking himself to shelter 
 however this trip seemed to attain its object cosette who made it her law to please her father and to whom moreover all spectacles were a novelty accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of youth and did not pout too disdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fete so that jean valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded and that no trace of that hideous vision remained 
 some days later one morning when the sun was shining brightly and they were both on the steps leading to the garden another infraction of the rules which jean valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused cosette to adopt cosette in a wrapper was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star and with her head bathed in light rosy after a good sleep submitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man she was picking a daisy to pieces 
 cosette did not know the delightful legend i love a little passionately was there who could have taught her 
 she was handling the flower instinctively innocently without a suspicion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart 
 if there were a fourth and smiling grace called melancholy she would have worn the air of that grace jean valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower and forgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by that child 
 a was warbling in the thicket on one side 
 white cloudlets floated across the sky so gayly that one would have said that they had just been set at liberty cosette went on attentively tearing the leaves from her flower she seemed to be thinking about something but whatever it was it must be something charming all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the delicate languor of a swan and said to jean valjean 
 father what are the galleys like

 chapter xiv 
 
 madame schoss who had been out to visit her daughter increased the countess fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit in myasnitski street when returning by that street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop she had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at the drink store having received orders to do so 
 after dinner the whole rostov household set to work with enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure the old count suddenly setting to work kept passing from the yard to the house and back again shouting confused instructions to the hurrying people and flurrying them still more petya directed things in the yard sonya owing to the contradictory orders lost her head and did not know what to do the servants ran noisily about the house and yard shouting and disputing natasha with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work too at first her intervention in the business of packing was received skeptically everybody expected some prank from her and did not wish to obey her but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed her and at last succeeded in making them believe her her first exploit which cost her immense effort and established her authority was the packing of the carpets the count had valuable gobelin tapestries and persian carpets in the house when natasha set to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom one almost full up with crockery the other with carpets there was also much china standing on the tables and still more was being brought in from the storeroom a third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it 
 sonya wait a bit pack everything into these said natasha 
 you miss we have tried to said the assistant 
 no wait a minute please 
 and natasha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates wrapped in paper 
 the dishes must go in here among the carpets said she 
 why a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases said the assistant 
 oh wait please and natasha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the things these needed said she putting aside some plates of kiev ware these yes these must go among the carpets she said referring to the saxony china dishes 
 natasha leave it alone get it all packed urged sonya reproachfully 
 what a young lady she is remarked the 
 but natasha would not give in she turned everything out and began quickly repacking deciding that the inferior russian carpets and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all when everything had been taken out of the cases they recommenced packing and it turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down a few more things might have been taken out but natasha insisted on having her own way she packed repacked pressed made the assistant and petya whom she had drawn into the business of packing press on the lid and made desperate efforts herself 
 enough natasha said sonya i see you were right but just take out the top one 
 i cried natasha with one hand bolding back the hair that hung over her perspiring face while with the other she pressed down the carpets now press petya press vasilich press hard she cried 
 the carpets yielded and the lid closed natasha clapping her hands screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes but this only lasted a moment she at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her completely the count was not angry even when they told him that natasha had countermanded an order of his and the servants now came to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded and whether it might be corded up thanks to directions the work now went on expeditiously unnecessary things were left and the most valuable packed as compactly as possible 
 but hard as they all worked till quite late that night they could not get everything packed the countess had fallen asleep and the count having put off their departure till next morning went to bed 
 sonya and natasha slept in the sitting room without undressing 
 that night another wounded man was driven down the povarskaya and mavra kuzminichna who was standing at the gate had him brought into the rostovs yard mavra kuzminichna concluded that he was a very important man he was being conveyed in a caleche with a raised hood and was quite covered by an apron on the box beside the driver sat a venerable old attendant a doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a cart 
 please come in here the masters are going away and the whole house will be empty said the old woman to the old attendant 
 well perhaps said he with a sigh we expect to get him home alive we have a house of our own in moscow but a long way from here and nobody living in it 
 do us the honor to come in plenty of everything in the house come in said mavra kuzminichna is he very ill she asked 
 the attendant made a hopeless gesture 
 we expect to get him home we must ask the doctor 
 and the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart 
 all right said the doctor 
 the old servant returned to the caleche looked into it shook his head disconsolately told the driver to turn into the yard and stopped beside mavra kuzminichna 
 o lord jesus christ she murmured 
 she invited them to take the wounded man into the house 
 the masters object she said 
 but they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs and so they took him into the wing and put him in the room that had been madame schoss 
 this wounded man was prince andrew bolkonski

 a wound without healing within 
 thus their life clouded over by degrees 
 but one diversion which had formerly been a happiness remained to them which was to carry bread to those who were hungry and clothing to those who were cold 
 cosette often accompanied jean valjean on these visits to the poor on which they recovered some remnants of their former free intercourse and sometimes when the day had been a good one and they had assisted many in distress and cheered and warmed many little children cosette was rather merry in the evening it was at this epoch that they paid their visit to the jondrette den 
 on the day following that visit jean valjean made his appearance in the pavilion in the morning calm as was his wont but with a large wound on his left arm which was much inflamed and very angry which resembled a burn and which he explained in some way or other this wound resulted in his being detained in the house for a month with fever 
 he would not call in a doctor 
 when cosette urged him call the said he 
 cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and such angelic happiness at being of use to him that jean valjean felt all his former joy returning his fears and anxieties dissipating and he gazed at cosette saying 
 oh what a kindly wound oh what a good misfortune 
 cosette on perceiving that her father was ill had deserted the pavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard she passed nearly all her days beside jean valjean and read to him the books which he desired 
 generally they were books of travel jean valjean was undergoing a new birth his happiness was reviving in these ineffable rays the luxembourg the prowling young stranger these clouds upon his soul were growing dim he had reached the point where he said to himself 
 i imagined all that i am an old fool 
 his happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the thenardiers made in the jondrette hovel unexpected as it was had after a fashion glided over him unnoticed 
 he had succeeded in making his escape all trace of him was more did he care for he only thought of those wretched beings to pity them 
 here they are in prison and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm he thought but what a lamentable family in distress 
 as for the hideous vision of the barriere du maine cosette had not referred to it again 
 sister had taught cosette music in the convent cosette had the voice of a linnet with a soul and sometimes in the evening in the wounded humble abode she warbled melancholy songs which delighted jean valjean 
 spring came the garden was so delightful at that season of the year that jean valjean said to cosette 
 you never go there i want you to stroll in it 
 as you like father said cosette 
 and for the sake of obeying her father she resumed her walks in the garden generally alone for as we have mentioned jean valjean who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence hardly ever went there 
 jean wound had created a diversion 
 when cosette saw that her father was suffering less that he was convalescing and that he appeared to be happy she experienced a contentment which she did not even perceive so gently and naturally had it come 
 then it was in the month of march the days were growing longer the winter was departing the winter always bears away with it a portion of our sadness then came april that daybreak of summer fresh as dawn always is gay like every childhood a little inclined to weep at times like the being that it is in that month nature has charming gleams which pass from the sky from the trees from the meadows and the flowers into the heart of man 
 cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that april joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself insensibly and without her suspecting the fact the blackness departed from her spirit 
 in spring sad souls grow light as light falls into cellars at midday 
 cosette was no longer sad however though this was so she did not account for it to herself in the morning about ten after breakfast when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden for a quarter of an hour and when she was pacing up and down in the sunlight in front of the steps supporting his left arm for him she did not perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy 
 jean valjean intoxicated beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more 
 oh 
 what a good wound he repeated in a whisper 
 and he felt grateful to the thenardiers 
 his wound once healed he resumed his solitary twilight strolls 
 it is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that fashion in the uninhabited regions of paris without meeting with some adventure

 chapter xv 
 
 last day had come it was a clear bright autumn day a sunday the church bells everywhere were ringing for service just as usual on sundays nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city 
 only two things indicated the social condition of moscow the rabble that is the poor people and the price of commodities an enormous crowd of factory hands house serfs and peasants with whom some officials seminarists and gentry were mingled had gone early that morning to the three hills having waited there for rostopchin who did not turn up they became convinced that moscow would be surrendered and then dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops prices too that day indicated the state of affairs the price of weapons of gold of carts and horses kept rising but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable goods such as cloth and receiving in payment a half of what they carted while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each and furniture mirrors and bronzes were being given away for nothing 
 in the rostovs staid house the dissolution of former conditions of life was but little noticeable as to the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the night but nothing was stolen and as to the value of their possessions the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for them not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of september orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the rostovs and wounded men dragged themselves there from the rostovs and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of moscow the to whom these entreaties were addressed though he was sorry for the wounded resolutely refused saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count pity these wounded men as one might it was evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to refuse another or all the carts and own carriages as well thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and own family so thought the on his behalf 
 on waking up that morning count ilya rostov left his bedroom softly so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown in the yard stood the carts ready corded the carriages were at the front porch the stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm on seeing the count the made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away 
 well vasilich is everything ready asked the count and stroking his bald head he looked at the officer and the orderly and nodded to them he liked to see new faces 
 we can harness at once your excellency 
 well right as soon as the countess wakes be off god willing what is it gentlemen he added turning to the officer are you staying in my house 
 the officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson 
 count be so good as to allow me for sake to get into some corner of one of your carts i have nothing here with me i shall be all right on a loaded cart 
 before the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same request on behalf of his master 
 oh yes said the count hastily i shall be very pleased very pleased vasilich see to it just unload one or two carts well what of it do necessary said the count muttering some indefinite order 
 but at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the face had already sealed the order the count looked around him in the yard at the gates at the window of the wings wounded officers and their orderlies were to be seen they were all looking at the count and moving toward the porch 
 please step into the gallery your excellency said the what are your orders about the pictures 
 the count went into the house with him repeating his order not to refuse the wounded who asked for a lift 
 well never mind some of the things can be unloaded he added in a soft confidential voice as though afraid of being overheard 
 at nine the countess woke up and matrena timofeevna who had been her maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of chief duty for her came to say that madame schoss was much offended and the young ladies summer dresses could not be left behind on inquiry the countess learned that madame schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its cart and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take with them the countess sent for her husband 
 what is this my dear i hear that the luggage is being unloaded 
 you know love i wanted to tell you countess dear an officer came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded after all ours are things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to them really now in our own yard we asked them in ourselves and there are officers among them you know i think my dear let them be taken the hurry 
 the count spoke timidly as he always did when talking of money matters the countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of something detrimental to the interests such as the building of a new gallery or conservatory the inauguration of a private theater or an orchestra she was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so 
 she assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband listen to me count you have managed matters so that we are getting nothing for the house and now you wish to throw away all our all the property you said yourself that we have a hundred thousand rubles worth of things in the house i consent my dear i do as you please the business to look after the wounded they know that look at the lopukhins opposite they cleared out everything two days ago what other people do only we who are such fools if you have no pity on me have some for the children 
 flourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without replying 
 papa what are you doing that for asked natasha who had followed him into her room 
 nothing what business is it of yours muttered the count angrily 
 but i heard said natasha why does mamma object 
 what business is it of yours cried the count 
 natasha stepped up to the window and pondered 
 papa berg coming to see us said she looking out of the window

 chapter ii 
 
 mother plutarque finds no difficulty in explaining a phenomenon 
 one evening little gavroche had had nothing to eat he remembered that he had not dined on the preceding day either this was becoming tiresome 
 he resolved to make an effort to secure some supper he strolled out beyond the salpetriere into deserted regions that is where windfalls are to be found where there is no one one always finds something 
 he reached a settlement which appeared to him to be the village of austerlitz 
 in one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old man and an old woman and in that garden a passable beside the stood a sort of which was not securely fastened and where one might contrive to get an apple 
 one apple is a supper one apple is life 
 that which was ruin might prove salvation 
 the garden abutted on a solitary unpaved lane bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses the garden was separated from it by a hedge 
 gavroche directed his steps towards this garden he found the lane he recognized the he verified the he examined the hedge a hedge means merely one stride 
 the day was declining there was not even a cat in the lane the hour was propitious gavroche began the operation of scaling the hedge then suddenly paused some one was talking in the garden 
 gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in the hedge 
 a couple of paces distant at the foot of the hedge on the other side exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have been made there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench and on this bench was seated the old man of the garden while the old woman was standing in front of him 
 the old woman was grumbling 
 gavroche who was not very discreet listened 
 monsieur mabeuf said the old woman 
 mabeuf thought gavroche that name is a perfect farce 
 the old man who was thus addressed did not stir 
 the old woman repeated 
 monsieur mabeuf 
 the old man without raising his eyes from the ground made up his mind to answer 
 what is it mother plutarque 
 mother plutarque thought gavroche another farcical name 
 mother plutarque began again and the old man was forced to accept the conversation 
 the landlord is not pleased 
 why 
 we owe three quarters rent 
 in three months we shall owe him for four quarters 
 he says that he will turn you out to sleep 
 i will go 
 the insists on being paid 
 she will no longer leave her fagots 
 what will you warm yourself with this winter we shall have no wood 
 there is the sun 
 the butcher refuses to give credit he will not let us have any more meat 
 that is quite right 
 i do not digest meat well 
 it is too heavy 
 what shall we have for dinner 
 bread 
 the baker demands a settlement and says no money no bread 
 that is well 
 what will you eat 
 we have apples in the 
 but monsieur we live like that without money 
 i have none 
 the old woman went away the old man remained alone 
 he fell into thought 
 gavroche became thoughtful also 
 it was almost dark 
 the first result of meditation was that instead of scaling the hedge he crouched down under it 
 the branches stood apart a little at the foot of the thicket 
 come exclaimed gavroche mentally a nook and he curled up in it 
 his back was almost in contact with father bench he could hear the octogenarian breathe 
 then by way of dinner he tried to sleep 
 it was a with one eye open 
 while he dozed gavroche kept on the watch 
 the twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth and the lane formed a livid line between two rows of dark bushes 
 all at once in this whitish band two figures made their appearance one was in front the other some distance in the rear 
 there come two creatures muttered gavroche 
 the first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois who was bent and thoughtful dressed more than plainly and who was walking slowly because of his age and strolling about in the open evening air 
 the second was straight firm slender 
 it regulated its pace by that of the first but in the voluntary slowness of its gait suppleness and agility were discernible 
 this figure had also something fierce and disquieting about it the whole shape was that of what was then called an elegant the hat was of good shape the coat black well cut probably of fine cloth and well fitted in at the waist 
 the head was held erect with a sort of robust grace and beneath the hat the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light 
 the profile had a rose in its mouth this second form was well known to gavroche it was montparnasse 
 he could have told nothing about the other except that he was a respectable old man 
 gavroche immediately began to take observations 
 one of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with the other 
 gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events the bedroom had turned into a at a very opportune moment 
 montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour in such a place betokened something threatening 
 gavroche felt his heart moved with compassion for the old man 
 what was he to do 
 interfere 
 one weakness coming to the aid of another 
 it would be merely a laughing matter for montparnasse gavroche did not shut his eyes to the fact that the old man in the first place and the child in the second would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtable ruffian eighteen years of age 
 while gavroche was deliberating the attack took place abruptly and hideously 
 the attack of the tiger on the wild ass the attack of the spider on the fly 
 montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose bounded upon the old man seized him by the collar grasped and clung to him and gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream 
 a moment later one of these men was underneath the other groaning struggling with a knee of marble upon his breast 
 only it was not just what gavroche had expected the one who lay on the earth was montparnasse the one who was on top was the old man 
 all this took place a few paces distant from gavroche 
 the old man had received the shock had returned it and that in such a terrible fashion that in a twinkling the assailant and the assailed had exchanged roles 
 a hearty veteran thought gavroche 
 he could not refrain from clapping his hands 
 but it was applause wasted 
 it did not reach the combatants absorbed and deafened as they were each by the other as their breath mingled in the struggle 
 silence ensued 
 montparnasse ceased his struggles 
 gavroche indulged in this aside 
 can he be dead 
 the goodman had not uttered a word nor given vent to a cry he rose to his feet and gavroche heard him say to montparnasse 
 get up 
 montparnasse rose but the goodman held him fast attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has been caught by a sheep 
 gavroche looked on and listened making an effort to reinforce his eyes with his ears 
 he was enjoying himself immensely 
 he was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a spectator 
 he was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed from the darkness an indescribably tragic accent the goodman questioned montparnasse replied 
 how old are you 
 nineteen 
 you are strong and healthy 
 why do you not work 
 it bores me 
 what is your trade 
 an idler 
 speak seriously 
 can anything be done for you 
 what would you like to be 
 a thief 
 a pause ensued 
 the old man seemed absorbed in profound thought he stood motionless and did not relax his hold on montparnasse 
 every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the twitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare 
 he gave a jerk tried a crook of the knee twisted his limbs desperately and made efforts to escape 
 the old man did not appear to notice it and held both his arms with one hand with the sovereign indifference of absolute force 
 the old revery lasted for some time then looking steadily at montparnasse he addressed to him in a gentle voice in the midst of the darkness where they stood a solemn harangue of which gavroche did not lose a single syllable 
 my child you are entering through indolence on one of the most laborious of lives 
 ah 
 you declare yourself to be an idler prepare to toil 
 there is a certain formidable machine have you seen it it is the you must be on your guard against it it is crafty and ferocious if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat you will be drawn in bodily 
 that machine is laziness stop while there is yet time and save yourself 
 otherwise it is all over with you in a short time you will be among the gearing once entangled hope for nothing more 
 toil lazybones there is no more repose for you 
 the iron hand of implacable toil has seized you you do not wish to earn your living to have a task to fulfil a duty it bores you to be like other men 
 well 
 you will be different labor is the law he who rejects it will find ennui his torment you do not wish to be a workingman you will be a slave toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on the other 
 you do not desire to be its friend you shall be its negro slave 
 ah 
 you would have none of the honest weariness of men you shall have the sweat of the damned 
 where others sing you will rattle in your throat 
 you will see afar off from below other men at work it will seem to you that they are resting the laborer the harvester the sailor the blacksmith will appear to you in glory like the blessed spirits in paradise 
 what radiance surrounds the forge 
 to guide the plough to bind the sheaves is joy 
 the bark at liberty in the wind what delight 
 do you lazy idler delve drag on roll march 
 drag your halter you are a beast of burden in the team of hell 
 ah 
 to do nothing is your object 
 well not a week not a day not an hour shall you have free from oppression 
 you will be able to lift nothing without anguish 
 every minute that passes will make your muscles crack what is a feather to others will be a rock to you 
 the simplest things will become steep acclivities 
 life will become monstrous all about you 
 to go to come to breathe will be just so many terrible labors 
 your lungs will produce on you the effect of weighing a hundred pounds 
 whether you shall walk here rather than there will become a problem that must be solved 
 any one who wants to go out simply gives his door a push and there he is in the open air if you wish to go out you will be obliged to pierce your wall what does every one who wants to step into the street do 
 he goes down stairs you will tear up your sheets little by little you will make of them a rope then you will climb out of your window and you will suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss and it will be night amid storm rain and the hurricane and if the rope is too short but one way of descending will remain to you to fall 
 to drop into the gulf from an unknown height on what 
 on what is beneath on the unknown 
 or you will crawl up a at the risk of burning or you will creep through a at the risk of drowning i do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask of the stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a day of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet 
 a lock presents itself the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by a locksmith 
 if you wish to pass out you will be condemned to execute a terrible work of art you will take a large sou you will cut it in two plates with what tools 
 you will have to invent them 
 that is your business then you will hollow out the interior of these plates taking great care of the outside and you will make on the edges a thread so that they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its cover the top and bottom thus screwed together nothing will be suspected to the overseers it will be only a sou to you it will be a box what will you put in this box 
 a small bit of steel 
 a in which you will have cut teeth and which will form a saw with this saw as long as a pin and concealed in a sou you will cut the bolt of the lock you will sever bolts the padlock of your chain and the bar at your window and the fetter on your leg this masterpiece finished this prodigy accomplished all these miracles of art address skill and patience executed what will be your recompense if it becomes known that you are the author 
 the dungeon there is your future 
 what precipices are idleness and pleasure do you know that to do nothing is a melancholy resolution to live in idleness on the property of society to be useless that is to say pernicious 
 this leads straight to the depth of wretchedness 
 woe to the man who desires to be a parasite he will become vermin 
 ah 
 so it does not please you to work ah 
 you have but one thought to drink well to eat well to sleep well 
 you will drink water you will eat black bread you will sleep on a plank with a fetter whose cold touch you will feel on your flesh all night long riveted to your limbs you will break those fetters you will flee 
 that is well you will crawl on your belly through the brushwood and you will eat grass like the beasts of the forest 
 and you will be recaptured and then you will pass years in a dungeon riveted to a wall groping for your jug that you may drink gnawing at a horrible loaf of darkness which dogs would not touch eating beans that the worms have eaten before you 
 you will be a in a cellar 
 ah 
 have pity on yourself you miserable young child who were sucking at nurse less than twenty years ago and who have no doubt a mother still alive 
 i conjure you listen to me i entreat you 
 you desire fine black cloth varnished shoes to have your hair curled and oils on your locks to please low women to be handsome 
 you will be shaven clean and you will wear a red blouse and wooden shoes 
 you want rings on your fingers you will have an iron necklet on your neck if you glance at a woman you will receive a blow 
 and you will enter there at the age of twenty 
 and you will come out at fifty you will enter young rosy fresh with brilliant eyes and all your white teeth and your handsome youthful hair you will come out broken bent wrinkled toothless horrible with white locks ah my poor child you are on the wrong road idleness is counselling you badly the hardest of all work is thieving believe me do not undertake that painful profession of an idle man it is not comfortable to become a rascal 
 it is less disagreeable to be an honest man 
 now go and ponder on what i have said to you 
 by the way what did you want of me 
 my purse 
 here it is 
 and the old man releasing montparnasse put his purse in the hand montparnasse weighed it for a moment after which he allowed it to slide gently into the back pocket of his coat with the same mechanical precaution as though he had stolen it 
 all this having been said and done the goodman turned his back and tranquilly resumed his stroll 
 the blockhead muttered montparnasse 
 who was this goodman 
 the reader has no doubt already divined 
 montparnasse watched him with amazement as he disappeared in the dusk this contemplation was fatal to him 
 while the old man was walking away gavroche drew near 
 gavroche had assured himself with a sidelong glance that father mabeuf was still sitting on his bench probably sound asleep then the gamin emerged from his thicket and began to crawl after montparnasse in the dark as the latter stood there motionless in this manner he came up to montparnasse without being seen or heard gently insinuated his hand into the back pocket of that of fine black cloth seized the purse withdrew his hand and having recourse once more to his crawling he slipped away like an adder through the shadows 
 montparnasse who had no reason to be on his guard and who was engaged in thought for the first time in his life perceived nothing 
 when gavroche had once more attained the point where father mabeuf was he flung the purse over the hedge and fled as fast as his legs would carry him 
 the purse fell on father foot 
 this commotion roused him 
 he bent over and picked up the purse 
 he did not understand in the least and opened it 
 the purse had two compartments in one of them there was some small change in the other lay six napoleons 
 m mabeuf in great alarm referred the matter to his housekeeper 
 that has fallen from heaven said mother plutarque

 chapter xvi 
 
 berg the rostovs was already a colonel wearing the orders of vladimir and anna and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the first division of the second army 
 on the first of september he had come to moscow from the army 
 he had nothing to do in moscow but he had noticed that everyone in the army was asking for leave to visit moscow and had something to do there so he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and domestic reasons 
 berg drove up to his house in his spruce little trap with a pair of sleek roans exactly like those of a certain prince he looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it 
 from the anteroom berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the drawing room where he embraced the count kissed the hands of natasha and sonya and hastened to inquire after health 
 health at a time like this said the count come tell us the news is the army retreating or will there be another battle 
 god almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland papa said berg the army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders so to say have now assembled in council no one knows what is coming but in general i can tell you papa that such a heroic spirit the truly antique valor of the russian army which they which it he corrected himself has shown or displayed in the battle of the there are no words worthy to do it justice i tell you papa he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done but berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the words russian army i tell you frankly that we the commanders far from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind could hardly restrain those those yes those exploits of antique valor he went on rapidly general barclay de tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the troops i can assure you our corps was stationed on a hillside you can imagine 
 and berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had heard those days natasha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question 
 altogether such heroism as was displayed by the russian warriors cannot be imagined or adequately praised said berg glancing round at natasha and as if anxious to conciliate her replying to her intent look with a smile russia is not in moscow she lives in the hearts of her sons it so papa said he 
 just then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and dissatisfied expression berg hurriedly jumped up kissed her hand asked about her health and swaying his head from side to side to express sympathy remained standing beside her 
 yes mamma i tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for every russian but why are you so anxious you have still time to get away 
 i think what the servants are about said the countess turning to her husband i have just been told that nothing is ready yet somebody after all must see to things one misses mitenka at such times there be any end to it 
 the count was about to say something but evidently restrained himself he got up from his chair and went to the door 
 at that moment berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose and seeing the knot in it pondered shaking his head sadly and significantly 
 and i have a great favor to ask of you papa said he 
 hm said the count and stopped 
 i was driving past house just now said berg with a laugh when the steward a man i know ran out and asked me whether i buy something i went in out of curiosity you know and there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table you know how dear vera wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it at the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table berg involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements and such a beauty it pulls out and has a secret english drawer you know and dear vera has long wanted one i wish to give her a surprise you see i saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard please let me have one i will pay the man well and 
 the count frowned and coughed 
 ask the countess i give orders 
 if inconvenient please said berg only i so wanted it for dear sake 
 oh go to the devil all of you to the devil the devil the devil cried the old count my in a whirl 
 and he left the room the countess began to cry 
 yes mamma yes these are very hard times said berg 
 natasha left the room with her father and as if finding it difficult to reach some decision first followed him and then ran downstairs 
 petya was in the porch engaged in giving out weapons to the servants who were to leave moscow the loaded carts were still standing in the yard two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly 
 do you know what about petya asked natasha 
 she understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about she did not answer 
 because papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded said petya vasilich told me i consider 
 i consider natasha suddenly almost shouted turning her angry face to petya i consider it so horrid so abominable so i know what are we despicable germans 
 her throat quivered with convulsive sobs and afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run to waste she turned and rushed headlong up the stairs 
 berg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful attention of a relative the count pipe in hand was pacing up and down the room when natasha her face distorted by anger burst in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps 
 horrid abominable she screamed you possibly have ordered it 
 berg and the countess looked at her perplexed and frightened the count stood still at the window and listened 
 mamma impossible see what is going on in the yard she cried they will be left 
 the matter with you who are they what do you want 
 why the wounded impossible mamma monstrous no mamma darling not the thing please forgive me darling mamma what does it matter what we take away only look what is going on in the yard mamma impossible 
 the count stood by the window and listened without turning round suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window 
 the countess glanced at her daughter saw her face full of shame for her mother saw her agitation and understood why her husband did not turn to look at her now and she glanced round quite disconcerted 
 oh do as you like am i hindering anyone she said not surrendering at once 
 mamma darling forgive me 
 but the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband 
 my dear you order what is right you know i understand about it said she dropping her eyes shamefacedly 
 the eggs the eggs are teaching the hen muttered the count through tears of joy and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of shame on his breast 
 papa mamma may i see to it may i asked natasha we will still take all the most necessary things 
 the count nodded affirmatively and natasha at the rapid pace at which she used to run when playing at tag ran through the ballroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the yard 
 the servants gathered round natasha but could not believe the strange order she brought them until the count himself in his name confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms when they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal it no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the only thing to do 
 the whole household as if to atone for not having done it sooner set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts the wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts the news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses from which wounded men began to come into the rostovs yard many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things but the work of unloading once started could not be arrested it seemed not to matter whether all or only half the things were left behind cases full of china bronzes pictures and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the yard and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have another and yet another cart 
 we can take four more men said the steward they can have my 
 trap or else what is to become of them 
 let them have my wardrobe cart said the countess dunyasha can go with me in the carriage 
 they unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a house two doors off the whole household servants included was bright and animated natasha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she had not known for a long time 
 what could we fasten this onto asked the servants trying to fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage we must keep at least one cart 
 in it asked natasha 
 the books 
 leave it vasilich will put it away not wanted 
 the phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where count peter could sit 
 on the box sit on the box you petya cried natasha 
 sonya too was busy all this time but the aim of her efforts was quite different from she was putting away the things that had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible

 solitude and the barracks combined 
 grief which had been so poignant and lively four or five months previously had without her being conscious of the fact entered upon its convalescence 
 nature spring youth love for her father the gayety of the birds and flowers caused something almost resembling forgetfulness to filter gradually drop by drop into that soul which was so virgin and so young 
 was the fire wholly extinct there 
 or was it merely that layers of ashes had formed the truth is that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any longer 
 one day she suddenly thought of marius 
 why said she i no longer think of him 
 that same week she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers with a waist a delicious uniform the cheeks of a young girl a sword under his arm waxed mustaches and a glazed schapka passing the gate 
 moreover he had light hair prominent blue eyes a round face was vain insolent and quite the reverse of marius 
 he had a cigar in his mouth 
 cosette thought that this officer doubtless belonged to the regiment in barracks in the rue de babylone 
 on the following day she saw him pass again 
 she took note of the hour 
 from that time forth was it chance she saw him pass nearly every day 
 the comrades perceived that there was in that badly kept garden behind that malicious rococo fence a very pretty creature who was almost always there when the handsome is not unknown to the reader and whose name was theodule gillenormand passed by 
 see here they said to him a little creature there who is making eyes at you look 
 have i the time replied the lancer to look at all the girls who look at me 
 this was at the precise moment when marius was descending heavily towards agony and was saying 
 if i could but see her before i die had his wish been realized had he beheld cosette at that moment gazing at the lancer he would not have been able to utter a word and he would have expired with grief 
 whose fault was it 
 no 
 marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves in sorrow and there abide cosette was one of those persons who plunge into sorrow and emerge from it again 
 cosette was moreover passing through that dangerous period the fatal phase of feminine revery abandoned to itself in which the isolated heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling as chance directs to the capital of a marble column or to the post of a a rapid and decisive moment critical for every orphan be she rich or poor for wealth does not prevent a bad choice misalliances are made in very high circles real misalliance is that of souls and as many an unknown young man without name without birth without fortune is a marble column which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand ideas so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent who has polished boots and varnished words if looked at not outside but inside a thing which is reserved for his wife is nothing more than a block obscurely haunted by violent unclean and vinous passions the post of a 
 what did soul contain 
 passion calmed or lulled to sleep something limpid brilliant troubled to a certain depth and gloomy lower down 
 the image of the handsome officer was reflected in the surface 
 did a souvenir linger in the depths quite at the 
 cosette did not know 
 a singular incident supervened

 chapter xvii 
 
 before two in the afternoon the rostovs four carriages packed full and with the horses harnessed stood at the front door one by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard 
 the caleche in which prince andrew was being taken attracted attention as it passed the front porch with the help of a maid she was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at the entrance 
 whose caleche is that she inquired leaning out of the carriage window 
 why you know miss replied the maid the wounded prince he spent the night in our house and is going with us 
 but who is it his name 
 our intended that was prince bolkonski himself they say he is dying replied the maid with a sigh 
 sonya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess the countess tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey was pacing up and down the drawing room waiting for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting natasha was not in the room 
 mamma said sonya prince andrew is here mortally wounded he is going with us 
 the countess opened her eyes in dismay and seizing arm glanced around 
 natasha she murmured 
 at that moment this news had only one significance for both of them they knew their natasha and alarm as to what would happen if she heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked 
 natasha does not know yet but he is going with us said sonya 
 you say he is dying 
 sonya nodded 
 the countess put her arms around sonya and began to cry 
 the ways of god are past finding out she thought feeling that the almighty hand hitherto unseen was becoming manifest in all that was now taking place 
 well mamma everything is ready the matter asked natasha as with animated face she ran into the room 
 nothing answered the countess if everything is ready let us start 
 and the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face sonya embraced natasha and kissed her 
 natasha looked at her inquiringly 
 what is it what has happened 
 nothing no 
 is it something very bad for me what is it persisted natasha with her quick intuition 
 sonya sighed and made no reply the count petya madame schoss mavra kuzminichna and vasilich came into the drawing room and having closed the doors they all sat down and remained for some moments silently seated without looking at one another 
 the count was the first to rise and with a loud sigh crossed himself before the icon all the others did the same then the count embraced mavra kuzminichna and vasilich who were to remain in moscow and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words the countess went into the oratory and there sonya found her on her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall the most precious ones with which some family tradition was connected were being taken with them 
 in the porch and in the yard the men whom petya had armed with swords and daggers with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts and girdles tightened were taking leave of those remaining behind 
 as is always the case at a departure much had been forgotten or put in the wrong place and for a long time two menservants stood one on each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house to the carriages the caleche the phaeton and back again 
 they always will forget everything said the countess you know i sit like that 
 and dunyasha with clenched teeth without replying but with an aggrieved look on her face hastily got into the coach to rearrange the seat 
 oh those servants said the count swaying his head 
 efim the old coachman who was the only one the countess trusted to drive her sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance round at what was going on behind him from thirty years experience he knew it would be some time yet before the order be off in name would be given him and he knew that even when it was said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had been forgotten and even after that he would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill he knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen with more patience than the horses especially the near one the chestnut falcon who was pawing the ground and champing his bit at last all were seated the carriage steps were folded and pulled up the door was shut somebody was sent for a traveling case and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say then efim deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself the postilion and all the other servants did the same off in name said efim putting on his hat start the postilion started the horses the off pole horse tugged at his collar the high springs creaked and the body of the coach swayed the footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway the other vehicles jolted in their turn and the procession of carriages moved up the street in the carriages the caleche and the phaeton all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite the house those who were to remain in moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off 
 rarely had natasha experienced so joyful a feeling as now sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls of forsaken agitated moscow occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of wounded in front of them almost at the head of the line she could see the raised hood of prince caleche she did not know who was in it but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that caleche she knew it was right in front 
 in kudrino from the nikitski presnya and podnovinsk streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the rostovs and as they passed along the sadovaya street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast 
 as they were going round the sukharev water tower natasha who was inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking past suddenly cried out in joyful surprise 
 dear me mamma sonya look he 
 who who 
 look yes on my word bezukhov said natasha putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall stout man in a long coat who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise and who was passing under the arch of the sukharev tower accompanied by a small beardless old man in a frieze coat 
 yes it really is bezukhov in a coat with a old boy really said natasha look look 
 no not he how can you talk such nonsense 
 mamma screamed natasha stake my head he i assure you stop stop she cried to the coachman 
 but the coachman could not stop for from the meshchanski street came more carts and carriages and the rostovs were being shouted at to move on and not block the way 
 in fact however though now much farther off than before the rostovs all saw pierre or someone extraordinarily like him in a coat going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small beardless old man who looked like a footman that old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them and respectfully touching elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage pierre evidently engrossed in thought could not at first understand him at length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man indicated he recognized natasha and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach but having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped 
 face leaning out of the window beamed with quizzical kindliness 
 peter kirilovich come here we have recognized you this is wonderful she cried holding out her hand to him what are you doing why are you like this 
 pierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on 
 what is the matter count asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone 
 what what why ask me said pierre and looked round at natasha whose radiant happy expression of which he was conscious without looking at her filled him with enchantment 
 are you remaining in moscow then 
 pierre hesitated 
 in moscow he said in a questioning tone yes in moscow goodby 
 ah if only i were a man certainly stay with you how splendid said natasha mamma if let me stay 
 pierre glanced absently at natasha and was about to say something but the countess interrupted him 
 you were at the battle we heard 
 yes i was pierre answered there will be another battle tomorrow he began but natasha interrupted him 
 but what is the matter with you count you are not like yourself 
 oh ask me ask me i know myself tomorrow but no he muttered an awful time and dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement 
 natasha continued to lean out of the window for a long time beaming at him with her kindly slightly quizzical happy smile

 apprehensions 
 during the first fortnight in april jean valjean took a journey this as the reader knows happened from time to time at very long intervals 
 he remained absent a day or two days at the utmost where did he go 
 no one knew not even cosette 
 once only on the occasion of one of these departures she had accompanied him in a as far as a little at the corner of which she read 
 impasse de la planchette 
 there he alighted and the coach took cosette back to the rue de babylone 
 it was usually when money was lacking in the house that jean valjean took these little trips 
 so jean valjean was absent 
 he had said 
 i shall return in three days 
 that evening cosette was alone in the in order to get rid of her ennui she had opened her and had begun to sing accompanying herself the while the chorus from euryanthe hunters astray in the wood which is probably the most beautiful thing in all the sphere of music 
 when she had finished she remained wrapped in thought 
 all at once it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in the garden 
 it could not be her father he was absent it could not be toussaint she was in bed and it was ten at night 
 she stepped to the shutter of the which was closed and laid her ear against it 
 it seemed to her that it was the tread of a man and that he was walking very softly 
 she mounted rapidly to the first floor to her own chamber opened a small wicket in her shutter and peeped into the garden the moon was at the full 
 everything could be seen as plainly as by day 
 there was no one there 
 she opened the window 
 the garden was absolutely calm and all that was visible was that the street was deserted as usual 
 cosette thought that she had been mistaken 
 she thought that she had heard a noise 
 it was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and magnificent chorus of weber which lays open before the mind terrified depths which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest and in which one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of the huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight 
 she thought no more about it 
 moreover cosette was not very timid by nature 
 there flowed in her veins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs barefoot 
 it will be remembered that she was more of a lark than a dove 
 there was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her 
 on the following day at an earlier hour towards nightfall she was strolling in the garden 
 in the midst of the confused thoughts which occupied her she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similar to that of the preceding evening as though some one were walking beneath the trees in the dusk and not very far from her but she told herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved from side to side and she paid no heed to it 
 besides she could see nothing 
 she emerged from the thicket she had still to cross a small lawn to regain the steps 
 the moon which had just risen behind her cast shadow in front of her upon this lawn as she came out from the shrubbery 
 cosette halted in alarm 
 beside her shadow the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another shadow which was particularly startling and terrible a shadow which had a round hat 
 it was the shadow of a man who must have been standing on the border of the clump of shrubbery a few paces in the rear of cosette 
 she stood for a moment without the power to speak or cry or call or stir or turn her head 
 then she summoned up all her courage and turned round resolutely 
 there was no one there 
 she glanced on the ground 
 the figure had disappeared 
 she the thicket searched the corners boldly went as far as the gate and found nothing 
 she felt herself absolutely chilled with terror 
 was this another hallucination 
 what 
 two days in succession one hallucination might pass but two hallucinations the disquieting point about it was that the shadow had assuredly not been a phantom 
 phantoms do not wear round hats 
 on the following day jean valjean returned 
 cosette told him what she thought she had heard and seen 
 she wanted to be reassured and to see her father shrug his shoulders and say to her you are a little goose 
 jean valjean grew anxious 
 it cannot be anything said he 
 he left her under some pretext and went into the garden and she saw him examining the gate with great attention 
 during the night she woke up this time she was sure and she distinctly heard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window she ran to her little wicket and opened it 
 in point of fact there was a man in the garden with a large club in his hand just as she was about to scream the moon lighted up the profile it was her father 
 she returned to her bed saying to herself he is very uneasy 
 jean valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the garden 
 cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter 
 on the third night the moon was on the wane and had begun to rise later at one in the morning possibly she heard a loud burst of laughter and her voice calling her 
 cosette 
 she jumped out of bed threw on her and opened her window 
 her father was standing on the below 
 i have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you said he look there is your shadow with the round hat 
 and he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon and which did indeed bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man wearing a round hat 
 it was the shadow produced by a of sheet iron with a hood which rose above a neighboring roof 
 cosette joined in his laughter all her lugubrious suppositions were allayed and the next morning as she was at breakfast with her father she made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron 
 jean valjean became quite tranquil once more as for cosette she did not pay much attention to the question whether the was really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen or thought she had seen and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky 
 she did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a which is afraid of being caught in the act and which retires when some one looks at its shadow for the shadow had taken the alarm when cosette had turned round and cosette had thought herself very sure of this 
 serenity was fully restored the proof appeared to her to be complete and it quite vanished from her mind whether there could possibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or at night 
 a few days later however a fresh incident occurred

 for the last two days ever since leaving home pierre had been living in the empty house of his deceased benefactor bazdeev this is how it happened 
 when he woke up on the morning after his return to moscow and his interview with count rostopchin he could not for some time make out where he was and what was expected of him when he was informed that among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife the countess helene he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb he felt that everything was now at an end all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces that nobody was right or wrong the future held nothing and there was no escape from this position smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair then rose went to the door of the reception room and peeped through the crack returned flourishing his arms and took up a book his came in a second time to say that the frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if only for a minute and that someone from widow had called to ask pierre to take charge of her books as she herself was leaving for the country 
 oh yes in a minute wait or no no of course go and say i will come directly pierre replied to the 
 but as soon as the man had left the room pierre took up his hat which was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door there was no one in the passage he went along the whole length of this passage to the stairs and frowning and rubbing his forehead with both hands went down as far as the first landing the hall porter was standing at the front door from the landing where pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back entrance he went down that staircase and out into the yard no one had seen him but there were some carriages waiting and as soon as pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him when he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen he hung his head and quickening his pace went down the street 
 of all the affairs awaiting pierre that day the sorting of joseph books and papers appeared to him the most necessary 
 he hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the ponds where the widow house was 
 continually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were making their way from all sides out of moscow and balancing his bulky body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle pierre experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school began to talk to his driver 
 the man told him that arms were being distributed today at the kremlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the three hills gates and a great battle would be fought there 
 having reached the ponds pierre found the bazdeevs house where he had not been for a long time past he went up to the gate gerasim that sallow beardless old man pierre had seen at torzhok five years before with joseph bazdeev came out in answer to his knock 
 at home asked pierre 
 owing to the present state of things sophia danilovna has gone to the torzhok estate with the children your excellency 
 i will come in all the same i have to look through the books said pierre 
 be so good as to step in makar alexeevich the brother of my late master may the kingdom of heaven be his has remained here but he is in a weak state as you know said the old servant 
 pierre knew that makar alexeevich was joseph brother and a hard drinker 
 yes yes i know let us go in said pierre and entered the house 
 a tall old man with a red nose wearing a dressing gown and with galoshes on his bare feet stood in the anteroom on seeing pierre he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage 
 he was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble as your honor sees said gerasim will you step into the study pierre nodded as it was sealed up so it has remained but sophia danilovna gave orders that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books 
 pierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such trepidation in his lifetime the room dusty and untouched since the death of joseph bazdeev was now even gloomier 
 gerasim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe pierre went round the study approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts were kept and took out what had once been one of the most important the holy of holies of the order this was the authentic scotch acts with notes and explanations he sat down at the dusty writing table and having laid the manuscripts before him opened them out closed them finally pushed them away and resting his head on his hand sank into meditation 
 gerasim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw pierre always sitting in the same attitude 
 more than two hours passed and gerasim took the liberty of making a slight noise at the door to attract his attention but pierre did not hear him 
 is the cabman to be discharged your honor 
 oh yes said pierre rousing himself and rising hurriedly look here he added taking gerasim by a button of his coat and looking down at the old man with moist shining and ecstatic eyes i say do you know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow 
 we heard so replied the man 
 i beg you not to tell anyone who i am and to do what i ask you 
 yes your excellency replied gerasim will you have something to eat 
 no but i want something else i want peasant clothes and a pistol said pierre unexpectedly blushing 
 yes your excellency said gerasim after thinking for a moment 
 all the rest of that day pierre spent alone in his study and gerasim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and talking to himself and he spent the night on a bed made up for him there 
 gerasim being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things accepted taking up his residence in the house without surprise and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on that same evening without even asking himself what they were wanted for he procured a coat and cap for pierre and promised to get him the pistol next day makar alexeevich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at pierre but as soon as pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away it was when pierre wearing the coat which gerasim had procured for him and had disinfected by steam was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the sukharev market that he met the rostovs

 enriched with commentaries by toussaint 
 in the garden near the railing on the street there was a stone bench screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of but which could in case of necessity be reached by an arm from the outside past the trees and the gate 
 one evening during that same month of april jean valjean had gone out cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown the breeze was blowing briskly in the trees cosette was meditating an objectless sadness was taking possession of her little by little that invincible sadness evoked by the evening and which arises perhaps who knows from the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour 
 perhaps fantine was within that shadow 
 cosette rose slowly made the tour of the garden walking on the grass drenched in dew and saying to herself through the species of melancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged really one needs wooden shoes for the garden at this hour one takes cold 
 she returned to the bench 
 as she was about to resume her seat there she observed on the spot which she had quitted a tolerably large stone which had evidently not been there a moment before 
 cosette gazed at the stone asking herself what it meant 
 all at once the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by itself that some one had placed it there that an arm had been thrust through the railing and this idea appeared to alarm her this time the fear was genuine the stone was there 
 no doubt was possible she did not touch it fled without glancing behind her took refuge in the house and immediately closed with shutter bolt and bar the window opening on the flight of steps she inquired of toussaint 
 has my father returned yet 
 not yet mademoiselle 
 we have already noted once for all the fact that toussaint stuttered may we be permitted to dispense with it for the future 
 the musical notation of an infirmity is repugnant to us 
 jean valjean a thoughtful man and given to nocturnal strolls often returned quite late at night 
 toussaint went on cosette are you careful to thoroughly barricade the shutters opening on the garden at least with bars in the evening and to put the little iron things in the little rings that close them 
 oh be easy on that score miss 
 toussaint did not fail in her duty and cosette was well aware of the fact but she could not refrain from adding 
 it is so solitary here 
 so far as that is concerned said toussaint it is true we might be assassinated before we had time to say ouf and monsieur does not sleep in the house to boot but fear nothing miss i fasten the shutters up like prisons lone women 
 that is enough to make one shudder i believe you just imagine what if you were to see men enter your chamber at night and say 
 hold your tongue and begin to cut your throat not the dying so much you die for one must die and all right the abomination of feeling those people touch you and then their knives they be able to cut well with them ah good gracious 
 be quiet said cosette 
 fasten everything thoroughly 
 cosette terrified by the melodrama improvised by toussaint and possibly also by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week which recurred to her memory dared not even say to her go and look at the stone which has been placed on the bench for fear of opening the garden gate and allowing the men to enter she saw that all the doors and windows were carefully fastened made toussaint go all over the house from garret to cellar locked herself up in her own chamber bolted her door looked under her couch went to bed and slept badly 
 all night long she saw that big stone as large as a mountain and full of caverns 
 at property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all our terrors of the past night and our laughter is in direct proportion to our terror which they have sunrise cosette when she woke viewed her fright as a nightmare and said to herself what have i been thinking of 
 it is like the footsteps that i thought i heard a week or two ago in the garden at night it is like the shadow of the am i becoming a coward the sun which was glowing through the crevices in her shutters and turning the damask curtains crimson reassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from her thoughts even the stone 
 there was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a round hat in the garden i dreamed about the stone as i did all the rest 
 she dressed herself descended to the garden ran to the bench and broke out in a cold perspiration 
 the stone was there 
 but this lasted only for a moment 
 that which is terror by night is curiosity by day 
 bah said she come let us see what it is 
 she lifted the stone which was tolerably large 
 beneath it was something which resembled a letter 
 it was a white envelope cosette seized it 
 there was no address on one side no seal on the other 
 yet the envelope though unsealed was not empty papers could be seen inside 
 cosette examined it 
 it was no longer alarm it was no longer curiosity it was a beginning of anxiety 
 cosette drew from the envelope its contents a little notebook of paper each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and rather pretty handwriting as cosette thought 
 cosette looked for a name there was none 
 to whom was this addressed to her probably since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench from whom did it come 
 an irresistible fascination took possession of her she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were trembling in her hand she gazed at the sky the street the acacias all bathed in light the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof and then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript and she said to herself that she must know what it contained 
 this is what she read

 chapter xix 
 
 order to retreat through moscow to the ryazan road was issued at night on the first of september 
 the first troops started at once and during the night they marched slowly and steadily without hurry at daybreak however those nearing the town at the dorogomilov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge ascending on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys while endless masses of troops were bearing down on them from behind and an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them they all rushed forward to the bridge onto it and to the fords and the boats kutuzov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of moscow 
 by ten in the morning of the second of september only the rear guard remained in the dorogomilov suburb where they had ample room the main army was on the other side of moscow or beyond it 
 at that very time at ten in the morning of the second of september napoleon was standing among his troops on the poklonny hill looking at the panorama spread out before him from the of august to the second of september that is from the battle of borodino to the entry of the french into moscow during the whole of that agitating memorable week there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a surprise when the sun hangs low and gives more heat than in spring when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air when even the nights are warm and when in those dark warm nights golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling from the sky 
 at ten in the morning of the second of september this weather still held 
 the brightness of the morning was magical moscow seen from the poklonny hill lay spaciously spread out with her river her gardens and her churches and she seemed to be living her usual life her cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight 
 the view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture such as he had never seen before filled napoleon with the rather envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has no knowledge of them this city was evidently living with the full force of its own life by the indefinite signs which even at a distance distinguish a living body from a dead one napoleon from the poklonny hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt as it were the breathing of that great and beautiful body 
 every russian looking at moscow feels her to be a mother every foreigner who sees her even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city must feel her feminine character and napoleon felt it 
 cette ville asiatique aux innombrables eglises moscou la sainte la voila done enfin cette fameuse ville il etait temps said he and dismounting he ordered a plan of moscow to be spread out before him and summoned lelorgne the interpreter 
 that asiatic city of the innumerable churches holy moscow here it is then at last that famous city it was high time 
 a town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor thought he he had said so to tuchkov at smolensk from that point of view he gazed at the oriental beauty he had not seen before it seemed strange to him that his wish which had seemed unattainable had at last been realized in the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan considering its details and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him 
 but could it be otherwise he thought here is this capital at my feet where is alexander now and of what is he thinking a strange beautiful and majestic city and a strange and majestic moment in what light must i appear to them thought he thinking of his troops here she is the reward for all those fainthearted men he reflected glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and forming up one word from me one movement of my hand and that ancient capital of the tsars would perish but my clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished i must be magnanimous and truly great but no it be true that i am in moscow he suddenly thought yet here she is lying at my feet with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine but i shall spare her on the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism i will inscribe great words of justice and mercy it is just this which alexander will feel most painfully i know him it seemed to napoleon that the chief import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between himself and alexander from the height of the kremlin yes there is the kremlin yes i will give them just laws i will teach them the meaning of true civilization i will make generations of boyars remember their conqueror with love i will tell the deputation that i did not and do not desire war that i have waged war only against the false policy of their court that i love and respect alexander and that in moscow i will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people i do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch boyars i will say to them i do not desire war i desire the peace and welfare of all my subjects however i know their presence will inspire me and i shall speak to them as i always do clearly impressively and majestically but can it be true that i am in moscow yes there she lies 
 les boyars said he to his suite 
 bring the boyars to me 
 a general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the boyars 
 two hours passed napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the same place on the poklonny hill awaiting the deputation his speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination that speech was full of dignity and greatness as napoleon understood it 
 he was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward moscow in his imagination he appointed days for assemblies at the palace of the tsars at which russian notables and his own would mingle he mentally appointed a governor one who would win the hearts of the people having learned that there were many charitable institutions in moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors on them all he thought that as in africa he had to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque so in moscow he must be beneficent like the tsars and in order finally to touch the hearts of the russians and being like all frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference to ma chere ma tendre ma pauvre mere he decided that he would place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters this establishment is dedicated to my dear mother or no it should be simply maison de ma mere he concluded but am i really in moscow yes here it lies before me but why is the deputation from the city so long in appearing he wondered 
 my dear my tender my poor mother 
 house of my mother 
 meanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite those sent to fetch the deputation had returned with the news that moscow was empty that everyone had left it the faces of those who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed they were not alarmed by the fact that moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants grave as that fact seemed but by the question how to tell the emperor without putting him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous that he had been awaiting the boyars so long in vain that there were drunken mobs left in moscow but no one else some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped together others disputed that opinion and maintained that the emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared and then told the truth 
 he will have to be told all the same said some gentlemen of the suite but gentlemen 
 the position was the more awkward because the emperor meditating upon his magnanimous plans was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread map occasionally glancing along the road to moscow from under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile 
 but impossible declared the gentlemen of the suite shrugging their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word le ridicule 
 at last the emperor tired of futile expectation his instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity gave a sign with his hand a single report of a signaling gun followed and the troops who were already spread out on different sides of moscow moved into the city through tver kaluga and dorogomilov gates faster and faster vying with one another they moved at the double or at a trot vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts 
 drawn on by the movement of his troops napoleon rode with them as far as the dorogomilov gate but there again stopped and dismounting from his horse paced for a long time by the rampart awaiting the deputation

 book end of which does not resemble the beginning 
 chapter iv 
 
 a heart beneath a stone 
 the reduction of the universe to a single being the expansion of a single being even to god that is love 
 love is the salutation of the angels to the stars 
 how sad is the soul when it is sad through love 
 what a void in the absence of the being who by herself alone fills the world 
 oh how true it is that the beloved being becomes god one could comprehend that god might be jealous of this had not god the father of all evidently made creation for the soul and the soul for love 
 the glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams 
 god is behind everything but everything hides god 
 things are black creatures are opaque 
 to love a being is to render that being transparent 
 certain thoughts are prayers 
 there are moments when whatever the attitude of the body may be the soul is on its knees 
 parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices which possess however a reality of their own 
 they are prevented from seeing each other they cannot write to each other they discover a multitude of mysterious means to correspond they send each other the song of the birds the perfume of the flowers the smiles of children the light of the sun the sighings of the breeze the rays of stars all creation 
 and why not all the works of god are made to serve love 
 love is sufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages 
 oh spring 
 thou art a letter that i write to her 
 the future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds love that is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity in the infinite the inexhaustible is requisite 
 love participates of the soul itself 
 it is of the same nature like it it is the divine spark like it it is incorruptible indivisible imperishable 
 it is a point of fire that exists within us which is immortal and infinite which nothing can confine and which nothing can extinguish 
 we feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones and we see it beaming in the very depths of heaven 
 oh love 
 adorations voluptuousness of two minds which understand each other of two hearts which exchange with each other of two glances which penetrate each other 
 you will come to me will you not bliss strolls by twos in the solitudes 
 blessed and radiant days 
 i have sometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from the lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies of men 
 god can add nothing to the happiness of those who love except to give them endless duration 
 after a life of love an eternity of love is in fact an augmentation but to increase in intensity even the ineffable felicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world is impossible even to god 
 god is the plenitude of heaven love is the plenitude of man 
 you look at a star for two reasons because it is luminous and because it is impenetrable 
 you have beside you a sweeter radiance and a greater mystery woman 
 all of us whoever we may be have our respirable beings 
 we lack air and we stifle 
 then we die 
 to die for lack of love is horrible suffocation of the soul 
 when love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic unity the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are concerned they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the same destiny they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit 
 love soar 
 on the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she walks you are lost you love 
 but one thing remains for you to do to think of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you 
 what love commences can be finished by god alone 
 true love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or a handkerchief found and eternity is required for its devotion and its hopes 
 it is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely little 
 if you are a stone be adamant if you are a plant be the sensitive plant if you are a man be love 
 nothing suffices for love 
 we have happiness we desire paradise we possess paradise we desire heaven 
 oh ye who love each other all this is contained in love understand how to find it there 
 love has contemplation as well as heaven and more than heaven it has voluptuousness 
 does she still come to the luxembourg 
 no sir 
 this is the church where she attends mass is it not 
 she no longer comes here does she still live in this house 
 she has moved away where has she gone to dwell 
 she did not say 
 what a melancholy thing not to know the address of soul 
 love has its childishness other passions have their pettinesses shame on the passions which belittle man 
 honor to the one which makes a child of him 
 there is one strange thing do you know it 
 i dwell in the night there is a being who carried off my sky when she went away 
 oh would that we were lying side by side in the same grave hand in hand and from time to time in the darkness gently caressing a would suffice for my eternity 
 ye who suffer because ye love love yet more 
 to die of love is to live in it 
 love 
 a sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture there is ecstasy in agony 
 oh joy of the birds 
 it is because they have nests that they sing 
 love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise 
 deep hearts sage minds take life as god has made it it is a long trial an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny this destiny the true one begins for a man with the first step inside the tomb 
 then something appears to him and he begins to distinguish the definitive 
 the definitive meditate upon that word the living perceive the infinite the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead 
 in the meanwhile love and suffer hope and contemplate 
 woe alas to him who shall have loved only bodies forms appearances 
 death will deprive him of all try to love souls you will find them again 
 i encountered in the street a very poor young man who was in love his hat was old his coat was worn his elbows were in holes water trickled through his shoes and the stars through his soul 
 what a grand thing it is to be loved 
 what a far grander thing it is to love 
 the heart becomes heroic by dint of passion it is no longer composed of anything but what is pure it no longer rests on anything that is not elevated and great 
 an unworthy thought can no more germinate in it than a nettle on a glacier the serene and lofty soul inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions dominating the clouds and the shades of this world its follies its lies its hatreds its vanities its miseries inhabits the blue of heaven and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny as the crests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake 
 if there did not exist some one who loved the sun would become extinct

 chapter xx 
 
 meanwhile moscow was empty there were still people in it perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained but it was empty it was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty 
 in a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive as other hives 
 the bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday sun as gaily as around the living hives from a distance it smells of honey like the others and bees fly in and out in the same way but one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any life in it the bees do not fly in the same way the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same to the tap on the wall of the sick hive instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial living sound the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive from the alighting board instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom and the warm whiffs of crowded life comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey there are no longer sentinels sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised and ready to die in defense of the hive there is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity like the sound of boiling water but diverse discordant sounds of disorder in and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily they do not sting but crawl away from danger formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive and they flew out empty now they fly out laden the beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in instead of black glossy bees tamed by toil clinging to one legs and drawing out the wax with a ceaseless hum of labor that used to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in various directions on the floor and walls of the hive instead of a neatly glued floor swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings there is a floor littered with bits of wax excrement dying bees scarcely moving their legs and dead ones that have not been cleared away 
 the beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and keeping the brood warm he sees the skillful complex structures of the combs but no longer in their former state of purity all is neglected and foul black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs and the short home bees shriveled and listless as if they were old creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers having lost all motive and all sense of life drones bumblebees wasps and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard here and there a couple of bees by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it in another corner two old bees are languidly fighting or cleaning themselves or feeding one another without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent in a third place a crowd of bees crushing one another attack some victim and fight and smother it and the victim enfeebled or killed drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather among the heap of corpses the keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells in place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation he sees hundreds of dull listless and sleepy shells of bees they have almost all died unawares sitting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is now no more they reek of decay and death only a few of them still move rise and feebly fly to settle on the hand lacking the spirit to die stinging him the rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales the beekeeper closes the hive chalks a mark on it and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean 
 so in the same way moscow was empty when napoleon weary uneasy and morose paced up and down in front of the rampart awaiting what to his mind was a necessary if but formal observance of the proprieties a deputation 
 in various corners of moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly moving about following their old habits and hardly aware of what they were doing 
 when with due circumspection napoleon was informed that moscow was empty he looked angrily at his informant turned away and silently continued to walk to and fro 
 my carriage he said 
 he took his seat beside the on duty and drove into the suburb moscow deserted he said to himself what an incredible event 
 he did not drive into the town but put up at an inn in the dorogomilov suburb 
 the coup de theatre had not come off

 of innovations 
 as the births of living creatures at first are ill shapen so are all innovations 
 which are the births of time yet notwithstanding as those that first bring honour 
 into their family are commonly more worthy than most that succeed so the first 
 precedent if it be good is seldom attained by mutation 
 for ill to nature as it stands perverted hath a natural motion strongest in continuance but good as a forced motion strongest at first surely every medicine is an innovation and he that will not apply new remedies must expect new evils for time is the greatest innovator and if time of course alter things to the worse and wisdom and counsel shall not alter them to the better what shall be the end it is true that what is settled by custom though it be not good yet at least it is fit and those things which have long gone together are as it were confederate within themselves whereas new things piece not so well but though they help by their utility yet they trouble by their inconformity besides they are like strangers more admired and less favoured 
 all this is true if time stood still which contrariwise moveth so round 
 that a froward retention of custom is as turbulent a thing as an innovation 
 and they that reverence too much old times are but a scorn to the new it were good therefore that men in their innovations would follow the example of time itself which indeed innovated greatly but quietly and by degrees scarce to be perceived for otherwise whatsoever is new is unlocked for and ever it mends some and pairs other and he that is holpen takes it for a fortune and thanks the time and he that is hurt for a wrong and imputeth it to the author it is good also not to try experiments in states except me necessity be urgent or the utility evident and well to beware that it be the reformation that draweth on the change and not the desire of change that pretendeth the reformation and lastly that the novelty though it be not rejected yet be held for a suspect and as the scripture saith that we make a stand upon the ancient way and then look about us and discover what is the straight and right way and so to walk in it

 new troubles 
 when the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys when jean valjean heard in his ear the strange words thou art free the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented a ray of vivid light a ray of the true light of the living suddenly penetrated within him but it was not long before this ray paled 
 jean valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty 
 he had believed in a new life he very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided 
 and this was encompassed with much bitterness 
 he had calculated that his earnings during his sojourn in the galleys ought to amount to a hundred and francs 
 it is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of sundays and festival days during nineteen years which entailed a diminution of about eighty francs 
 at all events his hoard had been reduced by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous which had been counted out to him on his departure he had understood nothing of this and had thought himself wronged let us say the 
 on the day following his liberation he saw at grasse in front of an distillery some men engaged in unloading bales he offered his services 
 business was pressing they were accepted he set to work 
 he was intelligent robust adroit he did his best the master seemed pleased 
 while he was at work a gendarme passed observed him and demanded his papers 
 it was necessary to show him the yellow passport 
 that done jean valjean resumed his labor a little while before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they earned each day at this occupation he had been told thirty sous 
 when evening arrived as he was forced to set out again on the following day he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be paid 
 the owner did not utter a word but handed him fifteen sous 
 he objected he was told that is enough for thee 
 he persisted 
 the master looked him straight between the eyes and said to him beware of the prison 
 there again he considered that he had been robbed 
 society the state by diminishing his hoard had robbed him wholesale now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail 
 liberation is not deliverance 
 one gets free from the galleys but not from the sentence 
 that is what happened to him at grasse 
 we have seen in what manner he was received at d

 the empire strikes back 
 x 
 
 the avenger had spotted the millennium falcon the moment the freighter shot out ofthe enormous asteroid 
 from that moment the imperial ship renewed its pursuit of the freighter with ablinding barrage of fire undaunted by the steady rain of asteroids on its massivehull the star destroyer relentlessly followed the smaller ship 
 the millennium falcon far more maneuverable than the other ship dartedaround the larger asteroids as they came rocketing toward it the falcon wassucceeding in holding its lead in front of the avenger but it was clear that the steadilypursuing ship was not about to abandon the chase 
 suddenly a gigantic asteroid appeared in the millennium path rushingtoward the freighter at incredible speed the ship quickly banked out of the the asteroid hurtled past it only to explode harmlessly against the hull 
 han solo glimpsed the flare through the front window of his the craft that followed them seemed absolutely invulnerable but he had notime to reflect on the differences between the ships it took everything in his powerto maintain control of the falcon as it was pelted by imperial cannon fire 
 princess leia tensely watched the asteroids and cannon fire flaring in theblackness of space outside the cockpit windows her fingers had tightened on thearms of her chair silently she hoped against hope that they would emerge from thischase alive 
 carefully following the bleeping images on a tracking scope to han i can see the edge of the asteroid field sir he reported 
 good han replied soon as clear kick this baby intohyperdrive he was confident that within moments the pursuing star destroyerwould be left behind the repairs in the systemhad been completed and there was nothing left to do now but get the ship free of theasteroid field and into space where it could blast away to safety 
 there was an excited wookiee bark as chewbacca looking out a cockpit that the asteroid density was already decreasing but their escape could not yetbe completed for the avenger was closing in and the bolts from its laser cannonsbombarded the falcon making it lurch and carom to one side 
 han rapidly adjusted the controls and brought his ship back on an even in the next instant the falcon zoomed out of the asteroid field and entered thepeaceful silence of deep space chewbacca whined joyful that theywere at last out of the deadly eager to leave the star destroyer far behind 
 with you chewie han responded vacate the area stand by this time they get the surprise hang on 
 everyone braced himself as han pulled back on the throttle but itwas the crew of the millennium falcon and mostly the captain himself that got thesurprise as once again 
 nothing happened 
 nothing 
 han frantically pulled back the throttle again 
 the ship maintained its sublight speed 
 this fair he exclaimed beginning to panic 
 chewbacca was furious it was rare that he lost his temper with his friend andcaptain but now he was exasperated and roared his fury in angry wookiee growlsand barks 
 be han replied defensively as he looked at his computer screens andquickly noted their readings i checked the transfer circuits 
 chewbacca barked again 
 i tell you this time not my fault sure i checked it 
 leia sighed deeply no in a tone that indicated she had expectedthis catastrophe too 
 sir interjected lost the rear deflector shield one moredirect hit on the back quarter and done for 
 well leia said as she glared at the captain of the millennium falcon whatnow 
 han realized he had only one choice there was no time to plan or to checkcomputer readouts not with the avenger already out of the asteroid field and rapidlygaining on them he had to make a decision based on instinct and hope theyreally had no alternative sharp bank chewie he ordered and pulled back a lever as he looked at his turn this bucket around 
 not even chewbacca could fathom what han had in mind he barked he heard the order quite right 
 you heard me han yelled turn around full power front shield thistime there was no mistaking his command and though chewbacca the suicidal maneuver he obeyed 
 the princess was flabbergasted going to attack them she stammeredin disbelief there a chance of survival now she thought was it possiblethat han really was crazy 
 threepio after running some calculation through his computer brain turned tohan solo sir if i might point out the odds of surviving a direct assault on animperial star destroyer are 
 chewbacca snarled at the golden droid and the immediately shut up no oneon board really wanted to hear the statistics especially since the falcon was alreadybanking into a steep turn to begin its course into the erupting storm of imperialcannon fire 
 solo concentrated intently on his flying it was all he could do to avoid thebarrage of flak bursts rocketing toward the falcon from the imperial ship thefreighter bobbed and weaved as han still heading directly for the star to avoid the bolts 
 no one on his tiny ship had the slightest idea what his plan might be 
 coming in too low the imperial deck officer shouted though he scarcelybelieved what he was seeing 
 captain needa and the star destroyer crew rushed the to bridge towatch the suicidal approach of the millennium falcon while alarms blared all overthe vast imperial ship a small freighter could not do much damage if it collidedagainst a star hull but if it smashed through the bridge windows thecontrol deck would be littered with corpses 
 the panicked tracking officer reported his sighting going to collide 
 shields up captain needa asked he must be insane 
 look out the deck officer yelled 
 the falcon was headed straight for the bridge window and the avenger crew andofficers fell to the floor in terror but at the last instant the freighter veered upsharply then 
 captain needa and his men slowly lifted their head all they saw outside thebridge windows was a peaceful ocean of stars 
 track them captain needa ordered they may come around for anotherpass 
 the tracking officer attempted to find the freighter on his scopes but there wasnothing to find 
 strange he muttered 
 what is it needa asked walking over to look at the tracking monitors forhimself 
 the ship appear on any of our scopes 
 the captain was perplexed it have disappeared could a ship thatsmall have a cloaking device 
 no sir the deck officer answered maybe they went into at thelast minute 
 captain needa felt his anger mounting at about the same rate as hisbefuddlement then why did they attack they could have gone into hyperspacewhen they cleared the asteroid field 
 well no trace of them sir no matter how they did it the trackingofficer replied still unable to locate the millennium falcon on his viewers theonly logical explanation is that they went into 
 the captain was staggered how had that crate of a ship eluded him 
 an aide approached sir lord vader demands an update on the pursuit hereported what should he be told 
 needa braced himself letting the millennium falcon get away when it was soclose was an unforgivable error and he knew he had to face vader and report hisfailure he felt resigned to whatever punishment waited in store for him 
 i am responsible for this he said get the shuttle ready when werendezvous with lord vader i will apologize to him myself turn around and scanthe area one more time 
 then like a living behemoth the great avenger slowly began to turn but therewas still no sign of the millennium falcon 
 the two glowing balls hovered like alien fireflies above body lyingmotionless in the mud standing protectively next to his fallen master a droid periodically extended a mechanical appendage to swat at thedancing objects as if they were mosquitoes but the hovering balls of light leapedjust out of the reach 
 leaned over inert body and whistled in an effort to revivehim but luke stunned unconscious by the charges of these energy balls did notrespond the robot turned to yoda who was sitting calmly on a tree stump andangrily began to beep and scold the little jedi master 
 getting no sympathy from him artoo turned back to luke his electroniccircuits told him there was no use trying to wake luke with his little noises anemergency rescue system was activated within his metal hull and artoo extended asmall metal electrode and rested it on chest uttering a quiet beep of generated a mild electrical charge just strong enough to jolt luke back toconsciousness the chest heaved and he awoke with a start 
 looking dazed the young jedi student shook his head clear he looked aroundhim rubbing his shoulders to ease the ache from seeker balls the seekers still suspended over him luke scowled then he heard yodachucking merrily nearby and turned his glare on him 
 concentration heh yoda laughed his lined face creased with 
 luke was in no mood to return his smile i though those seekers were set forstun he exclaimed angrily 
 that they are the amused yoda answered 
 a lot stronger than used to shoulder ached painfully 
 that would not matter were the force flowing through you yoda jump faster move he exclaimed open yourself to theforce you must 
 the youth was beginning to feel exasperated with his arduous training althoughhe had only been at it a short time he had felt very close to knowing so many times he had failed and had realized how very far away it wasfrom him still but now goading words made him spring to his feet hewas tired of waiting so long for this power weary at his lack of success andincreasingly infuriated by cryptic teachings 
 luke grabbed his laser sword from the mud and quickly ignited it 
 terrified scurried away to safety 
 open to it now luke shouted i feel it come on you little flyingblaster with fire in his eyes luke poised his weapon and moved toward theseekers immediately they zipped away and retreated to hover over yoda 
 no no the jedi master scolded shaking his hoary head this will not is what you feel 
 but i feel the force luke protested vehemently 
 anger anger fear aggression yoda warned the dark side of the force arethey easily they flowquick to join in a fight beware beware beware of heavy price is paid for the power they bring 
 luke lowered his sword and stared at yoda in confusion price he do you mean 
 the dark side beckons yoda said dramatically but if once start you downthe dark path forever will it dominate your destiny consume you it willas it apprentice 
 luke nodded he knew who yoda meant lord vader he said after hethought for a moment luke asked is the dark side stronger 
 no no easier quicker more seductive 
 but how am i to know the good side from the bad he asked puzzled 
 you will know yoda answered when you are at peacecalm passive ajedi uses the force for knowledge never for attack 
 but tell me why luke began 
 no there is no why nothing more will i tell you clear your mind ofquestions quiet now peace voice trailed off but his words had ahypnotic effect on luke the young student stopped protesting and began to feelpeaceful his body and mind relaxing 
 yes yoda murmured calm 
 slowly eyes closed as he let his mind clear of distracting thoughts 
 passive 
 luke heard soothing voice as it entered the receptive darkness of hismind he willed himself to travel along with the words to wherever theymight lead 
 let yourself go 
 when yoda perceived that luke was as relaxed as the young student could be atthis stage he made the tiniest of gestures as he did the two seeker balls above hishead shot toward luke firing stun bolts as they moved 
 in that instant luke sprang to life and ignited his laser sword he leaped to hisfeet and with pure concentration began deflecting the bolts as they spun toward he faced the attack and moved and dodged with extreme grace his leapsinto the air as he jumped to meet the bolts were higher than any he had achievedbefore luke wasted not a single motion as he concentrated only on every bolt as itsped his way 
 then as suddenly as it had begun the seeker attack was over the glowingballs returned to hover on either side of their head 
 the observer let out an electronic sigh and shook hismetal 
 grinning proudly luke looked toward yoda 
 much progress do you make young one the jedi master do you grow but the little instructor would not compliment him morethan that 
 luke was full of pride at his marvelous achievement he watched waiting for further praise from him but yoda did not move or sat then two more seeker balls floated up behind him and moved intoformation with the first two 
 luke grin began to melt away 
 a pair of stormtroopers lifted captain lifeless form fromthe floor of darth imperial star destroyer 
 needa had known that death was the likely consequence of his failure to capturethe millennium falcon he had known too that he had to report the situation tovader and make his formal apology but there was no mercy for failure among theimperial military and vader in disgust had signaled for the death 
 the dark lord turned and admiral piett and two of his captains came to reporttheir findings lord vader piett said our ships have completed their scan of thearea and found nothing the millennium falcon definitely went into probably somewhere on the other side of the galaxy by now 
 vader hissed through his breath mask alert all commands he every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disbursethe fleet to search for them fail me again admiral had quite enough 
 admiral piett thought of the captain whom he had just seen carriedout of the room like a sack of grin and he remembered the excruciating demise ofadmiral ozzel yes my lord he answered trying to hide his fear findthem 
 then the admiral turned to an aide deploy the fleet he instructed as theaide moved to carry out his orders a shadow of worry crossed the was not at all certain that his luck would be any better than that of ozzel or needa 
 lord imperial star destroyer regally moved off into space itsprotecting fleet of smaller craft hovered nearby as the imperial armada left the stardestroyer avenger behind 
 no one on the avenger or in entire fleet had any idea how near they wereto their prey as the avenger glided off into space to continue its search it carriedwith it clinging unnoticed to one side of the huge bridge tower a millennium falcon 
 inside the cockpit all was quiet han solo had stopped his ship andshut down all systems so quickly that even the customarily talkative silent the stood not moving a rivet a look of wonder frozen on his goldenface 
 you could have warned him before you shut him off princess leia at the droid that stood motionless like a bronzed statue 
 oh so sorry han said in mock concern mean to offend your think braking and shutting everything down in that amount of time is easy 
 leia was dubious about entire strategy still not sure what 
 he shrugged off her doubt find out soon enough he thought there any other choice he turned to his copilot chewie check the manualrelease on the landing claws 
 the wookiee barked then pulled himself out of his chair and moved toward therear of the ship 
 leia watched as chewbacca proceeded to disengage the landing claws so that theship could take off without mechanical delay 
 shaking her head incredulously she turned to han what do you have in mindfor your next move 
 the fleet is finally breaking up he answered as he pointed out a port hoping they follow standard imperial procedure and dump their garbage beforethey go into 
 the princess reflected on this strategy for a moment and then began to crazy man might know what he was doing after all impressed she patted himon the head not bad hot shot not bad then what then han said we have to find a safe port around here got any ideas 
 that depends where are we 
 here han said pointing to a configuration of small light points near theanoat system 
 slipping out of her chair leia moved next to him for a better look at the screen 
 funny han said after thinking for a moment i have the feeling been inthis area before let me check my logs 
 you keep logs leia was more impressed by the minute my howorganized she teased 
 well sometimes he answered as he hunted through the computer i knew it this should be interesting 
 i never heard of that system said leia 
 not a system a man lando calrissian a gambler con scoundrel he paused long enough for the last word to sink in and gavethe princess a wink your kind of guy the bespin system a fair distancebut reachable 
 leia looked at one of the computer monitor screens and read the data amining colony she noted 
 a tibanna gas mine han added lando won it in a sabacc match or so heclaims lando and i go way back 
 can you trust him leia asked 
 no but he has no love for the empire that much i know 
 the wookiee barked over the intercom 
 quickly responding han flicked some switches to bring new information to thecomputer screens and then stretched to look out the cockpit window i see i see it he said prepare the manual release then turning to theprincess han said here goes nothing sweetheart he leaned back in his chair andsmiled invitingly at her 
 leia shook her head then grinned shyly and gave him a quick kiss you dohave your moments she reluctantly admitted not many but you have them 
 han was getting used to the compliments and he that he really minded them more and more he was enjoying the fact that sheshared his own sarcastic sense of humor and he was fairly sure that she wasenjoying it too 
 let er go chewie he shouted gleefully 
 the hatch on the underbelly of the avenger yawned open and as the imperialgalactic cruiser zoomed into hyperspace it spewed out its own belt of and sections of irreparable machinery that scattered out into theblack void of space hidden among that trail of refuse the millennium falcontumbled undetected off the side of the larger ship and was left far behind as theavenger streaked away 
 safe at last han solo thought 
 the millennium falcon ignited its ion engines and raced off through the train ofdrifting space junk toward another system 
 but concealed among that scattered debris was another ship 
 and as the falcon roared off to seek the bespin system this other ship ignited itsown engines boba fett the most notorious and dreaded bounty hunter in the his small craft slave to begin its pursuit for bobafett had no intention of losing sight of the millennium falcon its pilot had too higha price on his head and this was one reward that the fearsome bounty hunter wasquite determined to collect 
 luke felt that he was definitely progressing 
 he ran through the yoda perched on his leaped withgazellelike grace over the profusion of foliage and tree roots growing throughout thebog 
 luke had at last begun to detach himself from the emotion of pride he feltunburdened and was finally open to experience fully the flow of the force 
 when his diminutive threw a sliver bar above head the young jedistudent reacted instantly in a flash he turned to slice the bar into four shinysegments before it fell to the ground 
 yoda was pleased and smiled at accomplishment four this force you feel 
 but luke was suddenly distracted he sensed something dangerous somethingevil not right he said to yoda i feel dangerdeath 
 he looked around him trying to see what it was that emitted so powerful an he turned he saw a huge tangled tree it blackened bark dry and crumbling thebase of the tree was surrounded by a small pond of water where the gigantic roots hadgrown to form the opening to a darkly sinister cave 
 luke gently lifted yoda from his neck and set him on the ground jedi student stared at the dark monstrosity breathing hard he found himselfunable to speak 
 you brought me here purposely luke said at last 
 yoda sat on a tangled root and put his gimer stick in his mouth calmlylooking at luke he said nothing 
 luke shivered i feel cold he said still gazing at the tree 
 this tree is strong with the dark side of the force a servant of evil it it you must go 
 luke felt a tremor of apprehension in there 
 only what you take with you yoda said cryptically 
 luke looked warily at yoda and then at the tree he silently resolved to takehis courage his willingness to learn and step within that darkness to face whatever itwas that awaited him he would take nothing more than 
 no he would also bring his lightsaber 
 lighting his weapon luke stepped through the shallow waters of the pond andtoward the dark opening between those great and foreboding roots 
 but the jedi voice stopped him 
 your weapon yoda reproved you need it 
 luke paused and looked again at the tree go into that evil cave completelyunarmed as skilled as luke was becoming he did not feel quite equal to that gripped his saber tighter and shook his head 
 yoda shrugged and placidly gnawed his gimer stick 
 taking a deep breath luke cautiously stepped into the grotesque tree cave 
 the dark inside the cave was so thick that luke could feel it against his skin soblack that the light thrown by his laser sword was quickly absorbed and illuminatedscarcely more than a meter in front of him as he slowly moved forward things brushed against his face and the moisture from the soggy cave floorbegan to seep into his boots 
 as he pushed through the blackness his eyes began to grow accustomed to thedark he saw a corridor before him but as he moved toward it he was surprised bya thick sticky membrane that completely enveloped him like the web of somegigantic spider the mass clung tightly to body thrashing at it with hislightsaber luke finally managed to disentangle himself and clear a path ahead 
 he held his glowing sword in front of him and noticed an object on the cave his lightsaber downward luke illuminated a black shiny beetle the size ofhis hand in an instant the thing scurried up the slimy wall to join a cluster of itsmate 
 luke caught his breath and stepped back at that moment he consideredhunting for the he braced himself and ventured still deeper into the darkchamber 
 he felt the space about him widen as he moved forward using his lightsaber as adim beacon he strained to see in the darkness trying his best to hear but therewas no sound at all nothing 
 then a very loud hiss 
 the sound was familiar he froze where he stood he had heard that hisseven in his nightmares it was the labored breath of a thing that had once been a man 
 out of the darkness a light blue flame of a laser its illumination luke saw the looming figure of darth vader raised his lightedweapon to attack and then lunge 
 prepared by his disciplined jedi training luke was ready he raised his ownlightsaber and perfectly sidestepped attack in the same movement luketurned to vader and with his mind and body completely focused the youthsummoned the force feeling its power within him luke raised his laser weaponand brought it crashing down on head 
 with one powerful stroke the dark head was severed from his and helmet crashed to the ground and rolled about the cave floor with a loudmetallic bang as luke watched in astonishment body was completelyswallowed up by the darkness then luke looked down at the helmet that had cometo rest directly in front of him for a moment it was completely still then thehelmet cracked in half and split open 
 as luke watched in shocked disbelief the broken helmet fell aside to reveal notthe unknown imagined face of darth vader but own face looking up at him 
 he gasped horrified at the sight and then as suddenly as it had appeared thedecapitated head faded away as if in a ghostly vision 
 luke stared at the dark space where the head and pieces of helmet had lain hismind reeled the emotions that raged inside of him were almost too much to bear 
 the tree he told himself it was all some trick of this ugly cave somecharade of arranged because he had come into the tree carrying a weapon 
 he wondered if he were really fighting himself or if he had fallen prey to thetemptations of the dark side of the force he might himself become a figure as evilas darth vader and he wondered if there might be some even darker meaningbehind the unsettling vision 
 it was a long while before luke skywalker was able to move from that cave 
 meanwhile sitting on the root the little jedi master calmly gnawed his gimerstick

 book one 
 chapter xxiv 
 
 there was now no one in the reception room except prince vasili and the eldest princess who were sitting under the portrait of catherine the great and talking eagerly as soon as they saw pierre and his companion they became silent and pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered 
 i bear the sight of that woman 
 catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room said prince vasili to anna mikhaylovna go and take something my poor anna mikhaylovna or you will not hold out 
 to pierre he said nothing merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder pierre went with anna mikhaylovna into the small drawing room 
 there is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious russian tea lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room around the table all who were at count house that night had gathered to fortify themselves pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables during balls given at the house pierre who did not know how to dance had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles on one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there not merrymaking but somberly whispering and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked to he looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left prince vasili and the eldest princess pierre concluded that this also was essential and after a short interval followed her anna mikhaylovna was standing beside the princess and they were both speaking in excited whispers 
 permit me princess to know what is necessary and what is not necessary said the younger of the two speakers evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room 
 but my dear princess answered anna mikhaylovna blandly but impressively blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing this be too much for poor uncle at a moment when he needs repose worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared 
 prince vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude with one leg crossed high above the other his cheeks which were so flabby that they looked heavier below were twitching violently but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying 
 come my dear anna mikhaylovna let catiche do as she pleases you know how fond the count is of her 
 i even know what is in this paper said the younger of the two ladies addressing prince vasili and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand all i know is that his real will is in his writing table and this is a paper he has forgotten 
 she tried to pass anna mikhaylovna but the latter sprang so as to bar her path 
 i know my dear kind princess said anna mikhaylovna seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily dear princess i beg and implore you have some pity on him je vous en conjure 
 the princess did not reply their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible but it was evident that if the princess did speak her words would not be flattering to anna mikhaylovna though the latter held on tenaciously her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness 
 pierre my dear come here i think he will not be out of place in a family consultation is it not so prince 
 why you speak cousin suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere making a scene on the very threshold of a dying room intriguer she hissed viciously and tugged with all her might at the portfolio 
 but anna mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio and changed her grip 
 prince vasili rose oh said he with reproach and surprise this is absurd come let go i tell you 
 the princess let go 
 and you too 
 but anna mikhaylovna did not obey him 
 let go i tell you i will take the responsibility i myself will go and ask him i does that satisfy you 
 but prince said anna mikhaylovna after such a solemn sacrament allow him a peace here pierre tell them your opinion said she turning to the young man who having come quite close was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity and at the twitching cheeks of prince vasili 
 remember that you will answer for the consequences said prince vasili severely you know what you are doing 
 vile woman shouted the princess darting unexpectedly at anna mikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from her 
 prince vasili bent his head and spread out his hands 
 at this moment that terrible door which pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly burst noisily open and banged against the wall and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands 
 what are you doing she cried vehemently he is dying and you leave me alone with him 
 her sister dropped the portfolio anna mikhaylovna stooping quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom the eldest princess and prince vasili recovering themselves followed her a few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face again biting her underlip at sight of pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred 
 yes now you may be glad said she this is what you have been waiting for and bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room 
 prince vasili came next he staggered to the sofa on which pierre was sitting and dropped onto it covering his face with his hand pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an ague 
 ah my friend said he taking pierre by the elbow and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in it before how often we sin how much we deceive and all for what i am near sixty dear friend i too all will end in death all death is awful and he burst into tears 
 anna mikhaylovna came out last she approached pierre with slow quiet steps 
 pierre she said 
 pierre gave her an inquiring look she kissed the young man on his forehead wetting him with her tears then after a pause she said 
 he is no more 
 pierre looked at her over his spectacles 
 come i will go with you try to weep nothing gives such relief as tears 
 she led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one could see his face anna mikhaylovna left him and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm 
 in the morning anna mikhaylovna said to pierre 
 yes my dear this is a great loss for us all not to speak of you but god will support you you are young and are now i hope in command of an immense fortune the will has not yet been opened i know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head but it imposes duties on you and you must be a man 
 pierre was silent 
 perhaps later on i may tell you my dear boy that if i had not been there god only knows what would have happened you know uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget boris but he had no time i hope my dear friend you will carry out your wish 
 pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at princess anna mikhaylovna after her talk with pierre anna mikhaylovna returned to the rostovs and went to bed on waking in the morning she told the rostovs and all her acquaintances the details of count death she said the count had died as she would herself wish to die that his end was not only touching but edifying as to the last meeting between father and son it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears and did not know which had behaved better during those awful moments the father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son or pierre whom it had been pitiful to see so stricken was he with grief though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father it is painful but it does one good it uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son said she of the behavior of the eldest princess and prince vasili she spoke disapprovingly but in whispers and as a great secret

 chapter 
 
 at the close of three weeks i was able to quit my chamber and move about the house and on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening i asked catherine to read to me because my eyes were weak we were in the library the master having gone to bed she consented rather unwillingly i fancied and imagining my sort of books did not suit her i bid her place herself in the choice of what she perused she selected one of her own favourites and got forward steadily about an hour then came frequent questions 
 ellen are not you tired you better lie down now be sick keeping up so long ellen 
 no no dear not tired i returned continually 
 perceiving me immovable she essayed another method of showing her disrelish for her occupation it changed to yawning and stretching and 
 ellen tired 
 give over then and talk i answered 
 that was worse she fretted and sighed and liked at her watch till eight and finally went to her room completely overdone with sleep judging by her peevish heavy look and the constant rubbing she inflicted on her eyes the following night she seemed more impatient still and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache and left me i thought her conduct odd and having remained alone a long while i resolved on going and inquiring whether she were better and asking her to come and lie on the sofa instead of upstairs in the dark no catherine could i discover upstairs and none below the servants affirmed they had not seen her i listened at mr door all was silence i returned to her apartment extinguished my candle and seated myself in the window 
 the moon shone bright a sprinkling of snow covered the ground and i reflected that she might possibly have taken it into her head to walk about the garden for refreshment i did detect a figure creeping along the inner fence of the park but it was not my young mistress on its emerging into the light i recognized one of the grooms he stood a considerable period viewing the through the grounds then started off at a brisk pace as if he had detected something and reappeared presently leading pony and there she was just dismounted and walking by its side the man took his charge stealthily across the grass towards the stable cathy entered by the casement window of the and glided noiselessly up to where i awaited her she put the door gently to slipped off her snowy shoes untied her hat and was proceeding unconscious of my espionage to lay aside her mantle when i suddenly rose and revealed myself the surprise petrified her an instant she uttered an inarticulate exclamation and stood fixed 
 my dear miss catherine i began too vividly impressed by her recent kindness to break into a scold where have you been riding out at this hour and why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale where have you been speak 
 to the bottom of the park she stammered i tell a tale 
 and nowhere else i demanded 
 no was the muttered reply 
 oh catherine i cried sorrowfully you know you have been doing wrong or you be driven to uttering an untruth to me that does grieve me rather be three months ill than hear you frame a deliberate lie 
 she sprang forward and bursting into tears threw her arms round my neck 
 well ellen so afraid of you being angry she said promise not to be angry and you shall know the very truth i hate to hide it 
 we sat down in the i assured her i would not scold whatever her secret might be and i guessed it of course so she commenced 
 been to wuthering heights ellen and never missed going a day since you fell ill except thrice before and twice after you left your room i gave michael books and pictures to prepare minny every evening and to put her back in the stable you scold him either mind i was at the heights by six and generally stayed till half past eight and then galloped home it was not to amuse myself that i went i was often wretched all the time now and then i was happy once in a week perhaps at first i expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to linton for i had engaged to call again next day when we quitted him but as you stayed upstairs on the morrow i escaped that trouble and while michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon i got possession of the key and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him because he was sick and come to the grange and how papa would object to my going and then i negotiated with him about the pony he is fond of reading and he thinks of leaving soon to get married so he offered if i would lend him books out of the library to do what i wished but i preferred giving him my own and that satisfied him better 
 on my second visit linton seemed in lively spirits and zillah that is their housekeeper made us a clean room and a good fire and told us that as joseph was out at a prayer meeting and hareton earnshaw was off with his our woods of pheasants as i heard might do what we liked she brought me some warm wine and gingerbread and appeared exceedingly and linton sat in the armchair and i in the little on the hearthstone and we laughed and talked so merrily and found so much to say we planned where we would go and what we would do in summer i repeat that because you would call it silly 
 one time however we were near quarrelling he said the pleasantest manner of spending a hot july day was lying from morning till evening on a bank of heath in the middle of the moors with the bees humming dreamily about among the bloom and the larks singing high up overhead and the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly that was his most perfect idea of happiness mine was rocking in a rustling green tree with a west wind blowing and bright white clouds flitting rapidly above and not only larks but throstles and blackbirds and linnets and cuckoos pouring out music on every side and the moors seen at a distance broken into cool dusky dells but close by great swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze and woods and sounding water and the whole world awake and wild with joy he wanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace i wanted all to sparkle and dance in a glorious jubilee i said his heaven would be only half alive and he said mine would be drunk i said i should fall asleep in his and he said he could not breathe in mine and began to grow very snappish at last we agreed to try both as soon as the right weather came and then we kissed each other and were friends 
 after sitting still an hour i looked at the great room with its smooth uncarpeted floor and thought how nice it would be to play in if we removed the table and i asked linton to call zillah in to help us and have a game at buff she should try to catch us you used to you know ellen he there was no pleasure in it he said but he consented to play at ball with me we found two in a cupboard among a heap of old toys tops and hoops and battledores and shuttlecocks one was marked c and the other h i wished to have the c because that stood for catherine and the h might be for heathcliff his name but the bran came out of h and linton like it i beat him constantly and he got cross again and coughed and returned to his chair that night though he easily recovered his good humour he was charmed with two or three pretty songs ellen and when i was obliged to go he begged and entreated me to come the following evening and i promised minny and i went flying home as light as air and i dreamt of wuthering heights and my sweet darling cousin till morning 
 on the morrow i was sad partly because you were poorly and partly that i wished my father knew and approved of my excursions but it was beautiful moonlight after tea and as i rode on the gloom cleared i shall have another happy evening i thought to myself and what delights me more my pretty linton will i trotted up their garden and was turning round to the back when that fellow earnshaw met me took my bridle and bid me go in by the front entrance he patted neck and said she was a bonny beast and appeared as if he wanted me to speak to him i only told him to leave my horse alone or else it would kick him he answered in his vulgar accent it do much hurt if it did and surveyed its legs with a smile i was half inclined to make it try however he moved off to open the door and as he raised the latch he looked up to the inscription above and said with a stupid mixture of awkwardness and elation 
 miss catherine i can read yon nah 
 wonderful i exclaimed pray let us hear are grown clever 
 he spelt and drawled over by syllables the earnshaw 
 and the figures i cried encouragingly perceiving that he came to a dead halt 
 i cannot tell them yet he answered 
 oh you dunce i said laughing heartily at his failure 
 the fool stared with a grin hovering about his lips and a scowl gathering over his eyes as if uncertain whether he might not join in my mirth whether it were not pleasant familiarity or what it really was contempt i settled his doubts by suddenly retrieving my gravity and desiring him to walk away for i came to see linton not him he saw that by the his hand from the latch and skulked off a picture of mortified vanity he imagined himself to be as accomplished as linton i suppose because he could spell his own name and was marvellously discomfited that i think the same 
 stop miss catherine dear i interrupted i shall not scold but i like your conduct there if you had remembered that hareton was your cousin as much as master heathcliff you would have felt how improper it was to behave in that way at least it was praiseworthy ambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as linton and probably he did not learn merely to show off you had made him ashamed of his ignorance before i have no doubt and he wished to remedy it and please you to sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding had you been brought up in his circumstances would you be less rude he was as quick and as intelligent a child as ever you were and hurt that he should be despised now because that base heathcliff has treated him so unjustly 
 well ellen you cry about it will you she exclaimed surprised at my earnestness but wait and you shall hear if he conned his a b c to please me and if it were worth while being civil to the brute i entered linton was lying on the settle and half got up to welcome me 
 ill tonight catherine love he said and you must have all the talk and let me listen come and sit by me i was sure you break your word and make you promise again before you go 
 i knew now that i tease him as he was ill and i spoke softly and put no questions and avoided irritating him in any way i had brought some of my nicest books for him he asked me to read a little of one and i was about to comply when earnshaw burst the door open having gathered venom with reflection he advanced direct to us seized linton by the arm and swung him off the seat 
 get to thy own room he said in a voice almost inarticulate with passion and his face looked swelled and furious take her there if she comes to see thee thou keep me out of this begone wi ye both 
 he swore at us and left linton no time to answer nearly throwing him into the kitchen and he clenched his fist as i followed seemingly longing to knock me down i was afraid for a moment and i let one volume fall he kicked it after me and shut us out i heard a malignant crackly laugh by the fire and turning beheld that odious joseph standing rubbing his bony hands and quivering 
 aw wer sure sarve ye eht a grand lad getten t raight sperrit in him he he knaws as weel as aw do who sud be ech ech he mad ye skift properly ech ech ech 
 where must we go i said to my cousin disregarding the old mockery 
 linton was white and trembling he was not pretty then ellen oh no he looked frightful for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into an expression of frantic powerless fury he grasped the handle of the door and shook it it was fastened inside 
 if you let me in kill you let me in kill you he rather shrieked than said devil kill kill you 
 joseph uttered his croaking laugh again 
 thear t father he cried father alias summut uh orther side in us niver heed hareton be cannot get at thee 
 i took hold of hands and tried to pull him away but he shrieked so shockingly that i dared not proceed at last his cries were choked by a dreadful fit of coughing blood gushed from his mouth and he fell on the ground i ran into the yard sick with terror and called for zillah as loud as i could she soon heard me she was milking the cows in a shed behind the barn and hurrying from her work she inquired what there was to do i breath to explain dragging her in i looked about for linton earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief he had caused and he was then conveying the poor thing upstairs zillah and i ascended after him but he stopped me at the top of the steps and said i go in i must go home i exclaimed that he had killed linton and i would enter joseph locked the door and declared i should do no sich stuff and asked me whether i were bahn to be as mad as him i stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared she affirmed he would be better in a bit but he do with that shrieking and din and she took me and nearly carried me into the house 
 ellen i was ready to tear my hair off my head i sobbed and wept so that my eyes were almost blind and the ruffian you have such sympathy with stood opposite presuming every now and then to bid me wisht and denying that it was his fault and finally frightened by my assertions that i would tell papa and that he should be put in prison and hanged he commenced blubbering himself and hurried out to hide his cowardly agitation still i was not rid of him when at length they compelled me to depart and i had got some hundred yards off the premises he suddenly issued from the shadow of the roadside and checked minny and took hold of me 
 miss catherine ill grieved he began but rayther too bad 
 i gave him a cut with my whip thinking perhaps he would murder me he let go thundering one of his horrid curses and i galloped home more than half out of my senses 
 i bid you good night that evening and i go to wuthering heights the next i wished to exceedingly but i was strangely excited and dreaded to hear that linton was dead sometimes and sometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering hareton on the third day i took courage at least i bear longer suspense and stole off once more i went at five and walked fancying i might manage to creep into the house and up to room unobserved however the dogs gave notice of my approach zillah received me and saying the lad was mending nicely showed me into a small tidy carpeted apartment where to my inexpressible joy i beheld linton laid on a little sofa reading one of my books but he would neither speak to me nor look at me through a whole hour ellen he has such an unhappy temper and what quite confounded me when he did open his mouth it was to utter the falsehood that i had occasioned the uproar and hareton was not to blame unable to reply except passionately i got up and walked from the room he sent after me a faint catherine he did not reckon on being answered so but i turn back and the morrow was the second day on which i stayed at home nearly determined to visit him no more but it was so miserable going to bed and getting up and never hearing anything about him that my resolution melted into air before it was properly formed it had appeared wrong to take the journey once now it seemed wrong to refrain michael came to ask if he must saddle minny i said yes and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the hills i was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court it was no use trying to conceal my presence 
 young master is in the house said zillah as she saw me making for the parlour i went in earnshaw was there also but he quitted the room directly linton sat in the great armchair half asleep walking up to the fire i began in a serious tone partly meaning it to be true 
 as you like me linton and as you think i come on purpose to hurt you and pretend that i do so every time this is our last meeting let us say goodbye and tell mr heathcliff that you have no wish to see me and that he invent any more falsehoods on the subject 
 sit down and take your hat off catherine he answered you are so much happier than i am you ought to be better papa talks enough of my defects and shows enough scorn of me to make it natural i should doubt myself i doubt whether i am not altogether as worthless as he calls me frequently and then i feel so cross and bitter i hate everybody i am worthless and bad in temper and bad in spirit almost always and if you choose you may say goodbye get rid of an annoyance only catherine do me this justice believe that if i might be as sweet and as kind and as good as you are i would be as willingly and more so than as happy and as healthy and believe that your kindness has made me love you deeper than if i deserved your love and though i and cannot help showing my nature to you i regret it and repent it and shall regret and repent it till i die 
 i felt he spoke the truth and i felt i must forgive him and though he should quarrel the next moment i must forgive him again we were reconciled but we cried both of us the whole time i stayed not entirely for sorrow yet i was sorry linton had that distorted nature never let his friends be at ease and never be at ease himself i have always gone to his little parlour since that night because his father returned the day after 
 about three times i think we have been merry and hopeful as we were the first evening the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled now with his selfishness and spite and now with his sufferings but learned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the latter mr heathcliff purposely avoids me 
 i have hardly seen him at all last sunday indeed coming earlier than usual i heard him abusing poor linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before i tell how he knew of it unless he listened linton had certainly behaved provokingly however it was the business of nobody but me and i interrupted mr lecture by entering and telling him so he burst into a laugh and went away saying he was glad i took that view of the matter since then told linton he must whisper his bitter things now ellen you have heard all and i be prevented from going to wuthering heights except by inflicting misery on two people whereas if only not tell papa my going need disturb the tranquillity of none not tell will you it will be very heartless if you do 
 make up my mind on that point by tomorrow miss catherine i replied it requires some study and so leave you to your rest and go think it over 
 i thought it over aloud in my presence walking straight from her room to his and relating the whole story with the exception of her conversations with her cousin and any mention of hareton mr linton was alarmed and distressed more than he would acknowledge to me in the morning catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence and she learnt also that her secret visits were to end in vain she wept and writhed against the interdict and implored her father to have pity on linton all she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him leave to come to the grange when he pleased but explaining that he must no longer expect to see catherine at wuthering heights perhaps had he been aware of his disposition and state of health he would have seen fit to withhold even that slight consolation

 chapter 
 
 in order that we may start afresh and go to wedding with free minds it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the marches and here let me premise that if any of the elders think there is too much lovering in the story as i fear they may not afraid the young folks will make that objection i can only say with mrs march what can you expect when i have four gay girls in the house and a dashing young neighbor over the way 
 the three years that have passed have brought but few changes to the quiet family the war is over and mr march safely at home busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace a quiet studious man rich in the wisdom that is better than learning the charity which calls all mankind brother the piety that blossoms into character making it august and lovely 
 these attributes in spite of poverty and the strict integrity which shut him out from the more worldly successes attracted to him many admirable persons as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of hard experience had distilled no bitter drop earnest young men found the scholar as young at heart as they thoughtful or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts to him sure of finding the gentlest sympathy the wisest counsel sinners told their sins to the old man and were both rebuked and saved gifted men found a companion in him ambitious men caught glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own and even worldlings confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true although they pay 
 to outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house and so they did in many things but the quiet scholar sitting among his books was still the head of the family the household conscience anchor and comforter for to him the busy anxious women always turned in troublous times finding him in the truest sense of those sacred words husband and father 
 the girls gave their hearts into their keeping their souls into their and to both parents who lived and labored so faithfully for them they gave a love that grew with their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death 
 mrs march is as brisk and cheery though rather grayer than when we saw her last and just now so absorbed in affairs that the hospitals and homes still full of wounded boys and soldiers widows decidedly miss the motherly visits 
 john brooke did his duty manfully for a year got wounded was sent home and not allowed to return he received no stars or bars but he deserved them for he cheerfully risked all he had and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom perfectly resigned to his discharge he devoted himself to getting well preparing for business and earning a home for meg with the good sense and sturdy independence that characterized him he refused mr more generous offers and accepted the place of bookkeeper feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned salary than by running any risks with borrowed money 
 meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting growing womanly in character wise in housewifely arts and prettier than ever for love is a great beautifier she had her girlish ambitions and hopes and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which the new life must begin ned moffat had just married sallie gardiner and meg help contrasting their fine house and carriage many gifts and splendid outfit with her own and secretly wishing she could have the same but somehow envy and discontent soon vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor john had put into the little home awaiting her and when they sat together in the twilight talking over their small plans the future always grew so beautiful and bright that she forgot splendor and felt herself the richest happiest girl in christendom 
 jo never went back to aunt march for the old lady took such a fancy to amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going and for the sake of this advantage amy would have served a far harder mistress so she gave her mornings to duty her afternoons to pleasure and prospered finely jo meantime devoted herself to literature and beth who remained delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past not an invalid exactly but never again the rosy healthy creature she had been yet always hopeful happy and serene and busy with the quiet duties she loved friend and an angel in the house long before those who loved her most had learned to know it 
 as long as the spread eagle paid her a dollar a column for her rubbish as she called it jo felt herself a woman of means and spun her little romances diligently but great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript which was one day to place the name of march upon the roll of fame 
 laurie having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner to please himself a universal favorite thanks to money manners much talent and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into scrapes by trying to get other people out of them he stood in great danger of being spoiled and probably would have been like many another promising boy if he had not possessed a talisman against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in his success the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were her son and last but not least by any means the knowledge that four innocent girls loved admired and believed in him with all their hearts 
 being only a glorious human boy of course he frolicked and flirted grew dandified aquatic sentimental or gymnastic as college fashions ordained hazed and was hazed talked slang and more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion but as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks he always managed to save himself by frank confession honorable atonement or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection in fact he rather prided himself on his narrow escapes and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his triumphs over wrathful tutors dignified professors and vanquished enemies the men of my class were heroes in the eyes of the girls who never wearied of the exploits of our fellows and were frequently allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures when laurie brought them home with him 
 amy especially enjoyed this high honor and became quite a belle among them for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular john to care for any other lords of creation and beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how amy dared to order them about so but jo felt quite in her own element and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the gentlemanly attitudes phrases and feats which seemed more natural to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies they all liked jo immensely but never fell in love with her though very few escaped without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at shrine and speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the dovecote 
 that was the name of the little brown house mr brooke had prepared for first home laurie had christened it saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who went on together like a pair of turtledoves with first a bill and then a coo it was a tiny house with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in the front here meg meant to have a fountain shrubbery and a profusion of lovely flowers though just at present the fountain was represented by a urn very like a dilapidated slopbowl the shrubbery consisted of several young larches undecided whether to live or die and the profusion of flowers was merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted but inside it was altogether charming and the happy bride saw no fault from garret to cellar to be sure the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano for one never could have been got in whole the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china into the coalbin but once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing could be more complete for good sense and good taste had presided over the furnishing and the result was highly satisfactory there were no tables long mirrors or lace curtains in the little parlor but simple furniture plenty of books a fine picture or two a stand of flowers in the bay window and scattered all about the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought 
 i think the parian psyche laurie gave lost any of its beauty because john put up the bracket it stood upon that any upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more gracefully than artistic hand or that any was ever better provided with good wishes merry words and happy hopes than that in which jo and her mother put away few boxes barrels and bundles and i am morally certain that the spandy new kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if hannah had not arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over and laid the fire all ready for lighting the minute mis brooke came home i also doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of dusters holders and piece bags for beth made enough to last till the silver wedding came round and invented three different kinds of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china 
 people who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them and meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table was eloquent of home love and tender forethought 
 what happy times they had planning together what solemn shopping excursions what funny mistakes they made and what shouts of laughter arose over ridiculous bargains in his love of jokes this young gentleman though nearly through college was a much of a boy as ever his last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits some new useful and ingenious article for the young housekeeper now a bag of remarkable clothespins next a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at the first trial a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives or a sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt soap that took the skin off hands infallible cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the deluded buyer and every kind of tinware from a toy savings bank for odd pennies to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process 
 in vain meg begged him to stop john laughed at him and jo called him mr toodles he was possessed with a mania for patronizing yankee ingenuity and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth so each week beheld some fresh absurdity 
 everything was done at last even to arranging different colored soaps to match the different colored rooms and setting the table for the first meal 
 are you satisfied does it seem like home and do you feel as if you should be happy here asked mrs march as she and her daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever 
 yes mother perfectly satisfied thanks to you all and so happy that i talk about it with a look that was far better than words 
 if she only had a servant or two it would be all right said amy coming out of the parlor where she had been trying to decide whether the bronze mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece 
 mother and i have talked that over and i have made up my mind to try her way first there will be so little to do that with lotty to run my errands and help me here and there i shall only have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick answered meg tranquilly 
 sallie moffat has four began amy 
 if meg had four the house hold them and master and missis would have to camp in the garden broke in jo who enveloped in a big blue pinafore was giving the last polish to the door handles 
 sallie a poor wife and many maids are in keeping with her fine establishment meg and john begin humbly but i have a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little house as in the big one a great mistake for young girls like meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress give orders and gossip when i was first married i used to long for my new clothes to wear out or get torn so that i might have the pleasure of mending them for i got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my pocket handkerchief 
 why you go into the kitchen and make messes as sallie says she does to amuse herself though they never turn out well and the servants laugh at her said meg 
 i did after a while not to mess but to learn of hannah how things should be done that my servants need not laugh at me it was play then but there came a time when i was truly grateful that i not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food for my little girls and help myself when i could no longer afford to hire help you begin at the other end meg dear but the lessons you learn now will be of use to you when john is a richer man for the mistress of a house however splendid should know how work ought to be done if she wishes to be well and honestly served 
 yes mother sure of that said meg listening respectfully to the little lecture for the best of women will hold forth upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping do you know i like this room most of all in my baby house added meg a minute after as they went upstairs and she looked into her linen closet 
 beth was there laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves and exulting over the goodly array all three laughed as meg spoke for that linen closet was a joke you see having said that if meg married that brooke she have a cent of her money aunt march was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and made her repent her vow she never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it and at last devised a plan whereby she could satisfy herself mrs carrol mamma was ordered to buy have made and marked a generous supply of house and table linen and send it as her present all of which was faithfully done but the secret leaked out and was greatly enjoyed by the family for aunt march tried to look utterly unconscious and insisted that she could give nothing but the pearls long promised to the first bride 
 a housewifely taste which i am glad to see i had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her said mrs march patting the damask tablecloths with a truly feminine appreciation of their fineness 
 i a single finger bowl but this is a setout that will last me all my days hannah says and meg looked quite contented as well she might 
 a tall young fellow with a cropped head a felt basin of a hat and a flyaway coat came tramping down the road at a great pace walked over the low fence without stopping to open the gate straight up to mrs march with both hands out and a hearty 
 here i am mother yes all right 
 the last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed as usual with a motherly kiss 
 for mrs john brooke with the congratulations and compliments bless you beth what a refreshing spectacle you are jo amy you are getting altogether too handsome for a single lady 
 as laurie spoke he delivered a brown paper parcel to meg pilled hair ribbon stared at bib pinafore and fell into an attitude of mock rapture before amy then shook hands all round and everyone began to talk 
 where is john asked meg anxiously 
 stopped to get the license for tomorrow 
 which side won the last match teddy inquired jo who persisted in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years 
 ours of course wish been there to see 
 how is the lovely miss randal asked amy with a significant smile 
 more cruel than ever you see how pining away and laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a melodramatic sigh 
 the last joke undo the bundle and see meg said beth eying the knobby parcel with curiosity 
 a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire or thieves observed laurie as a rattle appeared amid the laughter of the girls 
 any time when john is away and you get frightened mrs meg just swing that out of the front window and it will rouse the neighborhood in a jiffy nice thing it and laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears 
 gratitude for you and speaking of gratitude reminds me to mention that you may thank hannah for saving your wedding cake from destruction i saw it going into your house as i came by and if she defended it manfully have had a pick at it for it looked like a remarkably plummy one 
 i wonder if you will ever grow up laurie said meg in a matronly tone 
 doing my best but get much higher afraid as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days responded the young gentleman whose head was about level with the little chandelier 
 i suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this bower so as tremendously hungry i propose an adjournment he added presently 
 mother and i are going to wait for john there are some last things to settle said meg bustling away 
 beth and i are going over to kitty to get more flowers for tomorrow added amy tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls and enjoying the effect as much as anybody 
 come jo desert a fellow in such a state of exhaustion i get home without help take off your apron whatever you do peculiarly becoming said laurie as jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his feeble steps 
 now teddy i want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow began jo as they strolled away together you must promise to behave well and not cut up any pranks and spoil our plans 
 not a prank 
 and say funny things when we ought to be sober 
 i never do you are the one for that 
 and i implore you not to look at me during the ceremony i shall certainly laugh if you do 
 you see me be crying so hard that the thick fog round you will obscure the prospect 
 i never cry unless for some great affliction 
 such as fellows going to college hey cut in laurie with suggestive laugh 
 be a peacock i only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company 
 exactly i say jo how is grandpa this week pretty amiable 
 very why have you got into a scrape and want to know how take it asked jo rather sharply 
 now jo do you think look your mother in the face and say all right if it and laurie stopped short with an injured air 
 no i 
 then go and be suspicious i only want some money said laurie walking on again appeased by her hearty tone 
 you spend a great deal teddy 
 bless you i spend it it spends itself somehow and is gone before i know it 
 you are so generous and that you let people borrow and say no to anyone we heard about henshaw and all you did for him if you always spent money in that way no one would blame you said jo warmly 
 oh he made a mountain out of a molehill you have me let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little help when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps would you 
 of course not but i see the use of your having seventeen waistcoats endless neckties and a new hat every time you come home i thought got over the dandy period but every now and then it breaks out in a new spot just now the fashion to be hideous to make your head look like a scrubbing brush wear a strait jacket orange gloves and clumping boots if it was cheap ugliness say nothing but it costs as much as the other and i get any satisfaction out of it 
 laurie threw back his head and laughed so heartily at this attack that the felt hat fell off and jo walked on it which insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the advantages of a costume as he folded up the maltreated hat and stuffed it into his pocket 
 lecture any more a good soul i have enough all through the week and like to enjoy myself when i come home get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my friends 
 leave you in peace if only let your hair grow not aristocratic but i do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young prize fighter observed jo severely 
 this unassuming style promotes study why we adopt it returned laurie who certainly could not be accused of vanity having voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for stubble 
 by the way jo i think that little parker is really getting desperate about amy he talks of her constantly writes poetry and moons about in a most suspicious manner better nip his little passion in the bud he added laurie in a confidential elder brotherly tone after a silence 
 of course he had we want any more marrying in this family for years to come mercy on us what are the children thinking of and jo looked as much scandalized as if amy and little parker were not yet in their teens 
 a fast age and i know what we are coming to you are a mere infant but go next jo and be left lamenting said laurie shaking his head over the degeneracy of the times 
 be alarmed not one of the agreeable sort nobody will want me and a mercy for there should always be one old maid in a family 
 you give anyone a chance said laurie with a sidelong glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face you show the soft side of your character and if a fellow gets a peep at it by accident and help showing that he likes it you treat him as mrs gummidge did her sweetheart throw cold water over him and get so thorny no one dares touch or look at you 
 i like that sort of thing too busy to be worried with nonsense and i think dreadful to break up families so now say any more about it wedding has turned all our heads and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities i wish to get cross so change the subject and jo looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation 
 whatever his feelings might have been laurie found a vent for them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted at the gate mark my words jo go next

lionfish nov chapter rita scoopcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 everybody got up late on boxing day the gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations hair was bushy again she confessed to harry that she had used liberal amounts of hair potion on it for the ball but way too much bother to do every day she said scratching a purring crookshanks behind the ears 
 
 ron and hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument they were being quite friendly to each other though oddly formal ron and harry wasted no time in telling hermione about the conversation they had overheard between madame maxime and hagrid but hermione seem to find the news that hagrid was a nearly as shocking as ron did 
 
 well i thought he must be she said shrugging i knew he be pure giant because about twenty feet tall but honestly all this hysteria about giants they all be the same sort of prejudice that people have toward just bigotry it 
 
 ron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly but perhaps he want another row because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while hermione looking 
 
 it was time now to think of the homework they had neglected during the first week of the holidays everybody seemed to be feeling rather flat now that christmas was over everybody except harry that is who was starting once again to feel slightly nervous 
 
 the trouble was that february the looked a lot closer from this side of christmas and he still done anything about working out the clue inside the golden egg he therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory opening it and listening intently hoping that this time it would make some sense he strained to think what the sound reminded him of apart from thirty musical saws but he had never heard anything else like it he closed the egg shook it vigorously and opened it again to see if the sound had changed but it he tried asking the egg questions shouting over all the wailing but nothing happened he even threw the egg across the room though he really expected that to help 
 
 harry had not forgotten the hint that cedric had given him but his feelings toward cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it in any case it seemed to him that if cedric had really wanted to give harry a hand he would have been a lot more explicit he harry had told cedric exactly what was coming in the first task and idea of a fair exchange had been to tell harry to take a bath well he need that sort of rubbishy help not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with cho anyway and so the first day of the new term arrived and harry set off to lessons weighed down with books parchment and quills as usual but also with the lurking worry of the egg heavy in his stomach as though he were carrying that around with him too 
 
 snow was still thick upon the grounds and the greenhouse windows were covered in condensation so thick that they see out of them in herbology nobody was looking forward to care of magical creatures much in this weather though as ron said the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely either by chasing them or blasting off so forcefully that cabin would catch fire 
 
 when they arrived at hagrid s cabin however they found an elderly witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent chin standing before his front door 
 
 hurry up now the bell rang five minutes ago she barked at them as they struggled toward her through the snow 
 
 you said ron staring at her hagrid 
 
 my name is professor she said briskly i am your temporary care of magical creatures teacher 
 
 hagrid harry repeated loudly 
 
 he is indisposed said professor shortly 
 
 soft and unpleasant laughter reached ears he turned draco malfoy and the rest of the slytherins were joining the class all of them looked gleeful and none of them looked surprised to see professor 
 
 this way please said professor and she strode off around the paddock where the beauxbatons horses were shivering harry ron and hermione followed her looking back over their shoulders at cabin all the curtains were closed was hagrid in there alone and ill 
 
 wrong with hagrid harry said hurrying to catch up with professor 
 
 never you mind she said as though she thought he was being nosy 
 
 i do mind though said harry hotly up with him 
 
 professor acted as though she hear him she led them past the paddock where the huge beauxbatons horses were standing huddled against the cold and toward a tree on the edge of the forest where a large and beautiful unicorn was tethered 
 
 many of the girls ooooohed at the sight of the unicorn 
 
 oh so beautiful whispered lavender brown how did she get it supposed to be really hard to catch 
 
 the unicorn was so brightly white it made the snow all around look gray it was pawing the ground nervously with its golden hooves and throwing back its horned head 
 
 boys keep back barked professor throwing out an arm and catching harry hard in the chest they prefer the touch unicorns girls to the front and approach with care come on easy does it 
 
 she and the girls walked slowly forward toward the unicorn leaving the boys standing near the paddock fence watching the moment professor was out of earshot harry turned to ron 
 
 what reckons wrong with him you think a skrewt 
 
 oh he been attacked potter if what thinking said malfoy softly no just too ashamed to show his big ugly face 
 
 what mean said harry sharply 
 
 malfoy put his hand inside the pocket of his robes and pulled out a folded page of newsprint 
 
 there you go he said hate to break it to you potter 
 
 he smirked as harry snatched the page unfolded it and read it with ron seamus dean and neville looking over his shoulder it was an article topped with a picture of hagrid looking extremely shifty 
 
 giant mistake 
 albus dumbledore eccentric headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry has never been afraid to make controversial staff appointments writes rita skeeter special correspondent in september of this year he hired alastor moody the notoriously to teach defense against the dark arts a decision that caused many raised eyebrows at the ministry of magic given habit of attacking anybody who makes a sudden movement in his presence moody however looks responsible and kindly when set beside the dumbledore employs to teach care of magical creatures 
 rubeus hagrid who admits to being expelled from hogwarts in his third year has enjoyed the position of gamekeeper at the school ever since a job secured for him by dumbledore last year however hagrid used his mysterious influence over the headmaster to secure the additional post of care of magical creatures teacher over the heads of many candidates 
 an alarmingly large and man hagrid has been using his newfound authority to terrify the students in his care with a succession of horrific creatures while dumbledore turns a blind eye hagrid has maimed several pupils during a series of lessons that many admit to being very frightening 
 i was attacked by a hippogriff and my friend vincent crabbe got a bad bite off a flobberworm says draco malfoy a student we all hate hagrid but just too scared to say anything 
 hagrid has no intention of ceasing his campaign of intimidation however in conversation with a daily prophet reporter last month he admitted breeding creatures he has dubbed skrewts highly dangerous crosses between and the creation of new breeds of magical creature is of course an activity usually closely observed by the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures hagrid however considers himself to be above such petty restrictions 
 i was just having some fun he says before hastily changing the subject 
 as if this were not enough the daily prophet has now unearthed evidence that hagrid is not as he has always pretended a wizard he is not in fact even pure human his mother we can exclusively reveal is none other than the giantess fridwulfa whose whereabouts are currently unknown 
 bloodthirsty and brutal the giants brought themselves to the point of extinction by warring amongst themselves during the last century the handful that remained joined the ranks of and were responsible for some of the worst mass muggle killings of his reign of terror 
 while many of the giants who served were killed by aurors working against the dark side fridwulfa was not among them it is possible she escaped to one of the giant communities still existing in foreign mountain ranges if his antics during care of magical creatures lessons are any guide however son appears to have inherited her brutal nature 
 in a bizarre twist hagrid is reputed to have developed a close friendship with the boy who brought around fall from power thereby driving own mother like the rest of supporters into hiding perhaps harry potter is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend but albus dumbledore surely has a duty to ensure that harry potter along with his fellow students is warned about the dangers of associating with 
 harry finished reading and looked up at ron whose mouth was hanging open 
 
 how did she find out he whispered 
 
 but that what was bothering harry 
 
 what mean we all hate hagrid harry spat at malfoy this rubbish about him he pointed at crabbe getting a bad bite off a flobberworm they even got teeth 
 
 crabbe was sniggering apparently very pleased with himself 
 
 well i think this should put an end to the teaching career said malfoy his eyes glinting there was me thinking just swallowed a bottle of when he was of the mummies and daddies are going to like this at be worried eat their kids ha ha 
 
 you 
 
 are you paying attention over there 
 
 professor voice carried over to the boys the girls were all clustered around the unicorn now stroking it harry was so angry that the daily prophet article shook in his hands as he turned to stare unseeingly at the unicorn whose many magical properties professor was now enumerating in a loud voice so that the boys could hear too 
 
 i hope she stays that woman said parvati patil when the lesson had ended and they were all heading back to the castle for lunch more what i thought care of magical creatures would be likeproper creatures like unicorns not monsters 
 
 what about hagrid harry said angrily as they went up the steps 
 
 what about him said parvati in a hard voice he can still be gamekeeper he 
 
 parvati had been very cool toward harry since the ball he supposed that he ought to have paid her a bit more attention but she seemed to have had a good time all the same she was certainly telling anybody who would listen that she had made arrangements to meet the boy from beauxbatons in hogsmeade on the next weekend trip 
 
 that was a really good lesson said hermione as they entered the great hall i know half the things professor told us about uni 
 
 look at this harry snarled and he shoved the daily prophet article under nose 
 
 mouth fell open as she read her reaction was exactly the same as 
 
 how did that horrible skeeter woman find out you think hagrid told her 
 
 no said harry leading the way over to the gryffindor table and throwing himself into a chair furious he never even told us did he i reckon she was so mad he give her loads of horrible stuff about me she went ferreting around to get him back 
 
 maybe she heard him telling madame maxime at the ball said hermione quietly 
 
 have seen her in the garden said ron anyway not supposed to come into school anymore hagrid said dumbledore banned her 
 
 maybe got an invisibility cloak said harry ladling chicken casserole onto his plate and splashing it everywhere in his anger sort of thing do it hide in bushes listening to people 
 
 like you and ron did you mean said hermione 
 
 we trying to hear him said ron indignantly we have any choice the stupid prat talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him 
 
 got to go and see him said harry this evening after divination tell him we want him backyou do want him back he shot at hermione 
 
 i well not going to pretend it make a nice change having a proper care of magical creatures lesson for once but i do want hagrid back of course i do hermione added hastily quailing under furious stare 
 
 so that evening after dinner the three of them left the castle once more and went down through the frozen grounds to cabin they knocked and booming barks answered 
 
 hagrid us harry shouted pounding on the door open up 
 
 hagrid answer they could hear fang scratching at the door whining but it open they hammered on it for ten more minutes ron even went and banged on one of the windows but there was no response 
 
 he avoiding us for hermione said when they had finally given up and were walking back to the school he surely think care about him being 
 
 but it seemed that hagrid did care they see a sign of him all week he appear at the staff table at mealtimes they see him going about his gamekeeper duties on the grounds and professor continued to take the care of magical creatures classes malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity 
 
 missing your pal he kept whispering to harry whenever there was a teacher around so that he was safe from retaliation missing the 
 
 there was a hogsmeade visit halfway through january hermione was very surprised that harry was going to go 
 
 i just thought want to take advantage of the common room being quiet she said really get to work on that egg 
 
 oh i i reckon got a pretty good idea what about now harry lied 
 
 have you really said hermione looking impressed well done 
 
 insides gave a guilty squirm but he ignored them he still had five weeks to work out that egg clue after all and that was ageswhereas if he went into hogsmeade he might run into hagrid and get a chance to persuade him to come back 
 
 he ron and hermione left the castle together on saturday and set off through the cold wet grounds toward the gates as they passed the durmstrang ship moored in the lake they saw viktor krum emerge onto the deck dressed in nothing but swimming trunks he was very skinny indeed but apparently a lot tougher than he looked because he climbed up onto the side of the ship stretched out his arms and dived right into the lake 
 
 mad said harry staring at dark head as it bobbed out into the middle of the lake it must be freezing january 
 
 a lot colder where he comes from said hermione i suppose it feels quite warm to him 
 
 yeah but still the giant squid said ron he sound anxious if anything he sounded hopeful hermione noticed his tone of voice and frowned 
 
 really nice you know she said not at all like think coming from durmstrang he likes it much better here he told me 
 
 ron said nothing he mentioned viktor krum since the ball but harry had found a miniature arm under his bed on boxing day which had looked very much as though it had been snapped off a small model figure wearing bulgarian quidditch robes 
 
 harry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of hagrid all the way down the slushy high street and suggested a visit to the three broomsticks once he had ascertained that hagrid was not in any of the shops 
 
 the pub was as crowded as ever but one quick look around at all the tables told harry that hagrid there heart sinking he went up to the bar with ron and hermione ordered three butterbeers from madam rosmerta and thought gloomily that he might just as well have stayed behind and listened to the egg wailing after all 
 
 he ever go into the office hermione whispered suddenly look 
 
 she pointed into the mirror behind the bar and harry saw ludo bagman reflected there sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch of goblins bagman was talking very fast in a low voice to the goblins all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking rather menacing 
 
 it was indeed odd harry thought that bagman was here at the three broomsticks on a weekend when there was no triwizard event and therefore no judging to be done he watched bagman in the mirror he was looking strained again quite as strained as he had that night in the forest before the dark mark had appeared but just then bagman glanced over at the bar saw harry and stood up 
 
 in a moment in a moment harry heard him say brusquely to the goblins and bagman hurried through the pub toward harry his boyish grin back in place 
 
 harry he said how are you been hoping to run into you everything going all right 
 
 fine thanks said harry 
 
 wonder if i could have a quick private word harry said bagman eagerly you give us a moment you two could you 
 
 er okay said ron and he and hermione went off to find a table 
 
 bagman led harry along the bar to the end furthest from madam rosmerta 
 
 well i just thought congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that horntail harry said bagman really superb 
 
 thanks said harry but he knew this be all that bagman wanted to say because he could have congratulated harry in front of ron and hermione bagman seem in any particular rush to spill the beans though harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins who were all watching him and harry in silence through their dark slanting eyes 
 
 absolute nightmare said bagman to harry in an undertone noticing harry watching the goblins too their english too like being back with all the bulgarians at the quidditch world cupbut at least they used sign language another human could recognize this lot keep gabbling in i only know one word of gobbledegook bladvak it means pickax i like to use it in case they think threatening them 
 
 he gave a short booming laugh 
 
 what do they want harry said noticing how the goblins were still watching bagman very closely 
 
 er well said bagman looking suddenly nervous looking for barty crouch 
 
 why are they looking for him here said harry at the ministry in london he 
 
 eras a matter of fact no idea where he is said bagman sort ofstopped coming to work been absent for a couple of weeks now young percy his assistant says ill apparently just been sending instructions in by owl but would you mind not mentioning that to anyone harry because rita still poking around everywhere she can and willing to bet work up bartys illness into something sinister probably say gone missing like bertha jorkins 
 
 have you heard anything about bertha jorkins harry asked 
 
 no said bagman looking strained again got people looking of course about time thought harry and all very strange she definitely arrived in albania because she met her second cousin there and then she left the house to go south and see an auntand she seems to have vanished without trace en route blowed if i can see where got toshe seem the type to elope for instancebut are we doing talking about goblins and bertha jorkins i really wanted to ask you he lowered his voice how are you getting on with your golden egg 
 
 ernot bad harry said untruthfully 
 
 bagman seemed to know he being honest 
 
 listen harry he said still in a very low voice i feel very bad about all thisyou were thrown into this tournament you volunteer for itand if his voice was so quiet now harry had to lean closer to listen if i can help at alla prod in the right taken a liking to youthe way you got past that just say the word 
 
 harry stared up into round rosy face and his wide eyes 
 
 supposed to work out the clues alone we he said careful to keep his voice casual and not sound as though he was accusing the head of the department of magical games and sports of breaking the rules 
 
 wellwell yes said bagman impatiently but come on harry we all want a hogwarts victory we 
 
 have you offered cedric help harry said 
 
 the smallest of frowns creased smooth face no i he said i well like i say taken a liking to you just thought offer 
 
 well thanks said harry but i think nearly there with the eggcouple more days should crack it 
 
 he entirely sure why he was refusing help except that bagman was almost a stranger to him and accepting his assistance would feel somehow much more like cheating than asking advice from ron hermione or sirius 
 
 bagman looked almost affronted but say much more as fred and george turned up at that point 
 
 hello mr bagman said fred brightly can we buy you a drink 
 
 erno said bagman with a last disappointed glance at harry no thank you boys 
 
 fred and george looked quite as disappointed as bagman who was surveying harry as though he had let him down badly 
 
 well i must dash he said nice seeing you all good luck harry 
 
 he hurried out of the pub the goblins all slid off their chairs and exited after him harry went to rejoin ron and hermione 
 
 what did he want ron said the moment harry had sat down 
 
 he offered to help me with the golden egg said harry 
 
 he be doing that said hermione looking very shocked one of the judges and anyway already worked it out you 
 
 ernearly said harry 
 
 well i think dumbledore would like it if he knew bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat said hermione still looking deeply disapproving i hope trying to help cedric as much 
 
 not i asked said harry 
 
 who cares if getting help said ron harry privately agreed 
 
 those goblins look very friendly said hermione sipping her butterbeer what were they doing here 
 
 looking for crouch according to bagman said harry still ill been into work 
 
 maybe poisoning him said ron probably thinks if crouch snuffs it be made head of the department of international magical cooperation 
 
 hermione gave ron a look and said funny goblins looking for mr normally deal with the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures 
 
 crouch can speak loads of different languages though said harry maybe they need an interpreter 
 
 worrying about poor ickle goblins now are you ron asked hermione thinking of starting up or something society for the protection of ugly goblins 
 
 ha ha ha said hermione sarcastically goblins need protection you been listening to what professor binns has been telling us about goblin rebellions 
 
 no said harry and ron together 
 
 well quite capable of dealing with wizards said hermione taking another sip of butterbeer very clever not like who never stick up for themselves 
 
 said ron staring at the door 
 
 rita skeeter had just entered she was wearing robes today her long nails were painted shocking pink and she was accompanied by her paunchy photographer she bought drinks and she and the photographer made their way through the crowds to a table nearby harry ron and hermione glaring at her as she approached she was talking fast and looking very satisfied about something 
 
 seem very keen to talk to us did he bozo now why would that be do you think and he doing with a pack of goblins in tow anyway showing them the sightswhat nonsensehe was always a bad liar reckon up think we should do a bit of digging disgraced of magical games and sports ludo bagman snappy start to a sentence bozo we just need to find a story to fit it 
 
 trying to ruin someone life said harry loudly 
 
 a few people looked around rita eyes widened behind her jeweled spectacles as she saw who had spoken 
 
 harry she said beaming how lovely why you come and join 
 
 i come near you with a broomstick said harry furiously what did you do that to hagrid for eh 
 
 rita skeeter raised her heavily penciled eyebrows 
 
 our readers have a right to the truth harry i am merely doing my 
 
 who cares if harry shouted nothing wrong with him 
 
 the whole pub had gone very quiet madam rosmerta was staring over from behind the bar apparently oblivious to the fact that the flagon she was filling with mead was overflowing 
 
 rita smile flickered very slightly but she hitched it back almost at once she snapped open her handbag pulled out her quill and said how about giving me an interview about the hagrid you know harry the man behind the muscles your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it would you call him a father substitute 
 
 hermione stood up very abruptly her butterbeer clutched in her hand as though it were a grenade 
 
 you horrible woman she said through gritted teeth you care do you anything for a story and anyone will do wont they even ludo bagman 
 
 sit down you silly little girl and talk about things you understand said rita skeeter coldly her eyes hardening as they fell on hermione i know things about ludo bagman that would make your hair curlnot that it needs it she added eyeing bushy hair 
 
 go said hermione harry ron 
 
 they left many people were staring at them as they went harry glanced back as they reached the door rita quill was out it was zooming backward and forward over a piece of parchment on the table 
 
 be after you next hermione said ron in a low and worried voice as they walked quickly back up the street 
 
 let her try said hermione defiantly she was shaking with rage show her silly little girl am i oh get her back for this first harry then hagrid 
 
 you want to go upsetting rita skeeter said ron nervously serious hermione dig up something on you 
 
 my parents read the daily prophet she scare me into hiding said hermione now striding along so fast that it was all harry and ron could do to keep up with her the last time harry had seen hermione in a rage like this she had hit draco malfoy around the face and hagrid hiding anymore he should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him come on 
 
 breaking into a run she led them all the way back up the road through the gates flanked by winged boars and up through the grounds to cabin 
 
 the curtains were still drawn and they could hear fang barking as they approached 
 
 hagrid hermione shouted pounding on his front door hagrid enough we know in there nobody cares if your mum was a giantess hagrid you let that foul skeeter woman do this to you hagrid get out here just being 
 
 the door opened hermione said about it and then stopped very suddenly because she had found herself not with hagrid but with albus dumbledore 
 
 good afternoon he said pleasantly smiling down at them 
 
 we er we wanted to see hagrid said hermione in a rather small voice 
 
 yes i surmised as much said dumbledore his eyes twinkling why you come in 
 
 ohumokay said hermione 
 
 she ron and harry went into the cabin fang launched himself upon harry the moment he entered barking madly and trying to lick his ears harry fended off fang and looked around 
 
 hagrid was sitting at his table where there were two large mugs of tea he looked a real mess his face was blotchy his eyes swollen and he had gone to the other extreme where his hair was concerned far from trying to make it behave it now looked like a wig of tangled wire 
 
 hi hagrid said harry 
 
 hagrid looked up 
 
 lo he said in a very hoarse voice 
 
 more tea i think said dumbledore closing the door behind harry ron and hermione drawing out his wand and twiddling it a revolving tea tray appeared in midair along with a plate of cakes dumbledore magicked the tray onto the table and everybody sat down there was a slight pause and then dumbledore said did you by any chance hear what miss granger was shouting hagrid 
 
 hermione went slightly pink but dumbledore smiled at her and continued hermione harry and ron still seem to want to know you judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door 
 
 of course we still want to know you harry said staring at hagrid you think anything that skeeter cow sorry professor he added quickly looking at dumbledore 
 
 i have gone temporarily deaf and any idea what you said harry said dumbledore twiddling his thumbs and staring at the ceiling 
 
 said harry sheepishly i just how could you think care what about you 
 
 two fat tears leaked out of eyes and fell slowly into his tangled beard 
 
 living proof of what been telling you hagrid said dumbledore still looking carefully up at the ceiling i have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here telling me in no uncertain terms that if i sacked you they would have something to say about it 
 
 not all of em said hagrid hoarsely not all of em wan me ter stay 
 
 really hagrid if you are holding out for universal popularity afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time said dumbledore now peering sternly over his spectacles not a week has passed since i became headmaster of this school when i had at least one owl complaining about the way i run it but what should i do barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody 
 
 yeh not said hagrid croakily 
 
 hagrid look what got for relatives harry said furiously look at the dursleys 
 
 an excellent point said professor dumbledore my own brother aberforth was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat it was all over the papers but did aberforth hide no he did not he held his head high and went about his business as usual of course not entirely sure he can read so that may not have been bravery 
 
 come back and teach hagrid said hermione quietly please come back we really miss you 
 
 hagrid gulped more tears leaked out down his cheeks and into his tangled beard 
 
 dumbledore stood up i refuse to accept your resignation hagrid and i expect you back at work on monday he said you will join me for breakfast at in the great hall no excuses good afternoon to you all 
 
 dumbledore left the cabin pausing only to scratch fangs ears when the door had shut behind him hagrid began to sob into his hands hermione kept patting his arm and at last hagrid looked up his eyes very red indeed and said great man dumbledoregreat man 
 
 yeah he is said ron can i have one of these cakes hagrid 
 
 help yerself said hagrid wiping his eyes on the back of his hand ar righ o course all bin stupidmy ol dad woulda bin ashamed o the way bin behavin more tears leaked out but he wiped them away more forcefully and said never shown you a picture of my old dad have i here 
 
 hagrid got up went over to his dresser opened a drawer and pulled out a picture of a short wizard with crinkled black eyes beaming as he sat on top of shoulder hagrid was a good seven or eight feet tall judging by the apple tree beside him but his face was beardless young round and smooth he looked hardly older than eleven 
 
 tha was taken jus after i got inter hogwarts hagrid croaked dad was dead chuffedthought i migh not be a wizard see cos me mumwell anyway course i never was great shakes at magic reallybut at least he never saw me expelled died see in me second year 
 
 dumbledore was the one who stuck up for me after dad went got me the gamekeeper jobtrusts people he does gives em second what sets him apar from other heads see accept anyone at hogwarts as got the talent knows people can turn out okay even if their families tha respectable but some don understand that some always hold it against some even pretend they just had big bones rather than stand up an say i am what i am an not ashamed never be ashamed my ol dad used ter say some hold it against you but not worth botherin with an he was right bin an idiot not botherin with her no more i promise yeh that big give her big bones 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked at one another nervously harry would rather have taken fifty skrewts for a walk than admit to hagrid that he had overheard him talking to madame maxime but hagrid was still talking apparently unaware that he had said anything odd 
 
 yeh know wha harry he said looking up from the photograph of his father his eyes very bright when i firs met you you reminded me o me a bit mum an dad gone an you was feelin like yeh wouldn fit in at hogwarts remember not sure yeh were really up to itan now look at yeh harry school champion 
 
 he looked at harry for a moment and then said very seriously yeh know what love harry love yeh ter win i really would show em allyeh don have ter be pureblood ter do it yeh don have ter be ashamed of what yeh are show em the one got it righ lettin anyone in as long as they can do magic how you doin with that egg harry 
 
 great said harry really great 
 
 miserable face broke into a wide watery smile 
 
 my boyyou show em harry you show em beat em all 
 
 lying to hagrid quite like lying to anyone else harry went back to the castle later that afternoon with ron and hermione unable to banish the image of the happy expression on whiskery face as he had imagined harry winning the tournament the incomprehensible egg weighed more heavily than ever on conscience that evening and by the time he had got into bed he had made up his mind it was time to shelve his pride and see if hint was worth anything
