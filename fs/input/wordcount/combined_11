 pierre went on with his diary and this is what he wrote in it during that time 
 th november 
 got up at eight read the scriptures then went to my duties by joseph advice pierre had entered the service of the state and served on one of the committees returned home for dinner and dined alone the countess had many visitors i do not like i ate and drank moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the brothers in the evening i went down to the countess and told a funny story about b and only remembered that i ought not to have done so when everybody laughed loudly at it 
 i am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind great god help me to walk in thy paths to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation to vanquish lust by and repulsion to withdraw from worldliness but not avoid a the service of the state b family duties c relations with my friends and the management of my affairs 
 th november 
 i got up late on waking i lay long in bed yielding to sloth o god help and strengthen me that i may walk in thy ways read the scriptures but without proper feeling brother urusov came and we talked about worldly vanities he told me of the new projects i began to criticize them but remembered my rules and my words that a true freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist my tongue is my enemy brothers g v and o visited me and we had a preliminary talk about the reception of a new brother they laid on me the duty of rhetor i feel myself weak and unworthy then our talk turned to the interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the temple the seven sciences the seven virtues the seven vices and the seven gifts of the holy spirit brother o was very eloquent in the evening the admission took place the new decoration of the premises contributed much to the magnificence of the spectacle it was boris drubetskoy who was admitted i nominated him and was the rhetor a strange feeling agitated me all the time i was alone with him in the dark chamber i caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which i vainly tried to overcome that is why i should really like to save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth but evil thoughts of him did not leave me it seemed to me that his object in entering the brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge apart from the fact that he had asked me several times whether n and s were members of our lodge a question to which i could not reply and that according to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement i had no cause to doubt him but he seemed to me insincere and all the time i stood alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was smiling contemptuously at my words and i wished really to stab his bare breast with the sword i held to it i could not be eloquent nor could i frankly mention my doubts to the brothers and to the grand master great architect of nature help me to find the true path out of the labyrinth of lies 
 after this three pages were left blank in the diary and then the following was written 
 i have had a long and instructive talk alone with brother v who advised me to hold fast by brother a though i am unworthy much was revealed to me adonai is the name of the creator of the world elohim is the name of the ruler of all the third name is the name unutterable which means the all talks with brother v strengthen refresh and support me in the path of virtue in his presence doubt has no place the distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our sacred teaching is clear to me human sciences dissect everything to comprehend it and kill everything to examine it in the holy science of our order all is one all is known in its entirety and life the trinity the three elements of matter are sulphur mercury and salt sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature in combination with salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means of which it attracts mercury seizes it holds it and in combination produces other bodies mercury is a fluid volatile spiritual essence christ the holy spirit him 
 rd december 
 awoke late read the scriptures but was apathetic afterwards went and paced up and down the large hall i wished to meditate but instead my imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago when dolokhov meeting me in moscow after our duel said he hoped i was enjoying perfect peace of mind in spite of my absence at the time i gave him no answer now i recalled every detail of that meeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies i recollected myself and drove away that thought only when i found myself glowing with anger but i did not sufficiently repent afterwards boris drubetskoy came and began relating various adventures his coming vexed me from the first and i said something disagreeable to him he replied i flared up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him he became silent and i recollected myself only when it was too late my god i cannot get on with him at all the cause of this is my egotism i set myself above him and so become much worse than he for he is lenient to my rudeness while i on the contrary nourish contempt for him o god grant that in his presence i may rather see my own vileness and behave so that he too may benefit after dinner i fell asleep and as i was drowsing off i clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear thy day 
 i dreamed that i was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by dogs but i went on undismayed suddenly a smallish dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go i began to throttle it with my hands scarcely had i torn it off before another a bigger one began biting me i lifted it up but the higher i lifted it the bigger and heavier it grew and suddenly brother a came and taking my arm led me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank i stepped on it but it bent and gave way and i began to clamber up a fence which i could scarcely reach with my hands after much effort i dragged myself up so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on the other i looked round and saw brother a standing on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden and in the garden was a large and beautiful building i woke up o lord great architect of nature help me to tear from myself these dogs my passions especially the last which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones and aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which i attained in my dream 
 th december 
 i dreamed that joseph alexeevich was sitting in my house and that i was very glad and wished to entertain him it seemed as if i chattered incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could not please him and i wished to come close to him and embrace him but as soon as i drew near i saw that his face had changed and grown young and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order but so softly that i could not hear it then it seemed that we all left the room and something strange happened we were sitting or lying on the floor he was telling me something and i wished to show him my sensibility and not listening to what he was saying i began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of god sanctifying me and tears came into my eyes and i was glad he noticed this but be looked at me with vexation and jumped up breaking off his remarks i felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern me but he did not reply gave me a kind look and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed he lay down on the edge of it and i burned with longing to caress him and lie down too and he said tell me frankly what is your chief temptation do you know it i think you know it already abashed by this question i replied that sloth was my chief temptation he shook his head incredulously and even more abashed i said that though i was living with my wife as he advised i was not living with her as her husband to this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of embraces and gave me to understand that that was my duty but i replied that i should be ashamed to do it and suddenly everything vanished and i awoke and found in my mind the text from the gospel the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not joseph face had looked young and bright that day i received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about conjugal duties 
 th december 
 i had a dream from which i awoke with a throbbing heart i saw that i was in moscow in my house in the big sitting room and joseph alexeevich came in from the drawing room i seemed to know at once that the process of regeneration had already taken place in him and i rushed to meet him i embraced him and kissed his hands and he said hast thou noticed that my face is different i looked at him still holding him in my arms and saw that his face was young but that he had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed and i said i should have known you had i met you by chance and i thought to myself am i telling the truth and suddenly i saw him lying like a dead body then he gradually recovered and went with me into my study carrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper i said i drew that and he answered by bowing his head i opened the book and on all the pages there were excellent drawings and in my dream i knew that these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved and on its pages i saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent garments and with a transparent body flying up to the clouds and i seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation of the song of songs and looking at those drawings i dreamed i felt that i was doing wrong but could not tear myself away from them lord help me my god if thy forsaking me is thy doing thy will be done but if i am myself the cause teach me what i should do i shall perish of my debauchery if thou utterly desertest me

 chapter vii 
 
 continuation of the enigma 
 the night wind had risen which indicated that it must be between one and two in the morning 
 poor cosette said nothing as she had seated herself beside him and leaned her head against him jean valjean had fancied that she was asleep 
 he bent down and looked at her 
 eyes were wide open and her thoughtful air pained jean valjean 
 she was still trembling 
 are you sleepy said jean valjean 
 i am very cold she replied 
 a moment later she resumed 
 is she still there 
 who said jean valjean 
 madame thenardier 
 jean valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to make cosette keep silent 
 ah said he she is gone 
 you need fear nothing further 
 the child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast 
 the ground was damp the shed open on all sides the breeze grew more keen every instant 
 the goodman took off his coat and wrapped it round cosette 
 are you less cold now said he 
 oh yes father 
 well wait for me a moment 
 i will soon be back 
 he quitted the ruin and crept along the large building seeking a better shelter 
 he came across doors but they were closed there were bars at all the windows of the ground floor 
 just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice he observed that he was coming to some arched windows where he perceived a light he stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows they all opened on a tolerably vast hall paved with large flagstones cut up by arcades and pillars where only a tiny light and great shadows were visible 
 the light came from a taper which was burning in one corner 
 the apartment was deserted and nothing was stirring in it 
 nevertheless by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the ground something which appeared to be covered with a and which resembled a human form this form was lying face downward flat on the pavement with the arms extended in the form of a cross in the immobility of death one would have said judging from a sort of serpent which undulated over the floor that this sinister form had a rope round its neck 
 the whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely illuminated which adds to horror 
 jean valjean often said afterwards that although many funereal spectres had crossed his path in life he had never beheld anything more and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place and beheld thus at night 
 it was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive 
 he had the courage to plaster his face to the glass and to watch whether the thing would move 
 in spite of his remaining thus what seemed to him a very long time the outstretched form made no movement all at once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror and he fled 
 he began to run towards the shed not daring to look behind him 
 it seemed to him that if he turned his head he should see that form following him with great strides and waving its arms 
 he reached the ruin all out of breath 
 his knees were giving way beneath him the perspiration was pouring from him 
 where was he 
 who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of sepulchre in the midst of paris 
 what was this strange house an edifice full of nocturnal mystery calling to souls through the darkness with the voice of angels and when they came offering them abruptly that terrible vision promising to open the radiant portals of heaven and then opening the horrible gates of the tomb 
 and it actually was an edifice a house which bore a number on the street it was not a dream 
 he had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact 
 cold anxiety uneasiness the emotions of the night had given him a genuine fever and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain 
 he stepped up to cosette 
 she was asleep

 chapter xi 
 
 the rostovs monetary affairs had not improved during the two years they had spent in the country 
 though nicholas rostov had kept firmly to his resolution and was still serving modestly in an obscure regiment spending comparatively little the way of life at otradnoe management of affairs in particular was such that the debts inevitably increased every year the only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official post so he had come to petersburg to look for one and also as he said to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time 
 soon after their arrival in petersburg berg proposed to vera and was accepted 
 though in moscow the rostovs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a thought yet in petersburg their circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one in petersburg they were provincials and the very people they had entertained in moscow without inquiring to what set they belonged here looked down on them 
 the rostovs lived in the same hospitable way in petersburg as in moscow and the most diverse people met at their suppers country neighbors from otradnoe impoverished old squires and their daughters peronskaya a maid of honor pierre bezukhov and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in petersburg among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the rostovs house in petersburg were boris pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him and berg who spent whole days at the rostovs and paid the eldest daughter countess vera the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose 
 not in vain had berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left he narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed and he had obtained two decorations for austerlitz 
 in the finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself he had picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander just as he had done after austerlitz he related this occurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this and he received two decorations for the finnish war also in he was a captain in the guards wore medals and held some special lucrative posts in petersburg 
 though some skeptics smiled when told of merits it could not be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer on excellent terms with his superiors and a moral young man with a brilliant career before him and an assured position in society 
 four years before meeting a german comrade in the stalls of a moscow theater berg had pointed out vera rostova to him and had said in german das soll mein weib werden and from that moment had made up his mind to marry her now in petersburg having considered the rostovs position and his own he decided that the time had come to propose 
 that girl shall be my wife 
 proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not flattering to him at first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a countess rostova but chief characteristic was such a naive and good natured egotism that the rostovs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good indeed excellent moreover the rostovs affairs were seriously embarrassed as the suitor could not but know and above all vera was had been taken out everywhere and though she was certainly and sensible no one up to now had proposed to her so they gave their consent 
 you see said berg to his comrade whom he called friend only because he knew that everyone has friends you see i have considered it all and should not marry if i had not thought it all out or if it were in any way unsuitable but on the contrary my papa and mamma are now provided for i have arranged that rent for them in the baltic provinces and i can live in petersburg on my pay and with her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely i am not marrying for money i consider that dishonorable but a wife should bring her share and a husband his i have my position in the service she has connections and some means in our times that is worth something it but above all she is a handsome estimable girl and she loves me 
 berg blushed and smiled 
 and i love her because her character is sensible and very good now the other sister though they are the same family is quite different an unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence she is so you know unpleasant but my fiancee well you will be coming he was going to say to dine but changed his mind and said to take tea with us and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke perfectly embodying his dream of happiness 
 after the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by proposal the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took possession of the family but the rejoicing was external and insincere in the feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and constraint was evident as if they were ashamed of not having loved vera sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands the old count felt this most he would probably have been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment but it resulted from the state of his affairs he did not know at all how much he had what his debts amounted to or what dowry he could give vera when his daughters were born he had assigned to each of them for her dowry an estate with three hundred serfs but one of these estates had already been sold and the other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would have to be sold so that it was impossible to give it to vera nor had he any money 
 berg had already been engaged a month and only a week remained before the wedding but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the question of the dowry nor spoken to his wife about it at one time the count thought of giving her the ryazan estate or of selling a forest at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand a few days before the wedding berg entered the study early one morning and with a pleasant smile respectfully asked his future to let him know what dowry would be the count was so disconcerted by this inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply that came into his head i like your being businesslike about it i like it you shall be satisfied 
 and patting berg on the shoulder he got up wishing to end the conversation but berg smiling pleasantly explained that if he did not know for certain how much vera would have and did not receive at least part of the dowry in advance he would have to break matters off 
 because consider count if i allowed myself to marry now without having definite means to maintain my wife i should be acting badly 
 the conversation ended by the count who wished to be generous and to avoid further importunity saying that he would give a note of hand for eighty thousand rubles berg smiled meekly kissed the count on the shoulder and said that he was very grateful but that it was impossible for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in ready money or at least twenty thousand count he added and then a note of hand for only sixty thousand 
 yes yes all right said the count hurriedly only excuse me my dear fellow give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty thousand as well yes yes kiss me

 chapter viii 
 
 the enigma becomes doubly mysterious 
 the child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep 
 he sat down beside her and began to think 
 little by little as he gazed at her he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind 
 he clearly perceived this truth the foundation of his life henceforth that so long as she was there so long as he had her near him he should need nothing except for her he should fear nothing except for her 
 he was not even conscious that he was very cold since he had taken off his coat to cover her 
 nevertheless athwart this revery into which he had fallen he had heard for some time a peculiar noise 
 it was like the tinkling of a bell 
 this sound proceeded from the garden 
 it could be heard distinctly though faintly 
 it resembled the faint vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures 
 this noise made valjean turn round 
 he looked and saw that there was some one in the garden 
 a being resembling a man was walking amid the of the melon beds rising stooping halting with regular movements as though he were dragging or spreading out something on the ground this person appeared to limp 
 jean valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy for them everything is hostile and suspicious 
 they distrust the day because it enables people to see them and the night because it aids in surprising them 
 a little while before he had shivered because the garden was deserted and now he shivered because there was some one there 
 he fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors 
 he said to himself that javert and the spies had perhaps not taken their departure that they had no doubt left people on the watch in the street that if this man should discover him in the garden he would cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up he took the sleeping cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture which was out of use in the most remote corner of the shed 
 cosette did not stir 
 from that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon patch 
 the strange thing about it was that the sound of the bell followed each of this movements 
 when the man approached the sound approached when the man retreated the sound retreated if he made any hasty gesture a tremolo accompanied the gesture when he halted the sound ceased 
 it appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man but what could that signify who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox 
 as he put these questions to himself he touched hands they were icy cold 
 ah good god he cried 
 he spoke to her in a low voice 
 cosette 
 she did not open her eyes 
 he shook her vigorously 
 she did not wake 
 is she dead he said to himself and sprang to his feet quivering from head to foot 
 the most frightful thoughts rushed through his mind there are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies and violently force the partitions of our brains when those we love are in question our prudence invents every sort of madness 
 he remembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal 
 cosette was pale and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet without a movement 
 he listened to her breathing 
 she still breathed but with a respiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction 
 how was he to warm her back to life 
 how was he to rouse her all that was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts he rushed wildly from the ruin 
 it was absolutely necessary that cosette should be in bed and beside a fire in less than a quarter of an hour

 book six 
 chapter xii 
 
 natasha was sixteen and it was the year the very year to which she had counted on her fingers with boris after they had kissed four years ago since then she had not seen him before sonya and her mother if boris happened to be mentioned she spoke quite freely of that episode as of some childish matter that was not worth mentioning but in the secret depths of her soul the question whether her engagement to boris was a jest or an important binding promise tormented her 
 since boris left moscow in to join the army he had had not seen the rostovs he had been in moscow several times and had passed near otradnoe but had never been to see them 
 sometimes it occurred to natasha that he not wish to see her and this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke of him 
 nowadays old friends are not remembered the countess would say when boris was mentioned 
 anna mikhaylovna also had of late visited them less frequently seemed to hold herself with particular dignity and always spoke rapturously and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on which he had entered when the rostovs came to petersburg boris called on them 
 he drove to their house in some agitation the memory of natasha was his most poetic recollection but he went with the firm intention of letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and natasha could not be binding either on her or on him he had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with countess bezukhova a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed and he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in petersburg plans which might very easily be realized when he entered the rostovs drawing room natasha was in her own room when she heard of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room flushed and beaming with a more than cordial smile 
 boris remembered natasha in a short dress with dark eyes shining from under her curls and boisterous childish laughter as he had known her four years before and so he was taken aback when quite a different natasha entered and his face expressed rapturous astonishment this expression on his face pleased natasha 
 well do you recognize your little madcap playmate asked the countess 
 boris kissed hand and said that he was astonished at the change in her 
 how handsome you have grown 
 i should think so replied laughing eyes 
 and is papa older she asked 
 natasha sat down and without joining in boris conversation with the countess silently and minutely studied her suitor he felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her occasionally 
 boris uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed were all comme il faut and in the latest fashion this natasha noticed at once he sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess arranging with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand like a skin and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his lips about the amusements of the highest petersburg society recalling with mild irony old times in moscow and moscow acquaintances it was not accidentally natasha felt that he alluded when speaking of the highest aristocracy to an ball he had attended and to invitations he had received from and 
 all this time natasha sat silent glancing up at him from under her brows this gaze disturbed and confused boris more and more he looked round more frequently toward her and broke off in what he was saying he did not stay more than ten minutes then rose and took his leave the same inquisitive challenging and rather mocking eyes still looked at him after his first visit boris said to himself that natasha attracted him just as much as ever but that he must not yield to that feeling because to marry her a girl almost without fortune would mean ruin to his career while to renew their former relations without intending to marry her would be dishonorable boris made up his mind to avoid meeting natasha but despite that resolution he called again a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the rostovs it seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with natasha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten that in spite of everything she could not be his wife that he had no means and they would never let her marry him but he failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on such an explanation from day to day he became more and more entangled it seemed to her mother and sonya that natasha was in love with boris as of old she sang him his favorite songs showed him her album making him write in it did not allow him to allude to the past letting it be understood how was the present and every day he went away in a fog without having said what he meant to and not knowing what he was doing or why he came or how it would all end he left off visiting helene and received reproachful notes from her every day and yet he continued to spend whole days with the rostovs

 chapter ix 
 
 the man with the bell 
 he walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden he had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat 
 the head was bent down and he did not see him approaching in a few strides jean valjean stood beside him 
 jean valjean accosted him with the cry 
 one hundred francs 
 the man gave a start and raised his eyes 
 you can earn a hundred francs went on jean valjean if you will grant me shelter for this night 
 the moon shone full upon jean terrified countenance 
 what so it is you father madeleine said the man 
 that name thus pronounced at that obscure hour in that unknown spot by that strange man made jean valjean start back 
 he had expected anything but that 
 the person who thus addressed him was a bent and lame old man dressed almost like a peasant who wore on his left knee a leather whence hung a moderately large bell 
 his face which was in the shadow was not distinguishable 
 however the goodman had removed his cap and exclaimed trembling all over 
 ah good god 
 how come you here father madeleine 
 where did you enter 
 did you fall from heaven 
 there is no trouble about that 
 if ever you do fall it will be from there and what a state you are in 
 you have no cravat you have no hat you have no coat 
 do you know you would have frightened any one who did not know you 
 no coat 
 lord god 
 are the saints going mad nowadays 
 but how did you get in here 
 his words tumbled over each other 
 the goodman talked with a rustic volubility in which there was nothing alarming 
 all this was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness 
 who are you and what house is this demanded jean valjean 
 ah pardieu this is too much exclaimed the old man i am the person for whom you got the place here and this house is the one where you had me placed 
 what 
 you recognize me 
 no said jean valjean and how happens it that you know me 
 you saved my life said the man 
 he turned 
 a ray of moonlight outlined his profile and jean valjean recognized old fauchelevent 
 ah said jean valjean so it is you 
 yes i recollect you 
 that is very lucky said the old man in a reproachful tone 
 and what are you doing here resumed jean valjean 
 why i am covering my melons of course 
 in fact at the moment when jean valjean accosted him old fauchelevent held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed 
 during the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them it was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by jean valjean 
 he continued 
 i said to myself the moon is bright 
 it is going to freeze what if i were to put my melons into their greatcoats 
 and he added looking at jean valjean with a broad you ought to have done the same 
 but how do you come here 
 jean valjean finding himself known to this man at least only under the name of madeleine thenceforth advanced only with caution he multiplied his questions 
 strange to say their roles seemed to be reversed 
 it was he the intruder who interrogated 
 and what is this bell which you wear on your knee 
 this replied fauchelevent is so that i may be avoided 
 
 what so that you may be avoided 
 old fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air 
 ah goodness there are only women in this young girls it appears that i should be a dangerous person to meet 
 the bell gives them warning 
 when i come they go 
 what house is this 
 come you know well enough 
 but i do not 
 not when you got me the place here as gardener 
 answer me as though i knew nothing 
 well then this is the convent 
 memories recurred to jean valjean 
 chance that is to say providence had cast him into precisely that convent in the quartier where old fauchelevent crippled by the fall from his cart had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously he repeated as though talking to himself 
 the convent 
 exactly returned old fauchelevent 
 but to come to the point how the deuce did you manage to get in here you father madeleine no matter if you are a saint you are a man as well and no man enters here 
 you certainly are here 
 there is no one but me 
 still said jean valjean i must stay here 
 ah good god cried fauchelevent 
 jean valjean drew near to the old man and said to him in a grave voice 
 father fauchelevent i saved your life 
 i was the first to recall it returned fauchelevent 
 well you can do for me that which i did for you in the olden days 
 fauchelevent took in his aged trembling and wrinkled hands jean two robust hands and stood for several minutes as though incapable of speaking 
 at length he exclaimed 
 oh that would be a blessing from the good god if i could make you some little return for that 
 save your life 
 monsieur le maire dispose of the old man 
 a wonderful joy had transfigured this old man 
 his countenance seemed to emit a ray of light 
 what do you wish me to do he resumed 
 that i will explain to you 
 you have a chamber 
 i have an isolated hovel yonder behind the ruins of the old convent in a corner which no one ever looks into 
 there are three rooms in it 
 the hut was in fact so well hidden behind the ruins and so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen that jean valjean had not perceived it 
 good said jean valjean 
 now i am going to ask two things of you 
 what are they mr mayor 
 in the first place you are not to tell any one what you know about me in the second you are not to try to find out anything more 
 as you please 
 i know that you can do nothing that is not honest that you have always been a man after the good heart and then moreover you it was who placed me here 
 that concerns you i am at your service 
 that is settled then 
 now come with me 
 we will go and get the child 
 ah said fauchelevent so there is a child 
 he added not a word further and followed jean valjean as a dog follows his master 
 less than half an hour afterwards cosette who had grown rosy again before the flame of a good fire was lying asleep in the old bed 
 jean valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more his hat which he had flung over the wall had been found and picked up 
 while jean valjean was putting on his coat fauchelevent had removed the bell and kneecap which now hung on a nail beside a vintage basket that adorned the wall 
 the two men were warming themselves with their elbows resting on a table upon which fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese black bread a bottle of wine and two glasses and the old man was saying to jean valjean as he laid his hand on the knee 
 ah 
 father madeleine you did not recognize me immediately you save lives and then you forget them 
 that is bad 
 but they remember you you are an ingrate

 book six 
 chapter xiii 
 
 one night when the old countess in nightcap and dressing jacket without her false curls and with her poor little knob of hair showing under her white cotton cap knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and bowing to the ground in prayer her door creaked and natasha also in a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in curlpapers ran in the countess her prayerful mood dispelled looked round and frowned she was finishing her last prayer can it be that this couch will be my grave natasha flushed and eager seeing her mother in prayer suddenly checked her rush half sat down and unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself seeing that her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and rapidly slipping one little foot against the other pushed off her slippers and jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave this couch was high with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than the one below natasha jumped on it sank into the feather bed rolled over to the wall and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled down raising her knees to her chin kicking out and laughing almost inaudibly now covering herself up head and all and now peeping at her mother the countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a stern face but seeing that head was covered she smiled in her kind weak way 
 now then now then said she 
 mamma can we have a talk yes said natasha now just one on your throat and another do and seizing her mother round the neck she kissed her on the throat in her behavior to her mother natasha seemed rough but she was so sensitive and tactful that however she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased 
 well what is it tonight said the mother having arranged her pillows and waited until natasha after turning over a couple of times had settled down beside her under the quilt spread out her arms and assumed a serious expression 
 these visits of at night before the count returned from his club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother and daughter 
 what is it tonight but i have to tell you 
 natasha put her hand on her mouth 
 about boris i know she said seriously what i have come about say it i know no do tell me and she removed her hand tell me mamma nice 
 natasha you are sixteen at your age i was married you say boris is nice he is very nice and i love him like a son but what then what are you thinking about you have quite turned his head i can see that 
 as she said this the countess looked round at her daughter natasha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead so that the countess only saw her face in profile that face struck her by its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression 
 natasha was listening and considering 
 well what then said she 
 you have quite turned his head and why what do you want of him you know you marry him 
 why not said natasha without changing her position 
 because he is young because he is poor because he is a relation and because you yourself love him 
 how do you know 
 i know it is not right darling 
 but if i want to said natasha 
 leave off talking nonsense said the countess 
 but if i want to 
 natasha i am in earnest 
 natasha did not let her finish she drew the countess large hand to her kissed it on the back and then on the palm then again turned it over and began kissing first one knuckle then the space between the knuckles then the next knuckle whispering january february march april may speak mamma why you say anything speak said she turning to her mother who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say 
 it do my love not everyone will understand this friendship dating from your childish days and to see him so intimate with you may injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us and above all it torments him for nothing he may already have found a suitable and wealthy match and now half crazy 
 crazy repeated natasha 
 tell you some things about myself i had a cousin 
 i know cyril matveich but he is old 
 he was not always old but this is what do natasha have a talk with boris he need not come so often 
 why not if he likes to 
 because i know it will end in nothing 
 how can you know no mamma speak to him what nonsense said natasha in the tone of one being deprived of her property well i marry but let him come if he enjoys it and i enjoy it natasha smiled and looked at her mother not to marry but just so she added 
 how so my pet 
 just so no need for me to marry him but just so 
 just so just so repeated the countess and shaking all over she went off into a good humored unexpected elderly laugh 
 laugh stop cried natasha shaking the whole bed awfully like me just such another giggler wait and she seized the countess hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger saying june and continued kissing july august on the other hand but mamma is he very much in love what do you think was anybody ever so much in love with you and very nice very very nice only not quite my taste he is so narrow like the clock you understand narrow you know gray light gray 
 what rubbish talking said the countess 
 natasha continued you really understand nicholas would understand bezukhov now is blue and red and he is square 
 you flirt with him too said the countess laughing 
 no he is a freemason i have found out he is fine and red how can i explain it to you 
 little countess the voice called from behind the door not asleep natasha jumped up snatched up her slippers and ran barefoot to her own room 
 it was a long time before she could sleep she kept thinking that no one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her 
 sonya she thought glancing at that sleeping little kitten with her enormous plait of hair no how could she virtuous she fell in love with nicholas and does not wish to know anything more even mamma does not understand it is wonderful how clever i am and how charming she is she went on speaking of herself in the third person and imagining it was some very wise man the wisest and best of men who was saying it of her there is everything everything in her continued this man she is unusually intelligent charming and then she is pretty uncommonly pretty and agile she swims and rides splendidly and her voice one can really say a wonderful voice 
 she hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by cherubini threw herself on her bed laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately fall asleep called dunyasha the maid to put out the candle and before dunyasha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier world of dreams where everything was as light and beautiful as in reality and even more so because it was different 
 next day the countess called boris aside and had a talk with him after which he ceased coming to the rostovs

 of greatplace 
 men in great place are thrice servants servants of the sovereign or state servants of fame and servants of business so as they have no freedom neither in their persons nor in their actions nor in their times it is a strange desire to seek power and to lose liberty or to seek power over others and to lose power over a self 
 the rising unto place is laborious and by pains men come to greater pains 
 and it is sometimes base and by indignities men come to dignities the standing 
 is slippery and the regress is either a downfall or at least an eclipse which is 
 a melancholy thing cum non sis qui fueris non vivere nay retire men cannot when they would neither will they when it were reason but are impatient of privateness even in age and sickness which require the shadow like old townsmen that will be still sitting at their street door though thereby they offer age to scorn certainly great persons had need to borrow other opinions to think themselves happy for if they judge by their own feeling they cannot find it but if they think with themselves what other men think of them and that other men would fain be as they are then they are happy as it were by report when perhaps they find the contrary within for they are the first that find their own griefs though they be the last that find their own faults 
 certainly men in great fortunes are strangers to themselves and while they are in the pulse of business they have no time to tend their health either of body or mind illi mars gravis incubat qui notus nimis omnibus ignotus moritur sibi in place there is licence to do good and evil whereof the latter is a curse for in evil the best condition is not to will the second not to can but power to do good is the true and lawful end of aspiring 
 for good thoughts though god accept them yet towards men are little better then good dreams except they be put in act and that cannot be without power and place as the vantage and commanding ground merit and good works is the end of motion and conscience of the same is the accomplishment of rest for if a man can be partaker of theatre he shall likewise be partaker of rest et conversus deus ut aspiceret opera quae fecerunt manus suae vidit quod omnia essent bona nimis and then the sabbath in the discharge of thy place set before thee the best examples for imitation is a globe of precepts and after a time set before thee thine own example and examine thy self strictly whether thou didst not best at first neglect not also the examples of those that have carried themselves ill in the same place not to set off thy self by taxing their memory but to direct thy self what to avoid reform therefore without bravery or scandal of former times and persons but yet set it down to thyself as well to create good precedents as to follow them 
 reduce things to the first institution and observe wherein and how they have degenerate but yet ask counsel of both times of the ancient time what is best and of the latter time what is fittest seek to make thy course regular that men may know beforehand what they may expect but be not too positive and peremptory and express thyself well when thou digresses from thy rule preserve the right of thy place but stir not questions of jurisdiction and rather assume thy right in silence and de facto than voice it with claims and challenges preserve likewise the rights of inferior places and think it more honour to direct in chief than to be busy in all embrace and invite helps and advices touching the execution of thy place and do not drive away such as bring thee information as meddlers but accept of them in good part 
 the vices of authority are chiefly four delays corruption roughness and facility for delays give easy access keep times appointed go through with that which is in hand and interlace not business but of necessity for corruption do not only bind thine own hands or thy servants hands from taking but bind the hands of suitors also from offering for integrity used doth the one but integrity professed and with a manifest detestation of bribery doth the other and avoid not only the fault but the suspicion whosoever is found variable and changeth manifestly without manifest cause giveth suspicion of corruption 
 therefore always when thou changes thine opinion or course profess 
 it plainly and declare it together with the reasons that move thee to change and 
 do not think to steal it a servant or a favourite if he be inward and no other 
 apparent cause of esteem is commonly thought but a to close corruption for roughness it is a needless cause of discontent severity hreedeth fear but roughness hreedeth hate even reproofs from authority ought to be grave and not taunting as for facility it is worse then bribery for bribes come but now and then but if importunity or idle respects lead a man he shall never be without as solomon saith to respect persons is not good for such a man will transgress for a peace of bread 
 it is most true that was anciently spoken a place sheweth the man and it showeth some to the better and some to the worse omnium consensu capax imperii nisi imperasset saith tacitus of galba but of vespasian he saith solus imperantium vespasianus mutatus in melius though the one was meant of sufficiency the other of manners and affection it is an assured sign of a worthy and generous spirit whom honour amends for honour is or should be the place of virtue and as in nature things move violently to their place and calmly in their place so virtue in ambition is violent in authority settled and calm 
 all rising to great place is by a winding stair and if there be factions it is good to side a self whilst he is in the rising and to balance himself when he is placed use me memory of thy predecessor fairly and tenderly for if thou dost not it is a debt will sure be paid when thou art gone if thou have colleagues respect them and rather call them when they look not for it than exclude them when they have reason to look to be called be not too sensible or too remembering of my place in conversation and private answers to suitors but let it rather be said when he sits in place he is another man

 book just man 
 chapter x 
 
 the bishop in the presence of an unknown light 
 at an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding pages he did a thing which if the whole town was to be believed was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits 
 in the country near d a man lived quite alone 
 this man we will state at once was a former member of the convention his name was g 
 member of the convention g was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of d a member of the you imagine such a thing 
 that existed from the time when people called each other thou and when they said citizen 
 this man was almost a monster 
 he had not voted for the death of the king but almost 
 he was a he had been a terrible man how did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a court on the return of the legitimate princes they need not have cut off his head if you please clemency must be exercised agreed but a good banishment for life 
 an example in short etc 
 besides he was an atheist like all the rest of those people 
 gossip of the geese about the vulture 
 was g a vulture after all 
 yes if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his 
 as he had not voted for the death of the king he had not been included in the decrees of exile and had been able to remain in france 
 he dwelt at a distance of of an hour from the city far from any hamlet far from any road in some hidden turn of a very wild valley no one knew exactly where 
 he had there it was said a sort of field a hole a lair 
 there were no neighbors not even since he had dwelt in that valley the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass the locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman 
 nevertheless the bishop meditated on the subject and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the convention and he said there is a soul yonder which is lonely 
 and he added deep in his own mind i owe him a visit 
 but let us avow it this idea which seemed natural at the first blush appeared to him after a reflection as strange impossible and almost repulsive 
 for at bottom he shared the general impression and the old member of the convention inspired him without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself with that sentiment which borders on hate and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement 
 still should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil no but what a sheep 
 the good bishop was perplexed 
 sometimes he set out in that direction then he returned 
 finally the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd who served the member of the convention in his hovel had come in quest of a doctor that the old wretch was dying that paralysis was gaining on him and that he would not live over god some added 
 the bishop took his staff put on his cloak on account of his too threadbare cassock as we have mentioned and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon and set out 
 the sun was setting and had almost touched the horizon when the bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot 
 with a certain beating of the heart he recognized the fact that he was near the lair he strode over a ditch leaped a hedge made his way through a fence of dead boughs entered a neglected paddock took a few steps with a good deal of boldness and suddenly at the extremity of the waste land and behind lofty brambles he caught sight of the cavern 
 it was a very low hut poor small and clean with a vine nailed against the outside 
 near the door in an old the of the peasants there was a man smiling at the sun 
 near the seated man stood a young boy the shepherd lad he was offering the old man a jar of milk 
 while the bishop was watching him the old man spoke 
 thank you he said i need nothing 
 and his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child 
 the bishop stepped forward 
 at the sound which he made in walking the old man turned his head and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life 
 this is the first time since i have been here said he that any one has entered here 
 who are you sir 
 the bishop answered 
 my name is bienvenu myriel 
 bienvenu myriel 
 i have heard that name 
 are you the man whom the people call monseigneur welcome 
 i am 
 the old man resumed with a 
 in that case you are my bishop 
 something of that sort 
 enter sir 
 the member of the convention extended his hand to the bishop but the bishop did not take it 
 the bishop confined himself to the remark 
 i am pleased to see that i have been misinformed 
 you certainly do not seem to me to be ill 
 monsieur replied the old man i am going to recover 
 he paused and then said 
 i shall die three hours hence 
 then he continued 
 i am something of a doctor i know in what fashion the last hour draws on 
 yesterday only my feet were cold the chill has ascended to my knees now i feel it mounting to my waist when it reaches the heart i shall stop 
 the sun is beautiful is it not 
 i had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things 
 you can talk to me it does not fatigue me 
 you have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death it is well that there should be witnesses at that moment 
 one has caprices i should have liked to last until the dawn but i know that i shall hardly live three hours 
 it will be night then what does it matter after all 
 dying is a simple affair one has no need of the light for that 
 so be it 
 i shall die by starlight 
 the old man turned to the shepherd lad 
 go to thy bed thou wert awake all last night thou art tired 
 the child entered the hut 
 the old man followed him with his eyes and added as though speaking to himself 
 i shall die while he sleeps 
 the two slumbers may be good neighbors 
 the bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been he did not think he discerned god in this manner of dying let us say the whole for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest 
 he who on occasion was so fond of laughing at his grace was rather shocked at not being addressed as monseigneur and he was almost tempted to retort citizen he was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity common enough to doctors and priests but which was not habitual with him this man after all this member of the convention this representative of the people had been one of the powerful ones of the earth for the first time in his life probably the bishop felt in a mood to be severe 
 meanwhile the member of the convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality in which one could have distinguished possibly that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust 
 the bishop on his side although he generally restrained his curiosity which in his opinion bordered on a fault could not refrain from examining the member of the convention with an attention which as it did not have its course in sympathy would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach in connection with any other man a member of the convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law even of the law of charity 
 g calm his body almost upright his voice vibrating was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist the revolution had many of these men proportioned to the epoch in this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof though so near to his end he preserved all the gestures of health in his clear glance in his firm tone in the robust movement of his shoulders there was something calculated to disconcert death azrael the mohammedan angel of the sepulchre would have turned back and thought that he had mistaken the door 
 g seemed to be dying because he willed it so 
 there was freedom in his agony 
 his legs alone were motionless 
 it was there that the shadows held him fast his feet were cold and dead but his head survived with all the power of life and seemed full of light 
 g at this solemn moment resembled the king in that tale of the orient who was flesh above and marble below 
 there was a stone there 
 the bishop sat down 
 the exordium was abrupt 
 i congratulate you said he in the tone which one uses for a reprimand 
 you did not vote for the death of the king after all 
 the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all 
 he replied the smile had quite disappeared from his face 
 do not congratulate me too much sir 
 i did vote for the death of the tyrant 
 it was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity 
 what do you mean to say resumed the bishop 
 i mean to say that man has a 
 i voted for the death of that tyrant 
 that tyrant engendered royalty which is authority falsely understood while science is authority rightly understood man should be governed only by science 
 and conscience added the bishop 
 it is the same thing 
 conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us 
 monseigneur bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language which was very new to him 
 the member of the convention resumed 
 so far as louis xvi 
 was concerned i said no i did not think that i had the right to kill a man but i felt it my duty to exterminate evil 
 i voted the end of the tyrant that is to say the end of prostitution for woman the end of slavery for man the end of night for the child 
 in voting for the republic i voted for that 
 i voted for fraternity concord the dawn i have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors 
 the crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light 
 we have caused the fall of the old world and the old world that vase of miseries has become through its upsetting upon the human race an urn of joy 
 mixed joy said the bishop 
 you may say troubled joy and after that fatal return of the past which is called joy which has disappeared alas 
 the work was incomplete i admit 
 we demolished the ancient regime in deeds we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas to destroy abuses is not sufficient customs must be modified the mill is there no longer the wind is still there 
 you have demolished 
 it may be of use to demolish but i distrust a demolition complicated with wrath 
 right has its wrath bishop and the wrath of right is an element of progress 
 in any case and in spite of whatever may be said the french revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of christ 
 incomplete it may be but sublime it set free all the unknown social quantities it softened spirits it calmed appeased enlightened it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth 
 it was a good thing 
 the french revolution is the consecration of humanity 
 the bishop could not refrain from murmuring 
 yes 
 the member of the convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity and exclaimed so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation 
 ah there you go 
 i was expecting that word 
 a cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst 
 you are putting the thunderbolt on its trial 
 the bishop felt without perhaps confessing it that something within him had suffered extinction 
 nevertheless he put a good face on the matter 
 he replied 
 the judge speaks in the name of justice the priest speaks in the name of pity which is nothing but a more lofty justice a thunderbolt should commit no error 
 and he added regarding the member of the convention steadily the while louis xvii 
 the conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the arm 
 louis xvii let us see 
 for whom do you mourn is it for the innocent child very good in that case i mourn with you is it for the royal child 
 i demand time for reflection to me the brother of cartouche an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the place de greve until death ensued for the sole crime of having been the brother of cartouche is no less painful than the grandson of louis xv an innocent child martyred in the tower of the temple for the sole crime of having been grandson of louis xv 
 monsieur said the bishop i like not this conjunction of names 
 cartouche 
 louis xv to which of the two do you object 
 a momentary silence ensued 
 the bishop almost regretted having come and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken 
 the conventionary resumed 
 ah monsieur priest you love not the crudities of the true christ loved them 
 he seized a rod and cleared out the temple his scourge full of lightnings was a harsh speaker of truths when he cried sinite parvulos he made no distinction between the little children 
 it would not have embarrassed him to bring together the dauphin of barabbas and the dauphin of herod 
 innocence monsieur is its own crown 
 innocence has no need to be a highness it is as august in rags as in fleurs de lys 
 that is true said the bishop in a low voice 
 i persist continued the conventionary g you have mentioned louis xvii 
 to me 
 let us come to an understanding 
 shall we weep for all the innocent all martyrs all children the lowly as well as the exalted 
 i agree to that 
 but in that case as i have told you we must go back further than and our tears must begin before louis xvii 
 i will weep with you over the children of kings provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people 
 i weep for all said the bishop 
 equally exclaimed conventionary g and if the balance must incline let it be on the side of the people 
 they have been suffering longer 
 another silence ensued 
 the conventionary was the first to break it he raised himself on one elbow took a bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger as one does mechanically when one interrogates and judges and appealed to the bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony 
 it was almost an explosion 
 yes sir the people have been suffering a long while 
 and hold that is not all either why have you just questioned me and talked to me about louis xvii i know you not 
 ever since i have been in these parts i have dwelt in this enclosure alone never setting foot outside and seeing no one but that child who helps me your name has reached me in a confused manner it is true and very badly pronounced i must admit but that signifies nothing 
 clever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman the people by the way i did not hear the sound of your carriage you have left it yonder behind the coppice at the fork of the roads no doubt i do not know you i tell you 
 you have told me that you are the bishop but that affords me no information as to your moral personality in short i repeat my question 
 who are you 
 you are a bishop that is to say a prince of the church one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and revenues who have vast prebends the bishopric of d fifteen thousand francs settled income ten thousand in perquisites total thousand francs who have kitchens who have liveries who make good cheer who eat on friday who strut about a lackey before a lackey behind in a gala coach and who have palaces and who roll in their carriages in the name of jesus christ who went barefoot you are a palace horses servants good table all the sensualities of life you have this like the rest and like the rest you enjoy it it is well but this says either too much or too little this does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom to me 
 to whom do i speak who are you 
 the bishop hung his head and replied vermis am a worm 
 a worm of the earth in a carriage growled the conventionary 
 it was the turn to be arrogant and the to be humble 
 the bishop resumed mildly 
 so be it sir 
 but explain to me how my carriage which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder how my good table and the which i eat on friday how my thousand francs income how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty and that was not inexorable 
 the conventionary passed his hand across his brow as though to sweep away a cloud 
 before replying to you he said i beseech you to pardon me i have just committed a wrong sir 
 you are at my house you are my guest i owe you courtesy 
 you discuss my ideas and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments 
 your riches and your pleasures are advantages which i hold over you in the debate but good taste dictates that i shall not make use of them 
 i promise you to make no use of them in the future 
 i thank you said the bishop 
 g resumed 
 let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me where were we 
 what were you saying to me 
 that was inexorable 
 inexorable yes said the bishop 
 what think you of marat clapping his hands at the guillotine 
 what think you of bossuet chanting the te deum over the dragonnades 
 the retort was a harsh one but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel 
 the bishop quivered under it no reply occurred to him but he was offended by this mode of alluding to bossuet 
 the best of minds will have their fetiches and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic 
 the conventionary began to pant the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice still there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes 
 he went on 
 let me say a few words more in this and that direction i am willing 
 apart from the revolution which taken as a whole is an immense human affirmation is alas a rejoinder you think it inexorable sir but what of the whole monarchy sir carrier is a bandit but what name do you give to montrevel is a rascal but what is your opinion as to maillard is terrible but if you please 
 duchene senior is ferocious but what epithet will you allow me for the elder letellier 
 is a monster but not so great a one as m the marquis de louvois sir sir i am sorry for marie antoinette archduchess and queen but i am also sorry for that poor huguenot woman who in under louis the great sir while with a nursing infant was bound naked to the waist to a stake and the child kept at a distance her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish the little one hungry and pale beheld that breast and cried and agonized the executioner said to the woman a mother and a nurse abjure giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience 
 what say you to that torture of tantalus as applied to a mother 
 bear this well in mind sir the french revolution had its reasons for existence its wrath will be absolved by the future its result is the world made better from its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race 
 i abridge i stop i have too much the advantage moreover i am dying 
 and ceasing to gaze at the bishop the conventionary concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words 
 yes the brutalities of progress are called revolutions when they are over this fact is the human race has been treated harshly but that it has progressed 
 the conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the bishop 
 one remained however and from this intrenchment the last resource of monseigneur resistance came forth this reply wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning 
 progress should believe in god 
 good cannot have an impious servitor he who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race 
 the former representative of the people made no reply 
 he was seized with a fit of trembling 
 he looked towards heaven and in his glance a tear gathered slowly 
 when the eyelid was full the tear trickled down his livid cheek and he said almost in a stammer quite low and to himself while his eyes were plunged in the depths 
 o thou 
 o ideal 
 thou alone existest 
 the bishop experienced an indescribable shock 
 after a pause the old man raised a finger heavenward and said 
 the infinite is 
 he is there 
 if the infinite had no person person would be without limit it would not be infinite in other words it would not exist 
 there is then an i that i of the infinite is god 
 the dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice and with the shiver of ecstasy as though he beheld some one when he had spoken his eyes closed 
 the effort had exhausted him it was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him 
 that which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death 
 the supreme moment was approaching 
 the bishop understood this time pressed it was as a priest that he had come 
 from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion he gazed at those closed eyes he took that wrinkled aged and hand in his and bent over the dying man 
 this hour is the hour of god 
 do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain 
 the conventionary opened his eyes again 
 a gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance 
 bishop said he with a slowness which probably arose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength i have passed my life in meditation study and contemplation i was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs 
 i obeyed 
 abuses existed i combated them tyrannies existed i destroyed them rights and principles existed i proclaimed and confessed them 
 our territory was invaded i defended it france was menaced i offered my breast i was not rich i am poor 
 i have been one of the masters of the state the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver i dined in dead tree street at sous i have succored the oppressed i have comforted the suffering i tore the cloth from the altar it is true but it was to bind up the wounds of my country 
 i have always upheld the march forward of the human race forward towards the light and i have sometimes resisted progress without pity 
 i have when the occasion offered protected my own adversaries men of your profession 
 and there is at peteghem in flanders at the very spot where the merovingian kings had their summer palace a convent of urbanists the abbey of sainte claire en beaulieu which i saved in 
 i have done my duty according to my powers and all the good that i was able after which i was hunted down pursued persecuted blackened jeered at scorned cursed proscribed 
 for many years past i with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me to the poor ignorant masses i present the visage of one damned 
 and i accept this isolation of hatred without hating any one myself 
 now i am years old i am on the point of death 
 what is it that you have come to ask of me 
 your blessing said the bishop 
 and he knelt down 
 when the bishop raised his head again the face of the conventionary had become august 
 he had just expired 
 the bishop returned home deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot be known to us 
 he passed the whole night in prayer on the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the convention g he contented himself with pointing heavenward 
 from that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers 
 any allusion to that old wretch of a g caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation 
 no one could say that the passage of that soul before his and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his did not count for something in his approach to perfection 
 this pastoral visit naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries 
 was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop 
 there was evidently no conversion to be expected all those revolutionists are backsliders 
 then why go there what was there to be seen there 
 he must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil 
 one day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual addressed this sally to him monseigneur people are inquiring when your greatness will receive the red oh a coarse color replied the bishop it is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat

 a new hope 
 x 
 
 lined with power cables and circuitry conduits that rose from the depths and vanishedinto the heavens the service trench appeared to be hundreds of kilometers deep thenarrow catwalk running around one side looked like a starched thread glued on aglowing ocean it was barely wide enough for one man to traverse 
 one man edged his way along that treacherous walkway now his gaze intent onsomething ahead of him instead of the awesome metal abyss below the clackingsounds of enormous switching devices resounded like captive leviathans in the vastopen space tireless and never sleeping 
 two thick cables joined beneath an overlay panel it was locked but aftercareful inspection of sides top and bottom ben kenobi pressed the panel cover in aparticular fashion causing it to spring aside a blinking computer terminal wasrevealed beneath 
 with equal care he performed several adjustments to the terminal his actionswere rewarded when several indicator lights on the board changed from red to blue 
 without warning a secondary door close behind him opened hurriedlyreclosing the panel cover the old man slipped deeper into the shadows adetachment of troopers had appeared in the portal and the officer in charge moved towithin a couple of meters of the motionless hidden figure 
 secure this area until the alert has been cancelled 
 as they began to disperse kenobi became one with the dark 
 chewbacca grunted and wheezed and barely succeeded in forcing his thick torsothrough the hatchway opening with and help that turned to take stock of their surroundings 
 the hallway they had emerged into showed dust on the floor it gave theimpression of not having been used since the station had been built probably it wasonly a repair access corridor he had no idea where they were 
 something hit the wall behind them with a massive thunk and luke yelled foreveryone to watch out as a long gelatinous limb worked its way through the hatchand flailed hopefully about in the open corridor solo aimed his pistol at it as leiatried to slip past the chewbacca 
 somebody get this big hairy walking carpet out of my way suddenly shenoticed what solo was preparing to do no wait be heard 
 solo ignored her and fired at the hatchway the burst of energy was rewardedwith a distant roar as an avalanche of weakened wall and beaming all but buried thecreature in the chamber beyond 
 magnified by the narrow corridor the sounds continued to roll and echo for longminutes afterward luke shook his head in disgust realizing that someone like solowho spoke with the mouth of a gun might not always act sensibly until now he hadsort of looked up to the corellian but the senseless gesture of firing at the hatchwaybrought them for the first time in mind to the same level 
 the actions were more surprising than however listen shebegan staring up at him i know where you came from but as an afterthought she glanced back at luke adding to both of you herattention turned back to solo but from now on you do as i tell you 
 solo gaped at her this time the smug smile come look yourholiness he was finally able to stammer get something straight i takeorders only from one 
 a wonder still alive she shot back smoothly a quick look downthe corridor and she had started determinedly off in the other direction 
 solo looked at luke started to say something then hesitated and simply shookhis head slowly no reward is worth this i know if enough credit inthe universe to pay for putting up with herhey slow down 
 leia had started around a bend in the corridor and they ran swiftly to catch upwith her 
 the half dozen troops milling around the entrance to the power trench were moreinterested in discussing the peculiar disturbance in the detention block than in payingattention to their present boring duty so engrossed were they in speculation as tothe cause of the trouble that they failed to notice the fey wraith behind them itmoved from shadow to shadow like a ferret freezing when one of thetroopers seemed to turn slightly in its direction moving on again as if walking on air 
 several minutes later one of the troopers frowned inside his armor turning towhere he thought he had sensed a movement near the opening to the main was nothing but an undefinable something which the kenobi hadleft behind acutely uncomfortable yet understandably unwilling to confess tohallucinations the trooper turned back to the more prosaic conversation of his fellows someone finally discovered the two unconscious guards tied in the service lockerson board the captured freighter both men remained comatose despite all efforts torevive them 
 under the direction of several bickering officers troopers carried their twoarmorless comrades down the ramp and toward the nearest hospital bay on the waythey passed two forms hidden by a small opened service panel threepio and artoowent unnoticed despite their proximity to the hangar 
 as soon as the troops had passed artoo finished removing a socket cover andhurriedly shoved his sensor arm into the opening lights commenced a wild flashingon his face and smoke started issuing from several seams in the small droid before afrantic threepio could pull the arm free 
 immediately the smoke vanished the undisciplined blinking faded to emitted a few wilted beeps successfully giving the impression of a human whohad expected a glass of mild wine and instead unwittingly downed several gulps ofsomething proof 
 well next time watch where you stick your sensors threepio chastised hiscompanion you could have fried your insides he eyed the socket apower outlet stupid not an information terminal 
 artoo whistled a mournful apology together they hunted for the proper outlet 
 luke solo chewbacca and the princess reached the end of an empty before a large window which overlooked a hangar giving them asweeping tantalizing view of the freighter just below 
 pulling out his comlink and looking around them with increasing spoke into the pickup see threepiodo you copy 
 there was a threatening pause then i read you sir we had to abandon theregion around the office 
 are you both safe 
 for the moment though not sanguine about my old age in themain hangar across from the ship 
 luke looked toward the bay window in surprise i see you across must be right above you stand by join you as soon as we clicked off smiling suddenly at reference to his old the tall droid was more human than people 
 wonder if the old man was able to knock out the tractors solo was mutteringas he surveyed the scene below a dozen or so troopers were moving in and out ofthe freighter 
 getting back to the going to be like flying through the five fire rings offornax leia organa turned long enough to glance in surprise from the ship to came here in that wreck braver than i thought 
 at once praised and insulted solo sure how to react he settled forgiving her a dirty look as they started back down the hallway chewbacca bringing upthe rear 
 rounding a corner the three humans came to an abrupt halt so did the twentyimperial troopers marching toward them reacting is to drew his pistol and charged the platoon yelling and howlingin several languages at the top of his lungs 
 startled by the totally unexpected assault and wrongly assuming their attackerknew what he was doing the troopers started to back away several wild shots fromthe pistol initiated complete panic ranks and composure shattered thetroopers broke and fled down the passage 
 drunk with his own prowess solo continued the chase turning to shout back atluke get to the ship take care of these 
 are you out of your mind luke yelled at him where do you think 
 but solo had already rounded a far bend in the corridor and hear notthat it would have made any difference 
 upset at his disappearance chewbacca let out a thunderous if unsettledhowl and rushed down the hallway after him that left luke and leia standing alonein the empty corridor 
 maybe i was too hard on your friend he confessed reluctantly he certainlyis courageous 
 he certainly is an idiot a furious luke countered tightly i know whatgood do us if he gets himself killed muted alarms suddenly sounded from thebay below and behind them 
 done it luke growled disgustedly go together they startedoff in search of a way down to a level 
 solo continued his rout of all opposition running at top speed down the longhallway yelling and brandishing his pistol occasionally he got off a shot whoseeffect was more valuable psychologically than tactically 
 half the troops had already scattered down various subpassages and ten troopers he continued to harry still raced headlong away from him up againsta dead end which forced them to turn and confront their opponents 
 seeing that the ten had halted solo likewise slowed gradually he came to acomplete stop corellian and imperials regarded one another silently several ofthe troopers were staring not at han but past him 
 it suddenly occurred to solo that he was very much alone and the same thoughtwas beginning to seep into the minds of the guards he was gave way rapidly to anger rifles and pistols started to come took a step backward fired one shot then turned and ran like hell 
 chewbacca heard the whistle and crump of energy weapons firing as helumbered lightly down the corridor there was something odd about them sounded as if they were coming closer instead of moving away 
 he was debating what to do when solo came tearing around a corner and nearlyran him down seeing ten troopers in pursuit the wookie decided to reserve hisquestion for a less confused moment he turned and followed solo back up thehallway 
 luke grabbed the princess and pulled her back into a recess she was about toretort angrily at his brusqueness when the sound of marching feet caused her to shrinkback into the darkness with him 
 a squad of soldiers hurried past responding to the alarms that continued to ringsteadily luke looked out at the retreating backs and tried to catch his breath ouronly hope of reaching the ship is from the other side of the hangar they alreadyknow here he started back down the corridor motioning for her tofollow 
 two guards appeared at the far end of the passageway paused and pointeddirectly at them turning luke and leia began running back the way they had larger squad of troopers rounded the far bend and came racing toward them 
 blocking ahead and behind they hunted frantically for another way out thenleia spotted the cramped subhallway and gestured to it 
 luke fired at the nearest of their pursuers and joined her in running down thepassage it looked like a minor service corridor behind them pursuit soundeddeafeningly loud in the confining space but at least it minimized the amount of firethe troops could concentrate on them 
 a thick hatchway appeared ahead the lighting beyond turned dimmer hopes if they could lock the hatch even for a few moments and lostthemselves somewhere beyond they might have a chance of shaking their immediatetormentors 
 but the hatch stayed open showing no inclination to close automatically lukewas about to let out a shout of triumph when the ground suddenly vanished ahead ofhim his toes hanging over nothingness he failed to regain his balance succeedingjust in time to nearly go over the edge of the retracted catwalk anyway as the princessplowed into him from behind 
 the catwalk had been reduced to a stub protruding into empty air a cool draftcaressed face as he studied walls that soared to unseen heights overhead andplunged to fathomless depths below the service shaft was employed in circulatingand recycling the atmosphere of the station 
 at the moment luke was too frightened and concerned to be angry with theprincess for his attention a burst of energy exploded above their heads sendingmetal slivers flying 
 i think we made a wrong turn he murmured firing back at the advancingtroops and illuminating the narrow corridor behind them with destruction 
 an open hatchway showed on the other side of the chasm it might as wellhave been a away hunting along the rim of the doorway leia located aswitch and hit it quickly the hatch door behind them slid shut with a resoundingboom at least that cut off the fire from the rapidly nearing soldiers it also left thetwo fugitives balanced precariously on a small section of catwalk barely a metersquare if the remaining section were to unexpectedly withdraw into the wall theywould see more of the battle interior than either wished 
 gesturing for the princess to move aside as much as possible luke shielded hiseyes and aimed the pistol at the hatch controls a brief burst of energy melted themflush with the wall insuring that no one could open it easily from the other he turned his attention to the vast cavity blocking their path to the oppositeportal it beckoned small yellow rectangle of freedom 
 only the soft rush of air from below sounded until luke commented this is door but it hold them back very long 
 got to get across there somehow leia agreed once more examining themetal bordering the sealed doorway find the controls for extending the bridge 
 some desperate searching produced nothing while an ominous pounding andhissing sounded from behind the frozen door a small spot of white appeared in thecenter of the metal then began to spread and smoke 
 coming through luke groaned 
 the princess turned carefully to stare across the gap this must be a bridge with the controls only on the other side 
 reaching up to the point at the panel holding the unreachable controls caught on something at his waist a frustrated glance downward revealed engendered a bit of practical insanity 
 the cable coiled tightly in small loops was thin and fragile seeming but it wasgeneral line and would have supported weight easily itcertainly ought to hold leia and himself pulling the cable free of the waist catch hegauged its length matching it against the width of the abyss this should span thedistance with plenty to spare 
 what now the princess inquired curiously 
 luke reply instead he removed a small but heavy power unit from theutility belt of his armor and tied one end of the cable around it making sure thewrapping was secure he stepped as close to the edge of their uncertain perch as hedared 
 whirling the weighted end of the cord in increasing circles he let it arc acrossthe gorge it stuck an outcropping of cylindrical conduits on the other side and felldownward with forced patience he pulled the loose line back in then recoiled it foranother try 
 once again the weighted end orbited in ever greater circles and again he flung itacross the gap he could feel the rising heat behind him as he let it go heat from themelting metal doorway 
 this time the heavy end looped around an outcropping of pipes above wrappeditself several times around and slipped battery end down into a crack between backward he tugged and pulled on the cable pulling on it at the same time ashe tried to rest all his weight on it the cable showed no sign of parting 
 wrapping the other end of the line several times around his waist and right reached out and pulled the princess close to him with the other the hatch doorbehind them was now a molten white and liquid metal was running steadily from itsborders 
 something warm and pleasant touched lips shock at the princess hismouth still tingling from the kiss 
 just for luck she murmured with a slight almost embarrassed smile as she puther arms around him going to need it 
 gripping the thin cable as tightly as possible with his left hand luke put hisright over it took a deep breath and jumped out into air if he had miscalculated thedegree of arc in their swing they would miss the open hatch and slam into the metalwall to either side or below it if that happened he doubted he could maintain hisgrip on the rope 
 the transit was accomplished in less time than that thought in amoment luke was on the other side scrambling on his knees to make sure they back into the pit leia released her hold on him with admirable timing sherolled forward and into the open hatchway climbing gracefully to her feet as lukefought to untangle himself from the cable 
 a distant whine became a loud hen a groan as the hatch door on the other sidegave way it collapsed inward and tumbled into the depths if it touched hear it 
 a few bolts struck the wall nearby luke turned his own weapon on theunsuccessful troopers and returned the fire even as leia was pulling him into thepassageway behind 
 once clear of the door he hit the activating switch it shut tightly behind would have several minutes at least without having to worry about being shotin the back on the other hand luke have the slightest idea where they he found himself wondering what had happened to han and chewbacca 
 solo and his wookie partner had succeeded in shaking a portion of their it seemed that whenever they slipped free of several soldiers more appeared totake their place no question about it the word was out on them 
 ahead a series of shield doors was beginning to close 
 hurry chewie solo urged 
 chewbacca grunted once breathing like an overused engine despite hisimmense strength the wookie was not built for sprinting only hisenormous stride had enabled him to keep pace with the lithe corellian chewbaccaleft a couple of hairs in one of the doors but both slipped inside just before the fivelayers slammed shut 
 that ought to hold them for a while solo crowed with delight the wookiegrowled something at him but his partner fairly fluoresced with confidence 
 of course i can find the ship from get lost therecame another growl slightly accusing this time solo shrugged count he a corellian besides i was drunk 
 ben kenobi ducked into the shadows of a narrow passageway seeming tobecome part of the metal itself as a large cluster of troopers hurried past to make certain they had all passed he checked the corridor ahead beforestarting down it but he failed to see the dark silhouette which eclipsed the light farbehind him 
 kenobi had avoided one patrol after another slowly working his way backtoward the docking bay holding the freighter just another two turns and he shouldbe at the hangar what he would do then would be determined by howinconspicuous his charges had been 
 that young luke the adventurous corellian and his partner and the two robotshad been involved in something other than quiet napping he already suspected fromthe amount of activity he had observed while making his way back from the powertrench surely all those troops been out hunting just for him 
 but something else was troubling them judging from the reference he hadoverheard concerning a certain important prisoner now escaped that discovery hadpuzzled him until he considered the restless nature of both luke and han they were involved in some fashion 
 ben sensed something directly ahead and slowed cautiously it had a mostfamiliar feel to it a metal odor he could not quite place 
 then the figure stepped out in front of him blocking his entry to the hangar notfive meters away the outline and size of the figure completed the momentarypuzzle it was the maturity of the mind he had sensed that had temporarily confusedhim his hand moved naturally to the hilt of his deactivated saber 
 i have been waiting a long time kenobi darth vader intonedsolemnly we meet again at last the circle has been completed kenobisensed satisfaction beneath the hideous mask the presence i sensed earlier couldonly have been you 
 kenobi regarded the great form blocking his retreat and nodded slowly hegave the impression of being more curious than impressed you still have much tolearn 
 you were once my teacher vader admitted and i learned much from the time of learning has long passed and i am the master now 
 the logic that had constituted the missing link in his brilliant pupil remained asabsent as before there would be no reasoning here kenobi knew igniting hissaber he assumed the pose of a movement accomplished with the easeand elegance of a dancer 
 rather roughly vader imitated the movement several minutes followedwithout motion as the two men remained staring at each other as if waiting for someproper as yet unspoken signal 
 kenobi blinked once shook his head and tried to clear his eyes which hadbegun to water slightly sweat beaded up on his forehead and his eyelids flutteredagain 
 you powers are weak vader noted emotionlessly old man you shouldnever have come back it will make your end less peaceful than you might havewished 
 you sense only a part of the force darth kenobi murmured with the assuranceof one to whom death is merely another sensation like sleeping or making love ortouching a candle as always you perceive its reality as little as a utensil perceivesthe taste of food 
 executing a move of incredible swiftness for one so old kenobi lunged at themassive shape vader blocked the stab with equal speed riposting with acounterslash that kenobi barely parried another parry and kenobi countered this opportunity to move around the towering dark lord 
 they continued to trade blows with the old man now backing toward the his saber and locked the interaction of the two energy fields producinga violent sparking and flashing a low buzzing sound rose from the straining powerunits as each saber sought to override the other 
 threepio peeked around the entrance to the docking bay worriedly counting thenumber of troopers milling around the deserted freighter 
 where could they be oh oh 
 he ducked back out of sight just as one of the guards glanced in his second more cautious appraisal was more rewarding it revealed han solo andchewbacca hugging the wall of another tunnel on the far side of the bay 
 solo also was nonplussed at the number of guards he muttered wejust leave this party 
 chewbacca grunted and both turned only to relax and lower their weapons atthe sight of luke and the princess 
 what kept you solo quipped mirthlessly 
 we ran into leia explained panting heavily some old friends 
 luke was staring at the freighter is the ship all right 
 seems okay was analysis it look like removedanything or disturbed her engines the going to be getting to it 
 leia suddenly pointed to one of the opposite tunnels look 
 illuminated by the flare from contacting energy fields ben kenobi and darthvader were backing toward the bay the fight attracted the attention of others besidethe senator every one of the guards moved in for a better view of the olympianconflict 
 our chance solo observed starting forward 
 all seven of the troopers guarding the ship broke and rushed toward thecombatants going to the dark aid threepio barely ducked aside as they ranpast him turning back into the alcove he yelled to his companion 
 unplug yourself artoo leaving as soon as the artoo unit slippedhis sensor arm free of the socket the two droids began to slowly edge out into theopen bay 
 kenobi heard the approaching commotion and spared a glance back into thehangar the squad of troopers bearing down on him was enough to show that he wastrapped 
 vader took immediate advantage of the momentary distraction to bring his saberover and down kenobi somehow managed to deflect the sweeping blow at onceparrying and turning a complete circle 
 you still have your skill but your power fades prepare to meet the 
 kenobi gauged the shrinking distance between the oncoming troops and turned a pitying gaze on vader this is a fight you cannot win darth yourpower has matured since i taught you but i too have grown much since our my blade finds its mark you will cease to exist but if you cut me down i willonly become more powerful heed my words 
 your philosophies no longer confuse me old man vader growledcontemptuously i am the master now 
 once again he lunged forward feinting and then slashing in a deadly downwardarc with the saber it stuck home cutting the old man cleanly in half there was abrief flash as cloak fluttered to the deck in two neat sections 
 but ben kenobi was not in it wary of some tricks vader poked at the emptycloak sections with the saber there was no sign of the old man he had vanishedas though he had ever existed 
 the guards slowed their approach and joined vader in examining the place wherekenobi had stood seconds before several of them muttered and even the awesomepresence of the sith lord keep a few of them from feeling a little afraid 
 once the guards had turned and dashed for the far tunnels solo and the othersstarted for the starship shifted direction and was moving toward the guards 
 ben he screamed firing wildly toward the troops solo cursed but turned tofire in support of luke 
 one of the energy bolts struck the safety release on the tunnel blast door theemergency hold broken the heavy door fairly exploded downward both the guardsand vader leaped guards into the bay and vader backward to the oppositeside of the door 
 solo had turned and started for the entrance to the ship but he paused as he sawluke running toward the guards 
 too late leia yelled at him over 
 a familiar yet different voice rang in his voice all it said 
 bewildered luke turned to hunt for the source of that admonition he onlysaw leia beckoning to him as she followed artoo and threepio up the ramp 
 come on no time 
 hesitating his mind still on that imagined voice or was it imagined aconfused luke took aim and felled several soldiers before he too whirled andretreated into the freighter

 silence ensued the countess looked at her callers smiling affably but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave the daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over and a girl of thirteen hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room it was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar an officer of the guards a girl of fifteen and a plump boy in a short jacket 
 the count jumped up and swaying from side to side spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in 
 ah here she is he exclaimed laughing my pet whose name day it is my dear pet 
 ma chere there is a time for everything said the countess with feigned severity you spoil her ilya she added turning to her husband 
 how do you do my dear i wish you many happy returns of your name day said the visitor what a charming child she added addressing the mother 
 this girl not pretty but full of life with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice with black curls tossed backward thin bare arms little legs in drawers and feet in low slippers was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child though the child is not yet a young woman escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mantilla not paying the least attention to her severe remark and began to laugh she laughed and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock 
 do you see my doll mimi you see was all natasha managed to utter to her everything seemed funny she leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining in 
 now then go away and take your monstrosity with you said the mother pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness and turning to the visitor she added she is my youngest girl 
 natasha raising her face for a moment from her mantilla glanced up at her through tears of laughter and again hid her face 
 the visitor compelled to look on at this family scene thought it necessary to take some part in it 
 tell me my dear said she to natasha is mimi a relation of yours a daughter i suppose 
 natasha did not like the tone of condescension to childish things she did not reply but looked at her seriously 
 meanwhile the younger generation boris the officer anna son nicholas the undergraduate the eldest son sonya the niece and little petya his youngest boy had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces evidently in the back rooms from which they had dashed out so impetuously the conversation had been more amusing than the talk of society scandals the weather and countess apraksina now and then they glanced at one another hardly able to suppress their laughter 
 the two young men the student and the officer friends from childhood were of the same age and both handsome fellows though not alike boris was tall and fair and his calm and handsome face had regular delicate features nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room he evidently tried to find something to say but failed boris on the contrary at once found his footing and related quietly and humorously how he had know that doll mimi when she was still quite a young lady before her nose was broken how she had aged during the five years he had known her and how her head had cracked right across the skull having said this he glanced at natasha she turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter and unable to control herself any longer she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her boris did not laugh 
 you were meaning to go out you mamma do you want the carriage he asked his mother with a smile 
 yes yes go and tell them to get it ready she answered returning his smile 
 boris quietly left the room and went in search of natasha the plump boy ran after them angrily as if vexed that their program had been disturbed

 chapter 
 
 sometimes while meditating on these things in solitude got up in a sudden terror and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people talked regarding his ways and then recollected his confirmed bad habits and hopeless of benefiting him have flinched from the dismal house doubting if i could bear to be taken at my word 
 one time i passed the old gate going out of my way on a journey to gimmerton it was about the period that my narrative has reached a bright frosty afternoon the ground bare and the road hard and dry i came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your left hand a rough sand pillar with the letters cut on its north side on the east g and on the it serves as to the grange the heights and village the sun shone yellow on its grey head reminding me of summer and i cannot say why but all at once a gush of sensations flowed into my heart hindley and i held it a favourite spot twenty years before i gazed long at the block and stooping down perceived a hole near the bottom still full of and pebbles which we were fond of storing there with more perishable things and as fresh as reality it appeared that i beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf his dark square head bent forward and his little hand scooping out the earth with a piece of slate poor hindley i exclaimed involuntarily i started my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child lifted its face and stared straight into mine it vanished in a twinkling but immediately i felt an irresistible yearning to be at the heights superstition urged me to comply with this impulse supposing he should be dead i should die it were a sign of death the nearer i got to the house the more agitated i grew and on catching sight of it i trembled in every limb the apparition had outstripped me it stood looking through the gate that was my first idea on observing an boy setting his ruddy countenance against the bars further reflection suggested this must be hareton my hareton not altered greatly since i left him ten months since 
 god bless thee darling i cried forgetting instantaneously my foolish fears hareton nelly nelly thy nurse 
 he retreated out of length and picked up a large flint 
 i am come to see thy father hareton i added guessing from the action that nelly if she lived in his memory at all was not recognized as one with me 
 he raised his missile to hurl it i commenced a soothing speech but could not stay his hand the stone struck my bonnet and then ensued from the stammering lips of the little fellow a string of curses which whether he comprehended them or not were delivered with practised emphasis and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of malignity you may be certain this grieved more than angered me fit to cry i took an orange from my pocket and offered it to propitiate him he hesitated and then snatched it from my hold as if he fancied i only intended to tempt and disappoint him i showed another keeping it out of his reach 
 who has taught you those fine words my bairn i inquired the curate 
 damn the curate and thee gie me that he replied 
 tell us where you got your lessons and you shall have it said i your master 
 devil daddy was his answer 
 and what do you learn from daddy i continued 
 he jumped at the fruit i raised it higher what does he teach you i asked 
 naught said he but to keep out of his gait daddy cannot bide me because i swear at him 
 ah and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy i observed 
 he drawled 
 who then 
 heathcliff 
 i asked if he liked mr heathcliff 
 ay he answered again 
 desiring to have his reasons for liking him i could only gather the he pays dad back what he gies to curses daddy for cursing me he says i mun do as i will 
 and the curate does not teach you to read and write then i pursued 
 no i was told the curate should have dashed down his he stepped over the had promised that 
 i put the orange in his hand and bade him tell his father that a woman called nelly dean was waiting to speak with him by the garden gate he went up the walk and entered the house but instead of hindley heathcliff appeared on the doorstones and i turned directly and ran down the road as hard as ever i could race making no halt till i gained the and feeling as scared as if i had raised a goblin this is not much connected with miss affair except that it urged me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard and doing my utmost to check the spread of such bad influence at the grange even though i should wake a domestic storm by thwarting mrs pleasure 
 the next time heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some pigeons in the court she had never spoken a word to her for three days but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining and we found it a great comfort heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a single unnecessary civility on miss linton i knew now as soon as he beheld her his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the house front i was standing by the kitchen window but i drew out of sight he then stepped across the pavement to her and said something she seemed embarrassed and desirous of getting away to prevent it he laid his hand on her arm she averted her face he apparently put some question which she had no mind to answer there was another rapid glance at the house and supposing himself unseen the scoundrel had the impudence to embrace her 
 judas traitor i ejaculated you are a hypocrite too are you a deliberate deceiver 
 who is nelly said voice at my elbow i had been over intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance 
 your worthless friend i answered warmly the sneaking rascal yonder ah he has caught a glimpse of is coming in i wonder will he have the art to find a plausible excuse for making love to miss when he told you he hated her 
 mrs linton saw isabella tear herself free and run into the garden and a minute after heathcliff opened the door i withhold giving some loose to my indignation but catherine angrily insisted on silence and threatened to order me out of the kitchen if i dared to be so presumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue 
 to hear you people might think you were the mistress she cried you want setting down in your right place heathcliff what are you about raising this stir i said you must let isabella beg you will unless you are tired of being received here and wish linton to draw the bolts against you 
 god forbid that he should try answered the black villain i detested him just then god keep him meek and patient every day i grow madder after sending him to heaven 
 hush said catherine shutting the inner door vex me why have you disregarded my request did she come across you on purpose 
 what is it to you he growled a right to kiss her if she chooses and you have no right to object not your husband you be jealous of me 
 not jealous of you replied the mistress jealous for you clear your face you scowl at me if you like isabella you shall marry her but do you like her tell the truth heathcliff there you answer certain you 
 and would mr linton approve of his sister marrying that man i inquired 
 mr linton should approve returned my lady decisively 
 he might spare himself the trouble said heathcliff i could do as well without his approbation and as to you catherine i have a mind to speak a few words now while we are at it i want you to be aware that i know you have treated me do you hear and if you flatter yourself that i perceive it you are a fool and if you think i can be consoled by sweet words you are an idiot and if you fancy suffer unrevenged convince you of the contrary in a very little while meantime thank you for telling me your secret i swear make the most of it and stand you aside 
 what new phase of his character is this exclaimed mrs linton in amazement treated you take your revenge how will you take it ungrateful brute how have i treated you infernally 
 i seek no revenge on you replied heathcliff less vehemently not the plan the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they turn against him they crush those beneath them you are welcome to torture me to death for your amusement only allow me to amuse myself a little in the same style and refrain from insult as much as you are able having levelled my palace erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home if i imagined you really wished me to marry isabel cut my throat 
 oh the evil is that i am not jealous is it cried catherine well i repeat my offer of a wife it is as bad as offering satan a lost soul your bliss lies like his in inflicting misery you prove it edgar is restored from the he gave way to at your coming i begin to be secure and tranquil and you restless to know us at peace appear resolved on exciting a quarrel quarrel with edgar if you please heathcliff and deceive his sister hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me 
 the conversation ceased mrs linton sat down by the fire flushed and gloomy the spirit which served her was growing intractable she could neither lay nor control it he stood on the hearth with folded arms brooding on his evil thoughts and in this position i left them to seek the master who was wondering what kept catherine below so long 
 ellen said he when i entered have you seen your mistress 
 yes in the kitchen sir i answered sadly put out by mr behaviour and indeed i do think time to arrange his visits on another footing harm in being too soft and now come to i related the scene in the court and as near as i dared the whole subsequent dispute i fancied it could not be very prejudicial to mrs linton unless she made it so afterwards by assuming the defensive for her guest edgar linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close his first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame 
 this is insufferable he exclaimed it is disgraceful that she should own him for a friend and force his company on me call me two men out of the hall ellen catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low have humoured her enough 
 he descended and bidding the servants wait in the passage went followed by me to the kitchen its occupants had recommenced their angry discussion mrs linton at least was scolding with renewed vigour heathcliff had moved to the window and hung his head somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently he saw the master first and made a hasty motion that she should be silent which she obeyed abruptly on discovering the reason of his intimation 
 how is this said linton addressing her what notion of propriety must you have to remain here after the language which has been held to you by that blackguard i suppose because it is his ordinary talk you think nothing of it you are habituated to his baseness and perhaps imagine i can get used to it too 
 have you been listening at the door edgar asked the mistress in a tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband implying both carelessness and contempt of his irritation heathcliff who had raised his eyes at the former speech gave a sneering laugh at the latter on purpose it seemed to draw mr attention to him he succeeded but edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion 
 i have been so far forbearing with you sir he said quietly not that i was ignorant of your miserable degraded character but i felt you were only partly responsible for that and catherine wishing to keep up your acquaintance i your presence is a moral poison that would contaminate the most virtuous for that cause and to prevent worse consequences i shall deny you hereafter admission into this house and give notice now that i require your instant departure three minutes delay will render it involuntary and ignominious 
 heathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye full of derision 
 cathy this lamb of yours threatens like a bull he said it is in danger of splitting its skull against my knuckles by god mr linton mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down 
 my master glanced towards the passage and signed me to fetch the men he had no intention of hazarding a personal encounter i obeyed the hint but mrs linton suspecting something followed and when i attempted to call them she pulled me back slammed the door to and locked it 
 fair means she said in answer to her look of angry surprise if you have not courage to attack him make an apology or allow yourself to be beaten it will correct you of feigning more valour than you possess no swallow the key before you shall get it delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each after constant indulgence of weak nature and the bad one i earn for thanks two samples of blind ingratitude stupid to absurdity edgar i was defending you and yours and i wish heathcliff may flog you sick for daring to think an evil thought of me 
 it did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the master he tried to wrest the key from grasp and for safety she flung it into the hottest part of the fire whereupon mr edgar was taken with a nervous trembling and his countenance grew deadly pale for his life he could not avert that access of emotion mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely he leant on the back of a chair and covered his face 
 oh heavens in old days this would win you knighthood exclaimed mrs linton we are vanquished we are vanquished heathcliff would as soon lift a finger at you as a king would march his army against a colony of mice cheer up you be hurt your type is not a lamb a sucking leveret 
 i wish you joy of the coward cathy said her friend i compliment you on your taste and that is the slavering shivering thing you preferred to me i would not strike him with my fist but kick him with my foot and experience considerable satisfaction is he weeping or is he going to faint for fear 
 the fellow approached and gave the chair on which linton rested a push better have kept his distance my master quickly sprang erect and struck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter man it took his breath for a minute and while he choked mr linton walked out by the back door into the yard and from thence to the front entrance 
 there done with coming here cried catherine get away now return with a brace of pistols and half a dozen assistants if he did overhear us of course never forgive you played him an ill turn heathcliff but haste rather see edgar at bay than you 
 do you suppose going with that blow burning in my gullet he thundered by hell no crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel nut before i cross the threshold if i floor him now i shall murder him some time so as you value his existence let me get at him 
 not coming i interposed framing a bit of a lie the coachman and the two gardeners surely not wait to be thrust into the road by them each has a bludgeon and master will very likely be watching from the parlour windows to see that they fulfil his orders 
 the gardeners and coachman were there but linton was with them they had already entered the court heathcliff on second thoughts resolved to avoid a struggle against the three underlings he seized the poker smashed the lock from the inner door and made his escape as they tramped in 
 mrs linton who was very much excited bade me accompany her upstairs she did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance and i was anxious to keep her in ignorance 
 nearly distracted nelly she exclaimed throwing herself on the sofa a thousand smiths hammers are beating in my head tell isabella to shun me this uproar is owing to her and should she or anyone else aggravate my anger at present i shall get wild and nelly say to edgar if you see him again tonight that in danger of being seriously ill i wish it may prove true he has startled and distressed me shockingly i want to frighten him besides he might come and begin a string of abuse or complainings certain i should recriminate and god knows where we should end will you do so my good nelly you are aware that i am in no way blamable in this matter what possessed him to turn listener talk was outrageous after you left us but i could soon have diverted him from isabella and the rest meant nothing now all is dashed wrong by the craving to hear evil of self that haunts some people like a demon had edgar never gathered our conversation he would never have been the worse for it really when he opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after i had scolded heathcliff till i was hoarse for him i did not care hardly what they did to each other especially as i felt that however the scene closed we should all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long well if i cannot keep heathcliff for my edgar will be mean and jealous try to break their hearts by breaking my own that will be a prompt way of finishing all when i am pushed to extremity but a deed to be reserved for a forlorn hope not take linton by surprise with it to this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me you must represent the peril of quitting that policy and remind him of my passionate temper verging when kindled on frenzy i wish you could dismiss that apathy out of your countenance and look rather more anxious about me 
 the stolidity with which i received these instructions was no doubt rather exasperating for they were delivered in perfect sincerity but i believed a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to account beforehand might by exerting her will manage to control herself tolerably even while under their influence and i did not wish to frighten her husband as she said and multiply his annoyances for the purpose of serving her selfishness therefore i said nothing when i met the master coming towards the parlour but i took the liberty of turning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together he began to speak first 
 remain where you are catherine he said without any anger in his voice but with much sorrowful despondency i shall not stay i am neither come to wrangle nor be reconciled but i wish just to learn whether after this events you intend to continue your intimacy with 
 oh for sake interrupted the mistress stamping her foot for sake let us hear no more of it now your cold blood cannot be worked into a fever your veins are full of but mine are boiling and the sight of such chillness makes them dance 
 to get rid of me answer my question persevered mr linton you must answer it and that violence does not alarm me i have found that you can be as stoical as anyone when you please will you give up heathcliff hereafter or will you give up me it is impossible for you to be my friend and his at the same time and i absolutely require to know which you choose 
 i require to be let alone exclaimed catherine furiously i demand it you see i can scarcely stand edgar leave me 
 she rang the bell till it broke with a twang i entered leisurely it was enough to try the temper of a saint such senseless wicked rages there she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa and grinding her teeth so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters mr linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear he told me to fetch some water she had no breath for speaking i brought a glass full and as she would not drink i sprinkled it on her face in a few seconds she stretched herself out stiff and turned up her eyes while her cheeks at once blanched and livid assumed the aspect of death linton looked terrified 
 there is nothing in the world the matter i whispered i did not want him to yield though i could not help being afraid in my heart 
 she has blood on her lips he said shuddering 
 never mind i answered tartly and i told him how she had resolved previous to his coming on exhibiting a fit of frenzy i incautiously gave the account aloud and she heard me for she started hair flying over her shoulders her eyes flashing the muscles of her neck and arms standing out preternaturally i made up my mind for broken bones at least but she only glared about her for an instant and then rushed from the room the master directed me to follow i did to her chamber door she hindered me from going farther by securing it against me 
 as she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning i went to ask whether she would have some carried up no she replied peremptorily the same question was repeated at dinner and tea and again on the morrow after and received the same answer mr linton on his part spent his time in the library and did not inquire concerning his occupations isabella and he had had an interview during which he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for advances but he could make nothing of her evasive replies and was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily adding however a solemn warning that if she were so insane as to encourage that worthless suitor it would dissolve all bonds of relationship between herself and him

 i now propose a toast as my friend and pardner sairy gamp says fun forever and no grubbing cried jo rising glass in hand as the lemonade went round 
 they all drank it merrily and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day next morning meg did not appear till ten her solitary breakfast did not taste nice and the room seemed lonely and untidy for jo had not filled the vases beth had not dusted and books lay scattered about nothing was neat and pleasant but corner which looked as usual and there meg sat to rest and read which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary jo spent the morning on the river with laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over the wide wide world up in the apple tree beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided but getting tired before half done she left her establishment and went to her music rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash amy arranged her bower put on her best white frock smoothed her curls and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was as no one appeared but an inquisitive who examined her work with interest she went to walk got caught in a shower and came home dripping 
 at teatime they compared notes and all agreed that it had been a delightful though unusually long day meg who went shopping in the afternoon and got a sweet blue muslin had discovered after she had cut the breadths off that it wash which mishap made her slightly cross jo had burned the skin off her nose boating and got a raging headache by reading too long beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once and amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock for katy party was to be the next day and now like flora mcflimsey she had nothing to wear but these were mere trifles and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely she smiled said nothing and with help did their neglected work keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly it was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the resting and reveling process the days kept getting longer and longer the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers and unsettled feeling possessed everyone and satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do as the height of luxury meg put out some of her sewing and then found time hang so heavily that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up moffat jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books got so fidgety that even laurie had a quarrel with her and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with aunt march beth got on pretty well for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work and fell back into her old ways now and then but something in the air affected her and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear joanna and told her she was a fright amy fared worst of all for her resources were small and when her sisters left her to amuse herself she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden she like dolls fairy tales were childish and one draw all the time tea parties amount to much neither did picnics unless very well conducted if one could have a fine house full of nice girls or go traveling the summer would be delightful but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a boy was enough to try the patience of a boaz complained miss malaprop after several days devoted to pleasure fretting and ennui 
 no one would own that they were tired of the experiment but by friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done hoping to impress the lesson more deeply mrs march who had a good deal of humor resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner so she gave hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system 
 when they got up on saturday morning there was no fire in the kitchen no breakfast in the dining room and no mother anywhere to be seen 
 mercy on us what has happened cried jo staring about her in dismay 
 meg ran upstairs and soon came back again looking relieved but rather bewildered and a little ashamed 
 mother sick only very tired and she says she is going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best we can a very queer thing for her to do she act a bit like herself but she says it has been a hard week for her so we grumble but take care of ourselves 
 easy enough and i like the idea aching for something to do that is some new amusement you know added jo quickly 
 in fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work and they took hold with a will but soon realized the truth of saying housekeeping no joke there was plenty of food in the larder and while beth and amy set the table meg and jo got breakfast wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work 
 i shall take some up to mother though she said we were not to think of her for take care of herself said meg who presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot 
 so a tray was fitted out before anyone began and taken up with the compliments the boiled tea was very bitter the omelet scorched and the biscuits speckled with saleratus but mrs march received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after jo was gone 
 poor little souls they will have a hard time afraid but they suffer and it will do them good she said producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided herself and disposing of the bad breakfast so that their feelings might not be hurt a motherly little deception for which they were grateful 
 many were the complaints below and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures never mind get the dinner and be servant you be mistress keep your hands nice see company and give orders said jo who knew still less than meg about culinary affairs 
 this obliging offer was gladly accepted and margaret retired to the parlor which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble of dusting jo with perfect faith in her own powers and a friendly desire to make up the quarrel immediately put a note in the office inviting laurie to dinner 
 better see what you have got before you think of having company said meg when informed of the hospitable but rash act 
 oh corned beef and plenty of poatoes and i shall get some asparagus and a lobster for a relish as hannah says have lettuce and make a salad i know how but the book tells have blancmange and strawberries for dessert and coffee too if you want to be elegant 
 try too many messes jo for you make anything but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat i wash my hands of the dinner party and since you have asked laurie on your own responsibility you may just take care of him 
 i want you to do anything but be civil to him and help to the pudding give me your advice if i get in a muddle you asked jo rather hurt 
 yes but i know much except about bread and a few trifles you had better ask leave before you order anything returned meg prudently 
 of course i shall not a fool and jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers 
 get what you like and disturb me going out to dinner and worry about things at home said mrs march when jo spoke to her i never enjoyed housekeeping and going to take a vacation today and read write go visiting and amuse myself 
 the unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably and reading early in the morning made jo feel as if some unnatural phenomenon had occurred for an eclipse an earthquake or a volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger 
 everything is out of sorts somehow she said to herself going downstairs beth crying a sure sign that something is wrong in this family if amy is bothering shake her 
 feeling very much out of sorts herself jo hurried into the parlor to find beth sobbing over pip the canary who lay dead in the cage with his little claws pathetically extended as if imploring the food for want of which he had died 
 all my fault i forgot him there a seed or a drop left oh pip oh pip how could i be so cruel to you cried beth taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him 
 jo peeped into his eye felt his little heart and finding him stiff and cold shook her head and offered her domino box for a coffin 
 put him in the oven and maybe his will get warm and revive said amy hopefully 
 been starved and he be baked now dead make him a shroud and he shall be buried in the garden and never have another bird never my pip for i am too bad to own one murmured beth sitting on the floor with her pet folded in her hands the funeral shall be this afternoon and we will all go now cry bethy a pity but nothing goes right this week and pip has had the worst of the experiment make the shroud and lay him in my box and after the dinner party have a nice little funeral said jo beginning to feel as if she had undertaken a good deal 
 leaving the others to console beth she departed to the kitchen which was in a most discouraging state of confusion putting on a big apron she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for washing when she discovered that the fire was out 
 a sweet prospect muttered jo slamming the stove door open and poking vigorously among the cinders 
 having rekindled the fire she thought she would go to market while the water heated the walk revived her spirits and flattering herself that she had made good bargins she trudged home again after buying a very young lobster some very old asparagus and two boxes of acid strawberries by the time she got cleared up the dinner arrived and the stove was hannah had left a pan of bread to rise meg had worked it up early set it on the hearth for a second rising and forgotten it meg was entertaining sallie gardiner in the parlor when the door flew open and a floury crocky flushed and disheveled figure appeared demanding tartly 
 i say bread riz enough when it runs over the pans 
 sallie began to laugh but meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay mrs march went out after peeping here and there to see how matters went also saying a word of comfort to beth who sat making a winding sheet while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box a strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner and despair seized them when a few minutes later miss crocker appeared and said come to dinner now this lady was a thin yellow spinster with a sharp nose and inquisitive eyes who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw they disliked her but had been taught to be kind to her simply because she was old and poor and had few friends so meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her while she asked questions critsized everything and told stories of the people whom she knew 
 language cannot describe the anxieties experiences and exertions which jo underwent that morning and the dinner she served up became a standing joke fearing to ask any more advice she did her best alone and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook she boiled the asparagus for an hour and wasgrieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever the bread burned black for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to ear the lobster was a scarlet mystery to her but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meagerproportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves the potatoes had to be hurried not to keep the asparagus waiting and were not done at the last the blancmange was lumpy and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked having been skilfully deaconed 
 well they can eat beef and bread and butter if they are hungry only mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for nothing thought jo as she rang the bell half an hour later than usual and stood hot tired and dispirited surveying the feast spread before laurie accustomed to all sorts of elegance and miss crocker whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide 
 poor jo would gladly have gone under the table as one thing after another was tasted and left while amy giggled meg looked distressed miss crocker pursed her lips and laurie talked and laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene one strong point was the fruit for she had sugared it well and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it her hot cheeks cooled a trifle and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream miss crocker tasted first made a wry face and drank some water hastily jo who refused thinking there might not be enough for they dwindled sadly after the picking over glanced at laurie but he was eating away manfully though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate amy who was fond of delicate fare took a heaping spoonful choked hid her face in her napkin and left the table precipitately 
 oh what is it exclaimed jo trembling 
 salt instead of sugar and the cream is sour replied meg with a tragic gesture 
 jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair remembering that she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of the two boxes on the kitchen table and had neglected to put the milk in the refrigerator she turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying when she met eyes which would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts the comical side of the affair suddenly struck her and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks so did everyone else even croaker as the girls called the old lady and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily with bread and butter olives and fun 
 i strength of mind enough to clear up now so we will sober ourselves with a funeral said jo as they rose and miss crocker made ready to go being eager to tell the new story at another dinner table 
 they did sober themselves for sake laurie dug a grave under the ferns in the grove little pip was laid in with many tears by his mistress and covered with moss while a wreath of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph composed by jo while she struggled with the dinner 
 here lies pip march 
 who died the th of june 
 loved and lamented sore 
 and not forgotten soon 
 at the conclusion of the ceremonies beth retired to her room overcome with emotion and lobster but there was no place of repose for the beds were not made and she found her grief much assuaged by beating up the pillows and putting things in order meg helped jo clear away the remains of the feast which took half the afternoon and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and toast for supper 
 laurie took amy to drive which was a deed of charity for the sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper mrs march came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the middle of the afternoon and a glance at the closet gave her an idea of the success of one part of the experiment 
 before the housewives could rest several people called and there was a scramble to get ready to see them then tea must be got errands done and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last minute as twilight fell dewy and still one by one they gathered on the porch where the june roses were budding beautifully and each groaned or sighed as she sat down as if tired or troubled 
 what a dreadful day this has been began jo usually the first to speak 
 it has seemed shorter than usual but so uncomfortable said meg 
 not a bit like home added amy 
 it seem so without marmee and little pip sighed beth glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head 
 mother dear and you shall have another bird tomorrow if you want it 
 as she spoke mrs march came and took her place among them looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs 
 are you satisfied with your experiment girls or do you want another week of it she asked as beth nestled up to her and the rest turned toward her with brightening faces as flowers turn toward the sun 
 i cried jo decidedly 
 nor i echoed the others 
 you think then that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others do you 
 lounging and larking pay observed jo shaking her head tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off 
 suppose you learn plain cooking a useful accomplishment which no woman should be without said mrs march laughing inaudibly at the recollection of dinner party for she had met miss crocker and heard her account of it 
 mother did you go away and let everything be just to see how get on cried meg who had had suspicions all day 
 yes i wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully while hannah and i did your work you got on pretty well though i think you were very happy or amiable so i thought as a little lesson i would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of herself you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes and to bear and forbear that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all 
 we do mother we do cried the girls 
 then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again for though they seem heavy sometimes they are good for us and lighten as we learn to carry them work is wholesome and there is plenty for everyone it keeps us from ennui and mischief is good for health and spirits and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion 
 work like bees and love it too see if we said jo learn plain cooking for my holiday task and the dinner party i have shall be a success 
 make the set of shirts for father instead of letting you do it marmee i can and i will though not fond of sewing that will be better than fussing over my own things which are plenty nice enough as they are said meg 
 do my lessons every day and not spend so much time with my music and dolls i am a stupid thing and ought to be studying not playing was resolution while amy followed their example by heroically declaring i shall learn to make buttonholes and attend to my parts of speech 
 very good then i am quite satisfied with the experiment and fancy that we shall not have to repeat it only go to the other extreme and delve like slaves have regular hours for work and play make each day both useful and pleasant and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well then youth will be delightful old age will bring few regrets and life become a beautiful success in spite of poverty 
 remember mother and they did

 future 
 he pauses 
 morpheus 
 when he died the oracle at the temple of zion prophesied his

 people that is why there are those of us that have spent our 
 entire lives searching the matrix looking for him

 he assumes a fighting stance 
 morpheus

 neo assumes a similar stance cautiously circling until 
 he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack 
 it is like a jackie chan movie at high speed fists and 
 feet striking from every angle as neo presses his attack 
 
 but each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed

lionfish nov chapter eleven the dueling clubcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry woke up on sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff he sat up quickly and looked over at bed but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains harry had changed behind yesterday seeing that he was awake madam pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers 
 
 all in order she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge when finished eating you may leave 
 
 harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to gryffindor tower desperate to tell ron and hermione about colin and dobby but they there harry left to look for them wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they interested in whether he had his bones back or not 
 
 as harry passed the library percy weasley strolled out of it looking in far better spirits than last time met 
 
 oh hello harry he said excellent flying yesterday really excellent gryffindor has just taken the lead for the house cup you earned fifty points 
 
 you seen ron or hermione have you said harry 
 
 no i said percy his smile fading i hope not in another 
 
 harry forced a laugh watched percy walk out of sight and then headed straight for moaning bathroom he see why ron and hermione would be in there again but after making sure that neither filch nor any prefects were around he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall 
 
 me he said closing the door behind him there was a clunk a splash and a gasp from within the stall and he saw eye peering through the keyhole 
 
 harry she said you gave us such a fright come in your arm 
 
 fine said harry squeezing into the stall an old cauldron was perched on the toilet and a crackling from under the rim told harry they had lit a fire beneath it conjuring up portable waterproof fires was a speciality of 
 
 come to meet you but we decided to get started on the polyjuice potion ron explained as harry with difficulty locked the stall again decided this is the safest place to hide it 
 
 harry started to tell them about colin but hermione interrupted 
 
 we already know we heard professor mcgonagall telling professor flitwick this morning why we decided better get going 
 
 the sooner we get a confession out of malfoy the better snarled ron know what i think he was in such a foul temper after the quidditch match he took it out on colin 
 
 something else said harry watching hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night 
 
 ron and hermione looked up amazed harry told them everything dobby had told him or told him hermione and ron listened with their mouths open 
 
 the chamber of secrets has been opened before hermione said 
 
 this settles it said ron in a triumphant voice lucius malfoy opened the chamber when he was at school here and now told dear old draco how to do it obvious wish told you what kind of in there though i want to know how come noticed it sneaking around the school 
 
 maybe it can make itself invisible said hermione prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron or maybe it can disguise itself pretend to be a suit of armor or something read about chameleon ghouls 
 
 you read too much hermione said ron pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches he crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at harry 
 
 so dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm he shook his head you know what harry if he stop trying to save your life going to kill you 
 
 the news that colin creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by monday morning the air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion the first years were now moving around the castle in groups as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone 
 
 ginny weasley who sat next to colin creevey in charms was distraught but harry felt that fred and george were going the wrong way about cheering her up they were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues they only stopped when percy apoplectic with rage told them he was going to write to mrs weasley and tell her ginny was having nightmares 
 
 meanwhile hidden from the teachers a roaring trade in talismans amulets and other protective devices was sweeping the school neville longbottom bought a large green onion a pointed purple crystal and a rotting newt tail before the other gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger he was a and therefore unlikely to be attacked 
 
 they went for filch first neville said his round face fearful and everyone knows almost a squib 
 
 in the second week of december professor mcgonagall came around as usual collecting names of those who would be staying at school for christmas harry ron and hermione signed her list they had heard that malfoy was staying which struck them as very suspicious the holidays would be the perfect time to use the polyjuice potion and try to worm a confession out of him 
 
 unfortunately the potion was only half finished they still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin and the only place they were going to get them was from private stores harry privately felt rather face legendary monster than let snape catch him robbing his office 
 
 what we need said hermione briskly as thursday double potions lesson loomed nearer is a diversion then one of us can sneak into office and take what we need harry and ron looked at her nervously 
 
 i think better do the actual stealing hermione continued in a tone you two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble and got a clean record so all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep snape busy for five minutes or so 
 
 harry smiled feebly deliberately causing mayhem in potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye 
 
 potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons thursday lesson proceeded in the usual way twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients snape prowled through the fumes making waspish remarks about the while the slytherins sniggered appreciatively draco malfoy who was favorite student kept flicking eyes at ron and harry who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say unfair 
 
 swelling solution was far too runny but he had his mind on more important things he was waiting for signal and he hardly listened as snape paused to sneer at his watery potion when snape turned and walked off to bully neville hermione caught eye and nodded 
 
 harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron pulled one of filibuster fireworks out of his pocket and gave it a quick prod with his wand the firework began to fizz and sputter knowing he had only seconds harry straightened up took aim and lobbed it into the air it landed right on target in cauldron 
 
 potion exploded showering the whole class people shrieked as splashes of the swelling solution hit them malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon goyle blundered around his hands over his eyes which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened through the confusion harry saw hermione slip quietly into office 
 
 silence silence snape roared anyone who has been splashed come here for a deflating draft when i find out who did this 
 
 harry tried not to laugh as he watched malfoy hurry forward his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon as half the class lumbered up to desk some weighted down with arms like clubs others unable to talk through gigantic lips harry saw hermione slide back into the dungeon the front of her robes bulging 
 
 when everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided snape swept over to cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework there was a sudden hush 
 
 if i ever find out who threw this snape whispered i shall make sure that person is expelled 
 
 harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression snape was looking right at him and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome 
 
 he knew it was me harry told ron and hermione as they hurried back to moaning bathroom i could tell 
 
 hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly 
 
 be ready in two weeks she said happily 
 
 snape prove it was you said ron reassuringly to harry what can he do 
 
 knowing snape something foul said harry as the potion frothed and bubbled 
 
 a week later harry ron and hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up seamus finnigan and dean thomas beckoned them over looking excited 
 
 starting a dueling club said seamus first meeting tonight i mind dueling lessons they might come in handy one of these days 
 
 what you reckon monster can duel said ron but he too read the sign with interest 
 
 could be useful he said to harry and hermione as they went into dinner shall we go 
 
 harry and hermione were all for it so at eight that evening they hurried back to the great hall the long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall lit by thousands of candles floating overhead the ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school eemed to be packed beneath it all carrying their wands and looking excited 
 
 i wonder be teaching us said hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd someone told me flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young maybe be him 
 
 as long as not harry began but he ended on a groan gilderoy lockhart was walking onto the stage resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than snape wearing his usual black 
 
 lockhart waved an arm for silence and called gather round gather round can everyone see me can you all hear me excellent 
 
 now professor dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as i myself have done on countless occasions for full details see my published works 
 
 let me introduce my assistant professor snape said lockhart flashing a wide smile he tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin now i want any of you youngsters to worry still have your potions master when through with him never fear 
 
 it be good if they finished each other off ron muttered in ear 
 
 upper lip was curling harry wondered why lockhart was still smiling if snape had been looking at him like that have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction 
 
 lockhart and snape turned to face each other and bowed at least lockhart did with much twirling of his hands whereas snape jerked his head irritably then they raised their wands like swords in front of them 
 
 as you see we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position lockhart told the silent crowd on the count of three we will cast our first spells neither of us will be aiming to kill of course 
 
 i bet on that harry murmured watching snape baring his teeth 
 
 one two three 
 
 both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent snape cried expelliarmus there was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and lockhart was blasted off his feet he flew backward off the stage smashed into the wall and slid down it to sprawl on the floor 
 
 malfoy and some of the other slytherins cheered hermione was dancing on tiptoes do you think all right she squealed through her fingers 
 
 who cares said harry and ron together 
 
 lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet his hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end 
 
 well there you have it he said tottering back onto the platform that was a disarming charm as you see lost my wand ah thank you miss brown yes an excellent idea to show them that professor snape but if you mind my saying so it was very obvious what you were about to do if i had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy however i felt it would be instructive to let them see 
 
 snape was looking murderous possibly lockhart had noticed because he said enough demonstrating going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs professor snape if like to help me 
 
 they moved through the crowd matching up partners lockhart teamed neville with justin but snape reached harry and ron first 
 
 time to split up the dream team i think he sneered weasley you can partner finnigan potter 
 
 harry moved automatically toward hermione 
 
 i think so said snape smiling coldly mr malfoy come over here see what you make of the famous potter and you miss granger you can partner miss bulstrode 
 
 malfoy strutted over smirking behind him walked a slytherin girl who reminded harry of a picture seen in holidays with hags she was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return 
 
 face your partners called lockhart back on the platform and bow 
 
 hrry and malfoy barely inclined their heads not taking their eyes off each other 
 
 wands at the ready shouted lockhart when i count to three cast your charms to disarm your opponents only to disarm them we want any accidents one two three 
 
 harry swung his wand high but malfoy had already started on two his spell hit harry so hard he felt as though been hit over the head with a saucepan he stumbled but everything still seemed to be working and wasting no more time harry pointed his wand straight at malfoy and shouted rictusempra 
 
 a jet of silver light hit malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up wheezing 
 
 i said disarm only lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd as malfoy sank to his knees harry had hit him with a tickling charm and he could barely move for laughing harry hung back with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch malfoy while he was on the floor but this was a mistake gasping for breath malfoy pointed his wand at knees choked tarantallegra and the next second legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep 
 
 stop stop screamed lockhart but snape took charge finite incantatem he shouted feet stopped dancing malfoy stopped laughing and they were able to look up 
 
 a haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene both neville and justin were lying on the floor panting ron was holding up an seamus apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done but hermione and millicent bulstrode were still moving millicent had hermione in a headlock and hermione was whimpering in pain both their wands lay forgotten on the floor harry leapt forward and pulled millicent off it was difficult she was a lot bigger than he was 
 
 dear dear said lockhart skittering through the crowd looking at the aftermath of the duels up you go macmillan 
 
 careful there miss fawcett pinch it hard stop bleeding in a second 
 
 i think better teach you how to block unfriendly spells said lockhart standing flustered in the midst of the hall he glanced at snape whose black eyes glinted and looked quickly away have a volunteer pair longbottom and how about you 
 
 a bad idea professor lockhart said snape gliding over like a large and malevolent bat longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells be sending left of up to the hospital wing in a matchbox round pink face went pinker how about malfoy and potter said snape with a twisted smile 
 
 excellent idea said lockhart gesturing harry and malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room 
 
 now harry said lockhart when draco points his wand at you you do this 
 
 he raised his own wand attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action and dropped it snape smirked as lockhart quickly picked it up saying whoops my wand is a little overexcited 
 
 snape moved closer to malfoy bent down and whispered something in his ear malfoy smirked too harry looked up nervously at lockhart and said professor could you show me that blocking thing again 
 
 scared muttered malfoy so that lockhart hear him 
 
 you wish said harry out of the corner of his mouth 
 
 lockhart cuffed harry merrily on the shoulder just do what i did harry 
 
 what drop my wand 
 
 but lockhart listening 
 
 three two one go he shouted 
 
 malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed serpensortia 
 
 the end of his wand exploded harry watched aghast as a long black snake shot out of it fell heavily onto the floor between them and raised itself ready to strike there were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away clearing the floor 
 
 move potter said snape lazily clearly enjoying the sight of harry standing motionless eye to eye with the angry snake get rid of it 
 
 allow me shouted lockhart he brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang the snake instead of vanishing flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack enraged hissing furiously it slithered straight toward justin and raised itself again fangs exposed poised to strike 
 
 harry sure what made him do it he even aware of deciding to do it all he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake leave him alone and miraculously inexplicably the snake slumped to the floor docile as a thick black garden hose its eyes now on harry harry felt the fear drain out of him he knew the snake attack anyone now though how he knew it he have explained 
 
 he looked up at justin grinning expecting to see justin looking relieved or puzzled or even grateful but certainly not angry and scared 
 
 what do you think playing at he shouted and before harry could say anything justin had turned and stormed out of the hall 
 
 snape stepped forward waved his wand and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke snape too was looking at harry in an unexpected way it was a shrewd and calculating look and harry like it he was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes 
 
 come on said voice in his ear move come on 
 
 ron steered him out of the hall hermione hurrying alongside them as they went through the doors the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something harry have a clue what was going on and neither ron nor hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty gryffindor common room 
 
 then ron pushed harry into an armchair and said a parselmouth why you tell us 
 
 a what said harry 
 
 a parselmouth said ron you can talk to snakes 
 
 i know said harry i mean only the second time ever done it i accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin dudley at the zoo once long story but it was telling me it had never seen brazil and i sort of set it free without meaning to that was before i knew i was a wizard 
 
 a boa constrictor told you it had never seen brazil ron repeated faintly 
 
 so said harry i bet loads of people here can do it 
 
 oh no they said ron not a very common gift harry this is bad 
 
 bad said harry starting to feel quite angry wrong with everyone listen if i told that snake not to attack justin 
 
 oh what you said to it 
 
 what mean you were there you heard me 
 
 i heard you speaking parseltongue said ron snake language you could have been saying anything no wonder justin panicked you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something it was creepy you know 
 
 harry gaped at him 
 
 i spoke a different language but i realize how can i speak a language without knowing i can speak it 
 
 ron shook his head both he and hermione were looking as though someone had died harry see what was so terrible 
 
 want to tell me wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off head he said what does it matter how i did it as long as justin have to join the headless hunt 
 
 it matters said hermione speaking at last in a hushed voice because being able to talk to snakes was what salazar slytherin was famous for why the symbol of slytherin house is a serpent 
 
 mouth fell open 
 
 exactly said ron and now the whole going to think his or something 
 
 but not said harry with a panic he quite explain 
 
 find that hard to prove said hermione he lived about a thousand years ago for all we know you could be 
 
 harry lay awake for hours that night through a gap in the curtains around his he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered 
 
 could he be a descendant of salazar slithering he know anything about his family after all the dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives 
 
 quietly harry tried to say something in parseltongue the words come it seemed he had to be with a snake to do it 
 
 but in gryffindor harry thought the sorting hat have put me in here if i had slytherin blood 
 
 ah said a nasty little voice in his brain but the sorting hat wanted to put you in slytherin you remember 
 
 harry turned over see justin the next day in herbology and explain that been calling the snake off not egging it on which he thought angrily pummeling his pillow any fool should have realized 
 
 by next morning however the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last herbology lesson of the term was canceled professor sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the mandrakes a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else now that it was so important for the mandrakes to grow quickly and revive mrs norris and colin creevey 
 
 harry fretted about this next to the fire in the gryffindor common room while ron and hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess 
 
 for sake harry said hermione exasperated as one of bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board go and find justin if so important to you 
 
 so harry got up and left through the portrait hole wondering where justin might be 
 
 the castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick swirling gray snow at every window shivering harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place catching snatches of what was happening within professor mcgonagall was shouting at someone who by the sound of it had turned his friend into a badger resisting the urge to take a look harry walked on by thinking that justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work and deciding to check the library first 
 
 a group of the hufliepuffs who should have been in herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library but they seem to be working between the long lines of high bookshelves harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation he see whether justin was among them he was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears and he paused to listen hidden in the invisibility section 
 
 so anyway a stout boy was saying i told justin to hide up in our dormitory i mean to say if marked him down as his next victim best if he keeps a low profile for a while of course been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to potter he was justin actually told him been down for eton not the kind of thing you bandy about with heir on the loose is it 
 
 you definitely think it is potter then ernie said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously 
 
 hannah said the stout boy solemnly a parselmouth everyone knows the mark of a dark wizard have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes they called slytherin himself 
 
 there was some heavy murmuring at this and ernie went on remember what was written on the wall enemies of the heir beware potter had some sort of with filch next thing we know attacked that first year creevey was annoying potter at the quidditch match taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud next thing we know been attacked 
 
 he always seems so nice though said hannah uncertainly and well the one who made disappear he be all bad can he 
 
 ernie lowered his voice mysteriously the hufflepuffs bent closer and harry edged nearer so that he could catch words 
 
 no one knows how he survived that attack by i mean to say he was only a baby when it happened he should have been blasted into smithereens only a really powerful dark wizard could have survived a curse like that he dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper and said probably why you wanted to kill him in the first place want another dark lord competing with him i wonder what other powers been hiding 
 
 harry take anymore clearing his throat loudly he stepped out from behind the bookshelves if he been feeling so angry he would have found the sight that greeted him funny every one of the hufflepuffs looked as though they had been petrified by the sight of him and the color was draining out of face 
 
 hello said harry looking for justin 
 
 the fears had clearly been confirmed they all looked fearfully at ernie 
 
 what do you want with him said ernie in a quavering voice 
 
 i wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the dueling club said harry 
 
 ernie bit his white lips and then taking a deep breath said we were all there we saw what happened 
 
 then you noticed that after i spoke to it the snake backed off said harry 
 
 all i saw said ernie stubbornly though he was trembling as he spoke was you speaking parseltongue and chasing the snake toward justin 
 
 i chase it at him harry said his voice shaking with anger it even touch him 
 
 it was a very near miss said ernie and in case getting ideas he added hastily i might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my as pure as so 
 
 i care what sort of blood got said harry fiercely why would i want to attack 
 
 heard you hate those muggles you live with said ernie swiftly 
 
 not possible to live with the dursleys and not hate them said harry like to see you try it 
 
 he turned on his heel and stormed out of the library earning himself a reproving glare from madam pince who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook 
 
 harry blundered up the corridor barely noticing where he was going he was in such a fury the result was that he walked into something very large and solid which knocked him backward onto the floor 
 
 oh hello hagrid harry said looking up 
 
 face was entirely hidden by a woolly balaclava but it possibly be anyone else as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat a dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive gloved hands 
 
 all righ harry he said pulling up the balaclava so he could speak why yeh in class 
 
 canceled said harry getting up you doing in here 
 
 hagrid held up the limp rooster 
 
 second one killed this term he explained either foxes or a bugbear need the permission ter put a charm around the hen coop 
 
 he peered more closely at harry from under his thick snowflecked eyebrows 
 
 yeh sure all righ yeh look all hot 
 
 harry bring himself to repeat what ernie and the rest of the hufflepuffs had been saying about him 
 
 nothing he said id better get going hagrid transfiguration next and got to pick up my books 
 
 he walked off his mind still full of what ernie had said about him 
 
 been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to potter he was 
 
 harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor which was particularly dark the torches had been extinguished by a strong icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane he was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor 
 
 he turned to squint at what fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved 
 
 justin was lying on the floor rigid and cold a look of shock frozen on his face his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling and that all next to him was another figure the strangest sight harry had ever seen 
 
 it was nearly headless nick no longer and transparent but black and smoky floating immobile and horizontal six inches off the floor his head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to 
 
 harry got to his feet his breathing fast and shallow his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs he lookedwildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies the only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side 
 
 he could run and no one would ever know he had been there but he just leave them lying here he had to get help would anyone believe he had anything to do with this 
 
 as he stood there panicking a door right next to him opened with a bang peeves the poltergeist came shooting out 
 
 why potty wee potter cackled peeves knocking glasses askew as he bounced past him potter up to potter lurking 
 
 peeves stopped halfway through a midair somersault upside down he spotted justin and nearly headless nick he flipped the right way up filled his lungs and before harry could stop him screamed attack attack another attack no mortal or ghost is safe run for your lives attaaaack 
 
 crash crash crash door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out for several long minutes there was a scene of such confusion that justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in nearly headless nick harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet professor mcgonagall came running followed by her own class one of whom still had hair she used her wand to set off a loud bang which restored silence and ordered everyone back into their classes no sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than ernie the hufflepuff arrived panting on the scene 
 
 caught in the act ernie yelled his face stark white pointing his finger dramatically at harry 
 
 that will do macmillan said professor mcgonagall sharply 
 
 peeves was bobbing overhead now grinning wickedly surveying the scene peeves always loved chaos as the teachers bent over justin and nearly headless nick examining them peeves broke into song 
 
 oh potter you rotter oh what have you done killing you think good fun 
 
 enough peeves barked professor mcgonagall and peeves zoomed away backward with his tongue out at harry 
 
 justin was carried up to the hospital wing by professor flitwick and professor sinistra of the astronomy department but nobody seemed to know what to do for nearly headless nick in the end professor mcgonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air which she gave to ernie with instructions to waft nearly headless nick up the stairs this ernie did fanning nick along like a silent black hovercraft this left harry and professor mcgonagall alone together 
 
 this way potter she said 
 
 professor said harry at once i swear i 
 
 this is out of my hands potter said professor mcgonagall curtly 
 
 they marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle 
 
 lemon drop she said this was evidently a password because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two even full of dread for what was coming harry fail to be amazed behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward like an escalator as he and professor mcgonagall stepped onto it harry heard the wall thud closed behind them they rose upward in circles higher and higher until at last slightly dizzy harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin 
 
 he knew now where he was being taken this must be where dumbledore lived 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter eleven the fireboltcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry have a very clear idea of how he had managed to get back into the honeydukes cellar through the tunnel and into the castle once more all he knew was that the return trip seemed to take no time at all and that he hardly noticed what he was doing because his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard 
 
 why had nobody ever told him dumbledore hagrid mr weasley cornelius fudgewhy anyone ever mentioned the fact that parents had died because their best friend had betrayed them 
 
 ron and hermione watched harry nervously all through dinner not daring to talk about what overheard because percy was sitting close by them when they went upstairs to the crowded common room it was to find fred and george had set off half a dozen dungbombs in a fit of high spirits harry who want fred and george asking him whether reached hogsmeade or not sneaked quietly up to the empty dormitory and headed straight for his bedside cabinet he pushed his books aside and quickly found what he was looking for the photo album hagrid had given him two years ago which was full of wizard pictures of his mother and father he sat down on his bed drew the hangings around him and started turning the pages searching until 
 
 he stopped on a picture of his parents wedding day there was his father waving up at him beaming the untidy black hair harry had inherited standing up in all directions there was his mother alight with happiness arm in arm with his dad and therethat must be him their best manharry had never given him a thought before 
 
 if he known it was the same person he would never have guessed it was black in this old photograph his face sunken and waxy but handsome full of laughter had he already been working for voldemort when this picture had been taken was he already planning the deaths of the two people next to him did he realize he was facing twelve years in azkaban twelve years that would make him unrecognizable 
 
 but the dementors affect him harry thought staring into the handsome laughing face he have to hear my mum screaming if they get too close 
 
 harry slammed the album shut reached over and stuffed it back into his cabinet took off his robe and glasses and got into bed making sure the hangings were hiding him from view 
 
 the dormitory door opened 
 
 harry said voice uncertainly 
 
 but harry lay still pretending to be asleep he heard ron leave again and rolled over on his back his eyes wide open 
 
 a hatred such as he had never known before was coursing through harry like poison he could see black laughing at him through the darkness as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes he watched as though somebody was playing him a piece of film sirius black blasting peter pettigrew who resembled neville longbottom into a thousand pieces he could hear though having no idea what voice might sound like a low excited mutter it has happened my lordthe potters have made me their and then came another voice laughing shrilly the same laugh that harry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew near 
 
 harry you you look terrible 
 
 harry gotten to sleep until daybreak he had awoken to find the dormitory deserted dressed and gone down the spiral staircase to a common room that was completely empty except for ron who was eating a peppermint toad and massaging his stomach and hermione who had spread her homework over three tables 
 
 where is everyone said harry 
 
 gone the first day of the holidays remember said ron watching harry closely nearly lunchtime i was going to come and wake you up in a minute 
 
 harry slumped into a chair next to the fire snow was still falling outside the windows crookshanks was spread out in front of the fire like a large ginger rug 
 
 you really look well you know hermione said peering anxiously into his face 
 
 fine said harry 
 
 harry listen said hermione exchanging a look with ron you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday but the thing is you go doing anything stupid 
 
 like what said harry 
 
 like trying to go after black said ron sharply 
 
 harry could tell they had rehearsed this conversation while he had been asleep he say anything 
 
 you will you harry said hermione 
 
 because not worth dying for said ron 
 
 harry looked at them they seem to understand at all 
 
 know what i see and hear every time a dementor gets too near me ron and hermione shook their heads looking apprehensive i can hear my mum screaming and pleading with voldemort and if heard your mum screaming like that just about to be killed you forget it in a hurry and if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent voldemort after her 
 
 nothing you can do said hermione looking stricken the dementors will catch black and go back to azkaban and and serve him right 
 
 you heard what fudge said black affected by azkaban like normal people are not a punishment for him like it is for the others 
 
 so what are you saying said ron looking very tense you want to to kill black or something 
 
 be silly said hermione in a panicky voice harry want to kill anyone do you harry 
 
 again harry answer he know what he wanted to do all he knew was that the idea of doing nothing while black was at liberty was almost more than he could stand 
 
 malfoy knows he said abruptly remember what he said to me in potions if it was me hunt him down want revenge 
 
 going to take advice instead of ours said ron furiously listenyou know what mother got back after black had finished with him dad told me the order of merlin first class and finger in a box that was the biggest bit of him they could find a madman harry and dangerous 
 
 dad must have told him said harry ignoring ron he was right in inner circle 
 
 say will you interjected ron angrily 
 
 so obviously the malfoys knew black was working for voldemort 
 
 and love to see you blown into about a million pieces like pettigrew get a grip just hoping get yourself killed before he has to play you at quidditch 
 
 harry please said hermione her eyes now shining with tears please be sensible black did a terrible terrible thing but put yourself in danger what black wantsoh harry be playing right into hands if you went looking for him your mum and dad want you to get hurt would they never want you to go looking for black 
 
 never know what have wanted because thanks to black never spoken to them said harry shortly 
 
 there was a silence in which crookshanks stretched luxuriously flexing his claws pocket quivered 
 
 look said ron obviously casting around for a change of subject the holidays nearly christmas go down and see hagrid we visited him for ages 
 
 no said hermione quickly harry supposed to leave the castle ron 
 
 yeah go said harry sitting up and i can ask him how come he never mentioned black when he told me all about my parents 
 
 further discussion of sirius black plainly what ron had had in mind 
 
 or we could have a game of chess he said hastily or gobstones percy left a set 
 
 no visit hagrid said harry firmly 
 
 so they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off through the portrait hole stand and fight you mongrels down through the empty castle and out through the oak front doors 
 
 they made their way slowly down the lawn making a shallow trench in the glittering powdery snow their socks and the hems of their cloaks soaked and freezing the forbidden forest looked as though it had been enchanted each tree smattered with silver and cabin looked like an iced cake 
 
 ron knocked but there was no answer 
 
 not out is he said hermione who was shivering under her cloak 
 
 ron had his ear to the door 
 
 a weird noise he said listen is that fang 
 
 harry and hermione put their ears to the door too from inside the cabin came a series of low throbbing moans 
 
 think better go and get someone said ron nervously 
 
 hagrid called harry thumping the door hagrid are you in there 
 
 there was a sound of heavy footsteps then the door creaked open hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen tears splashing down the front of his leather vest 
 
 heard he bellowed and he flung himself onto neck 
 
 hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man this was no laughing matter harry about to collapse under weight was rescued by ron and hermione who each seized hagrid under an arm and heaved him back into the cabin hagrid allowed himself to be steered into a chair and slumped over the table sobbing uncontrollably his face glazed with tears that dripped down into his tangled beard 
 
 hagrid what is it said hermione aghast 
 
 harry spotted an letter lying open on the table 
 
 this hagrid 
 
 sobs redoubled but he shoved the letter toward harry who picked it up and read aloud 
 
 dear mr hagrid 
 further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a student in your class we have accepted the assurances of professor dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the regrettable incident 
 well okay then hagrid said ron clapping hagrid on the shoulder but hagrid continued to sob and waved one of his gigantic hands inviting harry to read on 
 
 however we must register our concern about the hippogriff in question we have decided to uphold the official complaint of mr lucius malfoy and this matter will therefore be taken to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures the hearing will take place on april th and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the offices in london on that date in the meantime the hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated 
 yours in fellowship 
 there followed a list of the school governors 
 
 oh said ron but you said buckbeak a bad hippogriff hagrid i bet get off 
 
 yeh don know them gargoyles at the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures choked hagrid wiping his eyes on his sleeve got it in fer interestin creatures 
 
 a sudden sound from the corner of cabin made harry ron and hermione whip around buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor 
 
 i couldn leave him tied up out there in the snow choked hagrid all on his own at christmas 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked at one another they had never seen eye to eye with hagrid about what he called interesting creatures and other people called terrifying monsters on the other hand there seem to be any particular harm in buckbeak in fact by usual standards he was positively cute 
 
 have to put up a good strong defense hagrid said hermione sitting down and laying a hand on massive forearm sure you can prove buckbeak is safe 
 
 won make no sobbed hagrid them disposal devils all in lucius pocket scared o him ad if i lose the case buckbeak 
 
 hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat then gave a great wail and lurched forward his face in his arms 
 
 what about dumbledore hagrid said harry 
 
 done enough fer me already groaned hagrid got enough on his plate what with keepin them dementors outta the castle an sirius black lurkin around 
 
 ron and hermione looked quickly at harry as though expecting him to start berating hagrid for not telling him the truth about black but harry bring himself to do it not now that he saw hagrid so miserable and scared 
 
 listen hagrid he said you give up right you just need a good defense you can call us as witnesses 
 
 sure read about a case of said hermione thoughtfully where the hippogriff got off look it up for you hagrid and see exactly what happened 
 
 hagrid howled still more loudly harry and hermione looked at ron to help them 
 
 er shall i make a cup of tea said ron 
 
 harry stared at him 
 
 what my mum does whenever upset ron muttered shrugging 
 
 at last after many more assurances of help with a steaming mug of tea in front of him hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the size of a tablecloth and said yer right i can afford to go ter pieces gotta pull meself together 
 
 fang the boarhound came timidly out from under the table and laid his head on knee 
 
 not bin meself lately said hagrid stroking fang with one hand and mopping his face with the other worried abou buckbeak an no one likin me classes 
 
 we do like them lied hermione at once 
 
 yeah great said ron crossing his fingers under the table er how are the flobberworms 
 
 dead said hagrid gloomily too much lettuce 
 
 oh no said ron his lip twitching 
 
 an them dementors make me feel ruddy terrible an all said hagrid with a sudden shudder gotta walk past em time i want a drink in the three broomsticks s like bein back in azkaban 
 
 he fell silent gulping his tea harry ron and hermione watched him breathlessly they had never heard hagrid talk about his brief spell in azkaban before after a pause hermione said timidly is it awful in there hagrid 
 
 no idea said hagrid quietly never bin anywhere like it thought i was goin mad kep goin over horrible stuff in me mindthe day i got expelled from hogwartsday me dad diedday i had ter let norbert go 
 
 his eyes filled with tears norbert was the baby dragon hagrid had once won in a game of cards 
 
 yeh can really remember who yeh are after a while an yeh can really see the point o livin at all i used ter hope jus die in me sleep when they let me out it was like bein born again came floodin back it was the bes feelin in the world mind the dementors keen on lettin me go 
 
 but you were innocent said hermione 
 
 hagrid snorted 
 
 think that matters to them they don care long as got a couple o hundred humans stuck there with em so they can leech all the happiness out of em they don give a damn guilty an not 
 
 hagrid went quiet for a moment staring into his tea then he said quietly thought o jus letting buckbeak go tryin ter make him fly awaybut how explain ter a hippogriff gotta go inter hidin an an scared o breakin the law he looked up at them tears leaking down his face again i don ever want ter go back ter azkaban 
 
 
 
 the trip to though far from fun had nevertheless had the effect ron and hermione had hoped though harry had by no means forgotten about black he brood constantly on revenge if he wanted to help hagrid win his case against the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures he ron and hermione went to the library the next day and returned to the empty common room laden with books that might help prepare a defense for buckbeak the three of them sat in front of the roaring fire slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases of marauding beasts speaking occasionally when they ran across something relevant 
 
 somethingthere was a case in but the hippogriff was convicted ugh look what they did to it disgusting 
 
 this might help look a manticore savaged someone in and they let the manticore off oh no that was only because everyone was too scared to go near it 
 
 meanwhile in the rest of the castle the usual magnificent christmas decorations had been put up despite the fact that hardly any of the students remained to enjoy them thick streamers of holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors mysterious lights shone from inside every suit of armor and the great hall was filled with its usual twelve christmas trees glittering with golden stars a powerful and delicious smell of cooking pervaded the corridors and by christmas eve it had grown so strong that even scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of pocket to sniff hopefully at the air 
 
 on christmas morning harry was woken by ron throwing his pillow at him 
 
 oy presents 
 
 harry reached for his glasses and put them on squinting through the to the foot of his bed where a small heap of parcels had appeared ron was already ripping the paper off his own presents 
 
 another sweater from mummaroon againsee if got one 
 
 harry had mrs weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the gryffindor lion knitted on the front also a dozen mince pies some christmas cake and a box of nut brittle as he moved all these things aside he saw a long thin package lying underneath 
 
 that said ron looking over a freshly unwrapped pair of maroon socks in his hand 
 
 dunno 
 
 harry ripped the parcel open and gasped as a magnificent gleaming broomstick rolled out onto his bedspread ron dropped his socks and jumped off his bed for a closer look 
 
 i believe it he said hoarsely 
 
 it was a firebolt identical to the dream broom harry had gone to see every day in diagon alley its handle glittered as he picked it up he could feel it vibrating and let go it hung in midair unsupported at exactly the right height for him to mount it his eyes moved from the golden registration number at the top of the handle right down to the perfectly smooth streamlined birch twigs that made up the tail 
 
 who sent it to you said ron in a hushed voice 
 
 look and see if a card said harry 
 
 ron ripped apart the wrappings 
 
 nothing blimey spend that much on you 
 
 well said harry feeling stunned betting it the dursleys 
 
 i bet it was dumbledore said ron now walking around and around the firebolt taking in every glorious inch he sent you the invisibility cloak anonymously 
 
 that was my though said harry dumbledore was just passing it on to me he spend hundreds of galleons on me he go giving students stuff like this 
 
 why he say it was from him said ron in case some git like malfoy said it was favoritism hey harry ron gave a great whoop of laughter malfoy wait til he sees you on this be sick as a pig this is an international standard broom this is 
 
 i believe this harry muttered running a hand along the firebolt while ron sank onto bed laughing his head off at the thought of malfoy who 
 
 i know said ron controlling himself i know who it been lupin 
 
 what said harry now starting to laugh himself lupin listen if he had this much gold be able to buy himself some new robes 
 
 yeah but he likes you said ron and he was away when your nimbus got smashed and he heard about it and decided to visit diagon alley and get this for you 
 
 what mean he was away said harry he was ill when i was playing in that match 
 
 well he in the hospital wing said ron i was there cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from snape remember 
 
 harry frowned at ron 
 
 i see lupin affording something like this 
 
 you two laughing about 
 
 hermione had just come in wearing her dressing gown and carrying crookshanks who was looking very grumpy with a string of tinsel tied around his neck 
 
 bring him in here said ron hurriedly snatching scabbers from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket 
 
 but hermione listening she dropped crookshanks onto empty bed and stared at the firebolt 
 
 oh harry who sent you that 
 
 no idea said harry there a card or anything with it 
 
 to his great surprise hermione did not appear either excited or intrigued by the news on the contrary her face fell and she bit her lip 
 
 the matter with you said ron 
 
 i know said hermione slowly but a bit odd it i mean this is supposed to be quite a good broom it 
 
 ron sighed exasperatedly 
 
 the best broom there is hermione he said 
 
 so it been really expensive 
 
 probably cost more than all the slytherins brooms put together said ron happily 
 
 send harry something as expensive as that and not even tell him sent it said hermione 
 
 who cares said ron impatiently listen harry can i have a go on it can i 
 
 i think anyone should ride that broom just yet said hermione shrilly 
 
 harry and ron looked at her 
 
 what think going to do with it sweep the floor said ron 
 
 but before hermione could answer crookshanks sprang from bed right at chest 
 
 get him out of here ron bellowed as claws ripped his pajamas and scabbers attempted a wild escape over his shoulder ron seized scabbers by the tail and aimed a misjudged kick at crookshanks that hit the trunk at the end of bed knocking it over and causing ron to hop up and down howling with pain 
 
 fur suddenly stood on end a shrill tinny whistling was filling the room the pocket sneakoscope had become dislodged from uncle old socks and was whirling and gleaming on the floor 
 
 i forgot about that harry said bending down and picking up the sneakoscope i never wear those socks if i can help it 
 
 the sneakoscope whirled and whistled in his palm crookshanks was hissing and spitting at it 
 
 better take that cat out of here hermione said ron furiously sitting on bed nursing his toe you shut that thing up he added to harry as hermione strode out of the room yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on ron 
 
 harry stuffed the sneakoscope back inside the socks and threw it back into his trunk all that could be heard now were stifled moans of pain and rage scabbers was huddled in hands it had been a while since harry had seen him out of pocket and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that scabbers once so fat was now very skinny patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too 
 
 not looking too good is he harry said 
 
 stress said ron be fine if that big stupid furball left him alone 
 
 but harry remembering what the woman at the magical menagerie had said about rats living only three years help feeling that unless scabbers had powers he had never revealed he was reaching the end of his life and despite frequent complaints that scabbers was both boring and useless he was sure ron would be very miserable if scabbers died 
 
 christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the gryffindor common room that morning hermione had shut crookshanks in her dormitory but was furious with ron for trying to kick him ron was still fuming about fresh attempt to eat scabbers harry gave up trying to make them talk to each other and devoted himself to examining the firebolt which he had brought down to the common room with him for some reason this seemed to annoy hermione as well she say anything but she kept looking darkly at the broom as though it too had been criticizing her cat 
 
 at lunchtime they went down to the great hall to find that the house tables had been moved against the walls again and that a single table set for twelve stood in the middle of the room professors dumbledore mcgonagall snape sprout and flitwick were there along with filch the caretaker who had taken off his usual brown coat and was wearing a very old and rather tailcoat there were only three other students two extremely first years and a slytherin fifth year 
 
 merry christmas said dumbledore as harry ron and hermione approached the table as there are so few of us it seemed foolish to use the house tablessit down sit down 
 
 harry ron and hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table 
 
 crackers said dumbledore enthusiastically offering the end of a large silver noisemaker to snape who took it reluctantly and tugged with a bang like a gunshot the cracker flew apart to reveal a large pointed witches hat topped with a stuffed vulture 
 
 harry remembering the boggart caught eye and they both grinned mouth thinned and he pushed the hat toward dumbledore who swapped it for his hat at once 
 
 dig in he advised the table beaming around 
 
 as harry was helping himself to roast potatoes the doors of the great hall opened again it was professor trelawney gliding toward them as though on wheels she had put on a green sequined dress in honor of the occasion making her look more than ever like a glittering oversized dragonfly 
 
 sibyll this is a pleasant surprise said dumbledore standing up 
 
 i have been crystal gazing headmaster said professor trelawney in her mistiest most faraway voice and to my astonishment i saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you who am i to refuse the promptings of fate i at once hastened from my tower and i do beg you to forgive my lateness 
 
 certainly certainly said dumbledore his eyes twinkling let me draw you up a chair 
 
 and he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand which revolved for a few seconds before falling with a thud between professors snape and mcgonagall professor trelawney however did not sit down her enormous eyes had been roving around the table and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream 
 
 i dare not headmaster if i join the table we shall be thirteen nothing could be more unlucky never forget that when thirteen dine together the first to rise will be the first to die 
 
 risk it sibyll said professor mcgonagall impatiently do sit down the getting stone cold 
 
 professor trelawney hesitated then lowered herself into the empty chair eyes shut and mouth clenched tight as though expecting a thunderbolt to hit the table professor mcgonagall poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen 
 
 tripe sibyll 
 
 professor trelawney ignored her eyes open again she looked around once more and said but where is dear professor lupin 
 
 afraid the poor fellow is ill again said dumbledore indicating that everybody should start serving themselves most unfortunate that it should happen on christmas day 
 
 but surely you already knew that sibyll said professor mcgonagall her eyebrows raised 
 
 professor trelawney gave professor mcgonagall a very cold look 
 
 certainly i knew minerva she said quietly but one does not parade the fact that one is i frequently act as though i am not possessed of the inner eye so as not to make others nervous 
 
 that explains a great deal said professor mcgonagall tartly 
 
 professor voice suddenly became a good deal less misty 
 
 if you must know minerva i have seen that poor professor lupin will not be with us for very long he seems aware himself that his time is short he positively fled when i offered to crystal gaze for him 
 
 imagine that said professor mcgonagall dryly 
 
 i doubt said dumbledore in a cheerful but slightly raised voice which put an end to professor mcgonagall and professor conversation that professor lupin is in any immediate danger severus made the potion for him again 
 
 yes headmaster said snape 
 
 good said dumbledore then he should be up and about in no timederek have you had any of the chipolatas excellent 
 
 the boy went furiously red on being addressed directly by dumbledore and took the platter of sausages with trembling hands 
 
 professor trelawney behaved almost normally until the very end of christmas dinner two hours later full to bursting with christmas dinner and still wearing their cracker hats harry and ron got up first from the table and she shrieked loudly 
 
 my dears which of you left his seat first which 
 
 dunno said ron looking uneasily at harry 
 
 i doubt it will make much difference said professor mcgonagall coldly unless a mad is waiting outside the doors to slaughter the first into the entrance hall 
 
 even ron laughed professor trelawney looked highly affronted 
 
 coming harry said to hermione 
 
 no hermione muttered i want a quick word with professor mcgonagall 
 
 probably trying to see if she can take any more classes yawned ron as they make their way into the entrance hall which was completely devoid of mad 
 
 when they reached the portrait hole they found sir cadogan enjoying a christmas part with a couple of monks several previous headmasters of hogwarts and his fat pony he pushed up his visor toasted them with a flagon of mead 
 
 merry hic christmas password 
 
 scurvy cur said ron 
 
 and the same to you sir roared sir cadogan as the painting swung forward to admit them 
 
 harry went straight up to the dormitory collected his firebolt and the broomstick servicing kit hermione had given him for his birthday brought them downstairs and tried to find something to do with the firebolt however there where no bent twigs to clip and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it he and ron simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened and hermione came in accompanied by professor mcgonagall 
 
 though professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor house harry had only seen her in the common room once before and that had been to make a very grave announcement he and ron stared at her both holding the firebolt hermione walked around them sat down picked up the nearest book and hid her face behind it 
 
 so it is it said professor mcgonagall beadily walking over to the fireside and staring at the firebolt miss granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick potter 
 
 harry and ron looked around at hermione they could see her forehead reddening over the top of her book which was 
 
 may i said professor mcgonagall but she wait for an answer before pulling the firebolt out of their hands she examined it carefully from handle to hmm and there was no note at all potter no card no message of any kind 
 
 no said harry blankly 
 
 i see said professor mcgonagall well afraid i will have to take this potter 
 
 w what said harry scrambling to his feet why 
 
 it will need to be checked for jinxes said professor mcgonagall of course no expert but i daresay madam hooch and professor flitwick will strip it down 
 
 strip it down repeated ron as though professor mcgonagall was mad 
 
 it take more than a few weeks said professor mcgonagall you will have it back if we are sure it is 
 
 nothing wrong with it said harry his voice shaking slightly honestly professor 
 
 you know that potter said professor mcgonagall quite kindly not until flown it at any rate and afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with i shall keep you informed 
 
 professor mcgonagall turned on her heel and carried the firebolt out of the portrait hole which closed behind her harry stood staring after her the tin of polish still clutched in his hands ron however rounded on hermione 
 
 what did you go running to mcgonagall for 
 
 hermione threw her book aside she was still pink in the face but stood up and faced ron defiantly 
 
 because i thought and professor mcgonagall agrees with me that that broom was probably sent to harry by sirius black

lionfish nov chapter eleven aboard the hogwart expresscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 there was a definite gloom in the air when harry awoke next morning heavy rain was still splattering against the window as he got dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt they would change into their school robes on the hogwarts express 
 
 he ron fred and george had just reached the landing on their way down to breakfast when mrs weasley appeared at the foot of the stairs looking harassed 
 
 arthur she called up the staircase arthur urgent message from the ministry 
 
 harry flattened himself against the wall as mr weasley came clattering past with his robes on and hurtled out of sight when harry and the others entered the kitchen they saw mrs weasley rummaging anxiously in the drawers got a quill here somewhere and mr weasley bending over the fire talking to 
 
 harry shut his eyes hard and opened them again to make sure that they were working properly 
 
 amos head was sitting in the middle of the flames like a large bearded egg it was talking very fast completely unperturbed by the sparks flying around it and the flames licking its ears 
 
 muggle neighbors heard bangs and shouting so they went and called those arthur got to get over there 
 
 here said mrs weasley breathlessly pushing a piece of parchment a bottle of ink and a crumpled quill into mr hands 
 
 a real stroke of luck i heard about it said mr head i had to come into the office early to send a couple of owls and i found the improper use of magic lot all setting off if rita skeeter gets hold of this one arthur 
 
 what does say happened asked mr weasley unscrewing the ink bottle loading up his quill and preparing to take notes 
 
 mr head rolled its eyes says he heard an intruder in his yard says he was creeping toward the house but was ambushed by his dustbins 
 
 what did the dustbins do asked mr weasley scribbling frantically 
 
 made one hell of a noise and fired rubbish everywhere as far as i can tell said mr diggory apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the turned up 
 
 mr weasley groaned 
 
 and what about the intruder 
 
 arthur you know said mr head rolling its eyes again someone creeping into his yard in the dead of night more likely a very cat wandering around somewhere covered in potato peelings but if the improper use of magic lot get their hands on had it think of his record got to get him off on a minor charge something in your department what are exploding dustbins worth 
 
 might be a caution said mr weasley still writing very fast his brow furrowed use his wand he actually attack anyone 
 
 bet he leapt out of bed and started jinxing everything he could reach through the window said mr diggory but have a job proving it there any casualties 
 
 all right off mr weasley said and he stuffed the parchment with his notes on it into his pocket and dashed out of the kitchen again 
 
 mr head looked around at mrs weasley 
 
 sorry about this molly it said more calmly bothering you so early and everythingbut the only one who can get off and supposed to be starting his new job today why he had to choose last night 
 
 never mind amos said mrs weasley sure you have a bit of toast or anything before you go 
 
 oh go on then said mr diggory 
 
 mrs weasley took a piece of buttered toast from a stack on the kitchen table put it into the fire tongs and transferred it into mr mouth 
 
 fanks he said in a muffled voice and then with a small pop vanished 
 
 harry could hear mr weasley calling hurried to bill charlie percy and the girls within five minutes he was back in the kitchen his robes on the right way now dragging a comb through his hair 
 
 better hurry you have a good term boys said mr weasley to harry ron and the twins fastening a cloak over his shoulders and preparing to disapparate molly are you going to be all right taking the kids to cross 
 
 of course i will she said you just look after be fine 
 
 as mr weasley vanished bill and charlie entered the kitchen 
 
 did someone say bill asked he been up to now 
 
 he says someone tried to break into his house last night said mrs weasley 
 
 moody said george thoughtfully spreading marmalade on his toast he that nutter 
 
 your father thinks very highly of moody said mrs weasley sternly 
 
 yeah well dad collects plugs he said fred quietly as mrs weasley left the room birds of a feather 
 
 moody was a great wizard in his time said bill 
 
 an old friend of he said charlie 
 
 not what call normal though is he said fred i mean i know a genius and everything 
 
 who is asked harry 
 
 retired used to work at the ministry said charlie i met him once when dad took me into work with him he was an auror one of the besta dark wizard catcher he added seeing blank look half the cells in azkaban are full because of him he made himself loads of enemies thoughthe families of people he caught mainlyand i heard been getting really paranoid in his old age trust anyone anymore sees dark wizards everywhere 
 
 bill and charlie decided to come and see everyone off at cross station but percy apologizing most profusely said that he really needed to get to work 
 
 i just justify taking more time off at the moment he told them mr crouch is really starting to rely on me 
 
 yeah you know what percy said george seriously i reckon know your name soon 
 
 mrs weasley had braved the telephone in the village post office to order three ordinary muggle taxis to take them into london 
 
 arthur tried to borrow ministry cars for us mrs weasley whispered to harry as they stood in the yard watching the taxi drivers heaving six heavy hogwarts trunks into their cars but there any to dear they look happy do they 
 
 harry like to tell mrs weasley that muggle taxi drivers rarely transported overexcited owls and pigwidgeon was making an earsplitting racket nor did it help that a number of fabulous fireworks went off unexpectedly when trunk sprang open causing the driver carrying it to yell with fright and pain as crookshanks clawed his way up the leg 
 
 the journey was uncomfortable owing to the fact that they were jammed in the back of the taxis with their trunks crookshanks took quite a while to recover from the fireworks and by the time they entered london harry ron and hermione were all severely scratched they were very relieved to get out at cross even though the rain was coming down harder than ever and they got soaked carrying their trunks across the busy road and into the station 
 
 harry was used to getting onto platform nine and by now it was a simple matter of walking straight through the apparently solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten the only tricky part was doing this in an unobtrusive way so as to avoid attracting muggle attention they did it in groups today harry ron and hermione the most conspicuous since they were accompanied by pigwidgeon and crookshanks went first they leaned casually against the barrier chatting unconcernedly and slid sideways through itand as they did so platform nine and materialized in front of them 
 
 the hogwarts express a gleaming scarlet steam engine was already there clouds of steam billowing from it through which the many hogwarts students and parents on the platform appeared like dark ghosts pigwidgeon became noisier than ever in response to the hooting of many owls through the mist harry ron and hermione set off to find seats and were soon stowing their luggage in a compartment halfway along the train they then hopped back down onto the platform to say to mrs weasley bill and charlie 
 
 i might be seeing you all sooner than you think said charlie grinning as he hugged ginny 
 
 why said fred keenly 
 
 see said charlie just tell percy i mentioned classified information until such time as the ministry sees fit to release it after all 
 
 yeah i sort of wish i were back at hogwarts this year said bill hands in his pockets looking almost wistfully at the train 
 
 why said george impatiently 
 
 going to have an interesting year said bill his eyes twinkling i might even get time off to come and watch a bit of it 
 
 a bit of what said ron 
 
 but at that moment the whistle blew and mrs weasley chivvied them toward the train doors 
 
 thanks for having us to stay mrs weasley said hermione as they climbed on board closed the door and leaned out of the window to talk to her 
 
 yeah thanks for everything mrs weasley said harry 
 
 oh it was my pleasure dears said mrs weasley invite you for christmas butwell i expect all going to want to stay at hogwarts what withone thing and another 
 
 mum said ron irritably what three know that we 
 
 find out this evening i expect said mrs weasley smiling going to be very exciting mind you very glad changed the rules 
 
 what rules said harry ron fred and george together 
 
 sure professor dumbledore will tell behave you you fred and you george 
 
 the pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move 
 
 tell us happening at hogwarts fred bellowed out of the window as mrs weasley bill and charlie sped away from them what rules are they changing 
 
 but mrs weasley only smiled and waved before the train had rounded the corner she bill and charlie had disapparated 
 
 harry ron and hermione went back to their compartment the thick rain splattering the windows made it very difficult to see out of them ron undid his trunk pulled out his maroon dress robes and flung them over cage to muffle his hooting 
 
 bagman wanted to tell us happening at hogwarts he said grumpily sitting down next to harry at the world cup remember but my own mother say wonder what 
 
 shh hermione whispered suddenly pressing her finger to her lips and pointing toward the compartment next to theirs harry and ron listened and heard a familiar drawling voice drifting in through the open door 
 
 father actually considered sending me to durmstrang rather than hogwarts you know he knows the headmaster you see well you know his opinion of dumbledore the such a and durmstrang admit that sort of riffraff but mother like the idea of me going to school so far away father says durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than hogwarts about the dark arts durmstrang students actually learn them not just the defense rubbish we do 
 
 hermione got up tiptoed to the compartment door and slid it shut blocking out voice 
 
 so he thinks durmstrang would have suited him does he she said angrily i wish he had gone then we have to put up with him 
 
 another wizarding school said harry 
 
 yes said hermione sniffily and got a horrible reputation according to an appraisal of magical education in europe it puts a lot of emphasis on the dark arts 
 
 i think heard of it said ron vaguely where is it what country 
 
 well nobody knows do they said hermione raising her eyebrows 
 
 er why not said harry 
 
 traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools durmstrang and beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets said hermione 
 
 come off it said ron starting to laugh got to be about the same size as hogwarts how are you going to hide a great big castle 
 
 but hogwarts is hidden said hermione in surprise everyone knows thatwell everyone read hogwarts a history anyway 
 
 just you then said ron so go on how hide a place like hogwarts 
 
 bewitched said hermione if a muggle looks at it all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying danger do not enter unsafe 
 
 so just look like a ruin to an outsider too 
 
 maybe said hermione shrugging or it might have charms on it like the world cup stadium and to keep foreign wizards from finding it have made it unplottable 
 
 come again 
 
 well you can enchant a building so impossible to plot on a map you 
 
 erif you say so said harry 
 
 but i think durmstrang must be somewhere in the far north said hermione thoughtfully somewhere very cold because got fur capes as part of their uniforms 
 
 ah think of the possibilities said ron dreamily it been so easy to push malfoy off a glacier and make it look like an his mother likes him 
 
 the rain became heavier and heavier as the train moved farther north the sky was so dark and the windows so steamy that the lanterns were lit by midday the lunch trolley came rattling along the corridor and harry bought a large stack of cauldron cakes for them to share 
 
 several of their friends looked in on them as the afternoon progressed including seamus finnigan dean thomas and neville longbottom a extremely forgetful boy who had been brought up by his formidable witch of a grandmother seamus was still wearing his ireland rosette some of its magic seemed to be wearing off now it was still squeaking troy mullet moran but in a very feeble and exhausted sort of way after half an hour or so hermione growing tired of the endless quidditch talk buried herself once more in the standard book of spells grade and started trying to learn a summoning charm 
 
 neville listened jealously to the others conversation as they relived the cup match 
 
 gran want to go he said miserably buy tickets it sounded amazing though 
 
 it was said ron look at this neville 
 
 he rummaged in his trunk up in the luggage rack and pulled out the miniature figure of viktor krum 
 
 oh wow said neville enviously as ron tipped krum onto his pudgy hand 
 
 we saw him right up close as well said ron we were in the top box 
 
 for the first and last time in your life weasley 
 
 draco malfoy had appeared in the doorway behind him stood crabbe and goyle his enormous thuggish cronies both of whom appeared to have grown at least a foot during the summer evidently they had overheard the conversation through the compartment door which dean and seamus had left ajar 
 
 remember asking you to join us malfoy said harry coolly 
 
 weasleywhat is that said malfoy pointing at cage a sleeve of dress robes was dangling from it swaying with the motion of the train the moldy lace cuff very obvious 
 
 ron made to stuff the robes out of sight but malfoy was too quick for him he seized the sleeve and pulled 
 
 look at this said malfoy in ecstasy holding up robes and showing crabbe and goyle weasley you thinking of wearing these were you i mean they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety 
 
 eat dung malfoy said ron the same color as the dress robes as he snatched them back out of grip malfoy howled with derisive laughter crabbe and goyle guffawed stupidly 
 
 sogoing to enter weasley going to try and bring a bit of glory to the family name money involved as well you be able to afford some decent robes if you won 
 
 what are you talking about snapped ron 
 
 are you going to enter malfoy repeated i suppose you will potter you never miss a chance to show off do you 
 
 either explain what on about or go away malfoy said hermione testily over the top of the standard book of spells grade 
 
 a gleeful smile spread across pale face 
 
 tell me you know he said delightedly got a father and brother at the ministry and you even know my god my father told me about it ages agoheard it from cornelius fudge but then always associated with the top people at the your too junior to know about it weasleyyesthey probably talk about important stuff in front of him 
 
 laughing once more malfoy beckoned to crabbe and goyle and the three of them disappeared 
 
 ron got to his feet and slammed the sliding compartment door so hard behind them that the glass shattered 
 
 ron said hermione reproachfully and she pulled out her wand muttered reparo and the glass shards flew back into a single pane and back into the door 
 
 wellmaking it look like he knows everything and we ron snarled always associated with the top people at the got a promotion any timehe just likes it where he is 
 
 of course he does said hermione quietly let malfoy get to you ron 
 
 him get to me as if said ron picking up one of the remaining cauldron cakes and squashing it into a pulp 
 
 bad mood continued for the rest of the journey he talk much as they changed into their school robes and was still glowering when the hogwarts express slowed down at last and finally stopped in the of hogsmeade station 
 
 as the train doors opened there was a rumble of thunder overhead hermione bundled up crookshanks in her cloak and ron left his dress robes over pigwidgeon as they left the train heads bent and eyes narrowed against the downpour the rain was now coming down so thick and fast that it was as though buckets of water were being emptied repeatedly over their heads 
 
 hi hagrid harry yelled seeing a gigantic silhouette at the far end of the platform 
 
 all righ harry hagrid bellowed back waving see yeh at the feast if we don drown 
 
 first years traditionally reached hogwarts castle by sailing across the lake with hagrid 
 
 oooh i fancy crossing the lake in this weather said hermione fervently shivering as they inched slowly along the dark platform with the rest of the crowd a hundred horseless carriages stood waiting for them outside the station harry ron hermione and neville climbed gratefully into one of them the door shut with a snap and a few moments later with a great lurch the long procession of carriages was rumbling and splashing its way up the track toward hogwarts castle

lionfish nov chapter eleven the sorting new songcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry did not want to tell the others that he and luna were having the same hallucination if that was what it was so he said nothing more about the horses as he sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind him nevertheless he could not help watching the silhouettes of the horses moving beyond the window 
 
 did everyone see that woman asked ginny she doing back here hagrid have left can he 
 
 be quite glad if he has said luna he a very good teacher is he 
 
 yes he is said harry ron and ginny angrily 
 
 harry glared at hermione she cleared her throat and quickly said erm yes very good 
 
 well we in ravenclaw think a bit of a joke said luna unfazed 
 
 got a rubbish sense of humour then ron snapped as the wheels below them creaked into motion 
 
 luna did not seem perturbed by rudeness on the contrary she simply watched him for a while as though he were a mildly interesting television programme 
 
 rattling and swaying the carriages moved in convoy up the road when they passed between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars on either side of the gates to the school grounds harry leaned forwards to try and see whether there were any lights on in cabin by the forbidden forest but the grounds were in complete darkness hogwarts castle however loomed ever closer a towering mass of turrets jet black against the dark sky here and there a window blazing fiery bright above them 
 
 the carriages jingled to a halt near the stone steps leading up to the oak front doors and harry got out of the carriage first he turned again to look for lit windows down by the forest but there was definitely no sign of life within cabin unwillingly because he had they would have vanished he turned his eyes instead upon the strange skeletal creatures standing quietly in the chill night air their blank white eyes gleaming 
 
 harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that ron could not but that had been a reflection in a mirror something much more insubstantial than a hundred very beasts strong enough to pull a fleet of carriages if luna was to be believed the beasts had always been there but invisible why then could harry suddenly see them and why could ron not 
 
 are you coming or what said ron beside him 
 
 oh yeah said harry quickly and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone steps into the castle 
 
 the entrance hall was ablaze with torches and echoing with footsteps as the students crossed the flagged stone floor for the double doors to the right leading to the great hall and the feast 
 
 the four long house tables in the great hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows candles floated in midair all along the tables illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted about the hall and the faces of the students talking eagerly exchanging summer news shouting greetings at friends from other houses eyeing one new haircuts and robes again harry noticed people putting their heads together to whisper as he passed he gritted his teeth and tried to act as though he neither noticed nor cared 
 
 luna drifted away from them at the ravenclaw table the moment they reached ginny was hailed by some fellow and left to sit with them harry ron hermione and neville found seats together about halfway down the table between nearly headless nick the gryffindor house ghost and parvati patil and lavender brown the last two of whom gave harry airy greetings that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before he had more important things to worry about however he was looking over the students heads to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the hall 
 
 not there 
 
 ron and hermione scanned the staff table too though there was no real need size made him instantly obvious in any lineup 
 
 he have left said ron sounding slightly anxious 
 
 of course he said harry firmly 
 
 you think hurt or anything do you said hermione uneasily 
 
 no said harry at once 
 
 but where is he then 
 
 there was a pause then harry said very quietly so that neville parvati and lavender could not hear maybe not back yet you knowfrom his missionthe thing he was doing over the summer for dumbledore 
 
 yeah yeah be it said ron sounding reassured but hermione bit her lip looking up and down the staff table as though hoping for some conclusive explanation of absence 
 
 that she said sharply pointing towards the middle of the staff table 
 
 eyes followed hers they lit first upon professor dumbledore sitting in his golden chair at the centre of the long staff table wearing robes scattered with silvery stars and a matching hat head was inclined towards the woman sitting next to him who was talking into his ear she looked harry thought like maiden aunt squat with short curly hair in which she had placed a horrible pink alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robes then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw with a shock of recognition a pallid toadlike face and a pair of prominent pouchy eyes 
 
 that umbridge woman 
 
 who said hermione 
 
 she was at my hearing she works for fudge 
 
 nice cardigan said ron smirking 
 
 she works for fudge hermione repeated frowning what on she doing here then 
 
 dunno 
 
 hermione scanned the staff table her eyes narrowed 
 
 no she muttered no surely not 
 
 harry did not understand what she was talking about but did not ask his attention had been caught by professor who had just appeared behind the staff table she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been that meant the must have crossed the lake and reached the castle and sure enough a few seconds later the doors from the entrance hall opened a long line of entered led by professor mcgonagall who was carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizards hat heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brim 
 
 the buzz of talk in the great hall faded away the lined up in front of the staff table facing the rest of the students and professor mcgonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them then stood back 
 
 the faces glowed palely in the candlelight a small boy right in the middle of the row looked as though he was trembling harry recalled fleetingly how terrified he had felt when he had stood there waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which house he belonged 
 
 the whole school waited with bated breath then the rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the sorting hat burst into song 
 
 in times of old when i was new 
 
 and hogwarts barely started 
 
 the founders of our noble school 
 
 thought never to be parted 
 
 united by a common goal 
 
 they had the selfsame yearning 
 
 to make the best magic school 
 
 and pass along their learning 
 
 together we will build and teach 
 
 the four good friends decided 
 
 and never did they dream that they 
 
 might some day be divided 
 
 for were there such friends anywhere 
 
 as slytherin and gryffindor 
 
 unless it was the second pair 
 
 of hufflepuff and ravenclaw 
 
 so how could it have gone so wrong 
 
 how could such friendships fail 
 
 why i was there and so can tell 
 
 the whole sad sorry tale 
 
 said slytherin teach just those 
 
 whose ancestry is purest 
 
 said ravenclaw teach those whose 
 
 intelligence is surest 
 
 said gryffindor teach all those 
 
 with brave deeds to their name 
 
 said hufflepuff teach the lot 
 
 and treat them just the same 
 
 these differences caused little strife 
 
 when first they came to light 
 
 for each of the four founders had 
 
 a house in which they might 
 
 take only those they wanted so 
 
 for instance slytherin 
 
 took only wizards 
 
 of great cunning just like him 
 
 and only those of sharpest mind 
 
 were taught by ravenclaw 
 
 while the bravest and the boldest 
 
 went to daring gryffindor 
 
 good hufflepuff she took the rest 
 
 and taught them all she knew 
 
 thus the houses and their founders 
 
 retained friendships firm and true 
 
 so hogwarts worked in harmony 
 
 for several happy years 
 
 but then discord crept among us 
 
 feeding on our faults and fears 
 
 the houses that like pillars four 
 
 had once held up our school 
 
 now turned upon each other and 
 
 divided sought to rule 
 
 and for a while it seemed the school 
 
 must meet an early end 
 
 what with duelling and with fighting 
 
 and the clash of friend on friend 
 
 and at last there came c morning 
 
 when old slytherin departed 
 
 and though the fighting then died out 
 
 he left us quite downhearted 
 
 and never since the founders four 
 
 were whittled down to three 
 
 have the houses been united 
 
 as they once were meant to be 
 
 and now the sorting hat is here 
 
 and you all know the score 
 
 i sort you into houses 
 
 because that is what for 
 
 but this year go further 
 
 listen closely to my song 
 
 though condemned i am to split you 
 
 still i worry that wrong 
 
 though i must fulfil my duty 
 
 and must quarter every year 
 
 still i wonder whether sorting 
 
 may not bring the end i fear 
 
 oh know the perils read the signs 
 
 the warning history shows 
 
 for our hogwarts is in danger 
 
 from external deadly foes 
 
 and we must unite inside her 
 
 or crumble from within 
 
 i have told you i have warned you 
 
 let the sorting now begin 
 
 
 
 the hat became motionless once more applause broke out though it was punctured for the first time in memory with muttering and whispers all across the great hall students were exchanging remarks with their neighbours and harry clapping along with everyone else knew exactly what they were talking about 
 
 branched out a bit this year it said ron his eyebrows raised 
 
 too right it has said harry 
 
 the sorting hat usually confined itself to describing the different qualities looked for by each of the four hogwarts houses and its own role in sorting them harry could not remember it ever trying to give the school advice before 
 
 i wonder if ever given warnings before said hermione sounding slightly anxious 
 
 yes indeed said nearly headless nick knowledgeably leaning across neville towards her neville winced it was very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you the hat feels itself to give the school due warning whenever it feels 
 
 but professor mcgonagall who was waiting to read out the list of names was giving the whispering students the sort of look that scorches nearly headless nick placed a finger to his lips and sat primly upright again as the muttering came to an abrupt end with a last frowning look that swept the lour house tables professor mcgonagall lowered her eyes to her long piece of parchment and called out the first name 
 
 abercrombie euan 
 
 the boy harry had noticed earlier stumbled forwards and put the hat on his head it was only prevented from falling right down to his shoulders by his very prominent ears the hat considered for a moment then the rip near the brim opened again and shouted 
 
 gryffindor 
 
 harry clapped loudly with the rest of gryffindor house as euan abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down looking as though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again 
 
 slowly the long line of thinned in the pauses between the names and the sorting decisions harry could hear stomach rumbling loudly finally zeller rose was sorted into hufflepuff and professor mcgonagall picked up the hat and stool and marched them away as professor dumbledore rose to his feet 
 
 whatever his recent bitter feelings had been towards his headmaster harry was somehow soothed to see dumbledore standing before them all between the absence of hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses he had felt that his return to hogwarts so long anticipated was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song but this at least was how it was supposed to be their headmaster rising to greet them all before the feast 
 
 to our newcomers said dumbledore in a ringing voice his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips welcome to our old handswelcome back there is a time for but this is not it tuck in 
 
 there was an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause as dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so as to keep it out of the way of his platefor food had appeared out of nowhere so that the five long tables were groaning under joints and pies and dishes of vegetables bread and sauces and flagons of pumpkin juice 
 
 excellent said ron with a kind of groan of longing and he seized the nearest plate of chops and began piling them on to his plate watched wistfully by nearly headless nick 
 
 what were you saying before the sorting hermione asked the ghost about the hat giving warnings 
 
 oh yes said nick who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from ron who was now eating roast potatoes with almost indecent enthusiasm yes i have heard the hat give several warnings before always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school and always of course its advice is the same stand together be strong from within 
 
 ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat said ron 
 
 his mouth was so full harry thought it was quite an achievement for him to make any noise at all 
 
 i beg your pardon said nearly headless nick politely while hermione looked revolted ron gave an enormous swallow and said how can it know if the in danger if a hat 
 
 i have no idea said nearly headless nick of course it lives in office so i daresay it picks things up there 
 
 and it wants all the houses to be friends said harry looking over at the slytherin table where draco malfoy was holding court fat chance 
 
 well now you take that attitude said nick reprovingly peaceful the key we ghosts though we belong to separate houses maintain links of friendship in spite of the competitiveness between gryffindor and slytherin i would never dream of seeking an argument with the bloody baron 
 
 only because terrified of him said ron 
 
 nearly headless nick looked highly affronted 
 
 terrified i hope i sir nicholas de have never been guilty of cowardice in my life the noble blood that runs in my veins 
 
 what blood asked ron surely you still got 
 
 a figure of speech said nearly headless nick now so annoyed his head was trembling ominously on his partially severed neck i assume i am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever words i like even if the pleasures of eating and drinking are denied me but i am quite used to students poking fun at my death i assure you 
 
 nick he really laughing at you said hermione throwing a furious look at ron 
 
 unfortunately mouth was packed to exploding point again and all he could manage was node iddum eentup sechew which nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology rising into the air he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end of the table coming to rest between the creevey brothers colin and dennis 
 
 well done ron snapped hermione 
 
 what said ron indignantly having managed finally to swallow his food not allowed to ask a simple question 
 
 oh forget it said hermione irritably and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence 
 
 harry was too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile them he felt it was a better use of his time to eat his way steadily through his steak and kidney pie then a large plateful of his favourite treacle tart 
 
 when all the students had finished eating and the noise level in the hall was starting to creep upwards again dumbledore got to his feet once more talking ceased immediately as all turned to face the headmaster harry was feeling pleasantly drowsy now his bed was waiting somewhere above wonderfully warm and soft 
 
 well now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast i beg a few moments of your attention for the usual notices said dumbledore ought to know that the forest in the grounds is to studentsand a few of our older students ought to know by now too harry ron and hermione exchanged smirks 
 
 mr filch the caretaker has asked me for what he tells me is the time to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes nor are a number of other things all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to mr office door 
 
 we have had two changes in staffing this year we are very pleased to welcome back professor who will be taking care of magical creatures lessons we are also delighted to introduce professor umbridge our new defence against the dark arts teacher 
 
 there was a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause during which harry ron and hermione exchanged slightly panicked looks dumbledore had not said for how long would be teaching 
 
 dumbledore continued tryouts for the house quidditch teams will take place on the 
 
 he broke off looking enquiringly at professor umbridge as she was not much taller standing than sitting there was a moment when nobody understood why dumbledore had stopped talking but then professor umbridge cleared her throat hem hem and it became clear that she had got to her feet and was intending to make a speech 
 
 dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment then he sat down smartly and looked alertly at professor umbridge as though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk other members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise professor eyebrows had disappeared into her flyaway hair and professor mouth was as thin as harry had ever seen it no new teacher had ever interrupted dumbledore before many of the students were smirking this woman obviously did not know how things were done at hogwarts 
 
 thank you headmaster professor umbridge simpered for those kind words of welcome 
 
 her voice was breathy and and again harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself all he knew was that he loathed everything about her from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan she gave another little cough hem hem and continued 
 
 well it is lovely to be back at hogwarts i must say she smiled revealing very pointed teeth and to see such happy little faces looking up at me 
 
 harry glanced around none of the faces he could see looked happy on the contrary they all looked rather at being addressed as though they were five years old 
 
 i am very much looking forward to getting to know you all and sure be very good friends 
 
 students exchanged looks at this some of them were barely concealing grins 
 
 be her friend as long as i have to borrow that cardigan parvati whispered to lavender and both of them lapsed into silent giggles 
 
 professor umbridge cleared her throat again hem hem but when she continued some of the breathiness had vanished from her voice she sounded much more businesslike and now her words had a dull sound to them 
 
 the ministry of magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance the rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction the ancient skills unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose them for ever the treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded replenished and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching 
 
 professor umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff members none of whom bowed back to her professor dark eyebrows had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike and harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance with professor sprout as umbridge gave another little hem hem and went on with her speech 
 
 every headmaster and headmistress of hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school and that is as it should be for without progress there will be stagnation and decay there again progress for sake must be discouraged for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering a balance then between old and new between permanence and change between tradition and innovation 
 
 harry found his attentiveness ebbing as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune the quiet that always filled the hall when dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads together whispering and giggling over on the ravenclaw table cho chang was chatting animatedly with her friends a few seats along from cho luna lovegood had got out the quibbler again meanwhile at the hufflepuff table ernie macmillan was one of the few still staring at professor umbridge but he was and harry was sure he was only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new badge gleaming on his chest 
 
 professor umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience harry had the impression that a riot could have broken out under her nose and she would have ploughed on with her speech the teachers however were still listening very attentively and hermione seemed to be drinking in every word umbridge spoke though judging by her expression they were not at all to her taste 
 
 because some changes will be for the better while others will come in the fullness of time to be recognised as errors of judgement meanwhile some old habits will be retained and rightly so whereas others outmoded and outworn must be abandoned let us move forward then into a new era of openness effectiveness and accountability intent on preserving what ought to be preserved perfecting what needs to be perfected and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited 
 
 she sat down dumbledore clapped the staff followed his lead though harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping a few students joined in but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech not having listened to more than a few words of it and before they could start applauding properly dumbledore had stood up again 
 
 thank you very much professor umbridge that was most illuminating he said bowing to her now as i was saying quidditch tryouts will be held 
 
 yes it certainly was illuminating said hermione in a low voice 
 
 not telling me you enjoyed it ron said quietly turning a glazed face towards hermione that was about the dullest speech ever heard and i grew up with percy 
 
 i said illuminating not enjoyable said hermione it explained a lot 
 
 did it said harry in surprise sounded like a load of waffle to me 
 
 there was some important stuff hidden in the waffle said hermione grimly 
 
 was there said ron blankly 
 
 how about progress for sake must be discouraged how about pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited 
 
 well what does that mean said ron impatiently 
 
 tell you what it means said hermione through gritted teeth it means the interfering at hogwarts 
 
 there was a great clattering and banging all around them dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the school because everyone was standing up ready to leave the hall hermione jumped up looking flustered 
 
 ron supposed to show the where to go 
 
 oh yeah said ron who had obviously forgotten heyhey you lot midgets 
 
 ron 
 
 well they are titchy 
 
 i know but you call them hermione called commandingly along the table this way please 
 
 a group of new students walked shyly up the gap between the gryffindor and hufflepuff tables all of them trying hard not to lead the group they did indeed seem very small harry was sure he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here he grinned at them a blond boy next to euan abercrombie looked petrified he nudged euan and whispered something in his ear euan abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at harry who felt the grin slide off his face like stinksap 
 
 see you later he said dully to ron and hermione and he made his way out of the great hall alone doing everything he could to ignore more whispering staring and pointing as he passed he kept his eyes fixed ahead as he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall then he hurried up the marble staircase took a couple of concealed short cuts and had soon left most of the crowds behind 
 
 he had been stupid not to expect this he thought angrily as he walked through the much emptier upstairs corridors of course everyone was staring at him he had emerged from the triwizard maze two months previously clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen lord voldemort return to power there had not been time last term to explain himself before all had to go homeeven if he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible events in that graveyard 
 
 harry had reached the end of the corridor to the gryffindor common room and come to a halt in front of the portrait of the fat lady before he realised that he did not know the new password 
 
 er he said glumly staring up at the fat lady who smoothed the folds of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him 
 
 no password no entrance she said loftily 
 
 harry i know it someone panted up behind him and he turned to see neville jogging towards him guess what it is actually going to be able to remember it for once he waved the stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train mimbuius mimbletonia 
 
 correct said the fat lady and her portrait swung open towards them like a door revealing a circular hole in the wall behind through which harry and neville now climbed 
 
 the gryffindor common room looked as welcoming as ever a cosy circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchairs and rickety old tables a fire was crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hands by it before going up to their dormitories on the other side of the room fred and george weasley were pinning something up on the noticeboard harry waved goodnight to them and headed straight for the door to the boys dormitories he was not in much of a mood for talking at the moment neville followed him 
 
 dean thomas and seamus finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the walls beside their beds with posters and photographs they had been talking as harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him harry wondered whether they had been talking about him then whether he was being paranoid 
 
 hi he said moving across to his own trunk and opening it 
 
 hey harry said dean who was putting on a pair of pyjamas in the west ham colours good holiday 
 
 not bad muttered harry as a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it you 
 
 yeah it was ok chuckled dean better than anyway he was just telling me 
 
 why what happened seamus neville asked as he placed his mimbuius mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet 
 
 seamus did not answer immediately he was making rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the kenmare kestrels quidditch team was quite straight then he said with his back still turned to harry me mam want me to come back 
 
 what said harry pausing in the act of pulling off his robes 
 
 she want me to come back to hogwarts 
 
 seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pyjamas out of his trunk still not looking at harry 
 
 butwhy said harry astonished he knew that mother was a witch and could not understand therefore why she should have come over so dursleyish 
 
 seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pyjamas 
 
 well he said in a measured voice i suppose because of you 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 his heart was beating rather fast he felt vaguely as though something was closing in on him 
 
 well said seamus again still avoiding eye she er well not just you dumbledore too 
 
 she believes the daily prophet said harry she thinks a liar and an old fool 
 
 seamus looked up at him 
 
 yeah something like that 
 
 harry said nothing he threw his wand down on to his bedside table pulled off his robes stuffed them angrily into his trunk and pulled on his pyjamas he was sick of it sick of being the person who is stared at and talked about all the time if any of them knew if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these things had happened to mrs finnigan had no idea the stupid woman he thought savagely 
 
 he got into bed and made to pull the hangings closed around him but before he could do so seamus said look what did happen that night when you know when with cedric diggory and all 
 
 seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time dean who had been bending over his trunk trying to retrieve a slipper went oddly still and harry knew he was listening hard 
 
 what are you asking me for harry retorted just read the daily prophet like your mother why you tell you all you need to know 
 
 you have a go at my mother seamus snapped 
 
 have a go at anyone who calls me a liar said harry 
 
 talk to me like that 
 
 talk to you how i want said harry his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table if got a problem sharing a dormitory with me go and ask mcgonagall if you can be moved stop your mummy worrying 
 
 leave my mother out of this potter 
 
 going on 
 
 ron had appeared in the doorway his wide eyes travelled from harry who was kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at seamus to seamus who was standing there with his fists raised 
 
 having a go at my mother seamus yelled 
 
 what said ron harry do thatwe met your mother we liked her 
 
 before she started believing every word the stinking daily prophet writes about me said harry at the top of his voice 
 
 oh said ron comprehension dawning across his freckled face oh right 
 
 you know what said seamus heatedly casting harry a venomous look right i want to share a dormitory with him any more mad 
 
 out of order seamus said ron whose ears were starting to glow redalways a danger sign 
 
 out of order am i shouted seamus who in contrast with ron was going pale you believe all the rubbish come out with about do you you reckon telling the truth 
 
 yeah i do said ron angrily 
 
 then mad too said seamus in disgust 
 
 yeah well unfortunately for you pal also a prefect said ron jabbing himself in the chest with a finger so unless you want detention watch your mouth 
 
 seamus looked for a few seconds as though detention would be a reasonable price to pay to say what was going through his mind but with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel vaulted into bed and pulled the hangings shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor ron glared at seamus then looked at dean and neville 
 
 anyone parents got a problem with harry he said aggressively 
 
 my parents are muggles mate said dean shrugging they know nothing about no deaths at hogwarts because not stupid enough to tell them 
 
 you know my mother weasel anything out of anyone seamus snapped at him anyway your parents get the daily know our been sacked from the wizengamot and the international confederation of wizards because losing his marbles 
 
 my gran says rubbish piped up neville she says the daily prophet going downhill not dumbledore cancelled our subscription we believe harry said neville simply he climbed into bed and pulled the covers up to his chin looking owlishly over them at seamus my grans always said would come back one day she says if dumbledore says back back 
 
 harry felt a rush of gratitude towards neville nobody else said anything seamus got out his wand repaired the bed hangings and vanished behind them dean got into bed rolled over and fell silent neville who appeared to have nothing more to say either was gazing fondly at his moonlit cactus 
 
 harry lay back on his pillows while ron bustled around the next bed putting his things away he fell shaken by the argument with seamus whom he had always liked very much how many more people were going to suggest that he was lying or unhinged 
 
 had dumbledore suffered like this all summer as first the wizengamot then the international confederation of wizards had thrown him from their ranks was it anger at harry perhaps that had stopped dumbledore getting in touch with him for months the two of them were in this together after all dumbledore had believed harry announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider wizarding community anyone who thought harry was a liar had to think that dumbledore was too or else that dumbledore had been hoodwinked 
 
 know right in the end thought harry miserably as ron got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory but he wondered how many more attacks like he would have to endure before that time came 
 
 rowling

 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter eleven helping handcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 as hermione had predicted the free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation ron had anticipated but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set not only were they studying as though they had exams every day but the lessons themselves had become more demanding than ever before harry barely understood half of what professor mcgonagall said to them these days even hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice incredibly and to increasing resentment best subject had suddenly become potions thanks to the prince 
 
 spells were now expected not only in defense against the dark arts but in charms and transfiguration too harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on but he knew that they were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud it was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in herbology but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the venomous tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind 
 
 one result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of practicing spells was that harry ron and hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit hagrid he had stopped coming to meals at the staff table an ominous sign and on the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out in the grounds he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings 
 
 got to go and explain said hermione looking up at huge empty chair at the staff table the following saturday at breakfast 
 
 got quidditch tryouts this morning said ron and supposed to be practicing that aguamenti charm from flitwick anyway explain what how are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject 
 
 we hate it said hermione 
 
 speak for yourself i forgotten the skrewts said ron darkly and telling you now had a narrow escape you hear him going on about his gormless brother have been teaching grawp how to tie his shoelaces if stayed 
 
 i hate not talking to hagrid said hermione looking upset 
 
 go down after quidditch harry assured her he too was missing hagrid although like ron he thought that they were better off without grawp in their lives but trials might take all morning the number of people who have applied he felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his captaincy i dunno why the this popular all of a sudden 
 
 oh come on harry said hermione suddenly impatient not quidditch popular you never been more interesting and frankly never been more fanciable 
 
 ron gagged on a large piece of kipper hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to harry 
 
 everyone knows been telling the truth now they the whole wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times and now calling you the chosen come on you see why people are fascinated by you 
 
 harry was finding the great hall very hot all of a sudden even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy 
 
 and been through all that persecution from the ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar you can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood but you stuck to your story anyway 
 
 you can still see where those brains got hold of me in the ministry look said ron shaking back his sleeves 
 
 and it hurt that grown about a foot over the summer either hermione finished ignoring ron 
 
 tall said ron inconsequentially 
 
 the post owls arrived swooping down through windows scattering everyone with droplets of water most people were receiving more post than usual anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to reassure them in turn that all was well at home harry had received no mail since the start of term his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had hoped that lupin might write occasionally he had so far been disappointed he was very surprised therefore to see the snowy white hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls she landed in front of him carrying a large square package a moment later an identical package landed in front of ron crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl pigwidgeon 
 
 ha said harry unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of advanced fresh from flourish and blotts 
 
 oh good said hermione delighted now you can give that graffitied copy back 
 
 are you mad said harry keeping it look thought it out 
 
 he pulled the old copy of advanced out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand muttering diffindo the cover fell off he did the same thing with the book hermione looked scandalized he then swapped the covers tapped each and said reparo 
 
 there sat the copy disguised as a new book and there sat the fresh copy from flourish and blotts looking thoroughly 
 
 give slughorn back the new one he complain it cost nine galleons 
 
 hermione pressed her lips together looking angry and disapproving but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that copy of the daily prophet she unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page 
 
 anyone we know dead asked ron in a determinedly casual voice he posed the same question every time hermione opened her paper 
 
 no but there have been more dementor attacks said hermione and an arrest 
 
 excellent who said harry thinking of bellatrix lestrange 
 
 stan shunpike said hermione 
 
 what said harry startled 
 
 stanley shunpike conductor on the popular wizarding conveyance the knight bus has been arrested on suspicion of death eater activity mr shunpike was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his clapham home 
 
 stan shunpike a death eater said harry remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before no way 
 
 he might have been put under the imperius curse said ron reasonably you never can tell 
 
 it look like it said hermione who was still reading it says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the death eaters secret plans in a pub she looked up with a troubled expression on her face if he was under the imperius curse hardly stand around gossiping about their plans would he 
 
 it sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did said ron he the one who claimed he was going to become minister of magic when he was trying to chat up those veela 
 
 yeah him said harry i dunno what playing at taking stan seriously 
 
 they probably want to look as though doing something said hermione frowning people are terrifiedyou know the patil twins parents want them to go home and eloise midgen has already been withdrawn her father picked her up last night 
 
 what said ron goggling at hermione but hogwarts is safer than their homes bound to be got aurors and all those extra protective spells and got dumbledore 
 
 i think got him all the time said hermione very quietly glancing toward the staff table over the top of the prophet you noticed his been empty as often as this past week 
 
 harry and ron looked up at the staff table the chair was indeed empty now harry came to think of it he had not seen dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago 
 
 i think left the school to do something with the order said hermione in a low voice i mean all looking serious it 
 
 harry and ron did not answer but harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing there had been a horrible incident the day before when hannah abbott had been taken out of herbology to be told her mother had been found dead they had not seen hannah since 
 
 when they left the gryffindor table five minutes later to head down to the quidditch pitch they passed lavender brown and parvati patil remembering what hermione had said about the patil twins parents wanting them to leave hogwarts harry was unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering together looking distressed what did surprise him was that when ron drew level with them parvati suddenly nudged lavender who looked around and gave ron a wide smile ron blinked at her then returned the smile uncertainly his walk instantly became something more like a strut harry resisted the temptation to laugh remembering that ron had refrained from doing so after malfoy had broken nose hermione however looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool misty drizzle and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing ron good luck 
 
 as harry had expected the trials took most of the morning half of gryffindor house seemed to have turned up from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms to seventh years who towered over the rest looking coolly intimidating the latter included a large boy harry recognized immediately from the hogwarts express 
 
 we met on the train in old compartment he said confidently stepping out of the crowd to shake hand cormac mclaggen keeper 
 
 you try out last year did you asked harry taking note of the breadth of mclaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoops without even moving 
 
 i was in the hospital wing when they held the trials said mclaggen with something of a swagger ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet 
 
 right said harry well if you wait over there 
 
 he pointed over to the edge of the pitch close to where hermione was sitting he thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over face and wondered whether mclaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both old favorites 
 
 harry decided to start with a basic test asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch this was a good decision the first ten was made up of first years and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts 
 
 the second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls harry had ever encountered who when he blew his whistle merely fell about giggling and clutching one another romilda vane was amongst them when he told them to leave the pitch they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else 
 
 the third group had a halfway around the pitch most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks the fifth group were hufflepuffs 
 
 if anyone else here not from gryffindor roared harry who was starting to get seriously annoyed leave now please 
 
 there was a pause then a couple of little ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch snorting with laughter 
 
 after two hours many complaints and several tantrums one involving a crashed comet two sixty and several broken teeth harry had found himself three chasers katie bell returned to the team after an excellent trial a new find called demelza robins who was particularly good at dodging bludgers and ginny weasley who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot pleased though he was with his choices harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected beaters 
 
 my final decision and if you get out of the way of the keepers hex you he bellowed 
 
 neither of his chosen beaters had the old brilliance of fred and george but he was still reasonably pleased with them jimmy peakes a short but boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of head with a ferociously hit bludger and ritchie coote who looked weedy but aimed well they now joined katie demelza and ginny in the stands to watch the selection of their last team member 
 
 harry had deliberately left the trial of the keepers until last hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned unfortunately however all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now so that it was larger than ever as each keeper flew up to the goal hoops the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure harry glanced over at ron who had always had a problem with nerves harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it but apparently not ron was a delicate shade of green 
 
 none of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece to great disappointment cormac mclaggen saved four penalties out of five on the last one however he shot off in completely the wrong direction the crowd laughed and booed and mclaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth 
 
 ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his cleansweep eleven 
 
 good luck cried a voice from the stands harry looked around expecting to see hermione but it was lavender brown he would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands as she did a moment later but thought that as the captain he ought to show slightly more grit and so turned to watch ron do his trial 
 
 yet he need not have worried ron saved one two three four five penalties in a row delighted and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty harry turned to mclaggen to tell him that most unfortunately ron had beaten him only to find red face inches from his own he stepped back hastily 
 
 his sister really try said mclaggen menacingly there was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one harry had often admired in uncle she gave him an easy save 
 
 rubbish said harry coldly that was the one he nearly missed 
 
 mclaggen took a step nearer harry who stood his ground this time 
 
 give me another go 
 
 no said harry had your go you saved four ron saved five keeper he won it fair and square get out of my way 
 
 he thought for a moment that mclaggen might punch him but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away growling what sounded like threats to thin air 
 
 harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him 
 
 well done he croaked you flew really well 
 
 you did brilliantly ron 
 
 this time it really was hermione running toward them from the stands harry saw lavender walking off the pitch arm in arm with parvati a rather grumpy expression on her face ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at hermione 
 
 after fixing the time of their first full practice for the following thursday harry ron and hermione bade goodbye to the rest of the team and headed off toward a watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last harry felt extremely hungry he hoped there would be something to eat at 
 
 i thought i was going to miss that fourth penalty ron was saying happily tricky shot from demelza did you see had a bit of spin on it 
 
 yes yes you were magnificent said hermione looking amused 
 
 i was better than that mclaggen anyway said ron in a highly satisfied voice did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth looked like been confunded 
 
 to surprise hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these words ron noticed nothing he was too busy describing each of his other penalties in loving detail 
 
 the great gray hippogriff buckbeak was tethered in front of cabin he clicked his beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them 
 
 oh dear said hermione nervously still a bit scary he 
 
 come off it ridden him you said ron harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking after a few seconds buckbeak sank into a bow too 
 
 how are you harry asked him in a low voice moving forward to stroke the feathery head missing him but okay here with hagrid you 
 
 oi said a loud voice 
 
 hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes his enormous boarhound fang was at his heels fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward 
 
 git away from him have yer fingersoh yeh lot 
 
 fang was jumping up at hermione and ron attempting to lick their ears hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second then turned and strode into his cabin slamming the door behind him 
 
 oh dear said hermione looking stricken 
 
 worry about it said harry grimly he walked over to the door and knocked loudly 
 
 hagrid open up we want to talk to you 
 
 there was no sound from within 
 
 if you open the door blast it open harry said pulling out his wand 
 
 harry said hermione sounding shocked you possibly 
 
 yeah i can said harry stand back 
 
 but before he could say anything else the door flew open again as harry had known it would and there stood hagrid glowering down at him and looking despite the flowery apron positively alarming 
 
 a teacher he roared at harry a teacher potter how dare yeh threaten ter break down my door 
 
 sorry sir said harry emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes 
 
 hagrid looked stunned since when have yeh called me sir 
 
 since when have you called me potter 
 
 oh very clever growled hagrid very amusin me outsmarted innit all righ come in then yeh ungrateful little 
 
 mumbling darkly he stood back to let them pass hermione scurried in after harry looking rather frightened 
 
 well said hagrid grumpily as harry ron and hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table fang laying his head immediately upon knee and drooling all over his robes this feelin sorry for me reckon lonely or summat 
 
 no said harry at once we wanted to see you 
 
 missed you said hermione tremulously 
 
 missed me have yeh snorted hagrid yeah righ 
 
 he stomped around brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle muttering all the while finally he slammed down three mugs of tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes harry was hungry enough even for cooking and took one at once 
 
 hagrid said hermione timidly when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong we really wanted to carry on with care of magical creatures you know hagrid gave another great snort harry rather thought some bogeys landed on the potatoes and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner 
 
 we did said hermione but none of us could fit it into our schedules 
 
 yeah righ said hagrid again 
 
 there was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around hermione let out a tiny shriek and ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed it was full of what looked like maggots slimy white and writhing 
 
 what are they hagrid asked harry trying to sound interested rather than revolted but putting down his rock cake all the same 
 
 jus giant grubs said hagrid 
 
 and they grow into said ron looking apprehensive 
 
 they won grow inter nuthin said hagrid i got em ter feed ter aragog 
 
 and without warning he burst into tears 
 
 hagrid cried hermione leaping up hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots and putting an arm around his shaking shoulders what is it 
 
 him gulped hagrid his eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron aragog i think dyin he got ill over the summer an not gettin better i don know what do if he if he bin tergether so long 
 
 hermione patted shoulder looking at a complete loss for anything to say harry knew how she felt he had known hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies the gigantic talking spider aragog who dwelled deep in the forbidden forest and which he and ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously 
 
 is thereis there anything we can do hermione asked ignoring frantic grimaces and 
 
 i don think there is hermione choked hagrid attempting to stem the flood of his tears see the rest o the tribe family gettin a bit funny now ill bit restive 
 
 yeah i think we saw a bit of that side of them said ron in an undertone 
 
 i don reckon be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo hagrid finished blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up but thanks fer offerin hermione it means a lot 
 
 after that the atmosphere lightened considerably for although neither harry nor ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous gargantuan spider hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more 
 
 ar i always knew find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables he said gruffly pouring them more tea even if yeh applied fer 
 
 we have done said hermione we smashed the entire stock of ministry when we were there last summer it was in the daily prophet 
 
 ar well then said hagrid no way yeh done it sorry binyeh jus bin worried about aragog an i did wonder whether if professor had bin teachin yeh 
 
 at which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that professor who had substituted for hagrid a few times was a dreadful teacher with the result that by the time hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk he looked quite cheerful 
 
 starving said harry once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted grounds he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth and got that detention with snape tonight i got much time for dinner 
 
 as they came into the castle they spotted cormac mclaggen entering the great hall it took him two attempts to get through the doors he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the hall after him but harry caught arm and held her back 
 
 what said hermione defensively 
 
 if you ask me said harry quietly mclaggen looks like he was confunded this morning and he was standing right in front of where you were sitting 
 
 hermione blushed 
 
 oh all right then i did it she whispered but you should have heard the way he was talking about ron and ginny anyway got a nasty temper you saw how he reacted when he get inyou have wanted someone like that on the team 
 
 
 no said harry no i suppose true but that dishonest hermione i mean a prefect you 
 
 oh be quiet she snapped as he smirked 
 
 what are you two doing demanded ron reappearing in the doorway to the great hall and looking suspicious 
 
 nothing said harry and hermione together and they hurried after ron the smell of roast beef made stomach ache with hunger but they had barely taken three steps toward the gryffindor table when professor slughorn appeared in front of them blocking their path 
 
 harry harry just the man i was hoping to see he boomed genially twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly i was hoping to catch you before dinner what do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead having a little party just a few rising stars got mclaggen coming and zabini the charming melinda bobbini know whether you know her her family owns a large chain of apothecariesand of course i hope very much that miss granger will favor me by coming too 
 
 slughorn made hermione a little bow as he finished speaking it was as though ron was not present slughorn did not so much as look at him 
 
 i come professor said harry at once got a detention with professor snape 
 
 oh dear said slughorn his face falling comically dear dear i was counting on you harry well now just have to have a word with severus and explain the situation sure be able to persuade him to postpone your detention yes see you both later 
 
 he bustled away out of the hall 
 
 got no chance of persuading snape said harry the moment slughorn was out of earshot this already been postponed once snape did it for dumbledore but he do it for anyone else 
 
 oh i wish you could come i want to go on my own said hermione anxiously harry knew that she was thinking about mclaggen 
 
 i doubt be alone probably be invited snapped ron who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by slughorn 
 
 after dinner they made their way back to gryffindor tower the common room was very crowded as most people had finished dinner by now but they managed to find a free table and sat down ron who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with slughorn folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling hermione reached out for a copy of the evening prophet which somebody had left abandoned on a chair 
 
 anything new said harry 
 
 not really hermione had opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages oh look your in here all right she added quickly for ron had looked around in alarm it just says been to visit the malfoys house this second search of the death eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results arthur weasley of the office for the detection and confiscation of counterfeit defensive spells and protective objects said that his team had been acting upon a confidential 
 
 yeah mine said harry i told him at kings cross about malfoy and that thing he was trying to get borgin to fix well if not at their house he must have brought whatever it is to hogwarts with him 
 
 but how can he have done harry said hermione putting down the newspaper with a surprised look we were all searched when we arrived we 
 
 were you said harry taken aback i 
 
 oh no of course you i forgot you were late well filch ran over all of us with secrecy sensors when we got into the entrance hall any dark object would have been found i know for a fact crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated so you see malfoy have brought in anything dangerous 
 
 momentarily stymied harry watched ginny weasley playing with arnold the pygmy puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection 
 
 sent it to him by owl then he said his mother or someone 
 
 all the owls are being checked too said hermione filch told us so when he was jabbing those secrecy sensors everywhere he could reach 
 
 really stumped this time harry found nothing else to say there did not seem to be any way malfoy could have brought a dangerous or dark object into the school he looked hopefully at ron who was sitting with his arms folded staring over at lavender brown 
 
 can you think of any way malfoy 
 
 oh drop it harry said ron 
 
 listen not my fault slughorn invited hermione and me to his stupid party neither of us wanted to go you know said harry firing up 
 
 well as not invited to any parties said ron getting to his feet again i think go to bed 
 
 he stomped off toward the door to the boys dormitories leaving harry and hermione staring after him 
 
 harry said the new chaser demelza robins appearing suddenly at his shoulder got a message for you 
 
 from professor slughorn asked harry sitting up hopefully 
 
 no from professor snape said demelza heart sank he says to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detentionerno matter how many party invitations received and he wanted you to know be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones to use in potions andand he says no need to bring protective gloves 
 
 right said harry grimly thanks a lot demelza 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter eleven the bribecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 if kreacher could escape a lake full of inferi harry was confident that the capture of mundungus would take a few hours at most and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation however kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon by nightfall harry felt discouraged and anxious and a supper composed largely of moldy bread upon which hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful transfigurations did nothing to help 
 
 kreacher did not return the following day nor the day after that however two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside number twelve and they remained there into the night gazing in the direction of the house that they could not see 
 
 death eaters for sure said ron as he harry and hermione watched from the drawing room windows reckon they know were in here 
 
 i dont think so said hermione though she looked frightened or theyd have sent snape in after us wouldnt they 
 
 dyou reckon hes been in here and has his tongue tied by moodys curse asked ron 
 
 yes said hermione otherwise hed have been able to tell that lot how to get in wouldnt he but theyre probably watching to see whether we turn up they know that harry owns the house after all 
 
 how do they c began harry 
 
 wizarding wills are examined by the ministry remember theyll know sirius left you the place 
 
 the presence of the death eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve they had not heard a word form anyone beyond grimmauld place since mr weasleys patronus and the strain was starting to tell restless and irritable ron had developed an annoying habit of playing with the deluminator in his pocket this particularly infuriated hermione who was whiling away the wait for kreacher by studying the tales of beedle the bard and did not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off 
 
 will you stop it she cried on the third evening of kreachers absence as all the light was sucked from the drawing room yet again 
 
 sorry sorry said ron clicking the deluminator and restoring the lights i dont know im doing it 
 
 well cant you find something useful to occupy yourself 
 
 what like reading kids stories 
 
 dumbledore left me this book ron c 
 
 c and he left me the deluminator maybe im supposed to use it 
 
 unable to stand the bickering harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them he headed downstairs toward the kitchen which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where kreacher was most likely to reappear halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall however he heard a tap on the front door then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain 
 
 every nerve in his body seemed to tauten he pulled out his wand moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads and waited the door opened he saw a glimpse of the lamplit square outside and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it the intruder took a step forward and moodys voice asked severus snape then the dust figure rose from the end of the hall and rushed him raising its dead hand 
 
 it was not i who killed you albus said a quiet voice 
 
 the jinx broke the exploded again and it was impossible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind 
 
 harry pointed the wand into the middle of it 
 
 dont move 
 
 he had forgotten the portrait of mrs black at the sound of his yell the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house c 
 
 ron and hermione came crashing down the stairs behind harry wands pointing like his at the unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below 
 
 hold your fire its me remus 
 
 oh thank goodness said hermione weakly pointing her wand at mrs black instead with a bang the curtains swished shut again and silence fell ron too lowered his wand but harry did not 
 
 show yourself he called back 
 
 lupin moved forward into the lamplight hands still held high in a gesture of surrender 
 
 i am remus john lupin werewolf sometimes known as moony one of the four creators of the marauders map married to nymphadora usually known as tonks and i taught you how to produce a patronus harry which takes the form of a stag 
 
 oh all right said harry lowering his wand but i had to check didnt i 
 
 speaking as your against the dark arts teacher i quite agree that you had to check ron hermione you shouldnt be so quick to lower your defenses 
 
 they ran down the stairs towards him wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak he looked exhausted but pleased to see them 
 
 no sign of severus then he asked 
 
 no said harry whats going on is everyone okay 
 
 yes said lupin but were all being watched there are a couple of death eaters in the square outside c 
 
 we know c 
 
 i had to apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me they cant know youre in here or im sure theyd have more people out there theyre staking out everywhere thats got any connection with you harry lets go downstairs theres a lot to tell you and i want to know what happened after you left the burrow 
 
 they descended into the kitchen where hermione pointed her wand at the grate a fire sprang up instantly it gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden table lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down 
 
 id have been here three days ago but i needed to shake off the death eater tailing me said lupin so you came straight here after the wedding 
 
 no said harry only after we ran into a couple of death eaters in a caf on tottenham court road 
 
 lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front 
 
 what 
 
 they explained what had happened when they had finished lupin looked aghast 
 
 but how did they find you so quickly its impossible to track anyone who apparates unless you grab hold of them as they disappear 
 
 and it doesnt seem likely they were just strolling down tottenham court road at the time does it said harry 
 
 we wondered said hermione tentatively whether harry could still have the trace on him 
 
 impossible said lupin ron looked smug and harry felt hugely relieved apart from anything else theyd know for sure harry was here if he still had the trace on him wouldnt they but i cant see how they could have tracked you to tottenham court road thats worrying really worrying 
 
 he looked disturbed but as far as harry was concerned that question could wait 
 
 tell us what happened after we left we havent heard a thing since rons dad told us the family was safe 
 
 well kingsley saved us said lupin thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were able to disapparate before they arrived 
 
 were they death eaters or ministry people interjected hermione 
 
 a mixture but to all intents and purposes theyre the same thing now said lupin there were about a dozen of them but they didnt know you were there harry arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of scrimgeour before they killed him if its true he didnt give you away 
 
 harry looked at ron and hermione their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude he felt he had never liked scrimgeour much but if what lupin said was true the mans final act had been to try to protect harry 
 
 the death eaters searched the burrow from top to bottom lupin went on they found the ghoul but didnt want to get too close c and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours they were trying to get information on you harry but of course nobody apart from the order knew that you had been there 
 
 at the same time that they were smashing up the wedding more death eaters were forcing their way into every house in the country no deaths he added quickly forestalling the question but they were rough they burned down dedalus diggles house but as you know he wasnt there and they used the cruciarus curse on tonkss family again trying to find out where you went after you visited them theyre all right c shaken obviously but otherwise okay 
 
 the death eaters got through all those protective charms 
 
 harry asked remembering how effective these had been on the night he had crashed in tonkss parents garden 
 
 what youve got to realize harry is that the death eaters have got the full might of the ministry on their side now said lupin theyve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of identification or arrest they managed to penetrate every defensive spell wed cast against them and once inside they were completely open about why theyd come 
 
 and are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing harrys whereabouts out of people asked hermione an edge to her voice 
 
 well lupin said he hesitated then pulled out a folded copy of the daily prophet 
 
 here he said pushing it across the table to harry youll know sooner or later anyway thats their pretext for going after you 
 
 harry smoothed out the paper a huge photograph of his own face filled the front page he read the headline over it 
 
 
 
 
 wanted for questioning about the death of albus dumbledore 
 ron and hermione gave roars of outrage but harry said nothing he pushed the newspaper away he did not want to read anymore he knew what it would say nobody but those who had been on top of the tower when dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and as rita skeeter had already told the wizarding world harry had been seen running from the place moments after dumbledore had fallen 
 
 im sorry harry lupin said 
 
 so death eaters have taken over the daily prophet too asked hermione furiously 
 
 lupin nodded 
 
 but surely people realize whats going on 
 
 the coup has been smooth and virtually silent said lupin 
 
 the official version of scrimgeours murder is that he resigned he has been replaced by pius thicknesse who is under the imperius curse 
 
 why didnt voldemort declare himself minister of magic asked ron 
 
 lupin laughed 
 
 he doesnt need to ron effectively he is the minister but why should he sit behind a desk at the ministry his puppet thicknesse is taking care of everyday business leaving voldemort free to extend his power beyond the ministry 
 
 naturally many people have deduced what has happened there has been such a dramatic change in ministry policy in the last few days and many are whispering that voldemort must be behind it however that is the point they whisper they darent confide in each other not knowing whom to trust they are scared to speak out in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted yes voldemort is playing a very clever game declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion remaining masked has created confusion uncertainty and fear 
 
 and this dramatic change in ministry policy said harry involves warning the wizarding world against me instead of voldemort 
 
 thats certainly a part of it said lupin and it is a masterstroke now that dumbledore is dead you c the boy who lived c were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to voldemort but by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hats death voldemort has not only set a price upon your head but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended you 
 
 meanwhile the ministry has started moving against 
 
 lupin pointed at the daily prophet 
 
 look at page two 
 
 hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had when handling secrets of the darkest art 
 
 register she read aloud the ministry of magic is undertaking a survey of the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets 
 
 recent research undertaken by the department of mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when wizards reproduce where no proven wizarding ancestry exists therefore the is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force 
 
 the ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power and to this end has issued an invitation to every to present themselves for interview by the newly appointed registration commission 
 
 people wont let this happen said ron 
 
 it is happening ron said lupin are being rounded up as we speak 
 
 but how are they supposed to have stolen magic said ron its mental if you could steal magic there wouldnt be any squibs would there 
 
 i know said lupin nevertheless unless you can prove that you have at least one close wizarding relative you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment 
 
 ron glanced at hermione then said what if purebloods and halfbloods swear a part of their family ill tell everyone hermiones my cousin c 
 
 hermione covered rons hand with hers and squeezed it 
 
 thank you ron but i couldnt let you c 
 
 you wont have a choice said ron fiercely gripping her hand back ill teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it 
 
 hermione gave a shaky laugh 
 
 ron as were on the run with harry potter the most wanted person in the country i dont think it matters if i was going back to school it would be different whats voldemort planning for hogwarts she asked lupin 
 
 attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard he replied that was announced yesterday its a change because it was never obligatory before of course nearly every witch and wizard in britain has been educated at hogwarts but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred this way voldemort will have the whole wizarding population under his eye from a young age and its also another way of weeding out because students must be given blood status c meaning that they have proven to the ministry that they are of wizard descent c before they are allowed to attend 
 
 harry felt sickened and angry at this moment excited would be poring over stacks of newly purchased unaware that they would never see hogwarts perhaps never see their families again either 
 
 its its he muttered struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts but lupin said quietly i know 
 
 lupin hesitated 
 
 ill understand if you cant confirm this harry but the order is under the impression that dumbledore left you a mission 
 
 he did harry replied and ron and hermione are in on it and theyre coming with me 
 
 can you confide in me what the mission is 
 
 harry looked into the prematurely lined face framed in thick but graying hair and wished that he could return a different answer 
 
 i cant remus im sorry if dumbledore didnt tell you i dont think i can 
 
 i thought youd say that said lupin looking disappointed but i might still be of some use to you you know what i am and what i can do i could come with you to provide protection there would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to 
 
 harry hesitated it was a very tempting offer though how they would be able to keep their mission secret from lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine 
 
 hermione however looked puzzled 
 
 but what about tonks she asked 
 
 what about her said lupin 
 
 well said hermione frowning youre married how does she feel about you going away with us 
 
 tonks will be perfectly safe said lupin shell be at her parents house 
 
 there was something strange in lupins tone it was almost cold there was also something odd in the idea of tonks remaining hidden at her parents house she was after all a member of the order and as far as harry knew was likely to want to be in the thick of the action 
 
 remus said hermione tentatively is everything all right you know between you and c 
 
 everything is fine thank you said lupin pointedly 
 
 hermione turned pink there was another pause an awkward and embarrassed one and then lupin said with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant tonks is going to have a baby 
 
 oh how wonderful squealed hermione 
 
 excellent said ron enthusiastically 
 
 congratulations said harry 
 
 lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace then said so do you accept my offer will three become four i cannot believe that dumbledore would have disapproved he appointed me your defense against the dark arts teacher after all and i must tell you that i believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined 
 
 ron and hermione both looked at harry 
 
 just c just to be clear he said you want to leave tonks at her parents house and come away with us 
 
 shell be perfectly safe there theyll look after her said lupin he spoke with a finality bordering on indifference harry im sure james would have wanted me to stick with you 
 
 well said harry slowly im not im pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you arent sticking with your own kid actually 
 
 lupins face drained of color the temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it while hermiones eyes swiveled backward and forward from harry to lupin 
 
 you dont understand said lupin at last 
 
 explain then said harry 
 
 lupin swallowed 
 
 i c i made a grave mistake in marrying tonks i did it against my better judgment and have regretted it very much every since 
 
 i see said harry so youre just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us 
 
 lupin sprang to his feet his chair toppled over backward and he glared at them so fiercely that harry saw for the first time ever she shadow of the wolf upon his human face 
 
 dont you understand what ive done to my wife and my unborn child i should never have married her ive made her an outcast 
 
 lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned 
 
 you have only ever seen me amongst the order or under dumbledores protection at hogwarts you dont know how most of the wizarding world sees creatures like me when they know of my affliction they can barely talk to me dont you see what ive done 
 
 even her own family is disgusted by our marriage what parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf and the child c the child c 
 
 lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair he looked quite deranged 
 
 my kind dont usually breed it will be like me i am convinced of it c how can i forgive myself when i knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child and if by some miracle it is not like me then it will be better off a hundred times so without a father of whom it must always be ashamed 
 
 remus whispered hermione tears in her eyes dont say that c how could any child be ashamed of you 
 
 oh i dont know hermione said harry id be pretty ashamed of him 
 
 harry did not know where his rage was coming from but it had propelled him to his feet too lupin looked as though harry had hit him 
 
 if the new regime thinks are bad harry said what will they do to a whose fathers in the order my father died trying to protect my mother and me and you reckon hed tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us 
 
 how c how dare you said lupin this is not about a desire for c for danger or personal glory c how dare you suggest such a c 
 
 i think youre feeling a bit of a daredevil harry said you fancy stepping into siriuss shoes c 
 
 harry no hermione begged him but he continued to glare into lupins livid face 
 
 id never have believed this harry said the man who taught me to fight dementors c a coward 
 
 lupin drew his wand so fast that harry had barely reached for his own there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward as if punched as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the floor he glimpsed the tail of lupins cloak disappearing around the door 
 
 remus remus come back hermione cried but lupin did not respond a moment later they heard the front door slam 
 
 harry wailed hermione how could you 
 
 it was easy said harry he stood up he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the wall he was still so full of anger he was shaking 
 
 dont look at me like that he snapped at hermione 
 
 dont you start on her snarled ron 
 
 no c no c we mustnt fight said hermione launching herself between them 
 
 you shouldnt have said that stuff to lupin ron told harry 
 
 he had it coming to him said harry broken images were racing each other through his mind sirius falling through the veil dumbledore suspended broken in midair a flash of green light and his mothers voice begging for mercy 
 
 parents said harry shouldnt leave their kids unless c unless theyve got to 
 
 harry c said hermione stretching out a consoling hand but he shrugged it off and walked away his eyes on the fire hermione had conjured he had once spoken to lupin out of that fireplace seeking reassurance about james and lupin had consoled him now lupins tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before him he felt a sickening surge of remorse neither ron nor hermione spoke but harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back communicating silently 
 
 he turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other 
 
 i know i shouldnt have called him a coward 
 
 no you shouldnt said ron at once 
 
 but hes acting like one 
 
 all the same said hermione 
 
 i know said harry but if it makes him go back to tonks itll be worth it wont it 
 
 he could not keep the plea out of his voice hermione looked sympathetic ron uncertain harry looked down at his feet thinking of his father would james have backed harry in what he had said to lupin or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend 
 
 the silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with ron and hermiones unspoken reproaches the daily prophet lupin had brought was still lying on the table harrys own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page he walked over to it and sat down opened the paper at random and pretended to read he could not take in the words his mind was still too full of the encounter with lupin he was sure that ron and hermione had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the prophet he turned a page loudly and dumbledores name leapt out at him it was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the photograph which showed a family group beneath the photograph were the words the dumbledore family left to right albus percival holding newborn ariana kendra and aberforth 
 
 his attention caught harry examined the picture more carefully dumbledores father percival was a man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph the baby ariana was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no more the mother kendra had jet black hair pulled into a high bun her face had a carved quality about it harry thought of photos of native americans hed seen as he studied her dark eyes high cheekbones and straight nose formally composed above a silk gown albus and aberforth wore matching lacy collared jackets and had identical hairstyles albus looked several years older but otherwise the two boys looked very alike for this was before albuss nose had been broken and before he started wearing glasses 
 
 the family looked quite happy and normal smiling serenely up out of the newspaper baby arianas arm waved vaguely out of her shawl harry looked above the picture and saw the headline 
 
 
 
 
 exclusive extract from upcoming 
 biography of albus dumbledore 
 by rita skeeter 
 
 
 
 thinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did harry began to read 
 
 
 
 
 proud and haughty kendra dumbledore could not bear to remain in after her husband percivals arrest and imprisonment in azkaban she therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to godrics hollow the village that was later to gain fame as the scene of harry potters strange escape from 
 
 like godrics hollow was home to a number of wizarding families but as kendra knew none of them she would be spared the curiosity about her husbands crime she had faced in her former village by repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new wizarding neighbors she soon ensured that her family was left well alone 
 
 slammed the door in my face when i went around to welcome her with a batch of homemade cauldron cakes says bathilda bagshot the first year they were there i only ever saw the two boys wouldnt have known there was a daughter if i hadnt been picking plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in and saw kendra leading ariana out into the back garden walked her round the lawn once keeping a firm grip on her then took her back inside didnt know what to make of it 
 
 it seems that kendra thought the move to godrics hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide ariana once and for all something she had probably been planning for years the timing was significant ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight and seven is the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself if present nobody now alive remembers ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability it seems clear therefore that kendra made a decision to hide her daughters existence rather than suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a squib moving away from the friends and neighbors who knew ariana would of course make imprisoning her all the easier the tiny number of people who henceforth knew of arianas existence could be counted upon to keep the secret including her two brothers who had deflected awkward questions with the answer their mother had taught them my sister is too frail for school 
 
 
 
 
 next week albus dumbledore at hogwarts c the prizes and the pretense 
 harry had been wrong what he had read had indeed made him feel worse he looked back at the photograph of the apparently happy family was it true how could he find out he wanted to go to godrics hollow even if bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him he wanted to visit the place where he and dumbledore had both lost loved ones he was in the process of lowering the newspaper to ask rons and hermiones opinions when a deafening crack echoed around the kitchen 
 for the first time in three days harry had forgotten all about kreacher his immediate thought was that lupin had burst back into the room and for a split second he did not take in the mass of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair he hurried to his feet as kreacher disentangled himself and bowing low to harry croaked kreacher has returned with the thief mundungus fletcher master 
 
 mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand hermione however was too quick for him 
 
 expelliarmus 
 
 mundunguss wand soared into the air and hermione caught it mundungus dived for the stairs ron him and mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch 
 
 what he bellowed writhing in his attempts to free himself from rons grip whave i done setting a bleedin on me what are you playing at whave i done lemme go lemme go of c 
 
 youre not in much of a position to make threats said harry he threw aside the newspaper crossed the kitchen in a few strides and dropped to his knees beside mundungus who stopped struggling and looked terrified ron got up panting and watched as harry pointed his wand deliberately at mundunguss nose mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke his hair was matted and his robes stained 
 
 kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief master croaked the elf fletcher knows how to avoid capture has many and accomplices nevertheless kreacher cornered the thief in the end 
 
 youve done really well kreacher said harry and the elf bowed low 
 
 right weve got a few questions for you harry told mundungus who shouted at once 
 
 i panicked okay i never wanted to come along no offense mate but i never volunteered to die for you an that was bleedin come flying at me anyone woulda got outta there i said all along i didnt wanna do it c 
 
 for your information none of the rest of us disapparated said hermione 
 
 well youre a bunch of bleedin eroes then arent you but i never pretended i was up for killing meself c 
 
 were not interested in why you ran out on said harry moving his wand a little closer to mundunguss baggy bloodshot eyes we already knew you were an unreliable bit of scum 
 
 well then why the ell am i being unted down by or is this about them goblets again i aint got none of em left or you could ave em c 
 
 its not about the goblets either although youre getting warmer said harry shut up and listen 
 
 it felt wonderful to have something to do someone of whom he could demand some small portion of truth harrys wand was now so close to the bridge of mundunguss nose that mundungus had gone trying to keep it in view 
 
 when you cleaned out this house of anything valuable harry began but mundungus interrupted him again 
 
 sirius never cared about any of the junk c 
 
 there was the sound of pattering fee a blaze of shining copper an echoing clang and a shriek of agony kreacher had taken a run at mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan 
 
 call im off call im off e should be locked up screamed mundungus cowering as kreacher raised the pan again 
 
 kreacher no shouted harry 
 
 kreachers thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan still held aloft 
 
 perhaps just one more master harry for luck 
 
 ron laughed 
 
 we need him conscious kreacher but if he needs persuading you can do the honors said harry 
 
 thank you very much master said kreacher with a bow and he retreated a short distance his great pale eyes still fixed upon mundungus with loathing 
 
 when you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find harry began again you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard there was a locket there harrys mouth was suddenly dry he could sense ron and hermiones tension and excitement too what did you do with it 
 
 why asked mundungus is it valuable 
 
 youve still got it cried hermione 
 
 no he hasnt said ron shrewdly hes wondering whether he should have asked more money for it 
 
 more said mundungus that wouldnt have been effing difficultbleedin gave it away din i no choice 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 i was selling in diagon alley and she come up to me and asks if ive got a license for trading in magical artifacts bleedin snoop she was gonna fine me but she took a fancy to the locket an told me shed take it and let me off that time and to fink meself lucky 
 
 who was this woman asked harry 
 
 i dunno some ministry hag 
 
 mundungus considered for a moment brow wrinkled 
 
 little woman bow on top of er head 
 
 he frowned and then added looked like a toad 
 
 harry dropped his wand it hit mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows which ignited 
 
 aquamenti screamed hermione and a jet of water streamed from her wand engulfing a spluttering and choking mundungus 
 
 harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in rons and hermiones faces the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 delaying is not forgetting 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there was an old mansion surrounded by a marshy ditch with a 
 drawbridge which was but seldom let down not all guests are good 
 people under the roof were loopholes to shoot through and to pour 
 down boiling water or even molten lead on the enemy should he 
 approach inside the house the rooms were very high and had ceilings 
 of beams and that was very useful considering the great deal of smoke which rose up from the chimney fire where the large damp logs of wood smouldered on the walls hung pictures of knights in armour and proud ladies in gorgeous dresses the most stately of all walked about alive she was called meta mogen she was the mistress of the house to her belonged the castle 
 
 towards the evening robbers came they killed three of her 
 people and also the and attached mrs meta to the kennel 
 by the chain while they themselves made good cheer in the hall and 
 drank the wine and the good ale out of her cellar mrs meta was now 
 on the chain she could not even bark 
 
 but lo the servant of one of the robbers secretly approached her 
 they must not see it otherwise they would have killed him 
 mrs meta mogen said the fellow do you still remember how 
 my father when your husband was still alive had to ride on the 
 wooden horse you prayed for him but it was no good he was to ride until his limbs were paralysed but you stole down to him as i 
 steal now to you you yourself put little stones under each of his 
 feet that he might have support nobody saw it or they pretended 
 not to see it for you were then the young gracious mistress my 
 father has told me this and i have not forgotten it now i will 
 free you mrs meta mogen 
 
 then they pulled the horses out of the stable and rode off in rain 
 and wind to obtain the assistance of friends 
 
 thus the small service done to the old man was richly rewarded said meta mogen 
 
 delaying is not forgetting said the fellow 
 the robbers were hanged 
 there was an old mansion it is still there it did not belong 
 to mrs meta mogen it belonged to another old noble family 
 we are now in the present time the sun is shining on the gilt 
 knob of the tower little wooded islands lie like bouquets on the 
 water and wild swans are swimming round them in the garden grow 
 roses the mistress of the house is herself the finest rose petal she 
 beams with joy the joy of good deeds however not done in the wide 
 world but in her heart and what is preserved there is not forgotten 
 delaying is not forgetting 
 
 now she goes from the mansion to a little peasant hut in the 
 field therein lives a poor paralysed girl the window of her little 
 room looks northward the sun does not enter here the girl can only 
 see a small piece of field which is surrounded by a high fence but 
 the sun shines here the warm beautiful sun of god is within 
 the little room it comes from the south through the new window where formerly the wall was 
 
 the paralysed girl sits in the warm sunshine and can see the 
 wood and the lake the world had become so large so beautiful and 
 only through a single word from the kind mistress of the mansion 
 the word was so easy the deed so small she said the joy it 
 afforded me was infinitely great and sweet 
 and therefore she does many a good deed thinks of all in the 
 humble cottages and in the rich mansions where there are also 
 afflicted ones it is concealed and hidden but god does not forget 
 it delayed is not forgotten 
 an old house stood there it was in the large town with its busy 
 traffic there are rooms and halls in it but we do not enter them we 
 remain in the kitchen where it is warm and light clean and tidy the 
 copper utensils are shining the table as if polished with beeswax 
 the sink looks like a freshly scoured meatboard all this a single 
 servant has done and yet she has time to spare as if she wished to go 
 to church she wears a bow on her cap a black bow that signifies 
 mourning but she has no one to mourn neither father nor mother 
 neither relations nor sweetheart she is a poor girl one day she 
 was engaged to a poor fellow they loved each other dearly 
 one day he came to her and said 
 
 we both have nothing the rich widow over the way in the basement 
 has made advances to me she will make me rich but you are in my 
 heart what do you advise me to do 
 
 i advise you to do what you think will turn out to your 
 happiness said the girl be kind and good to her but remember 
 this from the hour we part we shall never see each other again 
 years passed then one day she met the old friend and sweetheart 
 in the street he looked ill and miserable and she could not help 
 asking him how are you 
 
 rich and prospering in every respect he said the woman is 
 brave and good but you are in my heart i have fought the battle 
 it will soon be ended we shall not see each other again now until 
 we meet before god 
 
 a week has passed this morning his death was in the newspaper 
 that is the reason of the mourning her old sweetheart is 
 dead and has left a wife and three as the paper says 
 it sounds as if there is a crack but the metal is pure 
 the black bow signifies mourning the face points to the 
 same in a still higher degree it is preserved in the heart and will 
 never be forgotten delaying is not forgetting 
 these are three stories you see three leaves on the same stalk 
 do you wish for some more trefoil leaves in the little heartbook 
 are many more of them delaying is not forgetting

 book a black hunt a mute pack 
 chapter x 
 
 which explains how javert got on the scent 
 the events of which we have just beheld the reverse side so to speak had come about in the simplest possible manner 
 when jean valjean on the evening of the very day when javert had arrested him beside had escaped from the town jail of m sur m the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to paris 
 paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost and everything disappears in this belly of the world as in the belly of the sea 
 no forest hides a man as does that crowd fugitives of every sort know this 
 they go to paris as to an abyss there are gulfs which save 
 the police know it also and it is in paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere they sought the of m sur m javert was summoned to paris to throw light on their researches 
 javert had in fact rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of jean valjean zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by m chabouillet secretary of the prefecture under comte angles m chabouillet who had moreover already been patron had the inspector of m sur m attached to the police force of paris there javert rendered himself useful in divers and though the word may seem strange for such services honorable manners 
 he no longer thought of jean wolf of causes these dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of in december he read a newspaper he who never read newspapers but javert a monarchical man had a desire to know the particulars of the triumphal entry of the prince generalissimo into bayonne just as he was finishing the article which interested him a name the name of jean valjean attracted his attention at the bottom of a page 
 the paper announced that the convict jean valjean was dead and published the fact in such formal terms that javert did not doubt it 
 he confined himself to the remark a good entry then he threw aside the paper and thought no more about it 
 some time afterwards it chanced that a police report was transmitted from the prefecture of the to the prefecture of police in paris concerning the abduction of a child which had taken place under peculiar circumstances as it was said in the commune of montfermeil 
 a little girl of seven or eight years of age the report said who had been intrusted by her mother to an of that neighborhood had been stolen by a stranger this child answered to the name of cosette and was the daughter of a girl named fantine who had died in the hospital it was not known where or when 
 this report came under eye and set him to thinking 
 the name of fantine was well known to him 
 he remembered that jean valjean had made him javert burst into laughter by asking him for a respite of three days for the purpose of going to fetch that child 
 he recalled the fact that jean valjean had been arrested in paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for montfermeil 
 some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach and that he had already on the previous day made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village for he had not been seen in the village itself what had he been intending to do in that region of montfermeil it could not even be surmised 
 javert understood it now daughter was there 
 jean valjean was going there in search of her 
 and now this child had been stolen by a stranger who could that stranger be 
 could it be jean valjean 
 but jean valjean was dead 
 javert without saying anything to anybody took the coach from the pewter platter de la planchette and made a trip to montfermeil 
 he expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there he found a great deal of obscurity 
 for the first few days the thenardiers had chattered in their rage the disappearance of the lark had created a sensation in the village he immediately obtained numerous versions of the story which ended in the abduction of a child 
 hence the police report 
 but their first vexation having passed off thenardier with his wonderful instinct had very quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the prosecutor of the crown and that his complaints with regard to the abduction of cosette would have as their first result to fix upon himself and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand the glittering eye of justice 
 the last thing that owls desire is to have a candle brought to them 
 and in the first place how explain the fifteen hundred francs which he had received he turned squarely round put a gag on his mouth and feigned astonishment when the stolen child was mentioned to him he understood nothing about it no doubt he had grumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature taken from him so hastily he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer out of tenderness but her grandfather had come for her in the most natural way in the world 
 he added the grandfather which produced a good effect 
 this was the story that javert hit upon when he arrived at montfermeil 
 the grandfather caused jean valjean to vanish 
 nevertheless javert dropped a few questions like plummets into history 
 who was that grandfather and what was his name 
 thenardier replied with simplicity 
 he is a wealthy farmer i saw his passport 
 i think his name was m guillaume lambert 
 lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name thereupon javert returned to paris 
 jean valjean is certainly dead said he and i am a ninny 
 he had again begun to forget this history when in the course of march he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of and who had been surnamed the mendicant who gives alms 
 this person the story ran was a man of means whose name no one knew exactly and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years who knew nothing about herself save that she had come from montfermeil 
 montfermeil that name was always coming up and it made javert prick up his ears 
 an old beggar police spy an to whom this person had given alms added a few more details 
 this gentleman of property was very shy never coming out except in the evening speaking to no one except occasionally to the poor and never allowing any one to approach him he wore a horrible old yellow which was worth many millions being all wadded with this piqued curiosity in a decided manner 
 in order to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarming him he borrowed the outfit for a day and the place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching every evening whining orisons through his nose and playing the spy under cover of prayer 
 the suspected individual did indeed approach javert thus disguised and bestow alms on him 
 at that moment javert raised his head and the shock which jean valjean received on recognizing javert was equal to the one received by javert when he thought he recognized jean valjean 
 however the darkness might have misled him jean death was official javert cherished very grave doubts and when in doubt javert the man of scruples never laid a finger on any collar 
 he followed his man to the gorbeau house and got the old woman to talking which was no difficult matter 
 the old woman confirmed the fact regarding the coat lined with millions and narrated to him the episode of the bill 
 she had seen it she had handled it 
 javert hired a room that evening he installed himself in it 
 he came and listened at the mysterious door hoping to catch the sound of his voice but jean valjean saw his candle through the and foiled the spy by keeping silent 
 on the following day jean valjean decamped but the noise made by the fall of the piece was noticed by the old woman who hearing the rattling of coin suspected that he might be intending to leave and made haste to warn javert 
 at night when jean valjean came out javert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men 
 javert had demanded assistance at the prefecture but he had not mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize that was his secret and he had kept it for three reasons in the first place because the slightest indiscretion might put jean valjean on the alert next because to lay hands on an who had made his escape and was reputed dead on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed forever as among malefactors of the most dangerous sort was a magnificent success which the old members of the parisian police would assuredly not leave to a like javert and he was afraid of being deprived of his convict and lastly because javert being an artist had a taste for the unforeseen 
 he hated those successes which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom brushed off he preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and to unveil them suddenly at the last 
 javert had followed jean valjean from tree to tree then from corner to corner of the street and had not lost sight of him for a single instant even at the moments when jean valjean believed himself to be the most secure eye had been on him why had not javert arrested jean valjean 
 because he was still in doubt 
 it must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely at its ease the free press embarrassed it several arbitrary arrests denounced by the newspapers had echoed even as far as the chambers and had rendered the prefecture timid 
 interference with individual liberty was a grave matter 
 the police agents were afraid of making a mistake the prefect laid the blame on them a mistake meant dismissal the reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph reproduced by twenty newspapers would have caused in paris yesterday an aged grandfather with white hair a respectable and gentleman who was walking with his grandchild aged eight was arrested and conducted to the agency of the prefecture as an escaped convict 
 let us repeat in addition that javert had scruples of his own injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the prefect 
 he was really in doubt 
 jean valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark 
 sadness uneasiness anxiety depression this fresh misfortune of being forced to flee by night to seek a chance refuge in paris for cosette and himself the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the this without his being aware of it had altered jean walk and impressed on his bearing such senility that the police themselves incarnate in the person of javert might and did in fact make a mistake 
 the impossibility of approaching too close his costume of an emigre preceptor the declaration of thenardier which made a grandfather of him and finally the belief in his death in prison added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in mind 
 for an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers but if the man was not jean valjean and if this man was not a good honest old fellow living on his income he was probably some merry blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of parisian misdeeds some chief of a dangerous band who gave alms to conceal his other talents which was an old dodge he had trusty fellows accomplices retreats in case of emergencies in which he would no doubt take refuge 
 all these turns which he was making through the streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man 
 to arrest him too hastily would be to kill the hen that laid the golden eggs 
 where was the inconvenience in waiting 
 javert was very sure that he would not escape 
 thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind putting to himself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage 
 it was only quite late in the rue de pontoise that thanks to the brilliant light thrown from a he decidedly recognized jean valjean 
 there are in this world two beings who give a profound start the mother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey javert gave that profound start 
 as soon as he had positively recognized jean valjean the formidable convict he perceived that there were only three of them and he asked for reinforcements at the police station of the rue de pontoise one puts on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel 
 this delay and the halt at the carrefour rollin to consult with his agents came near causing him to lose the trail he speedily divined however that jean valjean would want to put the river between his pursuers and himself 
 he bent his head and reflected like a who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right scent 
 javert with his powerful rectitude of instinct went straight to the bridge of austerlitz a word with the furnished him with the information which he required 
 have you seen a man with a little girl i made him pay two sous replied the javert reached the bridge in season to see jean valjean traverse the small illuminated spot on the other side of the water leading cosette by the hand he saw him enter the rue du he remembered the genrot arranged there like a trap and of the sole exit of the rue into the rue he made sure of his back burrows as huntsmen say he hastily despatched one of his agents by a roundabout way to guard that issue a patrol which was returning to the arsenal post having passed him he made a requisition on it and caused it to accompany him in such games soldiers are aces 
 moreover the principle is that in order to get the best of a wild boar one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs 
 these combinations having been effected feeling that jean valjean was caught between the blind alley genrot on the right his agent on the left and himself javert in the rear he took a pinch of snuff 
 then he began the game 
 he experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment he allowed his man to go on ahead knowing that he had him safe but desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible happy at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free gloating over him with his gaze with that voluptuousness of the spider which allows the fly to flutter and of the cat which lets the mouse run 
 claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality the obscure movements of the creature imprisoned in their pincers what a delight this strangling is 
 javert was enjoying himself 
 the meshes of his net were stoutly knotted he was sure of success all he had to do now was to close his hand 
 accompanied as he was the very idea of resistance was impossible however vigorous energetic and desperate jean valjean might be 
 javert advanced slowly sounding searching on his way all the nooks of the street like so many pockets of thieves 
 when he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there 
 his exasperation can be imagined 
 he interrogated his sentinel of the rues and that agent who had remained imperturbably at his post had not seen the man pass 
 it sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns that is to say he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels and then the oldest huntsmen know not what to say duvivier ligniville and desprez halt short 
 in a discomfiture of this sort artonge exclaims it was not a stag but a sorcerer javert would have liked to utter the same cry 
 his disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage 
 it is certain that napoleon made mistakes during the war with russia that alexander committed blunders in the war in india that caesar made mistakes in the war in africa that cyrus was at fault in the war in scythia and that javert blundered in this campaign against jean valjean 
 he was wrong perhaps in hesitating in his recognition of the exconvict 
 the first glance should have sufficed him he was wrong in not arresting him purely and simply in the old building he was wrong in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the rue de pontoise 
 he was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the carrefour rollin advice is certainly useful it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs who deserve confidence but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict 
 javert by taking too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart and so made him run above all he was wrong in that after he had picked up the scent again on the bridge of austerlitz he played that formidable and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread he thought himself stronger than he was and believed that he could play at the game of the mouse and the lion 
 at the same time he reckoned himself as too weak when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement 
 fatal precaution waste of precious time javert committed all these blunders and none the less was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that ever existed 
 he was in the full force of the term what is called in venery a knowing dog but what is there that is perfect 
 great strategists have their eclipses 
 the greatest follies are often composed like the largest ropes of a multitude of strands 
 take the cable thread by thread take all the petty determining motives separately and you can break them one after the other and you say that is all there is of it braid them twist them together the result is enormous 
 it is attila hesitating between marcian on the east and valentinian on the west it is hannibal tarrying at capua it is danton falling asleep at 
 however that may be even at the moment when he saw that jean valjean had escaped him javert did not lose his head sure that the convict who had broken his ban could not be far off he established sentinels he organized traps and ambuscades and beat the quarter all that night 
 the first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope had been cut a precious sign which however led him astray since it caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the genrot in this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted on gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land jean valjean evidently must have fled in that direction 
 the fact is that had he penetrated a little further in the genrot he would probably have done so and have been lost 
 javert explored these gardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for a needle 
 at daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook and returned to the prefecture of police as much ashamed as a police spy who had been captured by a robber might have been

 chapter xiv 
 
 on the of december new eve an old grandee of day was giving a ball and midnight supper the diplomatic corps and the emperor himself were to be present 
 the mansion on the english quay glittered with innumerable lights police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance which was carpeted with red baize and not only gendarmes but dozens of police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving with footmen and footmen in plumed hats from the carriages emerged men wearing uniforms stars and ribbons while ladies in satin and ermine cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them with a clatter and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize at the entrance 
 almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the crowd and caps were doffed 
 the emperor no a minister prince ambassador you see the plumes was whispered among the crowd 
 one person better dressed than the rest seemed to know everyone and mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day 
 a third of the visitors had already arrived but the rostovs who were to be present were still hurrying to get dressed 
 there had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the rostov family many fears that the invitation would not arrive that the dresses would not be ready or that something would not be arranged as it should be 
 marya ignatevna peronskaya a thin and shallow maid of honor at the court of the dowager empress who was a friend and relation of the countess and piloted the provincial rostovs in petersburg high society was to accompany them to the ball 
 they were to call for her at her house in the taurida gardens at ten but it was already five minutes to ten and the girls were not yet dressed 
 natasha was going to her first grand ball she had got up at eight that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day all her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they all she herself mamma and sonya should be as well dressed as possible sonya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands the countess was to wear a velvet dress and the two girls white gauze over pink silk slips with roses on their bodices and their hair dressed a la grecque 
 everything essential had already been done feet hands necks and ears washed perfumed and powdered as befits a ball the openwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on the hairdressing was almost done sonya was finishing dressing and so was the countess but natasha who had bustled about helping them all was behindhand she was still sitting before a with a dressing jacket thrown over her slender shoulders sonya stood ready dressed in the middle of the room and pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her dainty finger was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went through it 
 not the way not the way sonya cried natasha turning her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the maid who was dressing it had not time to release that bow is not right come here 
 sonya sat down and natasha pinned the ribbon on differently 
 allow me miss i do it like that said the maid who was holding hair 
 oh dear well then wait right sonya 
 you ready it is nearly ten came the countess voice 
 directly directly and you mamma 
 i have only my cap to pin on 
 do it without me called natasha you do it right 
 but already ten 
 they had decided to be at the ball by half past ten and natasha had still to get dressed and they had to call at the taurida gardens 
 when her hair was done natasha in her short petticoat from under which her dancing shoes showed and in her dressing jacket ran up to sonya scrutinized her and then ran to her mother turning her head this way and that she fastened on the cap and hurriedly kissing her gray hair ran back to the maids who were turning up the hem of her skirt 
 the cause of the delay was skirt which was too long two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of thread a third with pins in her mouth was running about between the countess and sonya and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment up high on one uplifted hand 
 mavra quicker darling 
 give me my thimble miss from there 
 whenever will you be ready asked the count coming to the door here is here is some scent peronskaya must be tired of waiting 
 ready miss said the maid holding up the shortened gauze dress with two fingers and blowing and shaking something off it as if by this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what she held 
 natasha began putting on the dress 
 in a minute in a minute come in papa she cried to her father as he opened the door speaking from under the filmy skirt which still covered her whole face 
 sonya slammed the door to a minute later they let the count in he was wearing a blue coat shoes and stockings and was perfumed and his hair pomaded 
 oh papa how nice you look charming cried natasha as she stood in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze 
 if you please miss allow me said the maid who on her knees was pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her mouth to the other with her tongue 
 say what you like exclaimed sonya in a despairing voice as she looked at natasha say what you like still too long 
 natasha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass the dress was too long 
 really madam it is not at all too long said mavra crawling on her knees after her young lady 
 well if too long take it up tack it up in one minute said the resolute dunyasha taking a needle that was stuck on the front of her little shawl and still kneeling on the floor set to work once more 
 at that moment with soft steps the countess came in shyly in her cap and velvet gown 
 my beauty exclaimed the count she looks better than any of you 
 he would have embraced her but blushing she stepped aside fearing to be rumpled 
 mamma your cap more to this side said natasha arrange it and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn off 
 oh goodness what has happened really it was not my fault 
 never mind run it up it show said dunyasha 
 what a beauty a very queen said the nurse as she came to the door and sonya they are lovely 
 at a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started but they had still to call at the taurida gardens 
 peronskaya was quite ready in spite of her age and plainness she had gone through the same process as the rostovs but with less flurry for to her it was a matter of routine her ugly old body was washed perfumed and powdered in just the same way she had washed behind her ears just as carefully and when she entered her drawing room in her yellow dress wearing her badge as maid of honor her old maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the rostovs servants had been 
 she praised the rostovs toilets they praised her taste and toilet and at eleven careful of their coiffures and dresses they settled themselves in their carriages and drove off

 number rue 
 nothing half a century ago more resembled every other carriage gate than the carriage gate of number rue this entrance which usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion permitted a view of two things neither of which have anything very funereal about courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines and the face of a lounging porter 
 above the wall at the bottom of the court tall trees were visible 
 when a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard when a glass of wine cheered up the porter it was difficult to pass number little picpus street without carrying away a smiling impression of it 
 nevertheless it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse 
 the threshold smiled the house prayed and wept 
 if one succeeded in passing the porter which was not easy which was even nearly impossible for every one for there was an open sesame which it was necessary to the porter once passed one entered a little vestibule on the right on which opened a staircase shut in between two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it at a time if one did not allow self to be alarmed by a daubing of canary yellow with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase if one ventured to ascend it one crossed a first landing then a second and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash and the plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows the corridor took a turn and became dark 
 if one doubled this cape one arrived a few paces further on in front of a door which was all the more mysterious because it was not fastened 
 if one opened it one found self in a little chamber about six feet square tiled clean cold and hung with nankin paper with green flowers at fifteen sous the roll 
 a white dull light fell from a large window with tiny panes on the left which usurped the whole width of the room 
 one gazed about but saw no one one listened one heard neither a footstep nor a human murmur the walls were bare the chamber was not furnished there was not even a chair 
 one looked again and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular hole about a foot square with a grating of interlacing iron bars black knotted solid which formed squares i had almost said less than an inch and a half in diagonal length 
 the little green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square hole this grating would have prevented it 
 it did not allow the passage of the body but it did allow the passage of the eyes that is to say of the mind this seems to have occurred to them for it had been by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear and pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of a strainer 
 at the bottom of this plate an aperture had been pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box 
 a bit of tape attached to a hung at the right of the grated opening 
 if the tape was pulled a bell rang and one heard a voice very near at hand which made one start 
 who is there the voice demanded 
 it was a voice a gentle voice so gentle that it was mournful 
 here again there was a magical word which it was necessary to know if one did not know it the voice ceased the wall became silent once more as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the other side of it 
 if one knew the password the voice resumed enter on the right 
 one then perceived on the right facing the window a glass door surmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray 
 on raising the latch and crossing the threshold one experienced precisely the same impression as when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire before the grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted one was in fact in a sort of narrow furnished with two old chairs and a straw matting sparely illuminated by the vague light from the glass door a regular box with its front just of a height to lean upon bearing a tablet of black wood this box was grated only the grating of it was not of gilded wood as at the opera it was a monstrous lattice of iron bars hideously interlaced and riveted to the wall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists 
 the first minutes passed when eyes began to grow used to this one tried to pass the grating but got no further than six inches beyond it 
 there he encountered a barrier of black shutters and fortified with transverse beams of wood painted a gingerbread yellow 
 these shutters were divided into long narrow slats and they masked the entire length of the grating they were always closed 
 at the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice proceeding from behind these shutters and saying 
 i am here 
 what do you wish with me 
 it was a beloved sometimes an adored voice 
 no one was visible hardly the sound of a breath was audible 
 it seemed as though it were a spirit which had been evoked that was speaking to you across the walls of the tomb 
 if one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you the evoked spirit became an apparition 
 behind the grating behind the shutter one perceived so far as the grating permitted sight a head of which only the mouth and the chin were visible the rest was covered with a black veil 
 one caught a glimpse of a black guimpe and a form that was barely defined covered with a black shroud that head spoke with you but did not look at you and never smiled at you 
 the light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that you saw her in the white and she saw you in the black this light was symbolical 
 nevertheless your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was made in that place shut off from all glances 
 a profound vagueness enveloped that form clad in mourning 
 your eyes searched that vagueness and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition at the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could see nothing 
 what you beheld was night emptiness shadows a wintry mist mingled with a vapor from the tomb a sort of terrible peace a silence from which you could gather nothing not even sighs a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing not even phantoms 
 what you beheld was the interior of a cloister 
 it was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called the convent of the bernardines of the perpetual adoration the box in which you stood was the parlor 
 the first voice which had addressed you was that of the portress who always sat motionless and silent on the other side of the wall near the square opening screened by the iron grating and the plate with its thousand holes as by a double visor 
 the obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the parlor which had a window on the side of the world had none on the side of the convent 
 profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place 
 nevertheless there was something beyond that shadow there was a light there was life in the midst of that death 
 although this was the most strictly walled of all convents we shall endeavor to make our way into it and to take the reader in and to say without transgressing the proper bounds things which have never seen and have therefore never described

 natasha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once had time to think of what lay before her 
 in the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage she for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at the ball in those brightly lighted rooms with music flowers dances the emperor and all the brilliant young people of petersburg the prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the carriage she understood all that awaited her only when after stepping over the red baize at the entrance she entered the hall took off her fur cloak and beside sonya and in front of her mother mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers only then did she remember how she must behave at a ball and tried to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion but fortunately for her she felt her eyes growing misty she saw nothing clearly her pulse beat a hundred to the minute and the blood throbbed at her heart she could not assume that pose which would have made her ridiculous and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all her might to conceal it and this was the very attitude that became her best before and behind them other visitors were entering also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses the mirrors on the landing reflected ladies in white and pink dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms 
 natasha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection from the others all was blended into one brilliant procession on entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices footsteps and greetings deafened natasha and the light and glitter dazzled her still more the host and hostess who had already been standing at the door for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals charme de vous voir greeted the rostovs and peronskaya in the same manner 
 delighted to see you 
 the two girls in their white dresses each with a rose in her black hair both curtsied in the same way but the hostess eye involuntarily rested longer on the slim natasha she looked at her and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess looking at her she may have recalled the golden irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball the host also followed natasha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter 
 charming said he kissing the tips of his fingers 
 in the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the emperor the countess took up a position in one of the front rows of that crowd natasha heard and felt that several people were asking about her and looking at her she realized that those noticing her liked her and this observation helped to calm her 
 there are some like ourselves and some worse she thought 
 peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people at the ball 
 that is the dutch ambassador do you see that man she said indicating an old man with a profusion of curly hair who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said 
 ah here she is the queen of petersburg countess bezukhova said peronskaya indicating helene who had just entered how lovely she is quite equal to marya antonovna see how the men young and old pay court to her beautiful and clever they say prince is quite mad about her but see those two though not are even more run after 
 she pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain daughter 
 she is a splendid match a millionairess said peronskaya and look here come her suitors 
 that is brother anatole kuragin she said indicating a handsome officer of the horse guards who passed by them with head erect looking at something over the heads of the ladies handsome he i hear they will marry him to that rich girl but your cousin drubetskoy is also very attentive to her they say she has millions oh yes the french ambassador himself she replied to the countess inquiry about caulaincourt looks as if he were a king all the same the french are charming very charming no one more charming in society ah here she is yes she is still the most beautiful of them all our marya antonovna and how simply she is dressed lovely and that stout one in spectacles is the universal freemason she went on indicating pierre put him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon 
 pierre swaying his stout body advanced making way through the crowd and nodding to right and left as casually and as if he were passing through a crowd at a fair he pushed through evidently looking for someone 
 natasha looked joyfully at the familiar face of pierre the buffoon as peronskaya had called him and knew he was looking for them and for her in particular he had promised to be at the ball and introduce partners to her 
 but before he reached them pierre stopped beside a very handsome dark man of middle height and in a white uniform who stood by a window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon natasha at once recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform it was bolkonski who seemed to her to have grown much younger happier and 
 someone else we know bolkonski do you see mamma said natasha pointing out prince andrew you remember he stayed a night with us at otradnoe 
 oh you know him said peronskaya i bear him il fait a present la pluie et le beau temps too proud for anything takes after his father and hand in glove with speranski writing some project or other just look how he treats the ladies one talking to him and he has turned away she said pointing at him give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies 
 he is all the rage just now

 the obedience of martin verga 
 this convent which in had already existed for many a long year in the rue was a community of bernardines of the obedience of martin verga 
 these bernardines were attached in consequence not to clairvaux like the bernardine monks but to citeaux like the benedictine monks in other words they were the subjects not of saint bernard but of saint benoit 
 any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that martin verga founded in a congregation of with salamanca for the head of the order and alcala as the branch establishment 
 this congregation had sent out branches throughout all the catholic countries of europe 
 there is nothing unusual in the latin church in these grafts of one order on another 
 to mention only a single order of which is here in question 
 there are attached to this order without counting the obedience of martin verga four congregations two in italy and of padua two in france cluny and and nine granmont the celestins the camaldules the carthusians the humilies the olivateurs the silvestrins and lastly citeaux for citeaux itself a trunk for other orders is only an offshoot of citeaux dates from saint robert abbe de molesme in the diocese of langres in 
 now it was in that the devil having retired to the desert of was he turned hermit was chased from the ancient temple of apollo where he dwelt by then aged seventeen 
 after the rule of the carmelites who go barefoot wear a bit of willow on their throats and never sit down the harshest rule is that of the of martin verga they are clothed in black with a guimpe which in accordance with the express command of mounts to the chin a robe of serge with large sleeves a large woollen veil the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on the breast the band which descends over their brow to their is their dress all is black except the band which is white 
 the novices wear the same habit but all in white 
 the professed nuns also wear a rosary at their side 
 the of martin verga practise the perpetual adoration like the benedictines called ladies of the holy sacrament who at the beginning of this century had two houses in paris one at the temple the other in the rue however the of the of whom we are speaking were a totally different order from the ladies of the holy sacrament cloistered in the rue and at the temple there were numerous differences in their rule there were some in their costume 
 the of the wore the black guimpe and the benedictines of the holy sacrament and of the rue wore a white one and had besides on their breasts a holy sacrament about three inches long in silver gilt or gilded copper 
 the nuns of the did not wear this holy sacrament 
 the perpetual adoration which was common to the house of the and to the house of the temple leaves those two orders perfectly distinct 
 their only resemblance lies in this practice of the ladies of the holy sacrament and the bernardines of martin verga just as there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of all the mysteries relating to the infancy the life and death of jesus christ and the virgin between the two orders which were nevertheless widely separated and on occasion even hostile 
 the oratory of italy established at florence by philip de neri and the oratory of france established by pierre de berulle 
 the oratory of france claimed the precedence since philip de neri was only a saint while berulle was a cardinal 
 let us return to the harsh spanish rule of martin verga 
 the of this obedience fast all the year round abstain from meat fast in lent and on many other days which are peculiar to them rise from their first sleep from one to three in the morning to read their breviary and chant matins sleep in all seasons between serge sheets and on straw make no use of the bath never light a fire scourge themselves every friday observe the rule of silence speak to each other only during the recreation hours which are very brief and wear drugget chemises for six months in the year from september th which is the exaltation of the holy cross until easter these six months are a modification 
 the rule says all the year but this drugget chemise intolerable in the heat of summer produced fevers and nervous spasms 
 the use of it had to be restricted even with this palliation when the nuns put on this chemise on the th of september they suffer from fever for three or four days obedience poverty chastity perseverance in their seclusion these are their vows which the rule greatly aggravates 
 the prioress is elected for three years by the mothers who are called meres vocales because they have a voice in the chapter a prioress can only be twice which fixes the longest possible reign of a prioress at nine years 
 they never see the officiating priest who is always hidden from them by a serge curtain nine feet in height 
 during the sermon when the preacher is in the chapel they drop their veils over their faces they must always speak low walk with their eyes on the ground and their heads bowed 
 one man only is allowed to enter the convent the archbishop of the diocese 
 there is really one gardener 
 but he is always an old man and in order that he may always be alone in the garden and that the nuns may be warned to avoid him a bell is attached to his knee 
 their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive it is the canonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation as at the voice of christ ut voci christi at a gesture at the first sign ad nutum ad primum signum immediately with cheerfulness with perseverance with a certain blind obedience prompte hilariter perseveranter et caeca quadam obedientia as the file in the hand of the workman quasi limam in manibus fabri without power to read or to write without express permission legere vel scribere non addiscerit sine expressa superioris licentia 
 each one of them in turn makes what they call reparation the reparation is the prayer for all the sins for all the faults for all the dissensions for all the violations for all the iniquities for all the crimes committed on earth 
 for the space of twelve consecutive hours from four in the afternoon till four in the morning or from four in the morning until four in the afternoon the sister who is making reparation remains on her knees on the stone before the holy sacrament with hands clasped a rope around her neck 
 when her fatigue becomes unendurable she prostrates herself flat on her face against the earth with her arms outstretched in the form of a cross this is her only relief in this attitude she prays for all the guilty in the universe this is great to sublimity 
 as this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle it is called without distinction to make reparation or to be at the post 
 the nuns even prefer out of humility this last expression which contains an idea of torture and abasement 
 to make reparation is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed the sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall directly behind her 
 besides this there is always a sister kneeling before the holy sacrament 
 this station lasts an hour 
 they relieve each other like soldiers on guard 
 this is the perpetual adoration 
 the prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped with peculiar solemnity recalling not the saints and martyrs but moments in the life of jesus christ 
 as mother nativity mother conception mother presentation mother passion 
 but the names of saints are not interdicted 
 when one sees them one never sees anything but their mouths 
 all their teeth are yellow 
 no ever entered that convent brushing teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the loss of soul 
 they never say my 
 they possess nothing of their own and they must not attach themselves to anything 
 they call everything our thus 
 our veil our chaplet if they were speaking of their chemise they would say our chemise 
 sometimes they grow attached to some petty object to a book of hours a relic a medal that has been blessed 
 as soon as they become aware that they are growing attached to this object they must give it up 
 they recall the words of saint therese to whom a great lady said as she was on the point of entering her order permit me mother to send for a bible to which i am greatly attached 
 ah you are attached to something in that case do not enter our order 
 every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up to have a place of her own a chamber 
 they live with their cells open when they meet one says blessed and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar 
 the other responds forever 
 the same ceremony when one taps at the door 
 hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on the other side is heard to say hastily forever 
 like all practices this becomes mechanical by force of habit and one sometimes says forever before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar 
 among the visitandines the one who enters says 
 ave maria and the one whose cell is entered says gratia plena 
 it is their way of saying good day which is in fact full of grace 
 at each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the church bell of the convent 
 at this signal prioress vocal mothers professed nuns novices postulants interrupt what they are saying what they are doing or what they are thinking and all say in unison if it is five for instance at five and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar 
 if it is eight at eight and at all hours and so on according to the hour 
 this custom the object of which is to break the thread of thought and to lead it back constantly to god exists in many communities the formula alone varies 
 thus at the infant jesus they say at this hour and at every hour may the love of jesus kindle my heart the of martin verga cloistered fifty years ago at chant the offices to a solemn psalmody a pure gregorian chant and always with full voice during the whole course of the office 
 everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause and say in a low voice for the office of the dead they adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a depth 
 the effect produced is striking and tragic 
 the nuns of the had made a vault under their grand altar for the burial of their community 
 the government as they say does not permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when they die 
 this is an affliction to them and causes them consternation as an infraction of the rules 
 they had obtained a mediocre consolation at to be interred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient vaugirard cemetery which was made of land which had formerly belonged to their community 
 on fridays the nuns hear high mass vespers and all the offices as on sunday 
 they scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals unknown to people of the world of which the church of france was so prodigal in the olden days and of which it is still prodigal in spain and italy 
 their stations in the chapel are interminable as for the number and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of them than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them the prayers of the postulants are frightful the prayers of the novices are still worse and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse 
 once a week the chapter assembles 
 the prioress presides the vocal mothers assist 
 each sister kneels in turn on the stones and confesses aloud in the presence of all the faults and sins which she has committed during the week 
 the vocal mothers consult after each confession and inflict the penance aloud 
 besides this confession in a loud tone for which all faults in the least serious are reserved they have for their venial offences what they call the coulpe 
 to make coulpe means to prostrate self flat on face during the office in front of the prioress until the latter who is never called anything but our mother notifies the culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall that she can rise the coulpe or peccavi is made for a very small broken glass a torn veil an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an office a false note in church etc this suffices and the coulpe is made the coulpe is entirely spontaneous it is the culpable person herself the word is etymologically in its place here who judges herself and inflicts it on herself 
 on festival days and sundays four mother precentors intone the offices before a large with four places 
 one day one of the mother precentors intoned a psalm beginning with ecce and instead of ecce she uttered aloud the three notes do si sol for this piece of she underwent a coulpe which lasted during the whole service what rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed 
 when a nun is summoned to the parlor even were it the prioress herself she drops her veil as will be remembered so that only her mouth is visible 
 the prioress alone can hold communication with strangers the others can see only their immediate family and that very rarely if by chance an outsider presents herself to see a nun or one whom she has known and loved in the outer world a regular series of negotiations is required 
 if it is a woman the authorization may sometimes be granted the nun comes and they talk to her through the shutters which are opened only for a mother or sister it is unnecessary to say that permission is always refused to men 
 such is the rule of aggravated by martin verga 
 these nuns are not gay rosy and fresh as the daughters of other orders often are 
 they are pale and grave 
 between and three of them went mad

 suddenly everybody stirred began talking and pressed forward and then back and between the two rows which separated the emperor entered to the sounds of music that had immediately struck up behind him walked his host and hostess he walked in rapidly bowing to right and left as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over the band played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that had been set to it beginning alexander elisaveta all our hearts you ravish quite the emperor passed on to the drawing room the crowd made a rush for the doors and several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again then the crowd hastily retired from the door at which the emperor reappeared talking to the hostess a young man looking distraught pounced down on the ladies asking them to move aside some ladies with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets the men began to choose partners and take their places for the polonaise 
 everyone moved back and the emperor came smiling out of the drawing room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music the host followed with marya antonovna naryshkina then came ambassadors ministers and various generals whom peronskaya diligently named more than half the ladies already had partners and were taking up or preparing to take up their positions for the polonaise natasha felt that she would be left with her mother and sonya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall not having been invited to dance she stood with her slender arms hanging down her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly and with bated breath and glittering frightened eyes gazed straight before her evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery she was not concerned about the emperor or any of those great people whom peronskaya was pointing out she had but one thought is it possible no one will ask me that i shall not be among the first to dance is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me they do not even seem to see me or if they do they look as if they were saying ah not the one after so not worth looking at her no impossible she thought they must know how i long to dance how splendidly i dance and how they would enjoy dancing with me 
 the strains of the polonaise which had continued for a considerable time had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to ears she wanted to cry peronskaya had left them the count was at the other end of the room she and the countess and sonya were standing by themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone prince andrew with a lady passed by evidently not recognizing them the handsome anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at natasha as one looks at a wall boris passed them twice and each time turned away berg and his wife who were not dancing came up to them 
 this family gathering seemed humiliating to natasha as if there were nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball she did not listen to or look at vera who was telling her something about her own green dress 
 at last the emperor stopped beside his last partner he had danced with three and the music ceased a worried ran up to the rostovs requesting them to stand farther back though as it was they were already close to the wall and from the gallery resounded the distinct precise enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz the emperor looked smilingly down the room a minute passed but no one had yet begun dancing an the master of ceremonies went up to countess bezukhova and asked her to dance she smilingly raised her hand and laid it on his shoulder without looking at him the an adept in his art grasping his partner firmly round her waist with confident deliberation started smoothly gliding first round the edge of the circle then at the corner of the room he caught left hand and turned her the only sound audible apart from the music being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid agile feet while at every third beat his velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round natasha gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn of the waltz 
 prince andrew in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel wearing stockings and dancing shoes stood looking animated and bright in the front row of the circle not far from the rostovs baron firhoff was talking to him about the first sitting of the council of state to be held next day prince andrew as one closely connected with speranski and participating in the work of the legislative commission could give reliable information about that sitting concerning which various rumors were current but not listening to what firhoff was saying he was gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle 
 prince andrew was watching these men abashed by the presence and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance 
 pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm 
 you always dance i have a protegee the young rostova here ask her he said 
 where is she asked bolkonski excuse me he added turning to the baron we will finish this conversation elsewhere at a ball one must dance he stepped forward in the direction pierre indicated the despairing dejected expression of face caught his eye he recognized her guessed her feelings saw that it was her debut remembered her conversation at the window and with an expression of pleasure on his face approached countess rostova 
 allow me to introduce you to my daughter said the countess with heightened color 
 i have the pleasure of being already acquainted if the countess remembers me said prince andrew with a low and courteous bow quite belying remarks about his rudeness and approaching natasha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his invitation he asked her to waltz that tremulous expression on face prepared either for despair or rapture suddenly brightened into a happy grateful childlike smile 
 i have long been waiting for you that frightened happy little girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears as she raised her hand to prince shoulder they were the second couple to enter the circle prince andrew was one of the best dancers of his day and natasha danced exquisitely her little feet in their white satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly lightly and independently of herself while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness her slender bare arms and neck were not beautiful compared to her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped but helene seemed as it were hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned her person while natasha was like a girl exposed for the first time who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary 
 prince andrew liked dancing and wishing to escape as quickly as possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed to him wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked caused by the presence he danced and had chosen natasha because pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first pretty girl who caught his eye but scarcely had he embraced that slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers

 after prince andrew boris came up to ask natasha for dance and then the who had opened the ball and several other young men so that flushed and happy and passing on her superfluous partners to sonya she did not cease dancing all the evening she noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else not only did she fail to notice that the emperor talked a long time with the french ambassador and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady or that prince and did and said this and that and that helene had great success and was honored was by the special attention of but she did not even see the emperor and only noticed that he had gone because the ball became livelier after his departure for one of the merry cotillions before supper prince andrew was again her partner he reminded her of their first encounter in the otradnoe avenue and how she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night and told her how he had involuntarily overheard her natasha blushed at that recollection and tried to excuse herself as if there had been something to be ashamed of in what prince andrew had overheard 
 like all men who have grown up in society prince andrew liked meeting someone there not of the conventional society stamp and such was natasha with her surprise her delight her shyness and even her mistakes in speaking french with her he behaved with special care and tenderness sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most unimportant matters he admired her shy grace in the middle of the cotillion having completed one of the figures natasha still out of breath was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her she was tired and panting and evidently thought of declining but immediately put her hand gaily on the shoulder smiling at prince andrew 
 be glad to sit beside you and rest tired but you see how they keep asking me and glad of it happy and i love everybody and you and i understand it all and much much more was said in her smile when her partner left her natasha ran across the room to choose two ladies for the figure 
 if she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady she will be my wife said prince andrew to himself quite to his own surprise as he watched her she did go first to her cousin 
 what rubbish sometimes enters head thought prince andrew but what is certain is that that girl is so charming so original that she be dancing here a month before she will be married such as she are rare here he thought as natasha readjusting a rose that was slipping on her bodice settled herself beside him 
 when the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to the dancers he invited prince andrew to come and see them and asked his daughter whether she was enjoying herself natasha did not answer at once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully how can you ask such a question 
 i have never enjoyed myself so much before she said and prince andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her father and instantly dropped again natasha was happier than she had ever been in her life she was at that height of bliss when one becomes completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of evil unhappiness or sorrow 
 at that ball pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position his wife occupied in court circles he was gloomy and a deep furrow ran across his forehead and standing by a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one 
 on her way to supper natasha passed him 
 gloomy unhappy look struck her she stopped in front of him she wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance of her own happiness 
 how delightful it is count said she it 
 pierre smiled evidently not grasping what she said 
 yes i am very glad he said 
 how can people be dissatisfied with anything thought natasha especially such a capital fellow as bezukhov in eyes all the people at the ball alike were good kind and splendid people loving one another none of them capable of injuring another and so they ought all to be happy

 gayeties 
 none the less these young girls filled this grave house with charming souvenirs 
 at certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister 
 the recreation hour struck 
 a door swung on its hinges 
 the birds said good here come the children 
 an irruption of youth inundated that garden intersected with a cross like a shroud 
 radiant faces white foreheads innocent eyes full of merry light all sorts of auroras were scattered about amid these shadows 
 after the psalmodies the bells the peals and knells and offices the sound of these little girls burst forth on a sudden more sweetly than the noise of bees the hive of joy was opened and each one brought her honey they played they called to each other they formed into groups they ran about pretty little white teeth chattered in the corners 
 the veils superintended the laughs from a distance shades kept watch of the sunbeams but what mattered it 
 still they beamed and laughed those four lugubrious walls had their moment of dazzling brilliancy they looked on vaguely blanched with the reflection of so much joy at this sweet swarming of the hives 
 it was like a shower of roses falling athwart this house of mourning 
 the young girls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns the gaze of impeccability does not embarrass innocence 
 thanks to these children there was among so many austere hours one hour of ingenuousness 
 the little ones skipped about the elder ones danced 
 in this cloister play was mingled with heaven 
 nothing is so delightful and so august as all these fresh expanding young souls 
 homer would have come thither to laugh with perrault and there was in that black garden youth health noise cries giddiness pleasure happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles of all their ancestresses those of the epic as well as those of the those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottage from hecuba to la 
 in that house more than anywhere else perhaps arise those sayings which are so graceful and which evoke a smile that is full of thoughtfulness 
 it was between those four gloomy walls that a child of five years exclaimed one day mother one of the big girls has just told me that i have only nine years and ten months longer to remain here 
 what happiness 
 it was here too that this memorable dialogue took place 
 a vocal mother 
 why are you weeping my child 
 the child aged six i told alix that i knew my french history she says that i do not know it but i do 
 alix the big girl aged nine no she does not know it 
 the mother 
 how is that my child 
 alix 
 she told me to open the book at random and to ask her any question in the book and she would answer it 
 well 
 she did not answer it 
 let us see about it 
 what did you ask her 
 i opened the book at random as she proposed and i put the first question that i came across 
 and what was the question 
 it was what happened after that 
 it was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather greedy paroquet which belonged to a lady boarder 
 how well bred it eats the top of the slice of bread and butter just like a person 
 it was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was once picked up a confession which had been written out in advance in order that she might not forget it by a sinner of seven years 
 father i accuse myself of having been avaricious 
 father i accuse myself of having been an adulteress 
 father i accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen 
 it was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth six years of age improvised the following tale which was listened to by blue eyes aged four and five years 
 there were three little cocks who owned a country where there were a great many flowers 
 they plucked the flowers and put them in their pockets 
 after that they plucked the leaves and put them in their playthings 
 there was a wolf in that country there was a great deal of forest and the wolf was in the forest and he ate the little cocks 
 and this other poem 
 there came a blow with a stick 
 it was punchinello who bestowed it on the cat 
 it was not good for her it hurt her 
 then a lady put punchinello in prison 
 it was there that a little abandoned child a foundling whom the convent was bringing up out of charity uttered this sweet and saying 
 she heard the others talking of their mothers and she murmured in her corner 
 as for me my mother was not there when i was born 
 there was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through the corridors with her bunch of keys and whose name was sister agatha 
 the big big over ten years of age called her agathocles 
 the refectory a large apartment of an oblong square form which received no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the garden was dark and damp and as the children say full of beasts all the places round about furnished their contingent of insects 
 each of its four corners had received in the language of the pupils a special and expressive name 
 there was spider corner caterpillar corner corner and cricket corner 
 cricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed it was not so cold there as elsewhere 
 from the refectory the names had passed to the and there served as in the old college mazarin to distinguish four nations 
 every pupil belonged to one of these four nations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat at meals 
 one day monseigneur the archbishop while making his pastoral visit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter the through which he was passing 
 he inquired of another pupil a charming brunette with rosy cheeks who stood near him 
 who is that 
 she is a spider monseigneur 
 bah 
 and that one yonder 
 she is a cricket 
 and that one 
 she is a caterpillar 
 really and yourself 
 i am a monseigneur 
 every house of this sort has its own peculiarities 
 at the beginning of this century ecouen was one of those strict and graceful places where young girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august at ecouen in order to take rank in the procession of the holy sacrament a distinction was made between virgins and florists there were also the dais and the first who held the cords of the dais and the others who carried incense before the holy sacrament 
 the flowers belonged by right to the florists four virgins walked in advance 
 on the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the question put in the dormitory who is a virgin 
 madame campan used to quote this saying of a little one of seven years to a big girl of sixteen who took the head of the procession while she the little one remained at the rear you are a virgin but i am not

 chapter xviii 
 
 next day prince andrew thought of the ball but his mind did not dwell on it long yes it was a very brilliant ball and then yes that little rostova is very charming something fresh original about her that distinguishes her that was all he thought about ball and after his morning tea he set to work 
 but either from fatigue or want of sleep he was for work and could get nothing done he kept criticizing his own work as he often did and was glad when he heard someone coming 
 the visitor was bitski who served on various committees frequented all the societies in petersburg and a passionate devotee of the new ideas and of speranski and a diligent petersburg newsmonger one of those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into prince room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking he had just heard particulars of that sitting of the council of state opened by the emperor and he spoke of it enthusiastically the speech had been extraordinary it had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs deliver the sovereign plainly said that the council and senate are estates of the realm he said that the government must rest not on authority but on secure bases the emperor said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts published recounted bitski emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantly 
 ah yes events mark an epoch the greatest epoch in our history he concluded 
 prince andrew listened to the account of the opening of the council of state which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached such importance and was surprised that this event now that it had taken place did not affect him and even seemed quite insignificant he listened with quiet irony to enthusiastic account of it a very simple thought occurred to him what does it matter to me or to bitski what the emperor was pleased to say at the council can all that make me any happier or better 
 and this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest prince andrew had felt in the impending reforms he was going to dine that evening at with only a few friends as the host had said when inviting him the prospect of that dinner in the intimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested prince andrew especially as he had not yet seen speranski in his domestic surroundings but now he felt disinclined to go to it 
 at the appointed hour however he entered the modest house speranski owned in the taurida gardens in the parqueted dining room this small house remarkable for its extreme cleanliness suggesting that of a monastery prince andrew who was rather late found the friendly gathering of intimate acquaintances already assembled at five there were no ladies present except little daughter like her father and her governess the other guests were gervais magnitski and stolypin while still in the anteroom prince andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugh a laugh such as one hears on the stage someone it sounded like speranski was distinctly ejaculating prince andrew had never before heard famous laugh and this ringing high pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him 
 he entered the dining room the whole company were standing between two windows at a small table laid with speranski wearing a gray coat with a star on the breast and evidently still the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of the council of state stood at the table with a beaming countenance his guests surrounded him magnitski addressing himself to speranski was relating an anecdote and speranski was laughing in advance at what magnitski was going to say when prince andrew entered the room words were again crowned by laughter stolypin gave a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese gervais laughed softly with a hissing chuckle and speranski in a staccato manner 
 still laughing speranski held out his soft white hand to prince andrew 
 very pleased to see you prince he said one moment he went on turning to magnitski and interrupting his story we have agreed that this is a dinner for recreation with not a word about business and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh 
 prince andrew looked at the laughing speranski with astonishment regret and disillusionment it seemed to him that this was not speranski but someone else everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and fascinating in speranski suddenly became plain and unattractive 
 at dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes before magnitski had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something still funnier most of the anecdotes if not relating to the state service related to people in the service it seemed that in this company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored ridicule speranski related how at the council that morning a deaf dignitary when asked his opinion replied that he thought so too gervais gave a long account of an official revision remarkable for the stupidity of everybody concerned stolypin stuttering broke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed under the former order of things threatening to give a serious turn to the conversation magnitski starting quizzing stolypin about his vehemence gervais intervened with a joke and the talk reverted to its former lively tone 
 evidently speranski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement in a circle of friends and his guests understanding his wish tried to enliven him and amuse themselves but their gaiety seemed to prince andrew mirthless and tiresome voice struck him unpleasantly and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false note prince andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the company but no one took any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood they all seemed very gay 
 he tried several times to join in the conversation but his remarks were tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water and he could not jest with them 
 there was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it was witty and might have been funny but it lacked just that something which is the salt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a thing existed 
 after dinner daughter and her governess rose he patted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her and that gesture too seemed unnatural to prince andrew 
 the men remained at table over their port english fashion in the midst of a conversation that was started about spanish affairs which they all agreed in approving prince andrew began to express a contrary opinion speranski smiled and with an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course told a story that had no connection with the previous conversation for a few moments all were silent 
 having sat some time at table speranski corked a bottle of wine and remarking nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair passed it to the servant and got up all rose and continuing to talk loudly went into the drawing room two letters brought by a courier were handed to speranski and he took them to his study as soon as he had left the room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly and quietly with one another 
 now for the recitation said speranski on returning from his study a wonderful talent he said to prince andrew and magnitski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in french which he had composed about various petersburg people he was interrupted several times by applause when the verses were finished prince andrew went up to speranski and took his leave 
 where are you off to so early asked speranski 
 i promised to go to a reception 
 they said no more prince andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike impenetrable eyes and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have expected anything from speranski and from any of his own activities connected with him or ever to have attributed importance to what speranski was doing that precise mirthless laughter rang in prince ears long after he had left the house 
 when he reached home prince andrew began thinking of his life in petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new he recalled his exertions and solicitations and the history of his project of army reform which had been accepted for consideration and which they were trying to pass over in silence simply because another a very poor one had already been prepared and submitted to the emperor he thought of the meetings of a committee of which berg was a member he remembered how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and procedure was discussed at those meetings and how sedulously and promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded he recalled his labors on the legal code and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of the roman and french codes into russian and he felt ashamed of himself then he vividly pictured to himself bogucharovo his occupations in the country his journey to ryazan he remembered the peasants and dron the village elder and mentally applying to them the personal rights he had divided into paragraphs he felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless work

 above the door of the refectory this prayer which was called the white paternoster and which possessed the property of bearing people straight to paradise was inscribed in large black letters 
 little white paternoster which god made which god said which god placed in paradise 
 in the evening when i went to bed i found three angels sitting on my bed one at the foot two at the head the good virgin mary in the middle who told me to lie down without hesitation 
 the good god is my father the good virgin is my mother the three apostles are my brothers the three virgins are my sisters 
 the shirt in which god was born envelopes my body saint cross is written on my breast madame the virgin was walking through the meadows weeping for god when she met m saint john 
 monsieur saint john whence come you i come from ave salus 
 you have not seen the good god where is he he is on the tree of the cross his feet hanging his hands nailed a little cap of white thorns on his head 
 whoever shall say this thrice at eventide thrice in the morning shall win paradise at the last 
 in this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall under a triple coating of daubing paint 
 at the present time it is finally disappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then and who are old women now 
 a large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this refectory whose only door as we think we have mentioned opened on the garden 
 two narrow tables each flanked by two wooden benches formed two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory 
 the walls were white the tables were black these two mourning colors constitute the only variety in convents 
 the meals were plain and the food of the children themselves severe 
 a single dish of meat and vegetables combined or salt was their luxury 
 this meagre fare which was reserved for the pupils alone was nevertheless an exception the children ate in silence under the eye of the mother whose turn it was who if a fly took a notion to fly or to hum against the rule opened and shut a wooden book from time to time this silence was seasoned with the lives of the saints read aloud from a little pulpit with a desk which was situated at the foot of the crucifix 
 the reader was one of the big girls in weekly turn at regular distances on the bare tables there were large varnished bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks and into which they sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or spoiled fish this was punished 
 these bowls were called ronds the child who broke the silence made a cross with her tongue 
 where 
 on the ground 
 she licked the pavement the dust that end of all joys was charged with the chastisement of those poor little which had been guilty of chirping 
 there was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as a unique copy and which it is forbidden to read 
 it is the rule of an arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate nemo regulas seu constitutiones nostras externis communicabit 
 the pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book and set to reading it with avidity a reading which was often interrupted by the fear of being caught which caused them to close the volume precipitately 
 from the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderate amount of pleasure 
 the most interesting thing they found were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys 
 they played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby in spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments administered when the wind had shaken the trees they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or an inhabited pear on the sly 
 i will now cede the privilege of speech to a letter which lies before me a letter written five and twenty years ago by an old pupil now madame la duchesse de one of the most elegant women in paris 
 i quote literally one hides pear or apple as best one may when one goes up stairs to put the veil on the bed before supper one stuffs them under pillow and at night one eats them in bed and when one cannot do that one eats them in the closet that was one of their greatest luxuries 
 was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the convent one of the young girls mademoiselle bouchard who was connected with the montmorency family laid a wager that she would ask for a leave of enormity in so austere a community the wager was accepted but not one of those who bet believed that she would do it 
 when the moment came as the archbishop was passing in front of the pupils mademoiselle bouchard to the indescribable terror of her companions stepped out of the ranks and said monseigneur a leave of absence 
 mademoiselle bouchard was tall blooming with the prettiest little rosy face in the world m de quelen smiled and said what my dear child a leave of absence 
 three days if you like 
 i grant you three days the prioress could do nothing the archbishop had spoken horror of the convent but joy of the pupil 
 the effect may be imagined 
 this stern cloister was not so well walled off however but that the life of the passions of the outside world drama and even romance did not make their way in 
 to prove this we will confine ourselves to recording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact which however bears no reference in itself to and is not connected by any thread whatever with the story which we are relating 
 we mention the fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the mind 
 about this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was not a nun who was treated with great respect and who was addressed as madame albertine 
 nothing was known about her save that she was mad and that in the world she passed for dead beneath this history it was said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great marriage 
 this woman hardly thirty years of age of dark complexion and tolerably pretty had a vague look in her large black eyes could she see 
 there was some doubt about this 
 she glided rather than walked she never spoke it was not quite known whether she breathed 
 her nostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh 
 to touch her hand was like touching snow she possessed a strange spectral grace 
 wherever she entered people felt cold 
 one day a sister on seeing her pass said to another sister she passes for a dead woman 
 perhaps she is one replied the other 
 a hundred tales were told of madame albertine 
 this arose from the eternal curiosity of the pupils 
 in the chapel there was a gallery called de boeuf 
 it was in this gallery which had only a circular bay an oeil de boeuf that madame albertine listened to the offices 
 she always occupied it alone because this gallery being on the level of the first story the preacher or the officiating priest could be seen which was interdicted to the nuns one day the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank m le duc de rohan peer of france officer of the red musketeers in when he was prince de leon and who died afterward in as cardinal and archbishop of besancon 
 it was the first time that m de rohan had preached at the convent madame albertine usually preserved perfect calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services 
 that day as soon as she caught sight of m de rohan she half rose and said in a loud voice amid the silence of the chapel ah 
 auguste 
 the whole community turned their heads in amazement the preacher raised his eyes but madame albertine had relapsed into her immobility a breath from the outer world a flash of life had passed for an instant across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished and the mad woman had become a corpse again 
 those two words however had set every one in the convent who had the privilege of speech to chattering 
 how many things were contained in that ah 
 auguste what revelations 
 m de name really was auguste 
 it was evident that madame albertine belonged to the very highest society since she knew m de rohan and that her own rank there was of the highest since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a lord and that there existed between them some connection of relationship perhaps but a very close one in any case since she knew his pet name 
 two very severe duchesses mesdames de choiseul and de serent often visited the community whither they penetrated no doubt in virtue of the privilege magnates mulieres and caused great consternation in the when these two old ladies passed by all the poor young girls trembled and dropped their eyes 
 moreover m de rohan quite unknown to himself was an object of attention to the at that epoch he had just been made while waiting for the episcopate of the archbishop of paris 
 it was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate the offices in the chapel of the nuns of the not one of the young recluses could see him because of the serge curtain but he had a sweet and rather shrill voice which they had come to know and to distinguish 
 he had been a mousquetaire and then he was said to be very coquettish that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent moire and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world 
 he held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years 
 not a sound from without made its way into the convent 
 but there was one year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither this was an event and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall it 
 it was a flute which was played in the neighborhood 
 this flute always played the same air an air which is very far away zetulbe come reign my it was heard two or three times a day 
 the young girls passed hours in listening to it the vocal mothers were upset by it brains were busy punishments descended in showers 
 this lasted for several months the girls were all more or less in love with the unknown musician each one dreamed that she was zetulbe 
 the sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the rue and they would have given anything compromised everything attempted anything for the sake of seeing of catching a glance if only for a second of the young man who played that flute so deliciously and who no doubt played on all these souls at the same time 
 there were some who made their escape by a back door and ascended to the third story on the rue side in order to attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps 
 impossible 
 one even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating and to wave her white handkerchief two were still bolder 
 they found means to climb on a roof and risked their lives there and succeeded at last in seeing the young man he was an old emigre gentleman blind and penniless who was playing his flute in his attic in order to pass the time

 next day prince andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before and among them at the rostovs with whom he had renewed acquaintance at the ball apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the call he wanted to see that original eager girl who had left such a pleasant impression on his mind in her own home 
 natasha was one of the first to meet him she was wearing a house dress in which prince andrew thought her even prettier than in her ball dress she and all the rostov family welcomed him as an old friend simply and cordially the whole family whom he had formerly judged severely now seemed to him to consist of excellent simple and kindly people the old hospitality and good nature which struck one especially in petersburg as a pleasant surprise were such that prince andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner yes he thought they are capital people who of course have not the slightest idea what a treasure they possess in natasha but they are kindly folk and form the best possible setting for this strikingly poetic charming girl overflowing with life 
 in natasha prince andrew was conscious of a strange world completely alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him a different world that in the otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had already begun to disconcert him now this world disconcerted him no longer and was no longer alien to him but he himself having entered it found in it a new enjoyment 
 after dinner natasha at prince request went to the clavichord and began singing prince andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies and listened to her in the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him a thing he had thought impossible for him he looked at natasha as she sang and something new and joyful stirred in his soul he felt happy and at the same time sad he had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep what about his former love the little princess his disillusionments his hopes for the future yes and no the chief reason was a sudden vivid sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and illimitable within him and that limited and material something that he and even she was this contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while she sang 
 as soon as natasha had finished she went up to him and asked how he liked her voice she asked this and then became confused feeling that she ought not to have asked it he smiled looking at her and said he liked her singing as he liked everything she did 
 prince andrew left the rostovs late in the evening he went to bed from habit but soon realized that he could not sleep having lit his candle he sat up in bed then got up then lay down again not at all troubled by his sleeplessness his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had stepped out of a stuffy room into own fresh air it did not enter his head that he was in love with natasha he was not thinking about her but only picturing her to himself and in consequence all life appeared in a new light why do i strive why do i toil in this narrow confined frame when life all life with all its joys is open to me said he to himself and for the first time for a very long while he began making happy plans for the future he decided that he must attend to his education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in his charge then he ought to retire from the service and go abroad and see england switzerland and 
 italy i must use my freedom while i feel so much strength and youth in me he said to himself pierre was right when he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order to be happy and now i do believe in it let the dead bury their dead but while one has life one must live and be happy thought he

 the little convent 
 in this enclosure of the there were three perfectly distinct great convent inhabited by the nuns the where the scholars were lodged and lastly what was called the little convent 
 it was a building with a garden in which lived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders the relics of cloisters destroyed in the revolution a reunion of all the black gray and white medleys of all communities and all possible varieties what might be called if such a coupling of words is permissible a sort of harlequin convent 
 when the empire was established all these poor old dispersed and exiled women had been accorded permission to come and take shelter under the wings of the the government paid them a small pension the ladies of the received them cordially 
 it was a singular each followed her own rule sometimes the pupils of the were allowed as a great recreation to pay them a visit the result is that all those young memories have retained among other souvenirs that of mother mother and mother jacob 
 one of these refugees found herself almost at home 
 she was a nun of the only one of her order who had survived the ancient convent of the ladies of occupied at the beginning of the eighteenth century this very house of the which belonged later to the benedictines of martin verga 
 this holy woman too poor to wear the magnificent habit of her order which was a white robe with a scarlet scapulary had piously put it on a little manikin which she exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at her death in only one nun of this order remained there remains only a doll 
 in addition to these worthy mothers some old society women had obtained permission of the prioress like madame albertine to retire into the little convent 
 among the number were madame beaufort and marquise dufresne 
 another was never known in the convent except by the formidable noise which she made when she blew her nose 
 the pupils called her madame vacarmini hubbub 
 about or madame de genlis who was at that time editing a little periodical publication called asked to be allowed to enter the convent of the as lady resident the duc recommended her 
 uproar in the hive the were all in a flutter madame de genlis had made romances but she declared that she was the first to detest them and then she had reached her fierce stage of devotion 
 with the aid of god and of the prince she entered 
 she departed at the end of six or eight months alleging as a reason that there was no shade in the garden 
 the nuns were delighted 
 although very old she still played the harp and did it very well 
 when she went away she left her mark in her cell 
 madame de genlis was superstitious and a latinist 
 these two words furnish a tolerably good profile of her 
 a few years ago there were still to be seen pasted in the inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her silverware and her jewels these five lines in latin written with her own hand in red ink on yellow paper and which in her opinion possessed the property of frightening away robbers 
 imparibus meritis pendent tria corpora ramis 
 dismas et gesmas media est divina potestas 
 alta petit dismas infelix infima gesmas 
 nos et res nostras conservet summa potestas 
 hos versus dicas ne tu furto tua perdas 
 on the boughs hang three bodies of unequal merits dismas and gesmas between is the divine power 
 dismas seeks the heights gesmas unhappy man the lowest regions the highest power will preserve us and our effects 
 if you repeat this verse you will not lose your things by theft 
 these verses in sixth century latin raise the question whether the two thieves of calvary were named as is commonly believed dismas and gestas or dismas and gesmas 
 this orthography might have confounded the pretensions put forward in the last century by the vicomte de gestas of a descent from the wicked thief however the useful virtue attached to these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the hospitallers 
 the church of the house constructed in such a manner as to separate the great convent from the like a veritable intrenchment was of course common to the the great convent and the little convent 
 the public was even admitted by a sort of lazaretto entrance on the street 
 but all was so arranged that none of the inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world 
 suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand and folded in such a manner as to form not as in ordinary churches a prolongation behind the altar but a sort of hall or obscure cellar to the right of the officiating priest suppose this hall to be shut off by a curtain seven feet in height of which we have already spoken in the shadow of that curtain pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir on the left the on the right the and the novices at 
 the bottom and you will have some idea of the nuns of the assisting at divine service 
 that cavern which was called the choir communicated with the cloister by a lobby 
 the church was lighted from the garden 
 when the nuns were present at services where their rule enjoined silence the public was warned of their presence only by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising and falling

 one morning colonel berg whom pierre knew as he knew everybody in moscow and petersburg came to see him berg arrived in an immaculate uniform with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his temples as the emperor alexander wore his hair 
 i have just been to see the countess your wife unfortunately she could not grant my request but i hope count i shall be more fortunate with you he said with a smile 
 what is it you wish colonel i am at your service 
 i have now quite settled in my new rooms count berg said this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable and so i wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my friends he smiled still more pleasantly i wished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper 
 only countess helene considering the society of such people as the bergs beneath her could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small but select company and why this would give him pleasure and why though he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful he was prepared to run into some expense for the sake of good society that pierre could not refuse and promised to come 
 but be late count if i may venture to ask about ten minutes to eight please we shall make up a rubber our general is coming he is very good to me we shall have supper count so you will do me the favor 
 contrary to his habit of being late pierre on that day arrived at the bergs house not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight 
 having prepared everything necessary for the party the bergs were really for their guests arrival 
 in their new clean and light study with its small busts and pictures and new furniture sat berg and his wife berg closely buttoned up in his new uniform sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always could and should be acquainted with people above one because only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances 
 you can get to know something you can ask for something see how i managed from my first promotion berg measured his life not by years but by promotions my comrades are still nobodies while i am only waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment and have the happiness to be your husband he rose and kissed hand and on the way to her straightened out a corner of the carpet and how have i obtained all this chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances it goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical 
 berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman and paused reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak woman who could not understand all that constitutes a dignity what it was ein mann zu sein vera at the same time smiling with a sense of superiority over her good conscientious husband who all the same understood life wrongly as according to vera all men did berg judging by his wife thought all women weak and foolish vera judging only by her husband and generalizing from that observation supposed that all men though they understand nothing and are conceited and selfish ascribe common sense to themselves alone 
 to be a man 
 berg rose and embraced his wife carefully so as not to crush her lace fichu for which he had paid a good price kissing her straight on the lips 
 the only thing is we have children too soon he continued following an unconscious sequence of ideas 
 yes answered vera i at all want that we must live for society 
 princess yusupova wore one exactly like this said berg pointing to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile 
 just then count bezukhov was announced husband and wife glanced at one another both smiling with and each mentally claiming the honor of this visit 
 this is what what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances thought berg this is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself 
 but please interrupt me when i am entertaining the guests said vera because i know what interests each of them and what to say to different people 
 berg smiled again 
 it be helped men must sometimes have masculine conversation said he 
 they received pierre in their small new where it was impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry neatness and order so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that berg having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair or of the sofa for his dear guest but being apparently painfully undecided on the matter himself eventually left the visitor to settle the question of selection pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself and berg and vera immediately began their evening party interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their guest 
 vera having decided in her own mind that pierre ought to be entertained with conversation about the french embassy at once began accordingly berg having decided that masculine conversation was required interrupted his remarks and touched on the question of the war with austria and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them though the conversation was very incoherent and vera was angry at the intrusion of the masculine element both husband and wife felt with satisfaction that even if only one guest was present their evening had begun very well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with its talk tea and lighted candles 
 before long boris old comrade arrived there was a shade of condescension and patronage in his treatment of berg and vera after boris came a lady with the colonel then the general himself then the rostovs and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other evening parties berg and vera could not repress their smiles of satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room at the sound of the disconnected talk the rustling of dresses and the bowing and scraping everything was just as everybody always has it especially so the general who admired the apartment patted berg on the shoulder and with parental authority superintended the setting out of the table for boston the general sat down by count ilya rostov who was next to himself the most important guest the old people sat with the old the young with the young and the hostess at the tea table on which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as the panins had at their party everything was just as it was everywhere else

 some silhouettes of this darkness 
 during the six years which separate from the prioress of the was mademoiselle de blemeur whose name in religion was mother innocente 
 she came of the family of marguerite de blemeur author of lives of the saints of the order of she had been she was a woman about sixty years of age short thick singing like a cracked pot says the letter which we have already quoted an excellent woman moreover and the only merry one in the whole convent and for that reason adored she was learned erudite wise competent curiously proficient in history crammed with latin stuffed with greek full of hebrew and more of a benedictine monk than a benedictine nun 
 the was an old spanish nun mother cineres who was almost blind 
 the most esteemed among the vocal mothers were mother the treasurer mother the chief mistress of the novices the assistant mistress mother annonciation the sacristan mother the nurse the only one in the convent who was malicious then mother mademoiselle gauvain very young and with a beautiful voice mother des anges mademoiselle drouet who had been in the convent of the and in the convent du tresor between gisors and magny mother mademoiselle de cogolludo mother mademoiselle mother misericorde mademoiselle de cifuentes who could not resist austerities mother compassion mademoiselle de la miltiere received at the age of sixty in defiance of the rule and very wealthy mother providence mademoiselle de laudiniere mother presentation mademoiselle de siguenza who was prioress in and finally mother sister of the sculptor ceracchi who went mad mother mademoiselle de suzon who went mad 
 there was also among the prettiest of them a charming girl of three and twenty who was from the isle de bourbon a descendant of the chevalier roze whose name had been mademoiselle roze and who was called mother assumption 
 mother intrusted with the singing and the choir was fond of making use of the pupils in this quarter 
 she usually took a complete scale of them that is to say seven from ten to sixteen years of age inclusive of assorted voices and sizes whom she made sing standing drawn up in a line side by side according to age from the smallest to the largest 
 this presented to the eye something in the nature of a of young girls a sort of living made of angels 
 those of the whom the scholars loved most were sister euphrasie sister sister who was in her dotage and sister whose long nose made them laugh 
 all these women were gentle with the children 
 the nuns were severe only towards themselves 
 no fire was lighted except in the school and the food was choice compared to that in the convent moreover they lavished a thousand cares on their scholars 
 only when a child passed near a nun and addressed her the nun never replied 
 this rule of silence had had this effect that throughout the whole convent speech had been withdrawn from human creatures and bestowed on inanimate objects 
 now it was the which spoke now it was the bell 
 a very sonorous bell placed beside the portress and which was audible throughout the house indicated by its varied peals which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph all the actions of material life which were to be performed and summoned to the parlor in case of need such or such an inhabitant of the house 
 each person and each thing had its own peal 
 the prioress had one and one the one and two 
 announced lessons so that the pupils never said to go to lessons but to go to was madame de signal 
 it was very often heard 
 le diable a the very the uncharitable tennine strokes announced a great event 
 it was the opening of the door of seclusion a frightful sheet of iron bristling with bolts which only turned on its hinges in the presence of the archbishop 
 with the exception of the archbishop and the gardener no man entered the convent as we have already said 
 the schoolgirls saw two others 
 one the chaplain the abbe banes old and ugly whom they were permitted to contemplate in the choir through a grating the other the m ansiaux whom the letter of which we have perused a few lines calls m anciot and describes as a frightful old hunchback 
 it will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen 
 such was this curious house

 pierre as one of the principal guests had to sit down to boston with count rostov the general and the colonel at the card table he happened to be directly facing natasha and was struck by a curious change that had come over her since the ball she was silent and not only less pretty than at the ball but only redeemed from plainness by her look of gentle indifference to everything around 
 the matter with her thought pierre glancing at her she was sitting by her sister at the tea table and reluctantly without looking at him made some reply to boris who sat down beside her after playing out a whole suit and to his delight taking five tricks pierre hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the room while he was picking up his tricks glanced again at natasha 
 what has happened to her he asked himself with still greater surprise 
 prince andrew was standing before her saying something to her with a look of tender solicitude she having raised her head was looking up at him flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing and the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again alight in her she was completely transformed and from a plain girl had again become what she had been at the ball 
 prince andrew went up to pierre and the latter noticed a new and youthful expression in his face 
 pierre changed places several times during the game sitting now with his back to natasha and now facing her but during the whole of the six rubbers he watched her and his friend 
 something very important is happening between them thought pierre and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him neglect the game 
 after six rubbers the general got up saying that it was no use playing like that and pierre was released natasha on one side was talking with sonya and boris and vera with a subtle smile was saying something to prince andrew pierre went up to his friend and asking whether they were talking secrets sat down beside them vera having noticed prince attentions to natasha decided that at a party a real evening party subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and seizing a moment when prince andrew was alone began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her sister with so intellectual a guest as she considered prince andrew to be she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact 
 when pierre went up to them he noticed that vera was being carried away by her talk but that prince andrew seemed embarrassed a thing that rarely happened with him 
 what do you think vera was saying with an arch smile you are so discerning prince and understand characters so well at a glance what do you think of natalie could she be constant in her attachments could she like other women vera meant herself love a man once for all and remain true to him forever that is what i consider true love what do you think prince 
 i know your sister too little replied prince andrew with a sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment to be able to solve so delicate a question and then i have noticed that the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be he added and looked up pierre who was just approaching them 
 yes that is true prince in our days continued vera mentioning our days as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing imagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of our days and that human characteristics change with the times in our days a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling in her and it must be confessed that natalie is very susceptible this return to the subject of natalie caused prince andrew to knit his brows with discomfort he was about to rise but vera continued with a still more subtle smile 
 i think no one has been more courted than she she went on but till quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone now you know count she said to pierre even our dear cousin boris who between ourselves was very far gone in the land of tenderness alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time 
 prince andrew frowned and remained silent 
 you are friendly with boris you asked vera 
 yes i know him 
 i expect he has told you of his childish love for natasha 
 oh there was childish love suddenly asked prince andrew blushing unexpectedly 
 yes you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love le cousinage est un dangereux voisinage you think so 
 cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood 
 oh undoubtedly said prince andrew and with sudden and unnatural liveliness he began chaffing pierre about the need to be very careful with his moscow cousins and in the midst of these jesting remarks he rose taking pierre by the arm and drew him aside 
 well asked pierre seeing his strange animation with surprise and noticing the glance he turned on natasha as he rose 
 i must i must have a talk with you said prince andrew you know that pair of gloves he referred to the masonic gloves given to a newly initiated brother to present to the woman he loved i but no i will talk to you later on and with a strange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements prince andrew approached natasha and sat down beside her pierre saw how prince andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied 
 but at that moment berg came to pierre and began insisting that he should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on the affairs in spain 
 berg was satisfied and happy the smile of pleasure never left his face the party was very successful and quite like other parties he had seen everything was similar the ladies subtle talk the cards the general raising his voice at the card table and the samovar and the tea cakes only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening parties he wished to imitate they had not yet had a loud conversation among the men and a dispute about something important and clever now the general had begun such a discussion and so berg drew pierre to it

 post corda lapides 
 after having sketched its moral face it will not prove unprofitable to point out in a few words its material configuration the reader already has some idea of it 
 the convent of the filled almost the whole of the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the rue polonceau the rue the rue and the unused lane called rue aumarais on old plans these four streets surrounded this trapezium like a moat the convent was composed of several buildings and a garden the principal building taken in its entirety was a juxtaposition of hybrid constructions which viewed from a view outlined with considerable exactness a gibbet laid flat on the ground the main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment of the rue comprised between the rue and the rue polonceau the lesser arm was a lofty gray severe grated facade which faced the rue the carriage entrance no marked its extremity 
 towards the centre of this facade was a low arched door whitened with dust and ashes where the spiders wove their webs and which was open only for an hour or two on sundays and on rare occasions when the coffin of a nun left the convent this was the public entrance of the church 
 the elbow of the gibbet was a square hall which was used as the servants hall and which the nuns called the buttery 
 in the main arm were the cells of the mothers the sisters and the novices 
 in the lesser arm lay the kitchens the refectory backed up by the cloisters and the church 
 between the door no and the corner of the closed lane aumarais was the school which was not visible from without the remainder of the trapezium formed the garden which was much lower than the level of the rue polonceau which caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside the garden which was slightly arched had in its centre on the summit of a hillock a fine pointed and conical whence ran as from the peaked boss of a shield four grand alleys and ranged by twos in between the branchings of these eight small ones so that if the enclosure had been circular the geometrical plan of the alleys would have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel as the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of the garden they were of unequal length 
 they were bordered with currant bushes at the bottom an alley of tall poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent which was at the angle of the rue to the house of the little convent which was at the angle of the aumarais lane in front of the little convent was what was called the little garden to this whole let the reader add a courtyard all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings prison walls the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the rue polonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood and he will be able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the bernardines of the was forty years ago this holy house had been built on the precise site of a famous of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century which was called the of the eleven thousand devils 
 all these streets moreover were more ancient than paris 
 these names and aumarais are very ancient the streets which bear them are very much more ancient still 
 aumarais lane was called maugout lane the rue was called the rue des eglantiers for god opened flowers before man cut stones

 chapter xxii 
 next day having been invited by the count prince andrew dined with the rostovs and spent the rest of the day there 
 everyone in the house realized for whose sake prince andrew came and without concealing it he tried to be with natasha all day not only in the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured natasha but in the whole house there was a feeling of awe at something important that was bound to happen the countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes at prince andrew when he talked to natasha and timidly started some artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way sonya was afraid to leave natasha and afraid of being in the way when she was with them natasha grew pale in a panic of expectation when she remained alone with him for a moment prince andrew surprised her by his timidity she felt that he wanted to say something to her but could not bring himself to do so 
 in the evening when prince andrew had left the countess went up to natasha and whispered well what 
 mamma for sake ask me anything now one talk about that said natasha 
 but all the same that night natasha now agitated and now frightened lay long time in her bed gazing straight before her she told her how he had complimented her how he told her he was going abroad asked her where they were going to spend the summer and then how he had asked her about boris 
 but such a such a never happened to me before she said only i feel afraid in his presence i am always afraid when with him what does that mean does it mean that the real thing yes mamma are you asleep 
 no my love i am frightened myself answered her mother now go 
 all the same i sleep what silliness to sleep mummy mummy such a thing never happened to me before she said surprised and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself and could we ever have thought 
 it seemed to natasha that even at the time she first saw prince andrew at otradnoe she had fallen in love with him it was as if she feared this strange unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had then chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and of finding him as it seemed not indifferent to her 
 and it had to happen that he should come specially to petersburg while we are here and it had to happen that we should meet at that ball it is fate clearly it is fate that everything led up to this already then directly i saw him i felt something peculiar 
 what else did he say to you what are those verses read them said her mother thoughtfully referring to some verses prince andrew had written in album 
 mamma one need not be ashamed of his being a widower 
 natasha pray to god marriages are made in heaven said her mother 
 darling mummy how i love you how happy i am cried natasha shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother 
 at that very time prince andrew was sitting with pierre and telling him of his love for natasha and his firm resolve to make her his wife 
 that day countess helene had a reception at her house the french ambassador was there and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late become a frequent visitor of hers and many brilliant ladies and gentlemen pierre who had come downstairs walked through the rooms and struck everyone by his preoccupied and morose air 
 since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression and had made desperate efforts to combat it since the intimacy of his wife with the royal prince pierre had unexpectedly been made a gentleman of the bedchamber and from that time he had begun to feel oppressed and ashamed in court society and dark thoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him oftener than before at the same time the feeling he had noticed between his protegee natasha and prince andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position and his he tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife and about natasha and prince andrew and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with eternity again the question for what presented itself and he forced himself to work day and night at masonic labors hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him toward midnight after he had left the countess apartments he was sitting upstairs in a shabby dressing gown copying out the original transaction of the scottish lodge of freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy with tobacco smoke when someone came in it was prince andrew 
 ah you said pierre with a preoccupied dissatisfied air and i you see am hard at it he pointed to his manuscript book with that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at their work 
 prince andrew with a beaming ecstatic expression of renewed life on his face paused in front of pierre and not noticing his sad look smiled at him with the egotism of joy 
 well dear heart said he i wanted to tell you about it yesterday and i have come to do so today i never experienced anything like it before i am in love my friend 
 suddenly pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on the sofa beside prince andrew 
 with natasha rostova yes said he 
 yes yes who else should it be i should never have believed it but the feeling is stronger than i yesterday i tormented myself and suffered but i would not exchange even that torment for anything in the world i have not lived till now at last i live but i live without her but can she love me i am too old for her why you speak 
 i i what did i tell you said pierre suddenly rising and beginning to pace up and down the room i always thought it that girl is such a treasure she is a rare girl my dear friend i entreat you philosophize doubt marry marry marry and i am sure there will not be a happier man than you 
 but what of her 
 she loves you 
 talk rubbish said prince andrew smiling and looking into eyes 
 she does i know pierre cried fiercely 
 but do listen returned prince andrew holding him by the arm do you know the condition i am in i must talk about it to someone 
 well go on go on i am very glad said pierre and his face really changed his brow became smooth and he listened gladly to prince andrew prince andrew seemed and really was quite a different quite a new man where was his spleen his contempt for life his disillusionment pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind to speak openly and to him he told all that was in his soul now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his caprice and spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her or would do without his consent then he marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something strange apart from and independent of himself 
 i should not have believed anyone who told me that i was capable of such love said prince andrew it is not at all the same feeling that i knew in the past the whole world is now for me divided into two halves one half is she and there all is joy hope light the other half is everything where she is not and there is all gloom and darkness 
 darkness and gloom reiterated pierre yes yes i understand that 
 i cannot help loving the light it is not my fault and i am very happy you understand me i know you are glad for my sake 
 yes yes pierre assented looking at his friend with a touched and sad expression in his eyes the brighter prince lot appeared to him the gloomier seemed his own
