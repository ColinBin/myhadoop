lionfish nov chapter twelve professor umbridgecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 seamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before harry had even put on his socks 
 
 does he think turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too long asked harry loudly as the hem of robes wnipped out of sight 
 
 worry about it harry dean muttered hoisting his schoolbag on to his shoulder just 
 
 but apparently he was unable to say exactly what seamus was and after a slightly awkward pause followed him out of the room 
 
 neville and ron both gave harry an look but harry was not much consoled how much more of this would he have to take 
 
 the matter asked hermione five minutes later catching up with harry and ron halfway across the common room as they all headed towards breakfast you look absolutelyoh for heavens sake 
 
 she was staring at the noticeboard where a large new sign had been put up 
 
 gallons of galleons 
 
 pocket money failing to keep pace with your outgoings 
 
 like to earn a little extra gold 
 
 contact fred and george weasley gryffindor common room 
 
 for simple virtually painless jobs 
 
 we regret that all work is undertaken at own risk 
 
 they are the limit said hermione grimly taking down the sign which fred and george had pinned up ewer a poster giving the date of the first hogsmeade weekend which was to be in october have to talk to them ron 
 
 ron looked positively alarmed 
 
 why 
 
 because prefects said hermione as they climbed out through the portrait hole up to us to stop this kind of thing 
 
 ron said nothing harry could tell from his glum expression that the prospect of stopping fred and george doing exactly what they liked was not one he found inviting 
 
 anyway up harry hermione continued as they walked down a flight of stairs lined with portraits of old witches and wizards all of whom ignored them being engrossed in their own conversation you look really angry about something 
 
 seamus reckons lying about said ron succinctly when harry did not respond 
 
 hermione who harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf sighed 
 
 yes lavender thinks so too she said gloomily 
 
 been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not a lying prat have you harry said loudly 
 
 no said hermione calmly i told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you actually and it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats harry because in case you noticed ron and i are on your side 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 sorry said harry in a low voice 
 
 quite all right said hermione with dignity then she shook her head you remember what dumbledore said at the last feast 
 
 harry and ron both looked at her blankly and hermione sighed again 
 
 about he said his gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust 
 
 how do you remember stuff like that asked ron looking at her in admiration 
 
 i listen ron said hermione with a touch of asperity 
 
 so do i but i still tell you exactly what 
 
 the point hermione pressed on loudly is that this sort of thing is exactly what dumbledore was talking about only been back two months and already started fighting among ourselves and the sorting warning was the same stand together be united 
 
 and harry got it right last night retorted ron if that means supposed to get matey with the slytherinsfat chance 
 
 well i think a pity not trying for a bit of unity said hermione crossly 
 
 they had reached the foot of the marble staircase a line of ravenclaws was crossing the entrance hall they caught sight of harry and hurried to form a tighter group as though frightened he might attack stragglers 
 
 yeah we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that said harry sarcastically 
 
 they followed the ravenclaws into the great hall all looking instinctively at the staff table as they entered professor was chatting to professor sinistra the astronomy teacher and hagrid was once again conspicuous only by his absence the enchanted ceiling above them echoed mood it was a miserable grey 
 
 dumbledore even mention how long that staying he said as they made their way across to the gryffindor table 
 
 maybe said hermione thoughtfully 
 
 what said both harry and ron together 
 
 well maybe he want to draw attention to hagrid not being here 
 
 what mean draw attention to it said ron how could we not notice 
 
 before hermione could answer a tall black girl with long braided hair had marched up to harry 
 
 hi angelina 
 
 hi she said briskly good summer and without waiting for an answer listen been made gryffindor quidditch captain 
 
 nice one said harry grinning at her he suspected pep talks might not be as as oliver had been which could only be an improvement 
 
 yeah well we need a new keeper now left tryouts are on friday at five and i want the whole team there all right then we can see how the new fit in 
 
 ok said harry 
 
 angelina smiled at him and departed 
 
 forgotten wood had left said hermione vaguely as she sat down beside ron and pulled a plate of toast towards her i suppose that will make quite a difference to the team 
 
 i said harry taking the bench opposite he was a good keeper 
 
 still it hurt to have some new blood will it said ron 
 
 with a whoosh and a clatter hundreds of owls came soaring in through the upper windows they descended all over the hall bringing letters and packages to their owners and showering the breakfasters with droplets of water it was clearly raining hard outside hedwig was nowhere to be seen but harry was hardly surprised his only correspondent was sirius and he doubted sirius would have anything new to tell him after only hours apart hermione however had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way gor a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden daily prophet in its beak 
 
 what are you still getting that for said harry irritably thinking of seamus as hermione placed a knut in the leather pouch on the leg and it took off again not bothering load of rubbish 
 
 best to know what the enemy is saying said hermione darkly and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it not emerging until harry and ron had finished eating 
 
 nothing she said simply rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her plate nothing about you or dumbledore or anything 
 
 professor mcgonagall was now moving along the table handing out timetables 
 
 look at today groaned ron history of magic double potions divination and double defence against the dark arts binns snape trelawney and that umbridge woman all in one day i wish fred and hurry up and get those skiving snackboxes sorted 
 
 do mine ears deceive me said fred arriving with george and squeezing on to the bench beside harry hogwarts prefects surely wish to skive off lessons 
 
 look what got today said ron grumpily shoving his timetable under nose the worst monday ever seen 
 
 fair point little bro said fred scanning the column you can have a bit of nosebleed nougat cheap if you like 
 
 it cheap said ron suspiciously 
 
 because keep bleeding till you shrivel up we got an antidote yet said george helping himself to a kipper 
 
 cheers said ron moodily pocketing his timetable but i think take the lessons 
 
 and speaking of your skiving snackboxes said hermione eyeing fred and george beadily you advertise for testers on the gryffindor noticeboard 
 
 says who said george looking astonished 
 
 says me said hermione and ron 
 
 leave me out of it said ron hastily 
 
 hermione glared at him fred and george sniggered 
 
 be singing a different tune soon enough hermione said fred thickly buttering a crumpet starting your fifth year be begging us for a snackbox before long 
 
 and why would starting fifth year mean i want a skiving snackbox asked hermione 
 
 fifth owl year said george 
 
 so 
 
 so got your exams coming up you be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone be rubbed raw said fred with satisfaction 
 
 half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to owls said george happily tears and tantrums patricia stimpson kept coming over faint 
 
 kenneth towler came out in boils remember said fred remmiscently 
 
 cause you put bulbadox powder in his pyjamas said george 
 
 oh yeah said fred grinning forgotten hard to keep track sometimes it 
 
 anyway a nightmare of a year the fifth said george if you care about exam results anyway fred and i managed to keep our peckers up somehow 
 
 yeah you got what was it three owls each said ron 
 
 yep said fred unconcernedly but we feel our futures lie outside the world of academic achievement 
 
 we seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year said george brightly now that got 
 
 he broke off at a warning look from harry who knew george had been about to mention the triwizard winnings he had given them 
 
 now that got our owls george said hastily i mean do we really need newts but we think mum could take us leaving school early not on top of percy turning out to be the biggest prat 
 
 not going to waste our last year here though said fred looking affectionately around at the great hall going to use it to do a bit of market research find out exactly what the average hogwarts student requires from a joke shop carefully evaluate the results of our research then produce products to fit the demand 
 
 but where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop hermione asked sceptically going to need all the ingredients and materialsand premises too i suppose 
 
 harry did not look at the twins his face felt hot he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it he heard fred say overhead ask us no questions and tell you no lies hermione george if we get there early we might be able to sell a few extendable ears before herbology 
 
 harry emerged from under the table to see fred and george walking away each carrying a stack of toast 
 
 what did that mean said hermione looking from harry to ron ask us no questions does that mean already got some gold to start a joke shop 
 
 you know been wondering about that said ron his brow furrowed they bought me a new set of dress robes this summer and i understand where they got the galleons 
 
 harry decided it was time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous waters 
 
 reckon true this going to be really tough because of the exams 
 
 oh yeah said ron bound to be it owls are really important affect the jobs you can apply for and everything we get career advice too later this year bill told me so you can choose what newts you want to do next year 
 
 know what you want to do after hogwarts harry asked the other two as they left the great hall shortly afterwards and set off towards their history of magic classroom 
 
 not really said ron slowly except well 
 
 he looked slightly sheepish 
 
 what harry urged him 
 
 well be cool to be an auror said ron in an voice 
 
 yeah it would said harry fervently 
 
 but like the elite said ron got to be really good what about you hermione 
 
 i know she said i think like to do something really worthwhile 
 
 an worthwhile said harry 
 
 yes it is but not the only worthwhile thing said hermione thoughtfully i mean if i could take spew further 
 
 harry and ron carefully avoided looking at each other 
 
 history of magic was by common consent the most boring subject ever devised by wizardkind professor binns their ghost teacher had a wheezy droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within ten minutes five in warm weather he never varied the form of their lessons but lectured them without pausing while they took notes or rather gazed sleepily into space harry and ron had so far managed to scrape passes in this subject only by copying notes before exams she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of voice 
 
 today they suffered an hour and a droning on the subject of giant wars harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another hands this subject might have been mildly interesting but then his brain disengaged and he spent the remaining hour and twenty minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with ron while hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye 
 
 how would it be she asked them coldly as they left the classroom for break binns drifting away through the blackboard if i refused to lend you my notes this year 
 
 fail our owl said ron if you want that on your conscience hermione 
 
 well deserve it she snapped you even try to listen to him do you 
 
 we do try said ron we just got your brains or your memory or your concentration just cleverer than we areis it nice to rub it in 
 
 oh give me that rubbish said hermione but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard 
 
 a fine misty drizzle was falling so that the people standing in huddles around the edges of the yard looked blurred at the edges harry ron and hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony turning up the collars of their robes against the chilly september air and talking about what snape was likely to set them in the first lesson of the year they had got as far as agreeing that it was likely to be something extremely difficult just to catch them off guard after a holiday when someone walked around the corner towards them 
 
 hello harry 
 
 it was cho chang and what was more she was on her own again this was most unusual cho was almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girls harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the yule ball 
 
 hi said harry feeling his face grow hot at least not covered in stinksap this time he told himself cho seemed to be thinking along the same lines 
 
 you got that stuff off then 
 
 yeah said harry trying to grin as though the memory of their last meeting was funny as opposed to mortifying so did you er have a good summer 
 
 the moment he had said this he wished he had been boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost as badly as it had affected something seemed to tauten in her face but she said oh it was all right you know 
 
 is that a tornados badge ron demanded suddenly pointing to the front of robes where a badge emblazoned with a double gold t was pinned you support them do you 
 
 yeah i do said cho 
 
 have you always supported them or just since they started winning the league said ron in what harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice 
 
 supported them since i was six said cho coolly anyway see you harry 
 
 she walked away hermione waited until cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on ron 
 
 you are so tactless 
 
 what i only asked her if 
 
 you tell she wanted to talk to harry on her own 
 
 so she done i stopping 
 
 why on earth were you attacking her about her quidditch team 
 
 attacking i attacking her i was only 
 
 who cares if she supports the tornados 
 
 oh come on half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season 
 
 but what does it matter 
 
 it means not real fans just jumping on the bandwagon 
 
 the bell said harry dully because ron and hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it they did not stop arguing all the way down to snapes dungeon which gave harry plenty of time to reflect that between neville and ron he would be lucky ever to have two minutes of conversation with cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country 
 
 and yet he thought as they joined the queue lining up outside classroom door she had chosen to come and talk to him she she had been girlfriend she could easily have hated harry for coming out of the triwizard maze alive when cedric had died yet she was talking to him in a perfectly friendly way not as though she thought him mad or a liar or in some horrible way responsible for death yes she had definitely chosen to come and talk to him and that made the second time in two days and at this thought spirits rose even the ominous sound of dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest he filed into the classroom behind ron and hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back where he sat down between ron and hermione and ignored the huffy irritable noises now issuing from both of them 
 
 settle down said snape coldly shutting the door behind him 
 
 there was no real need for the call to order the moment the class had heard the door close quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped mere presence was usually enough to ensure a silence 
 
 before we begin lesson said snape sweeping over to his desk and staring around at them all i think it appropriate to remind you that next june you will be sitting an important examination during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are i expect you to scrape an acceptable in your owl or suffer my displeasure 
 
 his gaze lingered this time on neville who gulped 
 
 after this year of course many of you will cease studying with me snape went on i take only the very best into my newt potions class which means that some of us will certainly be saying goodbye 
 
 his eyes rested on harry and his lip curled harry glared back feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up potions after fifth year 
 
 but we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell said snape softly so whether or not you are intending to attempt newt i advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high pass level i have come to expect from my owl students 
 
 today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at ordinary wizarding level the draught of peace a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation be warned if you are too with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing on left hermione sat up a little straighter her expression one of utmost attention the ingredients and method snape flicked his wand are on the appeared there you will find everything you need he flicked his wand again in the store cupboard the door of the said cupboard sprang open you have an hour and a half start 
 
 just as harry ron and hermione had predicted snape could hardly have set them a more difficult fiddly potion the ingredients had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantities the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of times firstly in clockwise then in directions the heat of the flames on which it was simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minutes before the final ingredient was added 
 
 a light silver vapour should now be rising from your potion called snape with ten minutes left to go 
 
 harry who was sweating profusely looked desperately around the dungeon his own cauldron was issuing copious amounts of dark grey steam was spitting green sparks seamus was feverishly prodding the flames at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand as they seemed to be going out the surface of potion however was a shimmering mist of silver vapour and as snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment which meant he could find nothing to criticise 
 
 at cauldron however snape stopped and looked down at it with a horrible smirk on his face 
 
 potter what is this supposed to be 
 
 the slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly they loved hearing snape taunt harry 
 
 the draught of peace said harry tensely 
 
 tell me potter said snape softly can you read 
 
 draco malfoy laughed 
 
 yes i can said harry his fingers clenched tightly around his wand 
 
 read the third line of the instructions for me potter 
 
 harry squinted at the blackboard it was not easy to make out the instructions through the haze of steam now filling the dungeon 
 
 add powdered moonstone stir three times allow to simmer for seven minutes then add two drops of syrup of hellebore 
 
 his heart sank he had not added syrup of hellebore but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instructions after allowing his potion to simmer for seven minutes 
 
 did you do everything on the third line potter 
 
 no said harry very quietly 
 
 i beg your pardon 
 
 no said harry more loudly i forgot the hellebore 
 
 i know you did potter which means that this mess is utterly worthless evanesce 
 
 the contents of potion vanished he was left standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron 
 
 those of you who have managed to read the instructions fill one flagon with a sample of your potion label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing said snape homework twelve inches of parchment on the properties of moonstone and its uses in to be handed in on thursday 
 
 while everyone around him filled their flagons harry cleared away his things seething his potion had been no worse than which was now giving off a foul odour of bad eggs or which had achieved the consistency of cement and which neville was now having to gouge out of his cauldron yet it was he harry who would be receiving zero marks for the work he stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down on to his seat watching everyone else march up to desk with filled and corked flagons when at long last the bell rang harry was first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time ron and hermione joined him in the great hall the ceiling had turned an even murkier grey during the morning rain was lashing the high windows 
 
 that was really unfair said hermione consolingly sitting down next to harry and helping herself to pie your potion nearly as bad as when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robes on fire 
 
 yeah well said harry glowering at his plate since when has snape ever been fair to me 
 
 neither of the others answered all three of them knew that snape and mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment harry had set foot in hogwarts 
 
 i did think he might be a bit better this year said hermione in a disappointed voice i mean you know she looked around carefully there were half a dozen empty seats on either side of them and nobody was passing the table now in the order and everything 
 
 poisonous toadstools change their spots said ron sagely anyway always thought dumbledore was cracked to trust snape the evidence he ever really stopped working for 
 
 i think probably got plenty of evidence even if he share it with you ron snapped hermione 
 
 oh shut up the pair of you said harry heavily as ron opened his mouth to argue back hermione and ron both froze looking angry and offended you give it a rest said harry always having a go at each other driving me mad and abandoning his pie he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there 
 
 he walked up the marble staircase two steps at a time past the many students hurrying towards lunch the anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him and the vision of ron and shocked faces afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction serve them right he thought why they give it a rest bickering all the time enough to drive anyone up the wall 
 
 he passed the large picture of sir cadogan the knight on a landing sir cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at harry who ignored him 
 
 come back you scurvy dog stand fast and fight yelled sir cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his visor but harry merely walked on and when sir cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a neighbouring picture he was rebuffed by its inhabitant a large and wolfhound 
 
 harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of north tower consequently he was the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to sybill classroom when the bell rang 
 
 after potions divination was least favourite class which was due mainly to professor habit of predicting his premature death every few lessons a thin woman heavily draped in shawls and glittering with strings of beads she always reminded harry of some kind of insect with her glasses hugely magnifying her eyes she was busy putting copies of battered books on each of the spindly little tables with which her room was littered when harry entered the room but the light cast by the lamps covered by scarves and the fire was so dim she appeared not to notice him as he took a seat in the shadows the rest of the class arrived over the next five minutes ron emerged from the trapdoor looked around carefully spotted harry and made directly for him or as directly as he could while having to wend his way between tables chairs and overstuffed pouffes 
 
 hermione and me have stopped arguing he said sitting down beside harry 
 
 good grunted harry 
 
 but hermione says she thinks it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on us said ron 
 
 i m not 
 
 just passing on the message said ron talking over him but i reckon right not our fault how seamus and snape treat you 
 
 i never said it 
 
 said professor trelawney in her usual misty dreamy voice and harry broke off again feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself and welcome back to divination i have of course been following your fortunes most carefully over the holidays and am delighted to see that you have all returned to hogwarts safelyas of course i knew you would 
 
 you will find on the tables before you copies of the dream oracle by inigo imago dream interpretation is a most important means of divining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your owl not of course that i believe examination passes or failures are of the remotest importance when it comes to the sacred art of divination if you have the seeing eye certificates and grades matter very little however the headmaster likes you to sit the examination so 
 
 her voice trailed away delicately leaving them all in no doubt that professor trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matters as examinations 
 
 turn please to the introduction and read what imago has to say on the matter of dream interpretation then divide into pairs use the dream oracle to interpret each most recent dreams carry on 
 
 the one good thing to be said for this lesson was that it was not a double period by the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the book they had barely ten minutes left for dream interpretation at the table next to harry and ron dean had paired up with neville who immediately embarked on a explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his best hat harry and ron merely looked at each other glumly 
 
 i never remember my dreams said ron you say one 
 
 you must remember one of them said harry impatiently 
 
 he was not going to share his dreams with anyone he knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant he did not need ron or proiessor trelawney or the stupid dream oracle to tell him 
 
 well i dreamed i was playing quidditch the other night said ron screwing up his face in an effort to remember what reckon that means 
 
 probably that going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something said harry turning the pages of the dream oracle without interest it was very dull work looking up bits of dreams in the oracle and harry was not cheered up when professor trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month as homework when the bell went he and ron led the way back down the ladder ron grumbling loudly 
 
 realise how much homework got already binns set us a essay on giant wars snape wants a foot on the use of moonstones and now got a dream diary from trelawney fred and george wrong about owl year were they that umbridge woman had better not give us any 
 
 when they entered the defence against the dark arts classroom they found professor umbridge already seated at the teachers desk wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head harry was again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad 
 
 the class was quiet as it entered the room professor umbridge was as yet an unknown quantity and nobody knew how strict a disciplinarian she was likely to be 
 
 well good afternoon she said when finally the whole class had sat down 
 
 a few people mumbled good afternoon in reply 
 
 tut tut said professor umbridge that do now will it i should like you please to reply good afternoon professor umbridge one more time please good afternoon class 
 
 good afternoon professor umbridge they chanted back at her 
 
 there now said professor umbridge sweetly that too difficult was it wands away and quills out please 
 
 many of the class exchanged gloomy looks the order wands away had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled cut quill ink and parchment professor umbridge opened her handbag extracted her own wand which was an unusually short one and tapped the blackboard sharply with it words appeared on the board at once 
 
 defence against the dark arts 
 
 a return to basic principles 
 
 well now your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented it stated professor umbridge turning to face the class with her hands clasped neatly in front of her the constant changing of teachers many of whom do not seem to have followed any curriculum has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your owl year 
 
 you will be pleased to know however that these problems are now to be rectified we will be following a carefully structured course of defensive magic this year copy down the following please 
 
 she rapped the blackboard again the first message vanished and was replaced by 
 
 course aims 
 understanding the principles underlying defensive magic 
 
 learning to recognise situations in which defensive magic can legally be used 
 
 placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use 
 
 for a couple of minutes the room was full of the sound of scratching quills on parchment when everyone had copied down professor three course aims she asked has everybody got a copy of defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 there was a dull murmur of assent throughout the class 
 
 i think try that again said professor umbridge when i ask you a question i should like you to reply yes professor umbridge or no professor umbridge so has everyone got a copy of defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard 
 
 yes professor umbridge rang through the room 
 
 good said professor umbridge i should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one basics for beginners there will be no need to talk 
 
 professor umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the desk observing them all closely with those pouchy eyes harry turned to page five of his copy of defensive magical theory and started to read 
 
 it was desperately dull quite as bad as listening to professor binns he felt his concentration sliding away from him he had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words several silent minutes passed next to him ron was turning his quill over and over in his fingers staring at the same spot on the page harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor hermione had not even opened her copy of defensive magical was staring fixedly at professor umbridge with her hand in the air 
 
 harry could not remember hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose he looked at her enquiringly but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she was not about to answer questions and continued to stare at professor umbridge who was looking just as resolutely in another direction 
 
 after several more minutes had passed however harry was not the only one watching hermione the chapter they had been instructed to read was so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch mute attempt to catch professor eye rather than struggle on with basics for beginners 
 
 when more than half the class were staring at hermione rather than at their books professor umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer 
 
 did you want to ask something about the chapter dear she asked hermione as though she had only just noticed her 
 
 not about the chapter no said hermione 
 
 well reading just now said professor umbridge showing her small pointed teeth if you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class 
 
 got a query about your course aims said hermione 
 
 professor umbridge raised her eyebrows 
 
 and your name is 
 
 hermione granger said hermione 
 
 well miss granger i think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully said professor umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness 
 
 well i said hermione bluntly nothing written up there about using defensive spells 
 
 there was a short silence in which many members of the class turned their heads to frown at the three course aims still written on the blackboard 
 
 using defensive spells professor umbridge repeated with a little laugh why i imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell miss granger you surely expecting to be attacked during class 
 
 not going to use magic ron exclaimed loudly 
 
 students raise their hands when they wish to speak in my class mr 
 
 weasley said ron thrusting his hand into the air 
 
 professor umbridge smiling still more widely turned her back on him harry and hermione immediately raised their hands too professor pouchy eyes lingered on harry for a moment before she addressed hermione 
 
 yes miss granger you wanted to ask something else 
 
 yes said hermione surely the whole point of defence against the dark arts is to practise defensive spells 
 
 are you a educational expert miss granger asked professor umbridge in her falsely sweet voice 
 
 no but 
 
 well then afraid you are not qualified to decide what the whole point of any class is wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new programme of study you will be learning about defensive spells in a secure way 
 
 what use is that said harry loudly if going to be attacked it be in a 
 
 potter sang professor umbridge 
 
 harry thrust his fist in the air again professor umbridge promptly turned away from him but now several other people had their hands up too 
 
 and your name is professor umbridge said to dean 
 
 dean thomas 
 
 well mr thomas 
 
 well like harry said it said dean if going to be attacked it be risk free 
 
 i repeat said professor umbridge smiling in a very irritating fashion at dean do you expect to be attacked during my classes 
 
 no but 
 
 professor umbridge talked over him i do not wish to criticise the way things have been run in this school she said an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class very irresponsible indeednot to mention she gave a nasty little laugh extremely dangerous 
 
 if you mean professor lupin piped up dean angrily he was the best we ever 
 
 thomas as i was sayingyou have been introduced to spells that have been complex inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal you have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet dark attacks every other day 
 
 no we hermione said we just 
 
 your hand is not up miss granger 
 
 hermione put up her hand professor umbridge turned away from her 
 
 it is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curses in front of you he actually performed them on you 
 
 well he turned out to be a maniac he said dean hotly mind you we still learned loads 
 
 your hand is not up mr thomas trilled professor umbridge now it is the view of the ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination which after all is what school is all about and your name is she added staring at parvati whose hand had just shot up 
 
 parvati patil and there a practical bit in our defence against the dark arts owl we supposed to show that we can actually do the and things 
 
 as long as you have studied the theory hard enough there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions said professor umbridge dismissively 
 
 without ever practising them beforehand said parvati incredulously are you telling us that the first time get to do the spells will be during our exam 
 
 i repeat as long as you have studied the theory hard enough 
 
 and what theory going to be in the real world said harry loudly his fist in the air again 
 
 professor umbridge looked up 
 
 this is school mr potter not the real world she said softly 
 
 so not supposed to be prepared for waiting for us out there 
 
 there is nothing waiting out there mr potter 
 
 oh yeah said harry his temper which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day was reaching boiling point 
 
 who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves enquired professor umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice 
 
 hmm think said harry in a mock thoughtful voice maybe lord voldemort 
 
 ron gasped lavender brown uttered a little scream neville slipped sideways off his stool professor umbridge however did not flinch she was staring at harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face 
 
 ten points from gryffindor mr potter 
 
 the classroom was silent and still everyone was staring at either umbridge or harry 
 
 now let me make a few things quite plain 
 
 professor umbridge stood up and leaned towards them her hands splayed on her desk 
 
 you have been told that a certain dark wizard has returned from the dead 
 
 he dead said harry angrily but yeah returned 
 
 said professor umbridge in one breath without looking at him as i was saying you have been informed that a certain dark wizard is at large once again this is a lie 
 
 it is not a lie said harry i saw him i fought him 
 
 detention mr potter said professor umbridge triumphantly tomorrow evening five my office i repeat this is a ministry of magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any dark wizard if you are still worried by all means come and see me outside class hours if someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn dark wizards i would like to hear about it i am here to help i am your friend and now you will kindly continue your reading page five basics for beginners 
 
 professor umbridge sat down behind her desk harry however stood up everyone was staring at him seamus looked 
 
 harry no hermione whispered in a warning voice tugging at his sleeve but harry jerked his arm out of her reach 
 
 so according to you cedric diggory dropped dead of his own accord did he harry asked his voice shaking 
 
 there was a collective intake of breath from the class for none of them apart from ron and hermione had ever heard harry talk about what had happened on the night cedric had died they stared avidly from harry to professor umbridge who had raised her eyes and was staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face 
 
 cedric death was a tragic accident she said coldly 
 
 it was murder said harry he could feel himself shaking he had hardly spoken to anyone about this least of all thirty eagerly listening classmates voldemort killed him and you know it 
 
 professor face was quite blank for a moment harry thought she was going to scream at him then she said in her softest most sweetly girlish voice come here mr potter dear 
 
 he kicked his chair aside strode around ron and hermione and up to the desk he could feel the rest of the class holding its breath he felt so angry he did not care what happened next 
 
 professor umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag stretched it out on the desk dipped her quill into a bottle of ink and started scribbling hunched over so that harry could not see what she was writing nobody spoke after a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it 
 
 take this to professor mcgonagall dear said professor umbridge holding out the note to him 
 
 he took it from her without saying a word turned on his heel and left the room not even looking back at ron and hermione slamming the classroom door shut behind him he walked very fast along the corridor the note to mcgonagall clutched tight in his hand and turning a corner walked slap into peeves the poltergeist a little man floating on his back in midair juggling several inkwells 
 
 why potty wee potter cackled peeves allowing two of the inkwells to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the walls with ink harry jumped backwards out of the way with a snarl 
 
 get out of it peeves 
 
 oooh feeling cranky said peeves pursuing harry along the corridor leering as he zoomed along above him what is it this time my fine potty friend hearing voices seeing visions speaking in peeves blew a gigantic raspberry tongues 
 
 i said leave me alone harry shouted running down the nearest flight of stairs but peeves merely slid down the banister on his back beside him 
 
 oh most think barking the potty wee lad 
 
 but some are more kindly and think just sad 
 
 but peevesy knows better and says that mad 
 
 
 
 shut up 
 
 a door to his left flew open and professor mcgonagall emerged from her office looking grim and slightly harassed 
 
 what on earth are you shouting about potter she snapped as peeves cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight why you in class 
 
 been sent to see you said harry stiffly 
 
 sent what do you mean sent 
 
 he held out the note from professor umbridge professor mcgonagall took it from him frowning slit it open with a tap of her wand stretched it out and began to read her eyes zoomed from side to side behind their square spectacles as she read what umbridge had written and with each line they became narrower 
 
 come in here potter 
 
 he followed her inside her study the door closed automatically behind him 
 
 well said professor mcgonagall rounding on him is this true 
 
 is what true harry asked rather more aggressively than he had intended professor he added in an attempt to sound more polite 
 
 is it true that you shouted at professor umbridge 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 you called her a liar 
 
 yes 
 
 you told her he who must not be named is back 
 
 yes 
 
 professor mcgonagall sat down behind her desk watching harry closely then she said have a biscuit potter 
 
 havewhat 
 
 have a biscuit she repeated impatiently indicating a tartan tin lying on top of one of the piles of papers on her desk and sit down 
 
 there had been a previous occasion when harry expecting to be caned by professor mcgonagall had instead been appointed by her to the gryffindor quidditch team he sank into a chair opposite her and helped himself to a ginger newt feeling just as confused and as he had done on that occasion 
 
 professor mcgonagall set down professor note and looked very seriously at harry 
 
 potter you need to be careful 
 
 harry swallowed his mouthful of ginger newt and stared at her her tone of voice was not at all what he was used to it was not brisk crisp and stern it was low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual 
 
 misbehaviour in dolores class could cost you much more than house points and a detention 
 
 what do you 
 
 potter use your common sense snapped professor mcgonagall with an abrupt return to her usual manner you know where she comes from you must know to whom she is reporting 
 
 the bell rang for the end of the lesson overhead and all around came the elephantine sounds of hundreds of students on the move 
 
 it says here given you detention every evening this week starting tomorrow professor mcgonagall said looking down at note again 
 
 every evening this week harry repeated horrified but professor you 
 
 no i said professor mcgonagall flatly 
 
 but 
 
 she is your teacher and has every right to give you detention you will go to her room at five tomorrow for the first one just remember tread carefully around dolores umbridge 
 
 but i was telling the truth said harry outraged voldemort is back you know he is professor dumbledore knows he is 
 
 for sake potter said professor mcgonagall straightening her glasses angrily she had winced horribly when he had used name do you really think this is about truth or lies about keeping your head down and your temper under control 
 
 she stood up nostrils wide and mouth very thin and harry stood up too 
 
 have another biscuit she said irritably thrusting the tin at him 
 
 no thanks said harry coldly 
 
 be ridiculous she snapped 
 
 he took one 
 
 thanks he said grudgingly 
 
 you listen to dolores speech at the feast potter 
 
 yeah said harry yeah she said progress will be prohibited or well it meant that that the ministry of magic is trying to interfere at hogwarts 
 
 professor mcgonagall eyed him closely for a moment then sniffed walked around her desk and held open the door for him 
 
 well glad you listen to hermione granger at any rate she said pointing him out of her office 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix
