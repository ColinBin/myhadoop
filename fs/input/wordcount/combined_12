 kreacher it transpired had been lurking in the attic sirius said he had found him up there covered in dust no doubt looking for more relics of the black family to hide in his cupboard though sirius seemed satisfied with this story it made harry uneasy kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he submitted to orders more docilely than usual though once or twice harry caught the staring at him avidly but always looking quickly away whenever he saw that harry had noticed 
 
 harry did not mention his vague suspicions to sirius whose cheerfulness was evaporating fast now that christmas was over as the date of their departure back to hogwarts drew nearer he became more and more prone to what mrs weasley called fits of the sullens in which he would become taciturn and grumpy often withdrawing to room for hours at a time his gloom seeped through the house oozing under doorways like some noxious gas so that all of them became infected by it 
 
 harry want to leave sirius again with only kreacher for company in fact for the first time in his life he was not looking forward to returning to hogwarts going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of dolores umbridge who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decrees in their absence there was no quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned there was every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase as the exams drew even nearer and dumbledore remained as remote as ever in fact if it been for the da harry thought he might have begged sirius to let him leave hogwarts and remain in grimmauld place 
 
 then on the very last day of the holidays something happened that made harry positively dread his return to school 
 
 harry dear said mrs weasley poking her head into his and bedroom where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by hermione ginny and crookshanks could you come down to the kitchen professor snape would like a word with you 
 
 harry did not immediately register what she had said one of his castles was engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of and he was egging it on enthusiastically 
 
 squash him squash him only a pawn you idiot sorry mrs weasley what did you say 
 
 professor snape dear in the kitchen like a word 
 
 mouth fell open in horror he looked around at ron hermione and ginny all of whom were gaping back at him crookshanks whom hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour leapt gleefully on to the board and set the pieces running for cover squealing at the top of their voices 
 
 snape said harry blankly 
 
 professor snape dear said mrs weasley reprovingly now come on quickly he says he stay long 
 
 he want with you said ron looking unnerved as mrs weasley withdrew from the room you done anything have you 
 
 no said harry indignantly racking his brains to think what he could have done that would make snape pursue him to grimmauld place had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a t 
 
 a minute or two later he pushed open the kitchen door to find sirius and snape both seated at the long kitchen table glaring in opposite directions the silence between them was heavy with mutual dislike a letter lay open on the table in front of sirius 
 
 er said harry to announce his presence 
 
 snape looked around at him his face framed between curtains of greasy black hair 
 
 sit down potter 
 
 you know said sirius loudly leaning back on his rear chair legs and speaking to the ceiling i think prefer it if you give orders here snape my house you see 
 
 an ugly flush suffused pallid face harry sat down in a chair beside sirius facing snape across the table 
 
 i was supposed to see you alone potter said snape the familiar sneer curling his mouth but black 
 
 his godfather said sirius louder than ever 
 
 i am here on orders said snape whose voice by contrast was becoming more and more quietly waspish but by all means stay black i know you like to feel involved 
 
 that supposed to mean said sirius letting his chair fall back on to all four legs with a loud bang 
 
 merely that i am sure you must feelahfrustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful snape laid a delicate stress on the word for the order 
 
 it was turn to flush lip curled in triumph as he turned to harry 
 
 the headmaster has sent me to tell you potter that it is his wish for you to study occlumency this term 
 
 study what said harry blankly 
 
 sneer became more pronounced 
 
 occlumency potter the magical defence of the mind against external penetration an obscure branch of magic but a highly useful one 
 
 heart began to pump very fast indeed defence against external penetration but he was not being possessed they had all agreed on that 
 
 why do i have to study occluthing he blurted out 
 
 because the headmaster thinks it a good idea said snape smoothly you will receive private lessons once a week but you will not tell anybody what you are doing least of all dolores umbridge you understand 
 
 yes said harry going to be teaching me 
 
 snape raised an eyebrow 
 
 i am he said 
 
 harry had the horrible sensation that his insides were melting 
 
 extra lessons with snapewhat on earth had he done to deserve this he looked quickly round at sirius for support 
 
 why dumbledore teach harry asked sirius aggressively why you 
 
 i suppose because it is a privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks said snape silkily i assure you i did not beg for the job he got to his feet i will expect you at six on monday evening potter my office if anybody asks you are taking remedial potions nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them 
 
 he turned to leave his black travelling cloak billowing behind him 
 
 wait a moment said sirius sitting up straighter in his chair 
 
 snape turned back to face them sneering 
 
 i am in rather a hurry black unlike you i do not have unlimited leisure time 
 
 get to the point then said sirius standing up he was rather taller than snape who harry noticed balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what harry was sure was the handle of his wand if i hear using these occlumency lessons to give harry a hard time have me to answer to 
 
 how touching snape sneered but surely you have noticed that potter is very like his father 
 
 yes i have said sirius proudly 
 
 well then know so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him snape said sleekly 
 
 sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table towards snape pulling out his wand as he went snape whipped out his own they were squaring up to each other sirius looking livid snape calculating his eyes darting from to his face 
 
 sirius said harry loudly but sirius appeared not to hear him 
 
 warned you snivelus said sirius his face barely a foot from i care if dumbledore thinks reformed i know better 
 
 oh but why you tell him so whispered snape or are you afraid he might not take very seriously the advice of a man who has been hiding inside his house for six months 
 
 tell me how is lucius malfoy these days i expect delighted his working at hogwarts he 
 
 speaking of dogs said snape softly did you know that lucius malfoy recognised you last time you risked a little jaunt outside clever idea black getting yourself seen on a safe station platform gave you a excuse not to leave your in future it 
 
 sirius raised his wand 
 
 no harry yelled vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them sirius 
 
 are you calling me a coward roared sirius trying to push harry out of the way but harry would not budge 
 
 why yes i suppose i am said snape 
 
 harryget outofit snarled sirius pushing him aside with his free hand 
 
 the kitchen door opened and the entire weasley family plus hermione came inside all looking very happy with mr weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pyjamas covered by a mackintosh 
 
 cured he announced brightly to the kitchen at large completely cured 
 
 he and all the other weasleys froze on the threshold gazing at the scene in front of them which was also suspended in both sirius and snape looking towards the door with their wands pointing into each faces and harry immobile between them a hand stretched out to each trying to force them apart 
 
 beard said mr weasley the smile sliding off his face going on here 
 
 both sirius and snape lowered their wands harry looked from one to the other each wore an expression of utmost contempt yet the unexpected entrance of so many witnesses seemed to have brought them to their senses snape pocketed his wand turned on his heel and swept back across the kitchen passing the weasleys without comment at the door he looked back 
 
 six monday evening potter 
 
 and he was gone sirius glared after him his wand at his side 
 
 been going on asked mr weasley again 
 
 nothing arthur said sirius who was breathing heavily as though he had just run a long distance just a friendly little chat between two old school friends with what looked like an enormous effort he smiled so cured great news really great 
 
 yes it said mrs weasley leading her husband forward to a chair healer smethwyck worked his magic in the end found an antidote to whatever that got in its fangs and learned his lesson about dabbling in muggle medicine you dear she added rather menacingly 
 
 yes molly dear said mr weasley meekly 
 
 that meal should have been a cheerful one with mr weasley back amongst them harry could tell sirius was trying to make it so yet when his godfather was not forcing himself to laugh loudly at fred and jokes or offering everyone more food his face fell back into a moody brooding expression harry was separated from him by mundungus and who had dropped in to offer mr weasley their congratulations he wanted to talk to sirius to tell him he listen to a word snape said that snape was goading him deliberately and that the rest of them think sirius was a coward for doing as dumbledore told him and remaining in grimmauld place but he had no opportunity to do so and eyeing the ugly look on face harry wondered occasionally whether he would have dared to mention it even if he had the chance instead he told ron and hermione under his voice about having to take occlumency lessons with snape 
 
 dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about voldemort said hermione at once well you be sorry not to have them any more will you 
 
 extra lessons with snape said ron sounding aghast rather have the nightmares 
 
 they were to return to hogwarts on the knight bus the following day escorted once again by tonks and lupin both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when harry ron and hermione came down next morning the adults seemed to have been through a whispered conversation as harry opened the door all of them looked round hastily and fell silent 
 
 after a hurried breakfast they all pulled on jackets and scarves against the chilly grey january morning harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest he did not want to say goodbye to sirius he had a bad feeling about this parting he know when they would next see each other and he felt it was incumbent upon him to say something to sirius to stop him doing anything stupidharry was worried that accusation of cowardice had stung sirius so badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond grimmauld place before he could think of what to say however sirius had beckoned him to his side 
 
 i want you to take this he said quietly thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into hands 
 
 what is it harry asked 
 
 a way of letting me know if giving you a hard time no open it in here said sirius with a wary look at mrs weasley who was trying to persuade the twins to wear mittens i doubt molly would approvebut i want you to use it if you need me all right 
 
 ok said harry stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket but he knew he would never use whatever it was it would not be he harry who lured sirius from his place of safety no matter how foully snape treated him in their forthcoming occlumency classes 
 
 go then said sirius clapping harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly and before harry could say anything else they were heading upstairs stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door surrounded by weasleys 
 
 goodbye harry take care said mrs weasley hugging him 
 
 see you harry and keep an eye out for snakes for me said mr weasley genially shaking his hand 
 
 rightyeah said harry distractedly it was his last chance to tell sirius to be careful he turned looked into his face and opened his mouth to speak but before he could do so sirius was giving him a brief hug and saying gruffly look after yourself harry next moment harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air with tonks today heavily disguised as a tall tweedy woman with hair chivvying him down the steps 
 
 the door of number twelve slammed shut behind them they followed lupin down the front steps as he reached the pavement harry looked round number twelve was shrinking rapidly as those on either side of it stretched sideways squeezing it out of sight one blink later it had gone 
 
 come on the quicker we get on the bus the better said tonks and harry thought there was nervousness in the glance she threw around the square lupin flung out his right arm 
 
 bang 
 
 a violently purple bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost which jumped backwards out of its way 
 
 a thin pimply youth in a purple uniform leapt down on to the pavement and said welcome to the 
 
 yes yes we know thank you said tonks swiftly on on get on 
 
 and she shoved harry forwards towards the steps past the conductor who goggled at harry as he passed 
 
 arry 
 
 if you shout his name i will curse you into oblivion muttered tonks menacingly now shunting ginny and hermione forwards 
 
 always wanted to go on this thing said ron happily joining harry on board and looking around 
 
 it had been evening the last time harry had travelled by knight bus and its three decks had been full of brass bedsteads now in the early morning it was crammed with an assortment of mismatched chairs grouped haphazardly around windows some of these appeared to have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in grimmauld place a few witches and wizards were still getting to their feet grumbling and shopping bag had slid the length of the bus an unpleasant mixture of frogspawn cockroaches and custard creams was scattered all over the floor 
 
 looks like have to split up said tonks briskly looking for empty chairs fred george and ginny if you just take those seats at the back remus can stay with you 
 
 she harry ron and hermione proceeded up to the very top deck where there were two unoccupied chairs at the very front of the bus and two at the back stan shunpike the conductor followed harry and ron eagerly to the back heads turned as harry passed and when he sat down he saw all the faces flick back to the front again 
 
 as harry and ron handed stan eleven sickles each the bus set off again swaying ominously it rumbled around grimmauld place weaving on and off the pavement then with another tremendous bang they were all flung backwards chair toppled right over and pigwidgeon who had been on his lap burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down on to shoulder instead harry who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket looked out of the window they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway 
 
 just outside birmingham said stan happily answering unasked question as ron struggled up from the floor you keepin well then arry i seen your name in the paper loads over the summer but it never nuffink very nice i said to ern i said e seem like a nutter when we met im just goes to show dunnit 
 
 he handed over their tickets and continued to gaze enthralled at harry apparently stan did not care how nutty somebody was if they were famous enough to be in the paper the knight bus swayed alarmingly overtaking a line of cars on the inside looking towards the front of the bus harry saw hermione cover her eyes with her hands pigwidgeon swaying happily on her shoulder 
 
 bang 
 
 chairs slid backwards again as the knight bus jumped from the birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bends hedgerows on either side of the road were leaping out of their way as they mounted the verges from here they moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hills then to a windswept road between flats each time with a loud bang 
 
 changed my mind muttered ron picking himself up from the floor for the sixth time i never want to ride on this thing again 
 
 listen ogwarts stop after this said stan brightly swaying towards them that bossy woman up front oo got on with you given us a little tip to move you up the queue just gonna let madam marsh off first thoughthere was a retching sound from downstairs followed by a horrible spattering noise not feeling er best 
 
 a few minutes later the knight bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub which squeezed itself out of the way to avoid a collision they could hear stan ushering the unfortunate madam marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmurings of her fellow passengers on the second deck the bus moved on again gathering speed until 
 
 bang 
 
 they were rolling through a snowy hogsmeade harry caught a glimpse of the head down its side street the severed head sign creaking in the wintry wind flecks of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus at last they rolled to a halt outside the gates to hogwarts 
 
 lupin and tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage then got off to say goodbye harry glanced up at the three decks of the knight bus and saw all the passengers staring down at them noses flat against the windows 
 
 be safe once in the grounds said tonks casting a careful eye around at the deserted road have a good term ok 
 
 look after yourselves said lupin shaking hands all round and reaching harry last and listen he lowered his voice while the rest of them exchanged goodbyes with tonks harry i know you like snape but he is a superb occlumens and we allsirius includedwant you to learn to protect yourself so work hard all right 
 
 yeah all right said harry heavily looking up into prematurely lined face see you then 
 
 the six of them struggled up the slippery drive towards the castle dragging their trunks hermione was already talking about knitting a few elf hats before bedtime harry glanced back when they reached the oaken front doors the knight bus had already gone and he given what was coming the following evening that he was still on board 
 
 harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening his morning lesson did nothing to dispel his trepidation as snape was as unpleasant as ever his mood was further lowered by the da members constantly approaching him in the corridors between classes asking hopefully if there would be a meeting that night 
 
 let you know in the usual way when the next one is harry said over and over again but i do it tonight got to go toerremedial potions 
 
 you take remedial potions asked zacharias smith superciliously having cornered harry in the entrance hall after lunch good lord you must be terrible snape usually give extra lessons does he 
 
 as smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion ron glared after him 
 
 shall i jinx him i can still get him from here he said raising his wand and taking aim between shoulder blades 
 
 forget it said harry dismally what going to think it that really stup 
 
 hi harry said a voice behind him he turned round and found cho standing there 
 
 oh said harry as his stomach leapt uncomfortably hi 
 
 be in the library harry said hermione firmly as she seized ron above the elbow and dragged him off towards the marble staircase 
 
 had a good christmas asked cho 
 
 yeah not bad said harry 
 
 mine was pretty quiet said cho for some reason she was looking rather embarrassed erm another hogsmeade trip next month did you see the notice 
 
 what oh no i checked the noticeboard since i got back 
 
 yes on valentines day 
 
 right said harry wondering why she was telling him this well i suppose you want to 
 
 only if you do she said eagerly 
 
 harry stared he had been about to say i suppose you want to know when the next da meeting is but her response did not seem to fit 
 
 ier he said 
 
 oh ok if you she said looking mortified worry see you around 
 
 she walked away harry stood staring after her his brain working frantically then something clunked into place 
 
 cho heycho 
 
 he ran after her catching her halfway up the marble staircase 
 
 want to come into hogsmeade with me on day 
 
 oooh yes she said blushing crimson and beaming at him 
 
 right well settled then said harry and feeling that the day was not going to be a complete loss after all he virtually bounced off to the library to pick up ron and hermione before their afternoon lessons 
 
 by six that evening however even the glow of having successfully asked out cho chang could not lighten the ominous feelings that intensified with every step harry took towards office 
 
 he paused outside the door when he reached it wishing he were almost anywhere else then taking a deep breath he knocked and entered 
 
 the shadowy room was lined with shelves bearing hundreds of glass jars in which slimy bits of animals and plants were suspended in variously coloured potions in one corner stood the cupboard full of ingredients that snape had once accused harrynot without reasonof robbing attention was drawn towards the desk however where a shallow stone basin engraved with runes and symbols lay in a pool of candlelight harry recognised it at onceit was pensieve wondering what on earth it was doing there he jumped when cold voice came out of the shadows 
 
 shut the door behind you potter 
 
 harry did as he was told with the horrible feeling that he was imprisoning himself when he turned back into the room snape had moved into the light and was pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk harry sat down and so did snape his cold black eyes fixed unblinkingly upon harry dislike etched in every line of his face 
 
 well potter you know why you are here he said the headmaster has asked me to teach you occlumency i can only hope that you prove more adept at it than at potions 
 
 right said harry tersely 
 
 this may not be an ordinary class potter said snape his eyes narrowed malevolently but i am still your teacher and you will therefore call me sir or professor at all times 
 
 yes sir said harry 
 
 snape continued to survey him through narrowed eyes for a moment then said now occlumency as i told you back in your dear kitchen this branch of magic seals the mind against magical intrusion and influence 
 
 and why does professor dumbledore think i need it sir said harry looking directly into eyes and wondering whether snape would answer 
 
 snape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptuously surely even you could have worked that out by now potter the dark lord is highly skilled at legilimency 
 
 that sir 
 
 it is the ability to extract feelings and memories from another mind 
 
 he can read minds said harry quickly his worst fears confirmed 
 
 you have no subtlety potter said snape his dark eyes glittering you do not understand fine distinctions it is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable 
 
 snape paused for a moment apparently to savour the pleasure of insulting harry before continuing 
 
 only muggles talk of the mind is not a book to be opened at will and examined at leisure thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls to be perused by any invader the mind is a complex and thing potter or at least most minds are he smirked it is true however that those who have mastered legilimency are able under certain conditions to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly the dark lord for instance almost always knows when somebody is lying to him only those skilled at occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie and so can utter falsehoods in his presence without detection 
 
 whatever snape said legilimency sounded like to harry and he like the sound of it at all 
 
 so he could know what thinking right now sir 
 
 the dark lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them said snape time and space matter in magic potter eye contact is often essential to legilimency 
 
 well then why do i have to learn occlumency 
 
 snape eyed harry tracing his mouth with one long thin finger as he did so 
 
 the usual rules do not seem to apply with you potter the curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the dark lord the evidence suggests that at times when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable when you are asleep for instanceyou are sharing the dark thoughts and emotions the headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue he wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the dark lord 
 
 heart was pumping fast again none of this added up 
 
 but why does professor dumbledore want to stop it he asked abruptly i like it much but been useful it i mean i saw that snake attack mr weasley and if i professor dumbledore have been able to save him would he sir 
 
 snape stared at harry for a few moments still tracing his mouth with his finger when he spoke again it was slowly and deliberately as though he weighed every word 
 
 it appears that the dark lord has been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotions and sharing his thoughts without his being any the wiser however the vision you had shortly before christmas 
 
 the one with the snake and mr weasley 
 
 do not interrupt me potter said snape in a dangerous voice as i was saying the vision you had shortly before christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the dark thoughts 
 
 i saw inside the head not his 
 
 i thought i just told you not to interrupt me potter 
 
 but harry did not care if snape was angry at last he seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business he had moved forwards in his chair so that without realising it he was perched on the very edge tense as though poised for flight 
 
 how come i saw through the eyes if thoughts sharing 
 
 do not say the dark name spat snape 
 
 there was a nasty silence they glared at each other across the pensieve 
 
 professor dumbledore says his name said harry quietly 
 
 dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard snape muttered while he may feel secure enough to use the name the rest of us he rubbed his left forearm apparently unconsciously on the spot where harry knew the dark mark was burned into his skin 
 
 i just wanted to know harry began again forcing his voice back to politeness why 
 
 you seem to have visited the mind because that was where the dark lord was at that particular moment snarled snape he was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too 
 
 and volhe realised i was there 
 
 it seems so said snape coolly 
 
 how do you know said harry urgently is this just professor dumbledore guessing or 
 
 i told you said snape rigid in his chair his eyes slits to call me sir 
 
 yes sir said harry impatiently but how do you know 
 
 it is enough that we know said snape repressively the important point is that the dark lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings he has also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse that is to say he has realised that he might be able to access your thoughts and feelings in return 
 
 and he might try and make me do things asked harry sir he added hurriedly 
 
 he might said snape sounding cold and unconcerned which brings us back to occlumency 
 
 snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robes and harry tensed in his chair but snape merely raised the wand to his temple and placed its tip into the greasy roots of his hair when he withdrew it some silvery substance came away stretching from temple to wand like a thick gossamer strand which broke as he pulled the wand away from it and fell gracefully into the pensieve where it swirled neither gas nor liquid twice more snape raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin then without offering any explanation of his behaviour he picked up the pensieve carefully removed it to a shelf out of their way and returned to face harry with his wand held at the ready 
 
 stand up and take out your wand potter 
 
 harry got to his feet feeling nervous they faced each other with the desk between them 
 
 you may use your wand to attempt to disarm me or defend yourself in any other way you can think of said snape 
 
 and what are you going to do harry asked eyeing wand apprehensively 
 
 i am about to attempt to break into your mind said snape softly we are going to see how well you resist i have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the imperius curse you will find that similar powers are needed for this brace yourself now legilimens 
 
 snape had struck before harry was ready before he had even begun to summon any force of resistance the office swam in front of his eyes and vanished image after image was racing through his mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings 
 
 he was five watching dudley riding a new red bicycle and his heart was bursting with jealousy he was nine and ripper the bulldog was chasing him up a tree and the dursleys were laughing below on the lawn he was sitting under the sorting hat and it was telling him he would do well in slytherin hermione was lying in the hospital wing her face covered with thick black hair a hundred dementors were closing in on him beside the dark lake cho chang was drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe 
 
 no said a voice inside head as the memory of cho drew nearer not watching that not watching it private 
 
 he felt a sharp pain in his knee office had come back into view and he realised that he had fallen to the floor one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of desk he looked up at snape who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist there was an angry weal there like a scorch mark 
 
 did you mean to produce a stinging hex asked snape coolly 
 
 no said harry bitterly getting up from the floor 
 
 i thought not said snape watching him closely you let me get in too far you lost control 
 
 did you see everything i saw harry asked unsure whether he wanted to hear the answer 
 
 flashes of it said snape his lip curling to whom did the dog belong 
 
 my aunt marge harry muttered hating snape 
 
 well for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been said snape raising his wand once more you managed to stop me eventually though you wasted time and energy shouting you must remain focused repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand 
 
 trying said harry angrily but not telling me how 
 
 manners potter said snape dangerously now i want you to close your eyes 
 
 harry threw him a filthy look before doing as he was told he did not like the idea of standing there with his eyes shut while snape faced him carrying a wand 
 
 clear your mind potter said cold voice let go of all emotion 
 
 but anger at snape continued to pound through his veins like venom let go of his anger he could as easily detach his legs 
 
 not doing it potter you will need more discipline than this focus now 
 
 harry tried to empty his mind tried not to think or remember or feel 
 
 go again on the count of three onetwothreelegilimens 
 
 a great black dragon was rearing in front of him his father and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror cedric diggory was lying on the ground with blank eyes staring at him 
 
 nooooooo 
 
 harry was on his knees again his face buried in his hands his brain aching as though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull 
 
 get up said snape sharply get up you are not trying you are making no effort you are allowing me access to memories you fear handing me weapons 
 
 harry stood up again his heart thumping wildly as though he had really just seen cedric dead in the graveyard snape looked paler than usual and angrier though not nearly as angry as harry was 
 
 iammaking aneffort he said through clenched teeth 
 
 i told you to empty yourself of emotion 
 
 yeah well finding that hard at the moment harry snarled 
 
 then you will find yourself easy prey for the dark lord said snape savagely fools who wear their hearts proudly on their sleeves who cannot control their emotions who wallow in sad memories and allow themselves to be provoked so easilyweak people in other wordsthey stand no chance against his powers he will penetrate your mind with absurd ease potter 
 
 i am not weak said harry in a low voice fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack snape in a moment 
 
 then prove it master yourself spat snape control your anger discipline your mind we shall try again get ready now legilimens 
 
 he was watching uncle vernon hammering the letterbox shut a hundred dementors were drifting across the lake in the grounds towards him he was running along a windowless passage with mr weasley they were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the end of the corridor harry expected to go through it but mr weasley led him off to the left down a flight of stone steps 
 
 i know i know 
 
 he was on all fours again on office floor his scar was prickling unpleasantly but the voice that had just issued from his mouth was triumphant he pushed himself up again to find snape storing at him his wand raised it looked as though this time snape had lifted the spell before harry had even tried to fight back 
 
 what happened then potter he asked eyeing harry intently 
 
 i sawi remembered harry panted just realised 
 
 realised what asked snape sharply 
 
 harry did not answer at once he was still savouring the moment of blinding realisation as he rubbed his forehead 
 
 he had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for months without once realising that it was a real place now seeing the memory again he knew that all along he had been dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with mr weasley on the twelfth of august as they hurried to the courtrooms in the ministry it was the corridor leading to the department of mysteries and mr weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by snake 
 
 he looked up at snape 
 
 in the department of mysteries 
 
 what did you say snape asked quietly and harry saw with deep satisfaction that snape was unnerved 
 
 i said in the department of mysteries sir harry said 
 
 and why said snape slowly would you ask such a thing 
 
 because said harry watching face closely that corridor just been dreaming about it for just recognised itit leads to the department of mysteries and i think voldemort wants something from 
 
 i have told you not to say the dark name 
 
 they glared at each other scar seared again but he did not care snape looked agitated but when he spoke again he sounded as though he was trying to appear cool and unconcerned 
 
 there are many things in the department of mysteries potter few of which you would understand and none of which concern you do i make myself plain 
 
 yes harry said still rubbing his prickling scar which was becoming more painful 
 
 i want you back here same time on wednesday we will continue work then 
 
 fine said harry he was desperate to get out of office and find ron and hermione 
 
 you are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep empty it make it blank and calm you understand 
 
 yes said harry who was barely listening 
 
 and be warned potter i shall know if you have not practised 
 
 right harry mumbled he picked up his schoolbag swung it over his shoulder and hurried towards the office door as he opened it he glanced back at snape who had his back to harry and was scooping his own thoughts out of the pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head harry left without another word closing the door carefully behind him his scar still throbbing painfully 
 
 harry found ron and hermione in the library where they were working on most recent ream of homework other students nearly all of them sat at tables nearby noses close to books quills scratching feverishly while the sky outside the mullioned windows grew steadily blacker the only other sound was the slight squeaking of one of madam shoes as the librarian prowled the aisles menacingly breathing down the necks of those touching her precious books 
 
 harry felt shivery his scar was still aching he felt almost feverish 
 
 when he sat down opposite ron and hermione he caught sight of himself in the window opposite he was very white and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual 
 
 how did it go hermione whispered and then looking concerned are you all right harry 
 
 yeah fine i dunno said harry impatiently wincing as pain shot through his scar again listen just realised something 
 
 and he told them what he had just seen and deduced 
 
 so so are you saying whispered ron as madam pince swept past squeaking slightly that the weaponthe thing afteris in the ministry of magic 
 
 in the department of mysteries got to be harry whispered i saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him 
 
 hermione let out a long slow sigh 
 
 of course she breathed 
 
 of course what said ron rather impatiently 
 
 ron think about it sturgis podmore was trying to get through a door at the ministry of magic it must have been that one too much of a coincidence 
 
 how come sturgis was trying to break in when on our side said ron 
 
 well i know hermione admitted that is a bit odd 
 
 so in the department of mysteries harry asked ron has your dad ever mentioned anything about it 
 
 i know they call the people who work in there unspeakables said ron frowning because no one really seems to know what they doweird place to have a weapon 
 
 not weird at all it makes perfect sense said hermione it will be something top secret that the ministry has been developing i expect harry are you sure all right 
 
 for harry had just run both his hands hard over his forehead as though trying to iron it 
 
 yeah fine he said lowering his hands which were trembling i just feel a bit i like occlumency much 
 
 i expect anyone would feel snaky if had their mind attacked over and over again said hermione sympathetically look get back to the common room be a bit more comfortable there 
 
 but the common room was packed and full of shrieks of laughter and excitement fred and george were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise 
 
 headless hats shouted george as fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching students two galleons each watch fred now 
 
 fred swept the hat on to his head beaming for a second he merely looked rather stupid then both hat and head vanished 
 
 several girls screamed but everyone else was roaring with laughter 
 
 and off again shouted george and hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder then his head reappeared as he swept the hat from it 
 
 how do those hats work then said hermione distracted from her homework and watching fred and george closely i mean obviously some kind of invisibility spell but rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object imagine the charm have a very long life though 
 
 harry did not answer he was feeling ill 
 
 going to have to do this tomorrow he muttered pushing the books he had just taken out of his bag back inside it 
 
 well write it in your homework planner then said hermione encouragingly so you forget 
 
 harry and ron exchanged looks as he reached into his bag withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively 
 
 leave it till later you big chided the book as harry scribbled down homework hermione beamed at it 
 
 i think go to bed said harry stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got 
 
 he walked across the common room dodging george who tried to put a headless hat on him and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boys dormitories he was feeling sick again just as he had the night he had had the vision of the snake but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right 
 
 he opened the door of his dormitory and was one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head he did not know where be was whether he was standing or lying down he did not even know his own name 
 
 maniacal laughter was ringing in his ears he was happier than he had been in a very long time jubilant ecstatic triumphant a wonderful wonderful thing had happened 
 
 harry harry 
 
 someone had hit him around the face the insane laughter was punctuated with a cry of pain the happiness was draining out of him but the laughter continued 
 
 he opened his eyes and as he did so he became aware that the wild laughter was coming out of his own mouth the moment he realised this it died away harry lay panting on the floor staring up at the ceiling the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly ron was bending over him looking very worried 
 
 what happened he said 
 
 i dunno harry gasped sitting up again really happy really happy 
 
 is 
 
 something happened mumbled harry he was shaking as badly as he had done after seeing the snake attack mr weasley and felt very sick something been hoping for 
 
 the words came just as they had back in the gryffindor changing room as though a stranger was speaking them through mouth yet he knew they were true he took deep breaths willing himself not to vomit all over ron he was very glad that dean and seamus were not here to watch this time 
 
 hermione told me to come and check on you said ron in a low voice helping harry to his feet she says your defences will be low at the moment after been fiddling around with your mind still i suppose help in the long run it he looked doubtfully at harry as he helped him towards his bed harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillows aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening his scar still prickling painfully he could not help feeling that his first foray into occlumency had weakened his resistance rather than strengthening it and he wondered with a feeling of great trepidation what had happened to make lord voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen years 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter sectumsempracontents prev chapter next chapter 
 exhausted but delighted with his work harry told ron and hermione everything that had happened during next charms lesson having first cast the muffliato spell upon those nearest them they were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of slughorn and positively awed when he told them about horcruxes and promise to take harry along should he find another one 
 
 wow said ron when harry had finally finished telling them everything ron was waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing wow actually going to go with dumbledore and try and destroy wow 
 
 ron making it snow said hermione patiently grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which sure enough large white flakes had started to fall lavender brown harry noticed glared at hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes and hermione immediately let go of arm 
 
 oh yeah said ron looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise sorry looks like all got horrible dandruff now 
 
 he brushed some of the fake snow off shoulder lavender burst into tears ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her 
 
 we split up he told harry out of the corner of his mouth last night when she saw me coming out of the dormitory with hermione obviously she see you so she thought it had just been the two of us 
 
 ah said harry wellyou mind over do you 
 
 no ron admitted it was pretty bad while she was yelling but at least i have to finish it 
 
 coward said hermione though she looked amused well it was a bad night for romance all around ginny and dean split up too harry 
 
 harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could he asked how come 
 
 oh something really silly she said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole like she climb in herself but been a bit rocky for ages 
 
 harry glanced over at dean on the other side of the classroom he certainly looked unhappy 
 
 of course this puts you in a bit of a dilemma it said hermione 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 the quidditch team said hermione if ginny and dean speaking 
 
 ohoh yeah said harry 
 
 flitwick said ron in a warning tone the tiny little charms master was bobbing his way toward them and hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine her glass flask was full of deep crimson liquid whereas the contents of and were still murky brown 
 
 now now boys squeaked professor flitwick reproachfully a little less talk a little more action let me see you try 
 
 together they raised their wands concentrating with all their might and pointed them at their flasks vinegar turned to ice flask exploded 
 
 yes for homework said professor flitwick reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat practice 
 
 they had one of their rare joint free periods after charms and walked back to the common room together ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with lavender and hermione seemed cheery too though when asked what she was grinning about she simply said a nice day neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside brain 
 
 sister 
 
 but ditched dean 
 
 still sister 
 
 his best mate 
 
 make it worse 
 
 if i talked to him first 
 
 hit you 
 
 what if i care 
 
 your best mate 
 
 harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room and only vaguely registered the small group of clustered together there until hermione cried katie back are you okay 
 
 harry stared it was indeed katie bell looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends 
 
 really well she said happily they let me out of st on monday i had a couple of days at home with mum and dad and then came back here this morning leanne was just telling me about mclaggen and the last match harry 
 
 yeah said harry well now back and fit have a decent chance of thrashing ravenclaw which means we could still be in the running for the cup listen katie 
 
 he had to put the question to her at once his curiosity even drove ginny temporarily from his brain he dropped his voice as friends started gathering up their things apparently they were late for transfiguration 
 
 that necklace can you remember who gave it to you now 
 
 no said katie shaking her head ruefully been asking me but i got a clue the last thing i remember was walking into the ladies in the three broomsticks 
 
 you definitely went into the bathroom then said hermione 
 
 well i know i pushed open the door said katie so i suppose whoever imperiused me was standing just behind it after that my a blank until about two weeks ago in st listen better go i put it past mcgonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back 
 
 she caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends leaving harry ron and hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them 
 
 so it must have been a girl or a woman who gave katie the necklace said hermione to be in the ladies bathroom 
 
 or someone who looked like a girl or a woman said harry forget there was a cauldron full of polyjuice potion at hogwarts we know some of it got stolen 
 
 in his eye he watched a parade of crabbes and goyles prance past all transformed into girls 
 
 i think going to take another swig of felix said harry and have a go at the room of requirement again 
 
 that would be a complete waste of potion said hermione flatly putting down the copy of syllabary she had just taken out of her bag luck can only get you so far harry the situation with slughorn was different you always had the ability to persuade him you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit luck enough to get you through a powerful enchantment though go wasting the rest of that potion need all the luck you can get if dumbledore takes you along with him she dropped her voice to a whisper 
 
 we make some more ron asked harry ignoring hermione be great to have a stock of it have a look in the book 
 
 harry pulled his copy of advanced out of his bap and looked up felix felicis 
 
 blimey seriously complicated he said running an eye down the list of ingredients and it takes six months got to let it stew 
 
 typical said ron 
 
 harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down turning to it he saw the sectumsempra spell captioned for enemies that he had marked a few weeks previously he had still not found out what it did mainly because he did not want to test it around hermione but he was considering trying it out on mclaggen next time he came up behind him unawares 
 
 the only person who was not particularly pleased to see katie bell back at school was dean thomas because he would no longer be required to fill her place as chaser he took the blow stoically enough when harry told him merely grunting and shrugging but harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that dean and seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back 
 
 the following fortnight saw the best quidditch practices harry had known as captain his team was so pleased to be rid of mclaggen so glad to have katie back at last that they were flying extremely well 
 
 ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with dean on the contrary she was the life and soul of the team her imitations of ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the quaffle sped toward him or of harry bellowing orders at mclaggen before being knocked out cold kept them all highly amused harry laughing with the others was glad to have an innocent reason to look at ginny he had received several more bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the snitch 
 
 the battle still raged inside his head ginny or ron sometimes he thought that the ron might not mind too much if he asked ginny out but then he remembered expression when he had seen her kissing dean and was sure that ron would consider it base treachery if harry so much as held her hand 
 
 yet harry could not help himself talking to ginny laughing with her walking back from practice with her however much his conscience ached he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own it would have been ideal if slughorn had given another of his little parties for ron would not be aroundbut unfortunately slughorn seemed to have given them up once or twice harry considered asking for help but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face he thought he caught it sometimes when hermione spotted him staring at ginny or laughing at her jokes and to complicate matters he had the nagging worry that if he do it somebody else was sure to ask ginny out soon he and ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good 
 
 all in all the temptation to take another gulp of felix felicis was becoming stronger by the day for surely this was a case for as hermione put it tweaking the circumstances the balmy days slid gently through may and ron seemed to be there at shoulder every time he saw ginny harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few seconds there seemed no chance of either while the final quidditch game of the season was looming ron wanted to talk tactics with harry all the time and had little thought for anything else 
 
 ron was not unique in this respect interest in the game was running extremely high throughout the school for the match would decide the championship which was still wide open if gryffindor beat ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points a tall order and yet harry had never known his team to fly better then they would win the championship if they won by less than three hundred points they would come second to ravenclaw if they lost by a hundred points they would be third behind hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred they would be in fourth place and nobody harry thought would ever ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained gryffindor to their first defeat in two centuries 
 
 the to this crucial match had all the usual features members of rival houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors unpleasant chants about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up somehow the game had become inextricably linked in mind with success or failure in his plans for ginny he could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud party might be just as good as a hearty swig of felix felicis 
 
 in the midst of all his preoccupations harry had not forgotten his other ambition finding out what malfoy was up to in the room of requirement he was still checking the map and as he was unable to locate malfoy on it deduced that malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room although harry was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the room of requirement he attempted it whenever he was in the vicinity but no matter how he reworded his request the wall remained firmly doorless 
 
 a few days before the match against ravenclaw harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again and hermione having dashed off to see professor vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last arithmancy essay more out of habit than anything harry made his usual detour along the corridor checking the map as he went for a moment he could not find malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the room of requirement again but then he saw tiny labeled dot standing in a boys bathroom on the floor below accompanied not by crabbe or goyle but by moaning myrtle 
 
 harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor the loud crash brought him out of his reverie hurrying from the scene lest filch turn up he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below outside the bathroom he pressed his ear against the door he could not hear anything he very quietly pushed the door open 
 
 draco malfoy was standing with his back to the door his hands clutching either side of the sink his head bowed 
 
 crooned moaning voice from one of the cubicles tell me wrong i can help you 
 
 no one can help me said malfoy his whole body was shaking i do it i it work and unless i do it soon he says kill me 
 
 and harry realized with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot that malfoy was cryingactually cryingtears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin malfoy gasped and gulped and then with a great shudder looked up into mirror and saw harry staring at him over his shoulder 
 
 malfoy wheeled around drawing his wand instinctively harry pulled out his own hex missed harry by inches shattering the lamp on the wall beside him harry threw himself sideways thought levicorpus and flicked his wand but malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another 
 
 no no stop it squealed moaning myrtle her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room stop stop 
 
 there was a loud bang and the bin behind harry exploded harry attempted a curse that backfired off the wall behind ear and smashed the cistern beneath moaning myrtle who screamed loudly water poured everywhere and harry slipped as malfoy his face contorted cried cruci 
 
 sectumsempra bellowed harry from the floor waving his wand wildly 
 
 blood spurted from face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword he staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash his wand falling from his limp right hand 
 
 no gasped harry 
 
 slipping and staggering harry got to his feet and plunged toward malfoy whose face was now shining scarlet his white hands scrabbling at his chest 
 
 noi 
 
 harry did not know what he was saying he fell to his knees beside malfoy who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood moaning myrtle let out a deafening scream 
 
 murder murder in the bathroom murder 
 
 the door banged open behind harry and he looked up terrified snape had burst into the room his face livid pushing harry roughly aside he knelt over malfoy drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds curse had made muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song the flow of blood seemed to ease snape wiped the residue from face and repeated his spell now the wounds seemed to be knitting 
 
 harry was still watching horrified by what he had done barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water moaning myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead when snape had performed his for the third time he malfoy into a standing position 
 
 you need the hospital wing there may be a certain amount of scarring but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that come 
 
 he supported malfoy across the bathroom turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury and you potter you wait here for me 
 
 it did not occur to harry for a second to disobey he stood up slowly shaking and looked down at the wet floor there were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface he could not even find it in himself to tell moaning myrtle to be quiet as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment 
 
 snape returned ten minutes later he stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him 
 
 go he said to myrtle and she swooped back into her toilet at once leaving a ringing silence behind her 
 
 i mean it to happen said harry at once his voice echoed in the cold watery space i know what that spell did 
 
 but snape ignored this apparently i underestimated you potter he said quietly who would have thought you knew such dark magic who taught you that spell 
 
 iread about it somewhere 
 
 where 
 
 it wasa library book harry invented wildly i remember what it was call 
 
 liar said snape throat went dry he knew what snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it 
 
 the bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes he struggled to block out all thought but try as he might the copy of advanced swam hazily to the forefront of his mind 
 
 and then he was staring at snape again in the midst of this wrecked soaked bathroom he stared into black eyes hoping against hope that snape had not seen what he feared but 
 
 bring me your schoolbag said snape softly and all of your schoolbooks all of them bring them to me here now 
 
 there was no point arguing harry turned at once and splashed out of the bathroom once in the corridor he broke into a run toward gryffindor tower most people were walking the other way they gaped at him drenched in water and blood but he answered none of the questions fired at him as he ran past 
 
 he felt stunned it was as though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage what had the prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book and what would happen when snape saw it would he tell stomach churnedhow harry had been achieving such good results in potions all year would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught harry so much the book that had become a kind of guide and friend harry could not let it happen he could not 
 
 you why are you soaking is that blood 
 
 ron was standing at the top of the stairs looking bewildered at the sight of harry 
 
 i need your book harry panted your potions book quick give it to me 
 
 but what about the 
 
 explain later 
 
 ron pulled his copy of advanced out of his bag and handed it over harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room here he seized his schoolbag ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had already finished their dinner threw himself back out of the portrait hole and hurtled off along the corridor 
 
 he skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls closed his eyes and began to walk 
 
 i need a place to hide my book i need a place to hide my book i need a place to hide my book 
 
 three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall when he opened his eyes there it was at last the door to the room of requirement harry wrenched it open flung himself inside and slammed it shut 
 
 he gasped despite his haste his panic his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom he could not help but be overawed by what he was looking at he was standing in a room the size of a large cathedral whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls built of what harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of hogwarts inhabitants there were alleyways and roads bordered by tetering piles of broken and damaged furniture stowed away perhaps to hide the evidence of mishandled magic or else hidden by there were thousands and thousands of books no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen there were winged catapults and fanged frisbees some still with enough life in them to hover over the mountains of other forbidden items there were chipped bottles of congealed potions hats jewels cloaks there were what looked like dragon eggshells corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly several rusting swords and a heavy bloodstained axe 
 
 harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure he turned right past an enormous stuffed troll ran on a short way took a left at the broken vanishing cabinet in which montague had got lost the previous year finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface he opened one of the creaking doors it had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died its skeleton had five legs he stuffed the book behind the cage and slammed the door he paused for a moment his heart thumping horribly gazing around at all the clutter would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statues head to make it more distinctive then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go back to the door back out onto the corridor where he slammed the door behind him and it turned at once back into stone 
 
 harry ran toward the bathroom on the floor below cramming copy of advanced into his bag as he did so a minute later he was back in front of snape who held out his hand wordlessly for schoolbag harry handed it over panting a searing pain in his chest and waited 
 
 one by one snape extracted books and examined them finally the only book left was the potions book which he looked at very carefully before speaking 
 
 this is your copy of advanced is it potter 
 
 yes said harry still breathing hard 
 
 quite sure of that are you potter 
 
 yes said harry with a touch more defiance 
 
 this is the copy of advanced that you purchased from flourish and blotts 
 
 yes said harry firmly 
 
 then why asked snape does it have the name roonil wazlib written inside the front cover 
 
 heart missed a beat my nickname he said 
 
 your nickname repeated snape 
 
 yeah what my friends call me said harry 
 
 i understand what a nickname is said snape the cold black eyes were boring once more into he tried not to look into them close your mind close your mind but he had never learned how to do it properly 
 
 do you know what i think potter said snape very quietly i think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every saturday until the end of term what do you think potter 
 
 ii agree sir said harry still refusing to look into eyes 
 
 well we shall see how you feel after your detentions said snape ten saturday morning potter my office 
 
 but sir said harry looking up desperately quidditch the last match of the 
 
 ten whispered snape with a smile that showed his yellow teeth poor gryffindor fourth place this year i fear 
 
 and he left the bathroom without another word leaving harry to stare into the cracked mirror feeling sicker he was sure than ron had ever felt in his life 
 
 i say i told you so said hermione an hour later in the common room 
 
 leave it hermione said ron angrily 
 
 harry had never made it to dinner he had no appetite at all he had just finished telling ron hermione and ginny what had happened not that there seemed to have been much need the news had traveled very fast apparently moaning myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by pansy parkinson who had lost no time in vilifying harry far and wide and snape had told the staff precisely what had happened harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of professor mcgonagall who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly punishment of detention every saturday until the end of term 
 
 i told you there was something wrong with that prince person hermione said evidently unable to stop herself and i was right i 
 
 no i think you were said harry stubbornly 
 
 he was having a bad enough time without hermione lecturing him the looks on the gryffindor faces when he had told them he would not be able to play on saturday had been the worst punishment of all he could feel eyes on him now but did not meet them he did not want to see disappointment or anger there he had just told her that she would be playing seeker on saturday and that dean would be rejoining the team as chaser in her place perhaps if they won ginny and dean would make up during the euphoria the thought went through harry like an icy knife 
 
 harry said hermione how can you still stick up for that book when that spell 
 
 will you stop harping on about the book snapped harry the prince only copied it out not like he was advising anyone to use it for all we know he was making a note of something that had been used against him 
 
 i believe this said hermione actually defending 
 
 not defending what i did said harry quickly i wish i done it and not just because got about a dozen detentions you know i used a spell like that not even on malfoy but you blame the prince he written try this out really was just making notes for himself he not for anyone else 
 
 are you telling me said hermione that going to go back 
 
 and get the book yeah i am said harry forcefully listen without the prince never have won the felix felicis never have known how to save ron from poisoning never have 
 
 got a reputation for potions brilliance you deserve said hermione nastily 
 
 give it a rest hermione said ginny and harry was so amazed so grateful he looked up by the sound of it malfoy was trying to use an unforgivable curse you should be glad harry had something good up his sleeve 
 
 well of course glad harry cursed said hermione clearly stung but you call that sectumsempra spell good ginny look where landed him and have thought seeing what this has done to your chances in the match 
 
 oh start acting as though you understand quidditch snapped ginny only embarrass yourself 
 
 harry and ron stared hermione and ginny who had always got on together very well were now sitting with their arms folded glaring in opposite directions ron looked nervously at harry then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it harry however little though he knew he deserved it felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening 
 
 his lightheartedness was there were slytherin taunts to be endured next day not to mention much anger from fellow gryffindors who were most unhappy that their captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season by saturday morning whatever he might have told hermione harry would have gladly exchanged all the felix felicis in the world to be walking down to the quidditch pitch with ron ginny and the others it was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan 
 
 ah potter said snape when harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that snape despite teaching floors above now had not vacated it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls ominously there were many boxes piled on a table where harry was clearly supposed to sit they had an aura of tedious hard and pointless work about them 
 
 mr filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files said snape softly they are the records of other hogwarts wrongdoers and their punishments where the ink has grown faint or the cards have suffered damage from mice we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and making sure that they are in alphabetical order replace them in the boxes you will not use magic 
 
 right professor said harry with as much contempt as he could put into the last three syllables 
 
 i thought you could start said snape a malicious smile on his lips with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and you will find some familiar names in there which should add interest to the task here you see 
 
 he pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read james potter and sirius black apprehended using an illegal hex upon bertram aubrey head twice normal size double detention snape sneered it must be such a comforting thing that though they are gone a record of their great achievements remains 
 
 harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him 
 
 it was as harry had anticipated useless boring work punctuated as snape had clearly planned with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or names usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds occasionally accompanied by those of remus lupin and peter pettigrew and while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments he wondered what was going on outside where the match would have just started ginny playing seeker against cho 
 
 harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall it seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock perhaps snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly he could not have been here for only half an hour an hour an hour and a half 
 
 stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve snape who had not spoken at all since setting harry his task finally looked up at ten past one 
 
 i think that will do he said coldly mark the place you have reached you will continue at ten next saturday 
 
 yes sir 
 
 harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before snape could change his mind racing back up the stone steps straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch but all was quiet it was over then 
 
 he hesitated outside the crowded great hall then ran up the marble staircase whether gryffindor had won or lost the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room 
 
 quid agis he said tentatively to the fat lady wondering what he would find inside 
 
 her expression was unreadable as she replied see 
 
 and she swung forward 
 
 a roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him several hands pulled him into the room 
 
 we won yelled ron bounding into sight and brandishing the silver cup at harry we won four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty we won 
 
 harry looked around there was ginny running toward him she had a hard blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him and without thinking without planning it without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching harry kissed her 
 
 after several long momentsor it might have been half an houror possibly several sunlit daysthey broke apart the room had gone very quiet then several people and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling harry looked over the top of head to see dean thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand and romilda vane looking as though she might throw something hermione was beaming but eyes sought ron at last he found him still clutching the cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head for a fraction of a second they looked at each other then ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that harry understood to mean wellif you must 
 
 the creature in his chest roaring in triumph he grinned down at ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole a long walk in the grounds seemed indicated during whichif they had timethey might discuss the match

lionfish nov chapter the wandmakercontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 it was like sinking into an old nightmare for an instant harry knelt again beside dumbledores body at the foot of the tallest tower at hogwarts but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled upon the grass pierced by bellatrixs silver knife harrys voice was still saying dobbydobby even though he knew that the elf had gone where he could not call him back 
 
 after a minute or so he realized that they had after all come to the right place for here were bill and fleur dean and luna gathering around him as he knelt over the elf hermione he said suddenly where is she 
 
 rons taken her inside said bill shell be all right harry looked back down at dobby he stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elfs body then dragged off his own jacket and covered dobby in it like a blanket 
 
 the sea was rushing against the rock somewhere nearby harry listened to it while the others talked discussing matters in which he could take no interest making decisions dean carried the injured griphook into the house fleur hurrying with them now bill was really knowing what he was saying as he did so he gazed down at the tiny body and his scar prickled and burned and in one part of his mind viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope he saw voldemort punishing those they had left behind at the malfoy manor his rage was dreadful and yet harrys grief for dobby seemed to diminish it so that it became a distant storm that reached harry from across a vast silent ocean 
 
 i want to do it properly were the first words of which harry was fully conscious of speaking not by magic have you got a spade and shortly afterward he had set to work alone digging the grave in the place that bill had shown him at the end of the garden between bushes he dug with a kind of fury relishing the manual work glorying in the of it for every drop of his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives 
 
 his scar burned but he was master of the pain he felt it yet was apart from it he had learned control at last learned to shut his mind to voldemort the very thing dumbledore had wanted him to learn from snape just as voldemort had not been able to possess harry while harry was consumed with grief for sirius so his thoughts could not penetrate harry now while he mourned dobby grief it seemed drove voldemort outthough dumbledore of course would have said that it was love 
 
 on harry dug deeper and deeper into the hard cold earth subsuming his grief in sweat denying the pain in his scar in the darkness with nothing but the sound of his own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company the things that had happened at the malfoys returned to him the things he had heard came back to him and understanding blossomed in the darkness 
 
 the steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts hallowshorcruxeshallowshorcruxesyet no longer burned with that weird obsessive longing loss and fear had snuffed it out he felt as though he had been slapped awake again 
 
 deeper and deeper harry sank into the grave and he knew where voldemort had been tonight and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of nurmengard and why 
 
 and he thought of wormtail dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercydumbledore had foreseen thathow much more had he known 
 
 harry lost track of time he knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when he was rejoined by ron and dean hows hermione 
 
 better said ron fleurs looking after her harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect grave with his wand but he did not need it they jumped down into the hole he had made with spades of their own and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough 
 
 harry wrapped the elf more snuggly in his jacket ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks which he placed on the elfs bare feet dean produced a woolen hat which harry placed carefully upon dobbys head muffling his batlike ears we should close his eyes 
 
 harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness bill was wearing a traveling cloak fleur a large white apron from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what harry recognized to be hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown pale and unsteady on her feet ron put an arm around her when she reached him luna who was huddled in one of fleurs coats crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elfs eyelids sliding them over his glassy stare there she said softly now he could be sleeping 
 
 harry placed the elf into the grave arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body he forced himself not to break down as he remembered dumbledores funeral and the rows and rows of golden chairs and the minister of magic in the front row the recitation of dumbledores achievements the stateliness of the white marble tomb he felt that dobby deserved just as grand a funeral and yet here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole i think we ought to say something piped up luna ill go first shall i 
 
 and as everybody looked at her she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave thank you so much dobby for rescuing me from that cellar its so unfair that you had to die when you were so good and brave ill always remember what you did for us i hope youre happy now 
 
 she turned and looked expectingly at ron who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice yeahthanks dobby 
 
 thanks muttered dean harry swallowed good bye dobby he said it was all he could manage but luna had said it all for him bill raised his wand and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it a small reddish mound dya mind if i stay here a moment he asked the others 
 
 they murmured words he did not catch he felt gentle pats upon his back and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage leaving harry alone beside the elf 
 
 he looked around there were a number of large white stones smoothed by the sea marking the edge of the flower beds he picked up one of the largest and laid it pillowlike over the place where dobbys head now rested he then felt in his pocket for a wand there were two in there he had forgotten lost track he could not now remember whose wands these were he seemed to remember wrenching them out of someones hand he selected the shorter of the two which felt friendlier in his hand and pointed it at the rock 
 
 slowly under his murmured instruction deep cuts appeared upon the rocks surface he knew that hermione could have done it more neatly and probably more quickly but he wanted to mark the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave when harry stood up again the stone read here lies dobby a free elf 
 
 he looked at his handiwork for a few more seconds then walked away his scar still prickling a little and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave ideas that had taken shape in the darkness ideas both fascinating and terrible 
 
 they were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall their attention focused upon bill who was talking the room was pretty with a small fire of driftwood burning brightly in the fireplace harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet so he stood in the doorway listening 
 
 lucky that ginnys on holiday if shed been at hogwarts they could have taken her before we reached her now we know shes safe too he looked around and saw harry standing there ive been getting them all out of the burrow he explained moved them to muriels the death eaters know rons with you now theyre bound to target the family c dont apologize he added at the sight of harrys expression it was always a matter of time dads been saying so for months were the biggest blood traitor family there is 
 
 how are they protected asked harry fidelius charm dads and weve done it on this cottage too im here none of us can go to work but thats hardly the most important thing now once ollivander and griphook are well enough well move them to muriels too there isnt much room here but shes got plenty griphooks legs are on the mend fleurs given him could probably move them in an hour or c 
 
 no harry said and bill looked startled i need both of them here i need to talk to them its important he heard the authority of his own voice the conviction the voice of purpose that had come to him as he dug dobbys grave all of their faces were turned toward him looking puzzled 
 
 im going to wash harry told bill looking down at his hands still covered with mud and dobbys blood then ill need to see them straight away he walked into the little kitchen to the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea dawn was breaking over the horizon shell pink and faintly gold as he washed again following the train of thought that had come to him in the dark garden 
 
 dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar but harry knew what he had seen a piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment and then help had come help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it 
 
 harry dried his hands impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sitting room he looked out over the ocean and felt closer this dawn than ever before closer to the heart of it all 
 
 and still his scar prickled and he knew that voldemort was getting there too harry understood and yet did not understand his instinct was telling him one thing his brain quite another the dumbledore in harrys head smiled surveying harry over the tips of his fingers pressed together as if in prayer 
 
 you gave ron the deluminatoryou understood himyou gave him a way back 
 
 and you understood wormtail tooyou knew there was a bit of regret there somewhere 
 
 and if you knew themwhat did you know about me dumbledore 
 
 am i meant to know but not to seek did you know how hard id feel that is that why you made it this difficult so id have time to work that out 
 
 harry stood quite still eyes glazed watching the place where a bright gold ray of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon then he looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily surprised to see the cloth he was holding in them he set it down and returned to the hall and as he did so he felt his scar pulse angrily and then flashed across his mind swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over water the outline of a building he knew extremely well 
 
 bill and fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs 
 
 i need to speak to griphook and ollivander harry said 
 
 no said fleur you will ave to wait arry zey are both too tired c 
 
 im sorry he said without heat but it cant wait i need to talk to them now privately c and separately its urgent 
 
 harry what the hells going on asked bill you turn up here with a dead and a goblin hermione looks as though shes been tortured and rons just refused to tell me anything c 
 
 we cant tell you what were doing said harry flatly youre in the order bill you know dumbledore left us a mission were not supposed to talk about it to anyone else 
 
 fleur made an impatient noise but bill did not look at her he was staring at harry his deeply scarred face was hard to read finally bill said all right who do you want to talk to first 
 
 harry hesitated he knew what hung on his decision there was hardly any time left now was the moment to decide horcruxes or hallows 
 
 griphook harry said ill speak to griphook first 
 
 his heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle 
 
 up here then said bill leading the way 
 
 harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back 
 
 i need you two as well he called to ron and hermione who had been skulking half concealed in the doorway of the sitting room 
 
 they both moved into the light looking oddly relieved 
 
 how are you harry asked hermione you were amazing c coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that c 
 
 hermione gave a weak smile as ron gave her a squeeze 
 
 what are we doing now harry he asked 
 
 youll see come on 
 
 harry ron and hermione followed bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing three doors led off it 
 
 in here said bill opening the door into his and fleurs room it too had a view of the sea now flecked with gold in the sunrise harry moved to the window turned his back on the spectacular view and waited his arms folded his scar prickling hermione took the chair beside the dressing table ron sat on the arm 
 
 bill reappeared carrying the little goblin whom he set down carefully upon the bed griphook grunted thanks and bill left closing the door upon them all 
 
 im sorry to take you out of bed said harry how are your legs 
 
 painful replied the goblin but mending 
 
 he was still clutching the sword of gryffindor and wore a strange look half truculent half intrigued harry noted the goblins sallow skin his long thin fingers his black eyes fleur had removed his shoes his long feet were dirty he was larger than a but not by much his domed head was much bigger than a humans 
 
 you probably dont remember c harry began 
 
 c that i was the goblin who showed you to your vault the first time you ever visited gringotts said griphook i remember harry potter even amongst goblins you are very famous 
 
 harry and the goblin looked at each other sizing each other up harrys scar was still prickling he wanted to get through this interview with griphook quickly and at the same time was afraid of making a false move while he tried to decide on the best way to approach his request the goblin broke the silence 
 
 you buried the elf he said sounding unexpectedly rancorous i watched you from the window of the bedroom next door 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes 
 
 you are an unusual wizard harry potter 
 
 in what way asked harry rubbing his scar absently 
 
 you dug the grave 
 
 so 
 
 griphook did not answer harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a muggle but it did not matter to him whether griphook approved of dobbys grave or not he gathered himself for the attack 
 
 griphook i need to ask c 
 
 you also rescued a goblin 
 
 what 
 
 you brought me here saved me 
 
 well i take it youre not sorry said harry a little impatiently 
 
 no harry potter said griphook and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his chin but you are a very odd wizard 
 
 right said harry well i need some help griphook and you can give it to me 
 
 the goblin made no sign of encouragement but continued to frown at harry as though he had never seen anything like him 
 
 i need to break into a gringotts vault 
 
 harry had not meant to say it so badly the words were forced from him as pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw again the outline of hogwarts he closed his mind firmly he needed to deal with griphook first ron and hermione were staring at harry as though he had gone mad 
 
 harry c said hermione but she was cut off by griphook 
 
 break into a gringotts vault repeated the goblin wincing a little as he shifted his position upon the bed it is impossible 
 
 no it isnt ron contradicted him its been done 
 
 yeah said harry the same day i first met you griphook my birthday seven years ago 
 
 the vault in question was empty at the time snapped the goblin and harry understood that even though griphook had let gringotts he was offended at the idea of its defenses being breached its protection was minimal 
 
 well the vault we need to get into isnt empty and im guessing its protection will be pretty powerful said harry it belongs to the lestranges 
 
 he saw hermione and ron look at each other astonished but there would be time enough to explain after griphook had given his answer 
 
 you have no chance said griphook flatly no chance at all if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never yours c 
 
 thief you have been warned beware c yeah i know i remember said harry but im not trying to get myself any treasure im not trying to take anything for personal gain can you believe that 
 
 the goblin looked slantwise at harry and the lightning scar on harrys forehead prickled but he ignored it refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation 
 
 if there was a wizard of whom i would believe that they did not seek personal gain said griphook finally it would be you harry potter goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the respect that you have shown this night not from 
 
 repeated harry the phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled as voldemort turned his thoughts northward and as harry burned to question ollivander next door 
 
 the right to carry a wand said the goblin quietly has long been contested between wizards and goblins 
 
 well goblins can do magic without wands said ron 
 
 that is immaterial wizards refuse to share the secrets of with other magical beings they deny us the possibility of extending our powers 
 
 well goblins wont share any of their magic either said ron you wont tell us how to make swords and armor the way you do goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have never c 
 
 it doesnt matter said harry noting griphooks rising color this isnt about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magical creature c 
 
 griphook gave a nasty laugh 
 
 but it is it is precisely that as the dark lord becomes ever more powerful your race is set still more firmly above mine gringotts falls under wizarding rule are slaughtered and who amongst the protests 
 
 we do said hermione she had sat up straight her eyes bright we protest and im hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf griphook im a mudblood 
 
 dont call yourself c ron muttered 
 
 why shouldnt i said hermione mudblood and proud of it ive got no higher position under this new order than you have griphook it was me they chose to torture back at the malfoys 
 
 as she spoke she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut bellatrix had made scarlet against her throat 
 
 did you know that it was harry who set dobby free she asked did you know that weve wanted elves to be freed for years ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of hermiones chair you cant want defeated more than we do griphook 
 
 the goblin gazed at hermione with the same curiousity he had shown harry 
 
 what do you seek within the lestranges vault he asked abruptly the sword that lies inside it is a fake this is the real one he looked from one to the other of them i think that you already know this you asked me to lie for you back there 
 
 but the fake sword isnt the only thing in that vault is it asked harry perhaps youve seen other things in there 
 
 his heart was pounding harder than ever he redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his scar 
 
 the goblin twisted his beard around his finger again 
 
 it is against our code to speak of the secrets of gringotts we are the guardians of fabulous treasures we have a duty to the objects placed in our care which were so often wrought by our fingers 
 
 the goblin stroked the sword and his black eyes roved from harry to hermione to ron and then back again 
 
 so young he said finally to be fighting so many 
 
 will you help us said harry we havent got a hope of breaking in without a goblins help youre our one chance 
 
 i shall think about it said griphook maddeningly 
 
 but c ron started angrily hermione nudged him in the ribs 
 
 thank you said harry 
 
 the goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement then flexed his short legs 
 
 i think he said settling himself ostentatiously upon bill and fleurs bed that the has finished its work i may be able to sleep at last forgive me 
 
 yeah of course said harry but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the sword of gryffindor from beside the goblin griphook did not protest but harry thought he saw resentment in the goblins eyes as he closed the door upon him 
 
 little git whispered ron hes enjoying keeping us hanging 
 
 harry whispered hermione pulling them both away from the door into the middle of the landing are you saying what i think youre saying are you saying theres a horcrux in the lestranges vault 
 
 yes said harry bellatrix was terrified when she thought wed been in there she was beside herself why what did she think wed seen what else did she think we might have taken something she was petrified would find out about 
 
 but i thought we were looking for places been places hes done something important said ron looking baffled was he ever inside the lestranges vault 
 
 i dont know whether he was ever inside gringotts said harry he never had gold there when he was younger because nobody left him anything he would have seen the bank from the outside though the first time he ever went to diagon alley 
 
 harrys scar throbbed but he ignored it he wanted ron and hermione to understand about gringotts before they spoke to ollivander 
 
 i think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a gringotts vault i think hed have seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the wizarding world and dont forget he trusted bellatrix and her husband they were his most devoted servants before he fell and they went looking for him after he vanished he said it might he came back i heard him 
 
 harry rubbed his scar 
 
 i dont think hed have told bellatrix it was a horcrux though he never told lucius malfoy the truth about the diary he probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it in her vault the safest place in the world for anything you want to hide hagrid told me except for hogwarts 
 
 when harry had finished speaking ron shook his head 
 
 you really understand him 
 
 bits of him said harry bits i just wish id understood dumbledore as much but well see come on c ollivander now 
 
 ron and hermione looked bewildered but very impressed as they followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the door opposite bill and fleurs a weak come in answered them 
 
 the wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window he had been held in the cellar for more than a year and tortured harry knew on at least one occasion he was emaciated the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin his great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets the hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton harry sat down on the empty bed beside ron and hermione the rising sun was not visible here the room faced the garden and the freshly dug grave 
 
 mr ollivander im sorry to disturb you harry said 
 
 my dear boy ollivanders voice was feeble you rescued us i thought we would die in that place i can never thank you never thank you enough 
 
 we were glad to do it 
 
 harrys scar throbbed he knew he was certain that there was hardly any time left in which to beat voldemort to his goal or else to attempt to thwart him he felt a flutter of panic yet he had made his decision when he chose to speak to griphook first feigning a calm he did not feel he groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand 
 
 mr ollivander i need some help 
 
 anything anything said the wandmaker weakly 
 
 can you mend this is it possible 
 
 ollivander held out a trembling hand and harry placed the two barely connected halves in his palm 
 
 holly and phoenix feather said ollivander in a tremulous voice eleven inches nice and supple 
 
 yes said harry can you c 
 
 no whispered ollivander i am sorry very sorry but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that i know of 
 
 harry had been braced to hear it but it was a blow nevertheless he took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch around his neck ollivander stared at the place where the shattered wand had vanished and did not look away until harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the malfoys 
 
 can you identify these harry asked 
 
 the wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes rolling it between his fingers flexing it slightly 
 
 walnut and dragon heartstring he said inches unyielding this wand belonged to bellatrix lestrange 
 
 and this one 
 
 ollivander performed the same examination 
 
 hawthorn and unicorn hair ten inches precisely reasonably springy this was the wand of draco malfoy 
 
 was repeated harry isnt it still his 
 
 perhaps not if you took it c 
 
 c i did c 
 
 c then it may be yours of course the manner of taking matters much also depends upon the wand itself in general however where a wand has been won its allegiance will change 
 
 there was a silence in the room except for the distant rushing of the sea 
 
 you talk about wands like theyve got feelings said harry like they can think for themselves 
 
 the wand chooses the wizard said ollivander that much has always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore 
 
 a person can still use a wand that hasnt chosen them though asked harry 
 
 oh yes if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any instrument the best results however must always come where there is the strongest affinity between wizard and wand these connections are complex an initial attraction and then a mutual quest for experience the wand learning from the wizard the wizard from the wand 
 
 the sea gushed forward and backward it was a mournful sound 
 
 i took this wand from draco malfoy by force said harry can i use it safely 
 
 i think so subtle laws govern wand ownership but the conquered wand will usually bend its will to its new master 
 
 so i should use this one said ron pulling wormtails wand out of his pocket and handing it to ollivander 
 
 chestnut and dragon heartstring inches brittle i was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping for peter pettigrew yes if you won it it is more likely to do your bidding and do it well than another wand 
 
 and this holds true for all wands does it asked harry 
 
 i think so replied ollivander his protuberant eyes upon harrys face you ask deep questions mr potter wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic 
 
 so it isnt necessary to kill the previous owner to take the possession of a wand asked harry 
 
 ollivander swallowed 
 
 necessary no i should not say that it is necessary to kill 
 
 there are legends though said harry and as his heart rate quickened the pain in his scar became more intense he was sure that voldemort has decided to put his idea into action legends about a wand c or wands c that have been passed from hand to hand by murder 
 
 ollivander turned pale against the snowy pillow he was light gray and his eyes were enormous bloodshot and bulging with what looked like fear 
 
 only one wand i think he whispered 
 
 and is interested in it isnt he asked harry 
 
 i c how croaked ollivander and he looked appealingly at ron and hermione for help how do you know this 
 
 he wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands said harry 
 
 ollivander looked terrified 
 
 he tortured me you must understand that the cruciatus curse i c i had no choice but to tell him what i knew what i guessed 
 
 i understand said harry you told him about the twin cores you said he just had to borrow another wizards wand 
 
 ollivander looked horrified transfixed by the amount that harry knew he nodded slowly 
 
 but it didnt work harry went on mine still beat the borrowed wand do you know why that is 
 
 ollivander shook his head slowly as he had just nodded 
 
 i had never heard of such a thing your wand performed something unique that night the connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare yet why your wand would have snapped the borrowed wand i do not know 
 
 we were talking about the other wand the wand that changes hands by murder when realized my wand had done something strange he came back and asked about that other wand didnt he 
 
 how do you know this 
 
 harry did not answer 
 
 yes he asked whispered ollivander he wanted to know everything i could tell him about the wand variously known as the deathstick the wand of destiny or the elder wand 
 
 harry glanced sideways at hermione she looked flabbergasted 
 
 the dark lord said ollivander in hushed and frightened tones had always been happy with the wand i made him c yes and phoenix feather inches c until he discovered the connection of the twin cores now he seeks another more powerful wand as the only way to conquer yours 
 
 but hell know soon if he doesnt already that mines broken beyond repair said harry quietly 
 
 no said hermione sounding frightened he cant know that harry how could he c 
 
 priori incantatem said harry we left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the malfoys hermione if they examine them properly make them the spells theyve cast lately theyd see that yours broke mine theyll see that you tried and failed to mend it and theyll realize that ive been using the blackthorn one ever since 
 
 the little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face ron gave harry a reproachful look and said lets not worry about that now c 
 
 but mr ollivander intervened 
 
 the dark lord no longer seeks the elder wand only for your destruction mr potter he is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable 
 
 and will it 
 
 the owner of the elder wand must always fear attack said ollivander but the idea of the dark lord in possession of the deathstick is i must admit formidable 
 
 harry was suddenly reminded of how unsure when they first met of how much he liked ollivander even now having been tortured and imprisoned by voldemort the idea of the dark wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him 
 
 you c you really think this wand exists then mr ollivander asked hermione 
 
 oh yes said ollivander yes it is perfectly possible to trace the wands course through history there are gaps of course and long ones where it vanishes from view temporarily lost or hidden but always it resurfaces it has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize there are written accounts some of them obscure that i and other wandmakers have made it our business to study they have the ring of authenticity 
 
 so you c you dont think it can be a fairy tale or a myth hermione asked hopefully 
 
 no said ollivander whether it needs to pass by murder i do not know its history is bloody but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object and arouses such passions in wizards immensely powerful dangerous in the wrong hands and an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands 
 
 mr ollivander said harry you told that gregorovitch had the elder wand didnt you 
 
 ollivander turned if possible even paler he looked ghostly as he gulped 
 
 but how c how do you c 
 
 never mind how i know it said harry closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and he saw for mere seconds a vision of the main street in hogsmeade still dark because it was so much farther north you told that gregorovitch had the wand 
 
 it was a rumor whispered ollivander a rumor years and years ago long before you were born i believe gregorovitch himself started it you can see how good it would be for business that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the elder wand 
 
 yes i can see that said harry he stood up mr ollivander one last thing and then well let you get some rest what do you know about the deathly hallows 
 
 the c the what asked the wandmaker looking utterly bewildered 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 
 im afraid i dont know what youre talking about is this still something to do with wands 
 
 harry looked into the sunken face and believed that ollivander was not acting he did not know about the hallows 
 
 thank you said harry thank you very much well leave you to get some rest now 
 
 ollivander looked stricken 
 
 he was torturing me he gasped the cruciatus curse you have no idea 
 
 i do said harry i really do please get some rest thank you for telling me all of this 
 
 
 
 
 he led ron and hermione down the staircase harry caught glimpses of bill fleur luna and dean sitting at the table in the kitchen cups of tea in front of them they all looked up at harry as he appeared in the doorway but he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden ron and hermione behind him the reddish mound of earth that covered dobby lay ahead and harry walked back to it as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully it was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him but he knew that he would have to resist only a little longer he would yield very soon because he needed to know that his theory was right he must make only one more short effort so that he could explain to ron and hermione 
 
 gregorovitch had the elder wand a long time ago he said i saw trying to find him when he tracked him down he found that gregorovitch didnt have it anymore it was stolen from him by grindelwald how grindelwald found out that gregorovitch had it i dont know c but if gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor it cant have been that difficult 
 
 
 
 
 voldemort was at the gates of hogwarts harry could see him standing there and see too the lamp bobbing in the coming closer and closer 
 
 
 
 
 and grindelwald used the elder wand to become powerful and at the height of his power when dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him he dueled grindelwald and beat him and he took the elder wand 
 
 dumbledore had the elder wand said ron but then c where is it now 
 
 at hogwarts said harry fighting to remain with them in the garden 
 
 but then lets go said ron urgently harry lets go and get it before he does 
 
 its too late for that said harry he could not help himself but clutched his head trying to help it resist he knows where it is hes there now 
 
 harry ron said furiously how long have you known this c why have we been wasting time why did you talk to griphook first we could have gone c we could still go c 
 
 no said harry and he sank to his knees in the grass hermiones right dumbledore didnt want me to have it he didnt want me to take it he wanted me to get the horcruxes 
 
 the unbeatable wand harry moaned ron 
 
 im not supposed to im supposed to get the horcruxes 
 
 
 
 
 and now everything was cool and dark the sun was barely visible over the horizon as he glided alongside snape up through the grounds toward the lake 
 
 i shall join you in the castle shortly he said in his high cold voice leave me now 
 
 snape bowed and set off back up the path his black cloak billowing behind him harry walked slowly waiting for snapes figure to disappear it would not do for snape or indeed anyone else to see where he was going but there were no lights in the castle windows and he could conceal himself and in a second he had cast upon himself a disillusionment charm that hid him even from his own eyes 
 
 and he walked on around the edge of the lake taking in the outlines of the beloved castle his first kingdom his birthright 
 
 and here it was beside the lake reflected in the dark waters the white marble tomb an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape he felt again that rush of controlled euphoria that heady sense of purpose in destruction he raised the old yew wand how fitting that this would be its last great act 
 
 the tomb split open from head to foot the shrouded figure was as long as thin as it had been in life he raised the wand again 
 
 the wrappings fell open the face was translucent pale sunken yet almost perfectly preserved they had left his spectacles on the crooked nose he felt amused derision dumbledores hands were folded upon his chest and there it lay clutched beneath them buried with him 
 
 had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand had he thought that the dark lord would be scared to violate his tomb the spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the wand from dumbledores grasp and as he took it a shower of sparks flew from its tip sparkling over the corpse of its last owner ready to serve a new master at last

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 ole the 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the world always going up and down and now i go up 
 any higher so said ole the most people have to try 
 both the ups and the downs and rightly considered we all get to 
 be watchmen at last and look down upon life from a height 
 
 such was the speech of ole my friend the old a 
 strange talkative old fellow who seemed to speak out everything that 
 came into his head and who for all that had many a serious thought 
 deep in his heart yes he was the child of respectable people and 
 there were even some who said that he was the son of a privy 
 councillor or that he might have been he had studied too and had 
 been assistant teacher and deputy clerk but of what service was all 
 that to him in those days he lived in the house and was to 
 have everything in the house to be at free quarters as the saying 
 is but he was still so to speak a fine young gentleman he wanted 
 to have his boots cleaned with patent blacking and the clerk could 
 only afford ordinary grease and upon that point they split one spoke 
 of stinginess the other of vanity and the blacking became the 
 black cause of enmity between them and at last they parted 
 
 this is what he demanded of the world in general namely patent 
 blacking and he got nothing but grease accordingly he at last 
 drew back from all men and became a hermit but the church tower is 
 the only place in a great city where hermitage office and bread can 
 be found together so he betook himself up thither and smoked his 
 pipe as he made his solitary rounds he looked upward and downward and had his own thoughts and told in his own way of what he read in books and in himself i often lent him books good books and you may know by the company he keeps he loved neither the english governess novels nor the french ones which he called a mixture of empty wind and he wanted biographies and descriptions of the wonders of the world i visited him at least once a year generally directly after new day and then he always spoke of this and that which the change of the year had put into his head 
 
 i will tell the story of three of these visits and will reproduce 
 his own words whenever i can remember them 
 
 first visit 
 among the books which i had lately lent ole was one which had 
 greatly rejoiced and occupied him it was a geological book 
 containing an account of the boulders 
 
 yes rare old fellows those boulders he said and 
 to think that we should pass them without noticing them and over 
 the street pavement the paving stones those fragments of the 
 oldest remains of antiquity one walks without ever thinking about 
 them i have done the very thing myself but now i look respectfully 
 at every many thanks for the book it has filled me with 
 thought and has made me long to read more on the subject the romance of the earth is after all the most wonderful of all romances a pity one read the first volume of it because it is written in a 
 language that we understand one must read in the different 
 strata in the for each separate period yes it is a 
 romance a very wonderful romance and we all have our place in it 
 we grope and ferret about and yet remain where we are but the ball 
 keeps turning without emptying the ocean over us the clod on which 
 we move about holds and does not let us through and then a 
 story that has been acting for thousands upon thousands of years and 
 is still going on my best thanks for the book about the boulders 
 those are fellows indeed they could tell us something worth 
 hearing if they only knew how to talk really a pleasure now and 
 then to become a mere nothing especially when a man is as highly 
 placed as i am and then to think that we all even with patent 
 lacquer are nothing more than insects of a moment on that 
 the earth though we may be insects with stars and garters places and 
 offices one feels quite a novice beside these venerable 
 boulders on last new eve i was reading the 
 book and had lost myself in it so completely that i forgot my 
 usual new diversion namely the wild hunt to amack ah you 
 know what that is 
 
 the journey of the witches on broomsticks is well enough known 
 that journey is taken on st eve to the brocken but we have a 
 wild journey also which is national and modern and that is the 
 journey to amack on the night of the new year all indifferent poets 
 and poetesses musicians newspaper writers and artistic 
 notabilities i mean those who are no good ride in the new 
 night through the air to amack they sit backwards on their painting 
 brushes or quill pens for steel pens bear them too 
 stiff as i told you i see that every new night and could 
 mention the majority of the riders by name but i should not like to 
 draw their enmity upon myself for they like people to talk 
 about their ride to amack on quill pens a kind of niece who 
 is a fishwife and who as she tells me supplies three respectable 
 newspapers with the terms of abuse and vituperation they use and 
 she has herself been at amack as an invited guest but she was carried 
 out thither for she does not own a quill pen nor can she ride she 
 has told me all about it half of what she said is not true but the 
 other half gives us information enough when she was out there the 
 festivities began with a song each of the guests had written his 
 own song and each one sang his own song for he thought that the 
 best and it was all one all the same melody then those came 
 marching up in little bands who are only busy with their mouths 
 
 there were ringing bells that rang alternately and then came the 
 little drummers that beat their tattoo in the family circle and 
 acquaintance was made with those who write without putting their 
 names which here means as much as using grease instead of patent 
 blacking and then there was the beadle with his boy and the boy 
 was worst off for in general he gets no notice taken of him then 
 too there was the good street sweeper with his cart who turns over 
 the and calls it good very good remarkably good and 
 in the midst of the pleasure that was afforded by the mere meeting 
 of these folks there shot up out of the great at amack a 
 stem a tree an immense flower a great mushroom a perfect roof 
 which formed a sort of warehouse for the worthy company for in it 
 hung everything they had given to the world during the old year out 
 of the tree poured sparks like flames of fire these were the ideas 
 and thoughts borrowed from others which they had used and which now got free and rushed away like so many fireworks they played at the stick burns and the young poets played at and the 
 witlings played off their jests and the jests rolled away with a 
 thundering sound as if empty pots were being shattered against doors 
 
 it was very amusing my niece said in fact she said many things 
 that were very malicious but very amusing but i mention them 
 for a man must be and not a carping critic but you will 
 easily perceive that when a man once knows the rights of the journey 
 to amack as i know them quite natural that on the new 
 night one should look out to see the wild chase go by if in the new 
 year i miss certain persons who used to be there i am sure to 
 notice others who are new arrivals but this year i omitted taking 
 my look at the guests i bowled away on the boulders rolled back 
 through millions of years and saw the stones break loose high up in 
 the north saw them drifting about on icebergs long before ark was constructed saw them sink down to the bottom of the sea and with a with that one that peered forth from the flood and said this shall be zealand i saw them become the 
 of birds that are unknown to us and then become the 
 seat of wild chiefs of whom we know nothing until with their axes 
 they cut their runic signs into a few of these stones which then came 
 into the calendar of time but as for me i had gone quite beyond 
 all lapse of time and had become a cipher and a nothing then three 
 or four beautiful falling stars came down which cleared the air 
 and gave my thoughts another direction you know what a falling star 
 is do you not the learned men are not at all clear about it i 
 have my own ideas about shooting stars as the common people in many parts call them and my idea is this how often are silent 
 thanksgivings offered up for one who has done a good and noble action 
 
 the thanks are often speechless but they are not lost for all that i 
 think these thanks are caught up and the sunbeams bring the silent 
 hidden thankfulness over the head of the benefactor and if it be a 
 whole people that has been expressing its gratitude through a long 
 lapse of time the thankfulness appears as a nosegay of flowers and 
 at length falls in the form of a shooting star over the good 
 grave i am always very much pleased when i see a shooting star 
 especially in the new night and then find out for whom the 
 gift of gratitude was intended lately a gleaming star fell in the 
 southwest as a tribute of thanksgiving to many many for whom was that star intended thought i it fell no doubt on the hill by 
 the bay of plensberg where the danebrog waves over the graves of 
 schleppegrell lasloes and their comrades one star also fell in 
 the midst of the land fell upon soro a flower on the grave of 
 holberg the thanks of the year from a great many thanks for his 
 charming plays 
 
 it is a great and pleasant thought to know that a shooting star 
 falls upon our graves on mine certainly none will fall no sunbeam 
 brings thanks to me for here there is nothing worthy of thanks i 
 shall not get the patent lacquer said ole for my fate on earth 
 is only grease after all 
 
 second visit 
 it was new day and i went up on the tower ole spoke of 
 the toasts that were drunk on the transition from the old year into 
 the new from one grave into the other as he said and he told me a 
 story about the glasses and this story had a very deep meaning it 
 was this 
 
 when on the new night the clock strikes twelve the people 
 at the table rise up with full glasses in their hands and drain these 
 glasses and drink success to the new year they begin the year with 
 the glass in their hands that is a good beginning for drunkards they 
 begin the new year by going to bed and a good beginning for 
 drones sleep is sure to play a great part in the new year and the 
 glass likewise do you know what dwells in the glass asked ole i 
 will tell you there dwell in the glass first health and then 
 pleasure then the most complete sensual delight and misfortune and 
 the bitterest woe dwell in the glass also now suppose we count the 
 glasses of course i count the different degrees in the glasses for 
 different people 
 
 you see the first glass the glass of health and in that 
 the herb of health is found growing put it up on the beam in the 
 ceiling and at the end of the year you may be sitting in the arbor of 
 health 
 
 if you take the second glass from this a little bird soars 
 upward twittering in guileless cheerfulness so that a man may listen 
 to his song and perhaps join in fair is life no downcast looks 
 take courage and march onward 
 
 out of the third glass rises a little winged urchin who cannot 
 certainly be called an angel child for there is goblin blood in his 
 veins and he has the spirit of a goblin not wishing to hurt or 
 harm you indeed but very ready to play off tricks upon you 
 sit at your ear and whisper merry thoughts to you creep into 
 your heart and warm you so that you grow very merry and become a wit so far as the wits of the others can judge 
 
 in the fourth glass is neither herb bird nor urchin in that 
 glass is the pause drawn by reason and one may never go beyond that sign 
 
 take the fifth glass and you will weep at yourself you will 
 feel such a deep emotion or it will affect you in a different way 
 out of the glass there will spring with a bang prince carnival nine 
 times and extravagantly merry draw you away with him 
 forget your dignity if you have any and forget more than 
 you should or ought to forget all is dance song and sound the masks will carry you away with them and the daughters of vanity clad in silk and satin will come with loose hair and alluring charms but tear yourself away if you can 
 
 the sixth glass yes in that glass sits a demon in the form 
 of a little well dressed attractive and very fascinating man who 
 thoroughly understands you agrees with you in everything and becomes quite a second self to you he has a lantern with him to give you light as he accompanies you home there is an old legend about a saint who was allowed to choose one of the seven deadly sins and who accordingly chose drunkenness which appeared to him the least but which led him to commit all the other six the blood is 
 mingled with that of the demon it is the sixth glass and with that 
 the germ of all evil shoots up within us and each one grows up with a 
 strength like that of the grains of and shoots up into a 
 tree and spreads over the whole world and most people have no choice but to go into the oven to be in a new form 
 
 the history of the glasses said the ole 
 
 and it can be told with lacquer or only with grease but i give it 
 you with both 
 
 third visit 
 on this occasion i chose the general for my visit 
 to ole for on that day it is anything but agreeable down in the 
 streets in the town for they are full of sweepings shreds and 
 remnants of all sorts to say nothing of the rubbish in which 
 one has to wade about but this time i happened to see two children 
 playing in this wilderness of sweepings they were playing at going 
 to bed for the occasion seemed especially favorable for this 
 sport they crept under the straw and drew an old bit of ragged 
 curtain over themselves by way of coverlet it was splendid they 
 said but it was a little too strong for me and besides i was 
 obliged to mount up on my visit to ole 
 
 to day he said streets and houses are like 
 a a large but content with a cartload i may 
 get something good out of that and i really did get something good 
 out of it once shortly after christmas i was going up the street 
 it was rough weather wet and dirty the right kind of weather to 
 catch cold in the dustman was there with his cart which was full 
 and looked like a sample of streets on at the back of 
 the cart stood a fir tree quite green still and with tinsel on its 
 twigs it had been used on christmas eve and now it was thrown out 
 into the street and the dustman had stood it up at the back of his 
 cart it was droll to look at or you may say it was mournful all 
 depends on what you think of when you see it and i thought about 
 it and thought this and that of many things that were in the cart or 
 i might have done so and that comes to the same thing there was an 
 old glove too i wonder what that was thinking of shall i 
 tell you the glove was lying there pointing with its little finger 
 at the tree sorry for the tree it thought and i was also 
 at the feast where the chandeliers glittered my life was so to 
 speak a ball night a pressure of the hand and i burst my memory 
 keeps dwelling upon that and i have really nothing else to live for 
 
 this is what the glove thought or what it might have thought 
 a stupid affair with yonder fir tree said the potsherds you see 
 potsherds think everything is stupid when one is in the 
 they said one ought not to give self airs and wear 
 tinsel i know that i have been useful in the world far more useful 
 than such a green stick this was a view that might be taken and i 
 think it quite a peculiar one but for all that the fir tree 
 looked very well it was like a little poetry in the and 
 truly there is dust enough in the streets on the way is 
 difficult and troublesome then and i feel obliged to run away out 
 of the confusion or if i am on the tower i stay there and look 
 down and it is amusing enough 
 
 there are the good people below playing at changing houses 
 they toil and tug away with their goods and chattels and the 
 household goblin sits in an old tub and moves with them all the 
 little griefs of the lodging and the family and the real cares and 
 sorrows move with them out of the old dwelling into the new and what gain is there for them or for us in the whole affair yes there was written long ago the good old maxim think on the great of death that is a serious thought i hope it is not disagreeable to you that i should have touched upon it death is the most certain messenger after all in spite of his various occupations yes death is the omnibus conductor and he is the passport writer and he countersigns our and he is director of the savings bank of life do you understand me all the deeds of our life the great and the little alike we put into this savings bank and when 
 death calls with his omnibus and we have to step in and drive with 
 him into the land of eternity then on the frontier he gives us our 
 as a pass as a provision for the journey he takes 
 this or that good deed we have done and lets it accompany us and 
 this may be very pleasant or very terrific nobody has ever escaped 
 the omnibus journey there is certainly a talk about one who was not 
 allowed to go they call him the wandering jew he has to ride 
 behind the omnibus if he had been allowed to get in he would have 
 escaped the clutches of the poets 
 
 just cast your eye into that great omnibus the society is 
 mixed for king and beggar genius and idiot sit side by side they 
 must go without their property and money they have only the 
 and the gift out of the savings bank with them but which of our deeds is selected and given to us perhaps quite a little 
 one one that we have forgotten but which has been recorded small as a pea but the pea can send out a blooming shoot the poor bumpkin who sat on a low stool in the corner and was jeered at and flouted will perhaps have his stool given him as a provision and the stool may become a litter in the land of eternity and rise up then as a throne gleaming like gold and blooming as an arbor he who always lounged about and drank the spiced draught of pleasure that he might forget the wild things he had done here will have his barrel given to him on the journey and will have to drink from it as they go on and the drink is bright and clear so that the thoughts remain pure and all good and noble feelings are awakened and he sees and feels what in life he could not or would not see and then he has within him the punishment the gnawing worm which will not die through time incalculable if on the glasses there stood written oblivion on the barrel remembrance is inscribed 
 
 when i read a good book an historical work i always think at 
 last of the poetry of what i am reading and of the omnibus of 
 death and wonder which of the deeds death took out of the 
 savings bank for him and what provisions he got on the journey into 
 eternity there was once a french king i have forgotten his name for 
 the names of good people are sometimes forgotten even by me but it will come back some day there was a king who during a famine 
 became the benefactor of his people and the people raised up to his 
 memory a monument of snow with the inscription quicker than this 
 melts didst thou bring help i fancy that death looking back upon 
 the monument gave him a single as provision a 
 that never melts and this flake floated over his royal 
 head like a white butterfly into the land of eternity thus too 
 there was louis xi i have remembered his name for one remembers what is bad a trait of him often comes into my thoughts and i wish one could say the story is not true he had his lord high constable 
 executed and he could execute him right or wrong but he had the 
 innocent children of the constable one seven and the other eight 
 years old placed under the scaffold so that the warm blood of their 
 father spurted over them and then he had them sent to the bastille 
 and shut up in iron cages where not even a coverlet was given them to protect them from the cold and king louis sent the executioner to them every week and had a tooth pulled out of the head of each 
 that they might not be too comfortable and the elder of the boys 
 said my mother would die of grief if she knew that my younger 
 brother had to suffer so cruelly therefore pull out two of my 
 teeth and spare him the tears came into the eyes but the 
 will was stronger than the tears and every week two little 
 teeth were brought to him on a silver plate he had demanded them and he had them i fancy that death took these two teeth out of the 
 savings bank of life and gave them to louis xi to carry with him 
 on the great journey into the land of immortality they fly before him 
 like two flames of fire they shine and burn and they bite him the 
 innocent teeth 
 
 yes a serious journey the omnibus ride on the great 
 and when is it to be undertaken just the serious 
 part of it any day any hour any minute the omnibus may draw up 
 which of our deeds will death take out of the savings bank and give 
 to us as provision let us think of the that is not 
 marked in the calendar

 book end of which does not resemble the beginning 
 chapter v 
 
 cosette after the letter 
 as cosette read she gradually fell into thought 
 at the very moment when she raised her eyes from the last line of the the handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate it was his hour cosette thought him hideous 
 she resumed her contemplation of the book 
 it was written in the most charming of chirography thought cosette in the same hand but with divers inks sometimes very black again whitish as when ink has been added to the inkstand and consequently on different days 
 it was then a mind which had unfolded itself there sigh by sigh irregularly without order without choice without object cosette had never read anything like it this manuscript in which she already perceived more light than obscurity produced upon her the effect of a sanctuary each one of these mysterious lines shone before her eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance 
 the education which she had received had always talked to her of the soul and never of love very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the flame this manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed to her all of love sorrow destiny life eternity the beginning the end 
 it was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her a handful of rays of light 
 in these few lines she felt a passionate ardent generous honest nature a sacred will an immense sorrow and an immense despair a suffering heart an ecstasy fully expanded 
 what was this manuscript 
 a letter a letter without name without address without date without signature pressing and disinterested an enigma composed of truths a message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth the of a phantom to a shade 
 it was an absent one tranquil and dejected who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the absent love his lady the secret of fate the key of life love 
 this had been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven these lines which had fallen one by one on the paper were what might be called drops of soul 
 now from whom could these pages come 
 who could have penned them 
 cosette did not hesitate a moment 
 one man only 
 he 
 day had dawned once more in her spirit all had reappeared she felt an joy and a profound anguish 
 it was he he who had written he was there it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing 
 while she was forgetful of him he had found her again 
 but had she forgotten him 
 no never 
 she was foolish to have thought so for a single moment 
 she had always loved him always adored him 
 the fire had been smothered and had smouldered for a time but she saw all plainly now it had but made headway and now it had burst forth afresh and had inflamed her whole being this was like a spark which had fallen from that other soul into hers 
 she felt the conflagration starting up once more 
 she imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript oh yes said she how perfectly i recognize all that 
 that is what i had already read in his eyes 
 as she was finishing it for the third time lieutenant theodule passed the gate once more and rattled his spurs upon the pavement 
 cosette was forced to raise her eyes 
 she thought him insipid silly stupid useless foppish displeasing impertinent and extremely ugly the officer thought it his duty to smile at her 
 she turned away as in shame and indignation 
 she would gladly have thrown something at his head 
 she fled the house and shut herself up in her chamber to peruse the manuscript once more to learn it by heart and to dream 
 when she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her bosom 
 all was over cosette had fallen back into deep seraphic love the abyss of eden had yawned once more 
 all day long cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment she scarcely thought her ideas were in the state of a tangled skein in her brain she could not manage to conjecture anything she hoped through a tremor what vague things 
 she dared make herself no promises and she did not wish to refuse herself anything flashes of pallor passed over her countenance and shivers ran through her frame 
 it seemed to her at intervals that she was entering the land of chimaeras she said to herself 
 is this reality then she felt of the dear paper within her bosom under her gown she pressed it to her heart she felt its angles against her flesh and if jean valjean had seen her at the moment he would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy which overflowed from beneath her yes she thought it is certainly he this comes from him and is for me 
 and she told herself that an intervention of the angels a celestial chance had given him back to her 
 oh transfiguration of love 
 oh dreams 
 that celestial chance that intervention of the angels was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief to another thief from the charlemagne courtyard to the ditch over the roofs of la force

 book eleven 
 chapter xxi 
 
 the russian troops were passing through moscow from two at night till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the last of the inhabitants who were leaving 
 the greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the stone moskva and yauza bridges 
 while the troops dividing into two parts when passing around the kremlin were thronging the moskva and the stone bridges a great many soldiers taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion turned back from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of vasili the beatified and under the borovitski gate back up the hill to the red square where some instinct told them they could easily take things not belonging to them crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales filled all the passages and alleys of the bazaar but there were no dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to enter there were no hawkers nor the usual motley crowd of female purchasers but only soldiers in uniforms and overcoats though without muskets entering the bazaar and silently making their way out through its passages with bundles tradesmen and their assistants of whom there were but few moved about among the soldiers quite bewildered they unlocked their shops and locked them up again and themselves carried goods away with the help their assistants on the square in front of the bazaar were drummers beating the muster call but the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the direction of the drum as formerly but made them on the contrary run farther away among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats with closely shaven heads two officers one with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean horse the other in an overcoat and on foot stood at the corner of ilyinka street talking a third officer galloped up to them 
 the general orders them all to be driven out at once without fail this is outrageous half the men have dispersed 
 where are you off to where he shouted to three infantrymen without muskets who holding up the skirts of their overcoats were slipping past him into the bazaar passage stop you rascals 
 but how are you going to stop them replied another officer there is no getting them together the army should push on before the rest bolt all 
 how can one push on they are stuck there wedged on the bridge and move we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from running away 
 come go in there and drive them out shouted the senior officer 
 the officer in the scarf dismounted called up a drummer and went with him into the arcade some soldiers started running away in a group a shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose and a calm persistent calculating expression on his plump face hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer swinging his arms 
 your honor said he be so good as to protect us we grudge trifles you are welcome to anything we shall be delighted pray fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman or even two pieces with pleasure for we feel how it is but all this sheer robbery if you please could not guards be placed if only to let us close the shop 
 several shopkeepers crowded round the officer 
 eh what twaddle said one of them a thin man when head is gone one weep for hair take what any of you like and flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the officer 
 all very well for you ivan sidorych to talk said the first tradesman angrily please step inside your honor 
 talk indeed cried the thin one in my three shops here i have a hundred thousand rubles worth of goods can they be saved when the army has gone eh what people against might our hands fight 
 come inside your honor repeated the tradesman bowing 
 the officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision 
 not my business he exclaimed and strode on quickly down one of the passages 
 from one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation and just as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was flung out violently 
 this man bent double rushed past the tradesman and the officer the officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops but at that moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the moskva bridge and the officer ran out into the square 
 what is it what is it he asked but his comrade was already galloping off past vasili the beatified in the direction from which the screams came 
 the officer mounted his horse and rode after him when he reached the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns the infantry crossing the bridge several overturned carts and frightened and laughing faces among the troops beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were harnessed four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels the cart was loaded high and at the very top beside a chair with its legs in the air sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate shrieks he was told by his fellow officers that the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that general ermolov coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the bridge the crowd crushing one another upsetting carts and shouting and squeezing desperately had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward

 book end of which does not resemble the beginning 
 chapter vi 
 
 old people are made to go out opportunely 
 when evening came jean valjean went out cosette dressed herself she arranged her hair in the most becoming manner and she put on a dress whose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much and which through this slope permitted a view of the beginning of her throat and was as young girls say a trifle indecent it was not in the least indecent but it was prettier than usual she made her toilet thus without knowing why she did so 
 did she mean to go out 
 no 
 was she expecting a visitor 
 no 
 at dusk she went down to the garden 
 toussaint was busy in her kitchen which opened on the back yard 
 she began to stroll about under the trees thrusting aside the branches from time to time with her hand because there were some which hung very low 
 in this manner she reached the bench 
 the stone was still there 
 she sat down and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though she wished to caress and thank it 
 all at once she experienced that indefinable impression which one undergoes when there is some one standing behind one even when she does not see the person 
 she turned her head and rose to her feet 
 it was he 
 his head was bare 
 he appeared to have grown thin and pale his black clothes were hardly discernible 
 the twilight threw a wan light on his fine brow and covered his eyes in shadows beneath a veil of incomparable sweetness he had something about him that suggested death and night 
 his face was illuminated by the light of the dying day and by the thought of a soul that is taking flight 
 he seemed to be not yet a ghost and he was no longer a man 
 he had flung away his hat in the thicket a few paces distant 
 cosette though ready to swoon uttered no cry 
 she retreated slowly for she felt herself attracted 
 he did not stir 
 by virtue of something ineffable and melancholy which enveloped him she felt the look in his eyes which she could not see 
 cosette in her retreat encountered a tree and leaned against it had it not been for this tree she would have fallen 
 then she heard his voice that voice which she had really never heard barely rising above the rustle of the leaves and murmuring 
 pardon me here i am 
 my heart is full 
 i could not live on as i was living and i have come 
 have you read what i placed there on the bench 
 do you recognize me at all 
 have no fear of me it is a long time you remember the day since you looked at me at the luxembourg near the gladiator 
 and the day when you passed before me 
 it was on the th of june and the d of july 
 it is nearly a year ago 
 i have not seen you for a long time 
 i inquired of the woman who let the chairs and she told me that she no longer saw you you lived in the rue de on the third floor in the front apartments of a new see that i know 
 i followed you what else was there for me to do 
 and then you disappeared i thought i saw you pass once while i was reading the newspapers under the arcade of the odeon 
 i ran after you 
 but no 
 it was a person who had a bonnet like yours 
 at night i came hither do not be afraid no one sees me 
 i come to gaze upon your windows near at hand 
 i walk very softly so that you may not hear for you might be alarmed 
 the other evening i was behind you you turned round i fled 
 once i heard you singing 
 i was happy did it affect you because i heard you singing through the shutters that could not hurt you 
 no it is not so 
 you see you are my angel 
 let me come sometimes i think that i am going to die if you only knew 
 i adore you 
 forgive me i speak to you but i do not know what i am saying i may have displeased you have i displeased you 
 oh my mother said she 
 and she sank down as though on the point of death 
 he grasped her she fell he took her in his arms he pressed her close without knowing what he was doing 
 he supported her though he was tottering himself 
 it was as though his brain were full of smoke lightnings darted between his lips his ideas vanished it seemed to him that he was accomplishing some religious act and that he was committing a profanation 
 moreover he had not the least passion for this lovely woman whose force he felt against his breast he was beside himself with love 
 she took his hand and laid it on her heart 
 he felt the paper there he stammered 
 you love me then 
 she replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more than a barely audible breath 
 hush 
 thou knowest it 
 and she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb and intoxicated young man 
 he fell upon the bench and she beside him 
 they had no words more the stars were beginning to gleam 
 how did it come to pass that their lips met 
 how comes it to pass that the birds sing that snow melts that the rose unfolds that may expands that the dawn grows white behind the black trees on the shivering crest of the hills 
 a kiss and that was all 
 both started and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes 
 they felt neither the cool night nor the cold stone nor the damp earth nor the wet grass they looked at each other and their hearts were full of thoughts 
 they had clasped hands unconsciously 
 she did not ask him she did not even wonder how he had entered there and how he had made his way into the garden 
 it seemed so simple to her that he should be there 
 from time to time marius knee touched knee and both shivered 
 at intervals cosette stammered a word 
 her soul fluttered on her lips like a drop of dew on a flower 
 little by little they began to talk to each other 
 effusion followed silence which is fulness 
 the night was serene and splendid overhead these two beings pure as spirits told each other everything their dreams their intoxications their ecstasies their chimaeras their weaknesses how they had adored each other from afar how they had longed for each other their despair when they had ceased to see each other 
 they confided to each other in an ideal intimacy which nothing could augment their most secret and most mysterious thoughts 
 they related to each other with candid faith in their illusions all that love youth and the remains of childhood which still lingered about them suggested to their minds their two hearts poured themselves out into each other in such wise that at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it was the young man who had the young soul and the young girl who had the young soul 
 each became permeated with the other they were enchanted with each other they dazzled each other 
 when they had finished when they had told each other everything she laid her head on his shoulder and asked him 
 what is your name 
 my name is marius said he 
 and yours 
 my name is cosette

 chapter xxii 
 
 meanwhile the city itself was deserted there was hardly anyone in the streets the gates and shops were all closed only here and there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard nobody drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard the povarskaya was quite still and deserted the huge courtyard of the rostovs house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the horses and not a soul was to be seen there in the great drawing room of the house which had been left with all it contained were two people they were the yard porter ignat and the page boy mishka grandson who had stayed in moscow with his grandfather mishka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with one finger the yard porter his arms akimbo stood smiling with satisfaction before the large mirror 
 it fine eh uncle ignat said the boy suddenly beginning to strike the keyboard with both hands 
 only fancy answered ignat surprised at the broadening grin on his face in the mirror 
 impudence impudence they heard behind them the voice of mavra kuzminichna who had entered silently how grinning the fat mug is that what here for cleared away down there and vasilich is worn out just you wait a bit 
 ignat left off smiling adjusted his belt and went out of the room with meekly downcast eyes 
 aunt i did it gently said the boy 
 give you something gently you monkey you cried mavra kuzminichna raising her arm threateningly go and get the samovar to boil for your grandfather 
 mavra kuzminichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it and with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door 
 going out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go next to drink tea in the servants wing with vasilich or into the storeroom to put away what still lay about 
 she heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street someone stopped at the gate and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it mavra kuzminichna went to the gate 
 who do you want 
 the count count ilya andreevich rostov 
 and who are you 
 an officer i have to see him came the reply in a pleasant russian voice 
 mavra kuzminichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen with the round face of a rostov entered the yard 
 they have gone away sir went away yesterday at vespertime said mavra kuzminichna cordially 
 the young officer standing in the gateway as if hesitating whether to enter or not clicked his tongue 
 ah how annoying he muttered i should have come yesterday ah what a pity 
 meanwhile mavra kuzminichna was attentively and sympathetically examining the familiar rostov features of the young face his tattered coat and boots 
 what did you want to see the count for she asked 
 oh well it be helped said he in a tone of vexation and placed his hand on the gate as if to leave 
 he again paused in indecision 
 you see he suddenly said i am a kinsman of the and he has been very kind to me as you see he glanced with an amused air and smile at his coat and boots my things are worn out and i have no money so i was going to ask the count 
 mavra kuzminichna did not let him finish 
 just wait a minute sir one little moment said she 
 and as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and hurrying away on her old legs went through the back yard to the servants quarters 
 while mavra kuzminichna was running to her room the officer walked about the yard gazing at his boots with lowered head and a faint smile on his lips what a pity missed uncle what a nice old woman where has she run off to and how am i to find the nearest way to overtake my regiment which must by now be getting near the rogozhski gate thought he just then mavra kuzminichna appeared from behind the corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look carrying a check kerchief in her hand while still a few steps from the officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white assignat and hastily handed it to him 
 if his excellency had been at home as a kinsman he would of course but as it is 
 mavra kuzminichna grew abashed and confused the officer did not decline but took the note quietly and thanked her 
 if the count had been at home mavra kuzminichna went on apologetically christ be with you sir may god preserve you said she bowing as she saw him out 
 swaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself the officer ran almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the yauza bridge to overtake his regiment 
 but mavra kuzminichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist eyes pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer

 book gavroche 
 chapter i 
 
 the malicious playfulness of the wind 
 since when the tavern of montfermeil was on the way to shipwreck and was being gradually engulfed not in the abyss of a bankruptcy but in the cesspool of petty debts the thenardier pair had had two other children both males 
 that made five two girls and three boys 
 madame thenardier had got rid of the last two while they were still young and very small with remarkable luck 
 got rid of is the word 
 there was but a mere fragment of nature in that woman 
 a phenomenon by the way of which there is more than one example extant 
 like the marechale de la the thenardier was a mother to her daughters only there her maternity ended 
 her hatred of the human race began with her own sons 
 in the direction of her sons her evil disposition was uncompromising and her heart had a lugubrious wall in that quarter 
 as the reader has seen she detested the eldest she cursed the other two 
 why 
 because 
 the most terrible of motives the most unanswerable of i have no need of a litter of squalling brats said this mother 
 let us explain how the thenardiers had succeeded in getting rid of their last two children and even in drawing profit from the operation 
 the woman magnon who was mentioned a few pages further back was the same one who had succeeded in making old gillenormand support the two children which she had had 
 she lived on the quai des celestins at the corner of this ancient street of the which afforded her the opportunity of changing her evil repute into good odor the reader will remember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts of the seine in paris years ago and of which science took advantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of inhalations of alum so beneficially replaced at the present day by the external tincture of iodine during this epidemic the magnon lost both her boys who were still very young one in the morning the other in the evening of the same day this was a blow 
 these children were precious to their mother they represented eighty francs a month 
 these eighty francs were punctually paid in the name of m gillenormand by collector of his rents m barge a retired in the rue du the children dead the income was at an end 
 the magnon sought an expedient in that dark of evil of which she formed a part everything is known all secrets are kept and all lend mutual aid magnon needed two children the thenardiers had two 
 the same sex the same age 
 a good arrangement for the one a good investment for the other 
 the little thenardiers became little magnons magnon quitted the quai des celestins and went to live in the rue clocheperce 
 in paris the identity which binds an individual to himself is broken between one street and another 
 the registry office being in no way warned raised no objections and the substitution was effected in the most simple manner in the world 
 only the thenardier exacted for this loan of her children ten francs a month which magnon promised to pay and which she actually did pay 
 it is unnecessary to add that m gillenormand continued to perform his compact 
 he came to see the children every six months 
 he did not perceive the change monsieur magnon said to him how much they resemble you 
 thenardier to whom avatars were easy seized this occasion to become jondrette 
 his two daughters and gavroche had hardly had time to discover that they had two little brothers 
 when a certain degree of misery is reached one is overpowered with a sort of spectral indifference and one regards human beings as though they were spectres 
 your nearest relations are often no more for you than vague shadowy forms barely outlined against a nebulous background of life and easily confounded again with the invisible 
 on the evening of the day when she had handed over her two little ones to magnon with express intention of renouncing them forever the thenardier had felt or had appeared to feel a scruple 
 she said to her husband 
 but this is abandoning our children 
 thenardier masterful and phlegmatic cauterized the scruple with this saying jean jacques rousseau did even better 
 from scruples the mother proceeded to uneasiness 
 but what if the police were to annoy us tell me monsieur thenardier is what we have done permissible thenardier replied 
 everything is permissible 
 no one will see anything but true blue in it 
 besides no one has any interest in looking closely after children who have not a sou 
 magnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime she was careful about her toilet 
 she shared her lodgings which were furnished in an affected and wretched style with a clever gallicized english thief 
 this english woman who had become a naturalized parisienne recommended by very wealthy relations intimately connected with the medals in the library and mademoiselle diamonds became celebrated later on in judicial accounts she was called mamselle miss 
 the two little creatures who had fallen to magnon had no reason to complain of their lot 
 recommended by the eighty francs they were well cared for as is everything from which profit is derived they were neither badly clothed nor badly fed they were treated almost like little by their false mother than by their real one 
 magnon played the lady and talked no thieves slang in their presence 
 thus passed several years 
 thenardier augured well from the fact one day he chanced to say to magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend of ten francs 
 the father must give them some education 
 all at once these two poor children who had up to that time been protected tolerably well even by their evil fate were abruptly hurled into life and forced to begin it for themselves 
 a wholesale arrest of malefactors like that in the jondrette garret necessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent incarcerations is a veritable disaster for that hideous and occult which pursues its existence beneath public society an adventure of this description entails all sorts of catastrophes in that sombre world the thenardier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of magnon 
 one day a short time after magnon had handed to eponine the note relating to the rue plumet a sudden raid was made by the police in the rue clocheperce magnon was seized as was also mamselle miss and all the inhabitants of the house which was of a suspicious character were gathered into the net 
 while this was going on the two little boys were playing in the back yard and saw nothing of the raid when they tried to enter the house again they found the door fastened and the house empty 
 a cobbler opposite called them to him and delivered to them a paper which their mother had left for them on this paper there was an address 
 m barge collector of rents rue du no 
 the proprietor of the stall said to them you cannot live here any longer 
 go there 
 it is near by the first street on the left 
 ask your way from this paper 
 the children set out the elder leading the younger and holding in his hand the paper which was to guide them 
 it was cold and his benumbed little fingers could not close very firmly and they did not keep a very good hold on the paper 
 at the corner of the rue clocheperce a gust of wind tore it from him and as night was falling the child was not able to find it again 
 they began to wander aimlessly through the streets

 book eleven 
 chapter xxiii 
 
 from an unfinished house on the varvarka the ground floor of which was a dramshop came drunken shouts and songs on benches round the tables in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands tipsy and perspiring with dim eyes and mouths they were all laboriously singing some song or other they were singing discordantly arduously and with great effort evidently not because they wished to sing but because they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree one a tall lad in a clean blue coat was standing over the others his face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin compressed twitching lips and dull gloomy fixed eyes evidently possessed by some idea he stood over those who were singing and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow trying unnaturally to spread out his dirty fingers the sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand as if it were most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare in the midst of the song cries were heard and fighting and blows in the passage and porch the tall lad waved his arm 
 stop it he exclaimed peremptorily a fight lads and still rolling up his sleeve he went out to the porch 
 the factory hands followed him these men who under the leadership of the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning had brought the publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served them the blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy hearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into wished to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted 
 the publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door and when the workmen came out the smith wrenching himself free from the tavern keeper fell face downward on the pavement 
 another smith tried to enter the doorway pressing against the publican with his chest 
 the lad with the sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and cried wildly fighting us lads 
 at that moment the first smith got up and scratching his bruised face to make it bleed shouted in a tearful voice police murder killed a man lads 
 oh gracious me a man beaten to death killed screamed a woman coming out of a gate close by 
 a crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith 
 you robbed people enough taking their last shirts said a voice addressing the publican what have you killed a man for you thief 
 the tall lad standing in the porch turned his bleared eyes from the publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to fight now 
 murderer he shouted suddenly to the publican bind him lads 
 i daresay you would like to bind me shouted the publican pushing away the men advancing on him and snatching his cap from his head he flung it on the ground 
 as if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance the workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision 
 i know the law very well mates take the matter to the captain of police you think i get to him robbery is not permitted to anybody now a days shouted the publican picking up his cap 
 come along then come along then the publican and the tall young fellow repeated one after the other and they moved up the street together 
 the bloodstained smith went beside them the factory hands and others followed behind talking and shouting 
 at the corner of the moroseyka opposite a large house with closed shutters and bearing a signboard stood a score of thin bootmakers wearing overalls and long tattered coats 
 he should pay folks off properly a thin workingman with frowning brows and a straggly beard was saying 
 but sucked our blood and now he thinks quit of us been misleading us all the week and now that brought us to this pass made off 
 on seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased speaking and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving crowd 
 where are all the folks going 
 why to the police of course 
 i say is it true that we have been beaten and what did you think look what folks are saying 
 questions and answers were heard the publican taking advantage of the increased crowd dropped behind and returned to his tavern 
 the tall youth not noticing the disappearance of his foe waved his bare arm and went on talking incessantly attracting general attention to himself it was around him that the people chiefly crowded expecting answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds 
 he must keep order keep the law what the government is there for am i not right good christians said the tall youth with a scarcely perceptible smile he thinks no government how can one do without government or else there would be plenty rob us 
 why talk nonsense rejoined voices in the crowd will they give up moscow like this they told you that for fun and you believed it there plenty of troops on the march let him in indeed what the government is for better listen to what people are saying said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth 
 by the wall of a smaller group of people were gathered round a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand 
 an ukase they are reading an ukase reading an ukase cried voices in the crowd and the people rushed toward the reader 
 the man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of august when the crowd collected round him he seemed confused but at the demand of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him he began in a rather tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning 
 early tomorrow i shall go to his serene highness he read sirin highness said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and a frown on his brow to consult with him to act and to aid the army to exterminate these scoundrels we too will take part the reader went on and then paused do you see shouted the youth victoriously going to clear up the whole affair for you in destroying them and will send these visitors to the devil i will come back to dinner and set to work we will do completely do and undo these scoundrels 
 the last words were read out in the midst of complete silence the tall lad hung his head gloomily it was evident that no one had understood the last part in particular the words i will come back to dinner evidently displeased both reader and audience the minds were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly comprehensible it was what any one of them might have said and therefore was what an ukase emanating from the highest authority should not say 
 they all stood despondent and silent the tall youth moved his lips and swayed from side to side 
 we should ask him he himself yes ask him indeed why not explain voices in the rear of the crowd were suddenly heard saying and the general attention turned to the police trap which drove into the square attended by two mounted dragoons 
 the superintendent of police who had that morning by count orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his pocket on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to stop 
 what people are these he shouted to the men who were moving singly and timidly in the direction of his trap 
 what people are these he shouted again receiving no answer 
 your honor replied the shopman in the frieze coat your honor in accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count they desire to serve not sparing their lives and it is not any kind of riot but as his highest excellence said 
 the count has not left he is here and an order will be issued concerning you said the superintendent of police go on he ordered his coachman 
 the crowd halted pressing around those who had heard what the superintendent had said and looking at the departing trap 
 the superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared look said something to his coachman and his horses increased their speed 
 a fraud lads lead the way to him himself shouted the tall youth let him go lads let him answer us keep him shouted different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap 
 following the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went in the direction of the lubyanka street 
 there now the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to perish do they think dogs voices in the crowd were heard saying more and more frequently

 book gavroche 
 chapter ii 
 
 in which little gavroche extracts profit from napoleon the great 
 spring in paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which do not precisely chill but freeze one these north winds which sadden the most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of cold air which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting door or window 
 it seems as though the gloomy door of winter had remained ajar and as though the wind were pouring through it in the spring of the epoch when the first great epidemic of this century broke out in europe these north gales were more harsh and piercing than ever 
 it was a door even more glacial than that of winter which was ajar 
 it was the door of the sepulchre in these winds one felt the breath of the cholera 
 from a meteorological point of view these cold winds possessed this peculiarity that they did not preclude a strong electric tension frequent storms accompanied by thunder and lightning burst forth at this epoch 
 one evening when these gales were blowing rudely to such a degree that january seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed their cloaks little gavroche who was always shivering gayly under his rags was standing as though in ecstasy before a shop in the vicinity of the he was adorned with a woollen shawl picked up no one knows where and which he had converted into a neck comforter 
 little gavroche appeared to be engaged in intent admiration of a wax bride in a dress and crowned with who was revolving in the window and displaying her smile to between two argand lamps but in reality he was taking an observation of the shop in order to discover whether he could not prig from the a cake of soap which he would then proceed to sell for a sou to a in the suburbs 
 he had often managed to breakfast off of such a roll 
 he called his species of work for which he possessed special aptitude shaving barbers 
 while contemplating the bride and eyeing the cake of soap he muttered between his teeth 
 tuesday 
 it was not tuesday was it tuesday 
 perhaps it was tuesday 
 yes it was tuesday 
 no one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred 
 yes perchance this monologue had some connection with the last occasion on which he had dined three days before for it was now friday 
 the barber in his shop which was warmed by a good stove was shaving a customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy that freezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his pockets but whose mind was evidently unsheathed 
 while gavroche was scrutinizing the and the cakes of windsor soap two children of unequal stature very neatly dressed and still smaller than himself one apparently about seven years of age the other five timidly turned the handle and entered the shop with a request for something or other alms possibly in a plaintive murmur which resembled a groan rather than a prayer they both spoke at once and their words were unintelligible because sobs broke the voice of the younger and the teeth of the elder were chattering with cold 
 the barber wheeled round with a furious look and without abandoning his razor thrust back the elder with his left hand and the younger with his knee and slammed his door saying the idea of coming in and freezing everybody for nothing 
 the two children resumed their march in tears 
 in the meantime a cloud had risen it had begun to rain 
 little gavroche ran after them and accosted them 
 the matter with you brats 
 we know where we are to sleep replied the elder 
 is that all said gavroche 
 a great matter truly 
 the idea of bawling about that 
 they must be greenies 
 and adopting in addition to his superiority which was rather bantering an accent of tender authority and gentle patronage 
 come along with me young uns 
 yes sir said the elder 
 and the two children followed him as they would have followed an archbishop 
 they had stopped crying 
 gavroche led them up the rue in the direction of the bastille 
 as gavroche walked along he cast an indignant backward glance at the shop 
 that fellow has no heart the whiting he muttered an englishman 
 merlan 
 a sobriquet given to hairdressers because they are white with powder 
 a woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file with gavroche at their head burst into noisy laughter 
 this laugh was wanting in respect towards the group 
 good day mamselle omnibus said gavroche to her 
 an instant later the occurred to his mind once more and he added 
 i am making a mistake in the beast not a whiting a serpent 
 barber go and fetch a locksmith and have a bell hung to your tail 
 this had rendered him aggressive 
 as he strode over a gutter he apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet faust on the brocken and who had a broom in her hand 
 madam said he so you are going out with your horse 
 and thereupon he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian 
 you scamp shouted the furious pedestrian 
 gavroche elevated his nose above his shawl 
 is monsieur complaining 
 of you ejaculated the man 
 the office is closed said gavroche i do not receive any more complaints 
 in the meanwhile as he went on up the street he perceived a thirteen or fourteen years old and clad in so short a gown that her knees were visible lying thoroughly chilled under a the little girl was getting to be too old for such a thing 
 growth does play these tricks 
 the petticoat becomes short at the moment when nudity becomes indecent 
 poor girl said gavroche 
 she even trousers 
 hold on take this 
 and unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the where the scarf became a shawl once more 
 the child stared at him in astonishment and received the shawl in silence 
 when a certain stage of distress has been reached in his misery the poor man no longer groans over evil no longer returns thanks for good 
 that done 
 brrr said gavroche who was shivering more than saint martin for the latter retained of his cloak 
 at this brrr the downpour of rain redoubled in its spite became furious 
 the wicked skies punish good deeds 
 
 ah come now exclaimed gavroche the meaning of this good heavens if it goes on like this i shall stop my subscription 
 and he set out on the march once more 
 all right he resumed casting a glance at the as she coiled up under the shawl got a famous peel 
 and looking up at the clouds he exclaimed 
 caught 
 the two children followed close on his heels 
 as they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices which indicate a shop for bread is put behind bars like gold gavroche turned round 
 ah by the way brats have we dined 
 monsieur replied the elder we have had nothing to eat since this morning 
 so you have neither father nor mother resumed gavroche majestically 
 excuse us sir we have a papa and a mamma but we know where they are 
 sometimes better than knowing where they are said gavroche who was a thinker 
 we have been wandering about these two hours continued the elder we have hunted for things at the corners of the streets but we have found nothing 
 i know ejaculated gavroche the dogs who eat everything 
 he went on after a pause 
 ah we have lost our authors 
 we know what we have done with them 
 this should not be gamins 
 stupid to let old people stray off like that 
 come now we must have a snooze all the same 
 however he asked them no questions 
 what was more simple than that they should have no dwelling place 
 the elder of the two children who had almost entirely recovered the prompt heedlessness of childhood uttered this exclamation 
 queer all the same 
 mamma told us that she would take us to get a blessed spray on palm sunday 
 bosh said gavroche 
 mamma resumed the elder is a lady who lives with mamselle miss 
 tanflute retorted gavroche 
 meanwhile he had halted and for the last two minutes he had been feeling and fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained 
 at last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied but which was triumphant in reality 
 let us be calm young uns 
 supper for three 
 and from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou 
 without allowing the two urchins time for amazement he pushed both of them before him into the shop and flung his sou on the counter crying 
 boy five centimes worth of bread 
 the baker who was the proprietor in person took up a loaf and a knife 
 in three pieces my boy went on gavroche 
 and he added with dignity 
 there are three of us 
 and seeing that the baker after scrutinizing the three customers had taken down a black loaf he thrust his finger far up his nose with an inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great snuff on the tip of his thumb and hurled this indignant apostrophe full in the face 
 keksekca 
 those of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this interpellation of to the baker a russian or a polish word or one of those savage cries which the yoways and the botocudos hurl at each other from bank to bank of a river athwart the solitudes are warned that it is a word which they our readers utter every day and which takes the place of the phrase 
 que que cela 
 the baker understood perfectly and replied 
 well 
 bread and very good bread of the second quality 
 you mean larton brutal black bread retorted gavroche calmly and coldly disdainful 
 white bread boy white bread larton savonne standing treat 
 the baker could not repress a smile and as he cut the white bread he surveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked gavroche 
 come now boy said he what are you taking our measure like that for 
 all three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure 
 when the bread was cut the baker threw the sou into his drawer and gavroche said to the two children 
 grub away 
 the little boys stared at him in surprise 
 gavroche began to laugh 
 ah hullo so they understand yet too small 
 and he repeated 
 eat away 
 at the same time he held out a piece of bread to each of them 
 and thinking that the elder who seemed to him the more worthy of his conversation deserved some special encouragement and ought to be relieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite he added as be handed him the largest share 
 ram that into your muzzle 
 one piece was smaller than the others he kept this for himself 
 the poor children including gavroche were famished as they tore their bread apart in big mouthfuls they blocked up the shop of the baker who now that they had paid their money looked angrily at them 
 go into the street again said gavroche 
 they set off once more in the direction of the bastille 
 from time to time as they passed the lighted the smallest halted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended from his neck by a cord 
 well he is a very green un said gavroche 
 then becoming thoughtful he muttered between his teeth 
 all the same if i had charge of the babes lock em up better than that 
 just as they were finishing their morsel of bread and had reached the angle of that gloomy rue des ballets at the other end of which the low and threatening wicket of la force was visible 
 hullo is that you gavroche said some one 
 hullo is that you montparnasse said gavroche 
 a man had just accosted the street urchin and the man was no other than montparnasse in disguise with blue spectacles but recognizable to gavroche 
 the went on gavroche got a hide the color of a linseed plaster and blue specs like a doctor 
 putting on style pon my word 
 hush ejaculated montparnasse not so loud 
 and he drew gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops 
 the two little ones followed mechanically holding each other by the hand 
 when they were ensconced under the arch of a portecochere sheltered from the rain and from all eyes 
 do you know where going demanded montparnasse 
 to the abbey of replied gavroche 
 the scaffold 
 joker 
 and montparnasse went on 
 going to find babet 
 ah exclaimed gavroche so her name is babet 
 montparnasse lowered his voice 
 not she he 
 ah 
 babet 
 yes babet 
 i thought he was buckled 
 he has undone the buckle replied montparnasse 
 and he rapidly related to the gamin how on the morning of that very day babet having been transferred to la conciergerie had made his escape by turning to the left instead of to the right in the police office 
 gavroche expressed his admiration for this skill 
 what a dentist he cried 
 montparnasse added a few details as to flight and ended with 
 oh 
 not all 
 gavroche as he listened had seized a cane that montparnasse held in his hand and mechanically pulled at the upper part and the blade of a dagger made its appearance 
 ah he exclaimed pushing the dagger back in haste you have brought along your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois 
 montparnasse winked 
 the deuce resumed gavroche so going to have a bout with the bobbies 
 you tell replied montparnasse with an indifferent air always a good thing to have a pin about one 
 gavroche persisted 
 what are you up to 
 again montparnasse took a grave tone and said mouthing every syllable 
 things 
 and abruptly changing the conversation 
 by the way 
 
 what 
 something happened day 
 fancy 
 i meet a bourgeois he makes me a present of a sermon and his purse 
 i put it in my pocket a minute later i feel in my pocket 
 nothing there 
 except the sermon said gavroche 
 but you went on montparnasse where are you bound for now 
 gavroche pointed to his two proteges and said 
 going to put these infants to bed 
 whereabouts is the bed 
 at my house 
 your house 
 at my house 
 so you have a lodging 
 yes i have 
 and where is your lodging 
 in the elephant said gavroche 
 montparnasse though not naturally inclined to astonishment could not restrain an exclamation 
 in the elephant 
 well yes in the elephant retorted gavroche 
 kekcaa 
 this is another word of the language which no one writes and which every one speaks 
 kekcaa signifies 
 quest que que cela a 
 the matter with that 
 the profound remark recalled montparnasse to calmness and good sense 
 he appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to lodging 
 of course said he yes the elephant 
 is it comfortable there 
 very said gavroche 
 really bully there 
 there any draughts as there are under the bridges 
 how do you get in 
 oh i get in 
 so there is a hole demanded montparnasse 
 parbleu 
 i should say so 
 but you tell 
 between the fore legs 
 the bobbies seen it 
 and you climb up 
 yes i understand 
 a turn of the hand cric crac and all over no one there 
 after a pause gavroche added 
 i shall have a ladder for these children 
 montparnasse burst out laughing 
 where the devil did you pick up those young uns 
 gavroche replied with great simplicity 
 they are some brats that a made me a present of 
 meanwhile montparnasse had fallen to thinking 
 you recognized me very readily he muttered

 book eleven 
 chapter xxiv 
 
 on the evening of the first of september after his interview with kutuzov count rostopchin had returned to moscow mortified and offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war and because kutuzov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the defense of the city amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters distressed offended and surprised by all this rostopchin had returned to moscow after supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from kutuzov this letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops through the town as the army was retreating to the ryazan road beyond moscow this was not news to rostopchin he had known that moscow would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day with kutuzov on the poklonny hill but ever since the battle of borodino for all the generals who came to moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle and since then the government property had been removed every night and half the inhabitants had left the city with own permission yet all the same this information astonished and irritated the count coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order from kutuzov and received at night breaking in on his beauty sleep 
 when later on in his memoirs count rostopchin explained his actions at this time he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important considerations to maintain tranquillity in moscow and expedite the departure of the inhabitants if one accepts this twofold aim all actions appear irreproachable why were the holy relics the arms ammunition gunpowder and stores of corn not removed why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that moscow would not be given up and thereby ruined to presence the tranquillity of the city explains count rostopchin why were bundles of useless papers from the government offices and balloon and other articles removed to leave the town empty explains count rostopchin one need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification 
 all the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for public tranquillity 
 on what then was count fear for the tranquillity of moscow based in what reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city the inhabitants were leaving it and the retreating troops were filling it why should that cause the masses to riot 
 neither in moscow nor anywhere in russia did anything resembling an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town more than ten thousand people were still in moscow on the first and second of september and except for a mob in the courtyard assembled there at his bidding nothing happened it is obvious that there would have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle of borodino when the surrender of moscow became certain or at least probable rostopchin instead of exciting the people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the holy relics the gunpowder munitions and money and had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned 
 rostopchin though he had patriotic sentiments was a sanguine and impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding ever since the entry into smolensk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of the heart of russia not only did it seem to him as to all administrators that he controlled the external actions of inhabitants but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters written in a coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in authority rostopchin was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling and had grown so used to it that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under his feet so that he positively did not know what to do though he knew it was coming he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe that moscow would be abandoned and did not prepare for it the inhabitants left against his wishes if the government offices were removed this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly he was absorbed in the role he had created for himself as is often the case with those gifted with an ardent imagination though he had long known that moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his intellect he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs 
 all his painstaking and energetic activity in how far it was useful and had any effect on the people is another question had been simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic hatred of the french 
 but when events assumed their true historical character when expressing hatred for the french in words proved insufficient when it was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle when was of no avail in relation to the one question before moscow when the whole population streamed out of moscow as one man abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all the depth of their national feeling then the role chosen by rostopchin suddenly appeared senseless he unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous weak and alone with no ground to stand on 
 when awakened from his sleep he received that cold peremptory note from kutuzov he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself to blame all that he had been specially put in charge of the state property which he should have removed was still in moscow and it was no longer possible to take the whole of it away 
 who is to blame for it who has let things come to such a pass he ruminated not i of course i had everything ready i had moscow 
 firmly in hand and this is what they have let it come to villains traitors he thought without clearly defining who the villains and traitors were but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in which he found himself 
 all that night count rostopchin issued orders for which people came to him from all parts of moscow those about him had never seen the count so morose and irritable 
 your excellency the director of the department has sent for instructions from the consistory from the senate from the university from the foundling hospital the suffragan has sent asking for information what are your orders about the fire brigade from the governor of the prison from the superintendent of the lunatic asylum all night long such announcements were continually being received by the count 
 to all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that orders from him were not now needed that the whole affair carefully prepared by him had now been ruined by somebody and that that somebody would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen 
 oh tell that blockhead he said in reply to the question from the department that he should remain to guard his documents now why are you asking silly questions about the fire brigade they have horses let them be off to vladimir and not leave them to the french 
 your excellency the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come what are your commands 
 my commands let them go away all and let the lunatics out into the town when lunatics command our armies god evidently means these other madmen to be free 
 in reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison count rostopchin shouted angrily at the governor 
 do you expect me to give you two battalions which we have not got for a convoy release them all about it 
 your excellency there are some political prisoners meshkov vereshchagin 
 vereshchagin he been hanged yet shouted rostopchin bring him to me

 book gavroche 
 chapter ii 
 
 he took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than two quills wrapped in cotton and thrust one up each of his nostrils this gave him a different nose 
 that changes you remarked gavroche you are less homely so you ought to keep them on all the time 
 montparnasse was a handsome fellow but gavroche was a tease 
 seriously demanded montparnasse how do you like me so 
 the sound of his voice was different also 
 in a twinkling montparnasse had become unrecognizable 
 oh 
 do play porrichinelle for us exclaimed gavroche 
 the two children who had not been listening up to this point being occupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses drew near at this name and stared at montparnasse with dawning joy and admiration 
 unfortunately montparnasse was troubled 
 he laid his hand on shoulder and said to him emphasizing his words 
 listen to what i tell you boy if i were on the square with my dog my knife and my wife and if you were to squander ten sous on me i refuse to work but this shrove tuesday 
 this odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin he wheeled round hastily darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profound attention and perceived a police sergeant standing with his back to them a few paces off 
 gavroche allowed an ah good to escape him but immediately suppressed it and shaking hand 
 well good evening said he going off to my elephant with my brats 
 supposing that you should need me some night you can come and hunt me up there 
 i lodge on the entresol there is no porter 
 you will inquire for monsieur gavroche 
 very good said montparnasse 
 and they parted montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of the greve and gavroche towards the bastille 
 the little one of five dragged along by his brother who was dragged by gavroche turned his head back several times to watch porrichinelle as he went 
 the ambiguous phrase by means of which montparnasse had warned gavroche of the presence of the policeman contained no other talisman than the assonance dig repeated five or six times in different forms this syllable dig uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words of a phrase means 
 take care we can no longer talk freely there was besides in sentence a literary beauty which was lost upon gavroche that is mon dogue ma dague et ma digue a slang expression of the temple which signifies my dog my knife 
 and my wife greatly in vogue among clowns and the in the great century when moliere wrote and callot drew 
 twenty years ago there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of the place de la bastille near the basin of the canal excavated in the ancient ditch of the a singular monument which has already been effaced from the memories of parisians and which deserved to leave some trace for it was the idea of a member of the institute the of the army of egypt 
 we say monument although it was only a rough model 
 but this model itself a marvellous sketch the grandiose skeleton of an idea of which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown on each occasion still further from us had become historical and had acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisional aspect 
 it was an elephant forty feet high constructed of timber and masonry bearing on its back a tower which resembled a house formerly painted green by some dauber and now painted black by heaven the wind and time 
 in this deserted and unprotected corner of the place the broad brow of the colossus his trunk his tusks his tower his enormous crupper his four feet like columns produced at night under the starry heavens a surprising and terrible form 
 it was a sort of symbol of popular force it was sombre mysterious and immense 
 it was some mighty visible phantom one knew not what standing erect beside the invisible spectre of the bastille 
 few strangers visited this edifice no looked at it it was falling into ruins every season the plaster which detached itself from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it 
 the aediles as the expression ran in elegant dialect had forgotten it ever since 
 there it stood in its corner melancholy sick crumbling surrounded by a rotten palisade soiled continually by drunken coachmen cracks meandered athwart its belly a lath projected from its tail tall grass flourished between its legs and as the level of the place had been rising all around it for a space of thirty years by that slow and continuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns it stood in a hollow and it looked as though the ground were giving way beneath it 
 it was unclean despised repulsive and superb ugly in the eyes of the bourgeois melancholy in the eyes of the thinker 
 there was something about it of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out and something of the majesty which is on the point of being decapitated as we have said at night its aspect changed 
 night is the real element of everything that is dark 
 as soon as twilight descended the old elephant became transfigured he assumed a tranquil and redoubtable appearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows being of the past he belonged to night and obscurity was in keeping with his grandeur 
 this rough squat heavy hard austere almost misshapen but assuredly majestic monument stamped with a sort of magnificent and savage gravity has disappeared and left to reign in peace a sort of gigantic stove ornamented with its pipe which has replaced the sombre fortress with its nine towers very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal classes 
 it is quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of an epoch in which a pot contains power this epoch will pass away people have already begun to understand that if there can be force in a boiler there can be no force except in the brain in other words that which leads and drags on the world is not locomotives but ideas 
 harness locomotives to ideas that is well done but do not mistake the horse for the rider 
 at all events to return to the place de la bastille the architect of this elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster the architect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out of bronze 
 this which has been baptized by a sonorous name and called the column of july this monument of a revolution that miscarried was still enveloped in in an immense shirt of woodwork which we regret for our part and by a vast plank enclosure which completed the task of isolating the elephant 
 it was towards this corner of the place dimly lighted by the reflection of a distant street lamp that the gamin guided his two brats 
 the reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind him that we are dealing with simple reality and that twenty years ago the tribunals were called upon to judge under the charge of vagabondage and mutilation of a public monument a child who had been caught asleep in this very elephant of the bastille this fact noted we proceed 
 on arriving in the vicinity of the colossus gavroche comprehended the effect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small and said 
 be scared infants 
 then he entered through a gap in the fence into the enclosure and helped the young ones to clamber through the breach the two children somewhat frightened followed gavroche without uttering a word and confided themselves to this little providence in rags which had given them bread and had promised them a shelter 
 there extended along the fence lay a ladder which by day served the laborers in the neighboring gavroche raised it with remarkable vigor and placed it against one of the forelegs 
 near the point where the ladder ended a sort of black hole in the belly of the colossus could be distinguished 
 gavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests and said to them 
 climb up and go in 
 the two little boys exchanged terrified glances 
 afraid brats exclaimed gavroche 
 and he added 
 you shall see 
 he clasped the rough leg of the elephant and in a twinkling without deigning to make use of the ladder he had reached the aperture 
 he entered it as an adder slips through a crevice and disappeared within and an instant later the two children saw his head which looked pale appear vaguely on the edge of the shadowy hole like a wan and whitish spectre 
 well he exclaimed climb up young uns 
 see how snug it is here 
 come up you he said to the elder lend you a hand 
 the little fellows nudged each other the gamin frightened and inspired them with confidence at one and the same time and then it was raining very hard 
 the elder one undertook the risk the younger on seeing his brother climbing up and himself left alone between the paws of this huge beast felt greatly inclined to cry but he did not dare 
 the elder lad climbed with uncertain steps up the rungs of the ladder gavroche in the meanwhile encouraging him with exclamations like a to his pupils or a muleteer to his mules 
 be your feet there give us your hand 
 and when the child was within reach he seized him suddenly and vigorously by the arm and pulled him towards him 
 nabbed said he 
 the brat had passed through the crack 
 now said gavroche wait for me 
 be so good as to take a seat monsieur 
 and making his way out of the hole as he had entered it he slipped down the leg with the agility of a monkey landed on his feet in the grass grasped the child of five round the body and planted him fairly in the middle of the ladder then he began to climb up behind him shouting to the elder 
 going to boost him do you tug 
 and in another instant the small lad was pushed dragged pulled thrust stuffed into the hole before he had time to recover himself and gavroche entering behind him and repulsing the ladder with a kick which sent it flat on the grass began to clap his hands and to cry 
 here we are 
 long live general lafayette 
 this explosion over he added 
 now young uns you are in my house 
 gavroche was at home in fact 
 oh unforeseen utility of the useless 
 charity of great things goodness of giants 
 this huge monument which had embodied an idea of the had become the box of a street urchin the brat had been accepted and sheltered by the colossus the bourgeois decked out in their sunday finery who passed the elephant of the bastille were fond of saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes 
 the good of that it served to save from the cold the frost the hail and rain to shelter from the winds of winter to preserve from slumber in the mud which produces fever and from slumber in the snow which produces death a little being who had no father no mother no bread no clothes no refuge 
 it served to receive the innocent whom society repulsed 
 it served to diminish public crime it was a lair open to one against whom all doors were shut it seemed as though the miserable old mastodon invaded by vermin and oblivion covered with warts with mould and ulcers tottering abandoned condemned a sort of mendicant colossus asking alms in vain with a benevolent look in the midst of the had taken pity on that other mendicant the poor pygmy who roamed without shoes to his feet without a roof over his head blowing on his fingers clad in rags fed on rejected scraps that was what the elephant of the bastille was good for this idea of napoleon disdained by men had been taken back by god that which had been merely illustrious had become august in order to realize his thought the emperor should have had porphyry brass iron gold marble the old collection of planks beams and plaster sufficed for god 
 the emperor had had the dream of a genius in that titanic elephant armed prodigious with trunk uplifted bearing its tower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying waters he wished to incarnate the people 
 god had done a grander thing with it he had lodged a child there 
 the hole through which gavroche had entered was a breach which was hardly visible from the outside being concealed as we have stated beneath the belly and so narrow that it was only cats and homeless children who could pass through it 
 begin said gavroche by telling the porter that we are not at home 
 and plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is well acquainted with his apartments he took a plank and stopped up the aperture 
 again gavroche plunged into the obscurity 
 the children heard the crackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle the chemical match was not yet in existence at that epoch the fumade steel represented progress 
 a sudden light made them blink gavroche had just managed to ignite one of those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called cellar rats 
 the cellar rat which emitted more smoke than light rendered the interior of the elephant confusedly visible 
 two guests glanced about them and the sensation which they experienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up in the great tun of heidelberg or better still like what jonah must have felt in the biblical belly of the whale an entire and gigantic skeleton appeared enveloping them 
 above a long brown beam whence started at regular distances massive arching ribs represented the vertebral column with its sides stalactites of plaster depended from them like entrails and vast spiders webs stretching from side to side formed dirty diaphragms here and there in the corners were visible large blackish spots which had the appearance of being alive and which changed places rapidly with an abrupt and frightened movement 
 fragments which had fallen from the back into his belly had filled up the cavity so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a floor 
 the smaller child nestled up against his brother and whispered to him 
 black 
 this remark drew an exclamation from gavroche 
 the petrified air of the two brats rendered some shock necessary 
 that you are gabbling about there he exclaimed are you scoffing at me 
 are you turning up your noses do you want the tuileries 
 are you brutes 
 come say 
 i warn you that i belong to the regiment of simpletons 
 ah come now are you brats from the establishment 
 a little roughness is good in cases of fear 
 it is reassuring the two children drew close to gavroche 
 gavroche paternally touched by this confidence passed from grave to gentle and addressing the smaller 
 stupid said he accenting the insulting word with a caressing intonation outside that it is black 
 outside raining here it does not rain outside cold here not an atom of wind outside there are heaps of people here no one outside there even the moon here my candle confound it 
 the two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror but gavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation 
 quick said he 
 and he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the end of the room 
 there stood his bed 
 bed was complete that is to say it had a mattress a blanket and an alcove with curtains 
 the mattress was a straw mat the blanket a rather large strip of gray woollen stuff very warm and almost new 
 this is what the alcove consisted of 
 three rather long poles thrust into and consolidated with the rubbish which formed the floor that is to say the belly of the elephant two in front and one behind and united by a rope at their summits so as to form a pyramidal bundle 
 this cluster supported a of brass wire which was simply placed upon it but artistically applied and held by fastenings of iron wire so that it enveloped all three holes 
 a row of very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothing could pass under it this grating was nothing else than a piece of the brass screens with which aviaries are covered in menageries 
 bed stood as in a cage behind this net 
 the whole resembled an esquimaux tent 
 this took the place of curtains 
 gavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart 
 down on all fours brats said gavroche 
 he made his guests enter the cage with great precaution then he crawled in after them pulled the stones together and closed the opening hermetically again 
 all three had stretched out on the mat 
 gavroche still had the cellar rat in his hand 
 now said he go to sleep 
 going to suppress the candelabra 
 monsieur the elder of the brothers asked gavroche pointing to the netting that for 
 that answered gavroche gravely is for the rats 
 go to sleep 
 nevertheless he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the benefit of these young creatures and he continued 
 a thing from the jardin des plantes 
 used for fierce animals a whole shopful of them there 
 all got to do is to climb over a wall crawl through a window and pass through a door you can get as much as you want 
 as he spoke he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold 
 of the blanket and the little one murmured 
 oh how good that is 
 warm 
 gavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket 
 from the jardin des plantes too said he 
 i took that from the monkeys 
 and pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying a very thick and admirably made mat he added 
 that belonged to the giraffe 
 after a pause he went on 
 the beasts had all these things 
 i took them away from them it trouble them 
 i told them 
 for the elephant 
 he paused and then resumed 
 you crawl over the walls and you care a straw for the government so there now 
 the two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on this intrepid and ingenious being a vagabond like themselves isolated like themselves frail like themselves who had something admirable and about him who seemed supernatural to them and whose physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank mingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles 
 monsieur ventured the elder timidly you are not afraid of the police then 
 gavroche contented himself with replying 
 brat 
 nobody says police they say bobbies 
 the smaller had his eyes wide open but he said nothing as he was on the edge of the mat the elder being in the middle gavroche tucked the blanket round him as a mother might have done and heightened the mat under his head with old rags in such a way as to form a pillow for the child 
 then he turned to the elder 
 hey 
 jolly comfortable here we 
 ah yes replied the elder gazing at gavroche with the expression of a saved angel 
 the two poor little children who had been soaked through began to grow warm once more 
 ah by the way continued gavroche what were you bawling about 
 and pointing out the little one to his brother 
 a mite like that nothing to say about but the idea of a big fellow like you crying 
 idiotic you looked like a calf 
 gracious replied the child we have no lodging 
 bother retorted gavroche you say lodgings you say crib 
 and then we were afraid of being alone like that at night 
 you say night you say darkmans 
 thank you sir said the child 
 listen went on gavroche you must never bawl again over anything take care of you 
 you shall see what fun have in summer go to the glaciere with navet one of my pals bathe in the gare run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at makes the laundresses raging they scream they get mad and if you only knew how ridiculous they are go and see the and then take you to the play take you to see frederick lemaitre

 there were a lot of us fellers and we ran under a cloth and that made the sea get you an engagement at my theatre 
 go to see the savages they real those savages they wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles and you can see where their elbows have been darned with white 
 then go to the opera 
 get in with the hired applauders 
 the opera claque is well managed i associate with the claque on the boulevard 
 at the opera just fancy some of them pay twenty sous but ninnies called dishclouts 
 and then go to see the guillotine work show you the executioner 
 he lives in the rue des marais monsieur sanson 
 he has a at his door 
 ah have famous fun 
 at that moment a drop of wax fell on finger and recalled him to the realities of life 
 the deuce said he the wick giving out 
 attention i spend more than a sou a month on my lighting 
 when a body goes to bed he must sleep 
 we the time to read m paul de romances 
 and besides the light might pass through the cracks of the and all the bobbies need to do is to see it 
 and then remarked the elder alone dared talk to gavroche and reply to him a spark might fall in the straw and we must look out and not burn the house down 
 people say burn the house down remarked gavroche they say blaze the crib 
 the storm increased in violence and the heavy downpour beat upon the back of the colossus amid claps of thunder taken in rain said gavroche 
 it amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of the house 
 winter is a stupid it wastes its merchandise it loses its labor it wet us and that makes it kick up a row old that it is 
 this allusion to the thunder all the consequences of which gavroche in his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century accepted was followed by a broad flash of lightning so dazzling that a hint of it entered the belly of the elephant through the crack almost at the same instant the thunder rumbled with great fury the two little creatures uttered a shriek and started up so eagerly that the network came near being displaced but gavroche turned his bold face to them and took advantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh 
 calm down children 
 topple over the edifice 
 fine thunder all right 
 no slouch of a streak of lightning 
 bravo for the good god 
 deuce take it 
 almost as good as it is at the ambigu 
 that said he restored order in the netting pushed the two children gently down on the bed pressed their knees in order to stretch them out at full length and exclaimed 
 since the good god is lighting his candle i can blow out mine now babes now my young humans you must shut your peepers very bad not to sleep 
 make you swallow the strainer or as they say in fashionable society stink in the gullet wrap yourself up well in the hide 
 going to put out the light are you ready 
 yes murmured the elder all right 
 i seem to have feathers under my head 
 people say head cried gavroche they say nut 
 the two children nestled close to each other gavroche finished arranging them on the mat drew the blanket up to their very ears then repeated for the third time his injunction in the hieratical tongue 
 shut your peepers 
 and he snuffed out his tiny light 
 hardly had the light been extinguished when a peculiar trembling began to affect the netting under which the three children lay 
 it consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic sound as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire this was accompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries 
 the little boy on hearing this hubbub overhead and chilled with terror jogged his elbow but the elder brother had already shut his peepers as gavroche had ordered then the little one who could no longer control his terror questioned gavroche but in a very low tone and with bated breath 
 sir 
 hey said gavroche who had just closed his eyes 
 what is that 
 the rats replied gavroche 
 and he laid his head down on the mat again 
 the rats in fact who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the elephant and who were the living black spots which we have already mentioned had been held in awe by the flame of the candle so long as it had been lighted but as soon as the cavern which was the same as their city had returned to darkness scenting what the good perrault calls fresh meat they had hurled themselves in throngs on tent had climbed to the top of it and had begun to bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this trap 
 still the little one could not sleep 
 sir he began again 
 hey said gavroche 
 what are rats 
 they are mice 
 this explanation reassured the child a little 
 he had seen white mice in the course of his life and he was not afraid of them nevertheless he lifted up his voice once more 
 sir 
 hey said gavroche again 
 why you have a cat 
 i did have one replied gavroche i brought one here but they ate her 
 this second explanation undid the work of the first and the little fellow began to tremble again 
 the dialogue between him and gavroche began again for the fourth time 
 monsieur 
 hey 
 who was it that was eaten 
 the cat 
 and who ate the cat 
 the rats 
 the mice 
 yes the rats 
 the child in consternation dismayed at the thought of mice which ate cats pursued 
 sir would those mice eat us 
 they just ejaculated gavroche 
 the terror had reached its climax 
 but gavroche added 
 be afraid 
 they get in 
 and besides here here catch hold of my hand 
 hold your tongue and shut your peepers 
 at the same time gavroche grasped the little hand across his brother 
 the child pressed the hand close to him and felt reassured 
 courage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicating themselves 
 silence reigned round them once more the sound of their voices had frightened off the rats at the expiration of a few minutes they came raging back but in vain the three little fellows were fast asleep and heard nothing more 
 the hours of the night fled away 
 darkness covered the vast place de la bastille 
 a wintry gale which mingled with the rain blew in gusts the patrol searched all the doorways alleys enclosures and obscure nooks and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence before the elephant the monster erect motionless staring into the shadows had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good deed and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleeping children 
 in order to understand what is about to follow the reader must remember that at that epoch the bastille was situated at the other end of the square and that what took place in the vicinity of the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel 
 towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn a man turned from the rue at a run made the circuit of the enclosure of the column of july and glided between the palings until he was underneath the belly of the elephant if any light had illuminated that man it might have been divined from the thorough manner in which he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain 
 arrived beneath the elephant he uttered a peculiar cry which did not belong to any human tongue and which a paroquet alone could have imitated 
 twice he repeated this cry of whose orthography the following barely conveys an idea 
 kirikikiou 
 at the second cry a clear young merry voice responded from the belly of the elephant 
 yes 
 almost immediately the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside and gave passage to a child who descended the leg and fell briskly near the man 
 it was gavroche 
 the man was montparnasse 
 as for his cry of was doubtless what the child had meant when he said 
 you will ask for monsieur gavroche 
 on hearing it he had waked with a start had crawled out of his alcove pushing apart the netting a little and carefully drawing it together again then he had opened the trap and descended 
 the man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom montparnasse confined himself to the remark 
 we need you 
 come lend us a hand 
 the lad asked for no further enlightenment 
 with you said he 
 and both took their way towards the rue whence montparnasse had emerged winding rapidly through the long file of carts which descend towards the markets at that hour 
 the crouching in their wagons amid the salads and vegetables enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflers on account of the beating rain did not even glance at these strange pedestrians

 book eleven 
 chapter xxv 
 
 toward nine in the morning when the troops were already moving through moscow nobody came to the count any more for instructions those who were able to get away were going of their own accord those who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do 
 the count ordered his carriage that he might drive to sokolniki and sat in his study with folded hands morose sallow and taciturn 
 in quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts while the sea of history remains calm the in his frail bark holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself moving naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding on to but as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the ship to move such a delusion is no longer possible the ship moves independently with its own enormous motion the boat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel and suddenly the administrator instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power becomes an insignificant useless feeble man 
 rostopchin felt this and it was this which exasperated him 
 the superintendent of police whom the crowd had stopped went in to see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the horses were harnessed they were both pale and the superintendent of police after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had received informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the courtyard and wished to see him 
 without saying a word rostopchin rose and walked hastily to his light luxurious drawing room went to the balcony door took hold of the handle let it go again and went to the window from which he had a better view of the whole crowd the tall lad was standing in front flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look the blood stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face a drone of voices was audible through the closed window 
 is my carriage ready asked rostopchin stepping back from the window 
 it is your excellency replied the adjutant 
 rostopchin went again to the balcony door 
 but what do they want he asked the superintendent of police 
 your excellency they say they have got ready according to your orders to go against the french and they shouted something about treachery but it is a turbulent crowd your excellency i hardly managed to get away from it your excellency i venture to suggest 
 you may go i need you to tell me what to do exclaimed rostopchin angrily 
 he stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd 
 this is what they have done with russia this is what they have done with me thought he full of an irrepressible fury that welled up within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be attributed as often happens with passionate people he was mastered by anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it here is that mob the dregs of the people he thought as he gazed at the crowd this rabble they have roused by their folly they want a victim he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm and this thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim something on which to vent his rage 
 is the carriage ready he asked again 
 yes your excellency what are your orders about vereshchagin he is waiting at the porch said the adjutant 
 ah exclaimed rostopchin as if struck by an unexpected recollection 
 and rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony the talking instantly ceased hats and caps were doffed and all eyes were raised to the count 
 good morning lads said the count briskly and loudly thank you for coming come out to you in a moment but we must first settle with the villain we must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of moscow wait for me 
 and the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door behind him 
 a murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd settle with all the villains see and you said the french show you what law is the mob were saying as if reproving one another for their lack of confidence 
 a few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door gave an order and the dragoons formed up in line the crowd moved eagerly from the balcony toward the porch rostopchin coming out there with quick angry steps looked hastily around as if seeking someone 
 where is he he inquired and as he spoke he saw a young man coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons he had a long thin neck and his head that had been half shaved was again covered by short hair this young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat lined with fox fur that had once been smart and dirty hempen convict trousers over which were pulled his thin dirty boots on his thin weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute movements 
 ah said rostopchin hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young man in the coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch put him there 
 the young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot indicated holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed his neck turned his long neck twice this way and that sighed and submissively folded before him his thin hands unused to work 
 for several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step the silence continued only among the back rows of the people who were all pressing toward the one spot could sighs groans and the shuffling of feet be heard 
 while waiting for the young man to take his place on the step rostopchin stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand 
 lads said he with a metallic ring in his voice this man vereshchagin is the scoundrel by whose doing moscow is perishing 
 the young man in the coat stooping a little stood in a submissive attitude his fingers clasped before him his emaciated young face disfigured by the head hung down hopelessly at the first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye but rostopchin did not look at him a vein in the young long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear and suddenly his face flushed 
 all eyes were fixed on him he looked at the crowd and rendered more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there he smiled sadly and timidly and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step 
 he has betrayed his tsar and his country he had gone over to bonaparte he alone of all the russians has disgraced the russian name he has caused moscow to perish said rostopchin in a sharp even voice but suddenly he glanced down at vereshchagin who continued to stand in the same submissive attitude as if inflamed by the sight he raised his arm and addressed the people almost shouting 
 deal with him as you think fit i hand him over to you 
 the crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one another to keep one another back to breathe in that stifling atmosphere to be unable to stir and to await something unknown uncomprehended and terrible was becoming unbearable those standing in front who had seen and heard what had taken place before them all stood with wide open eyes and mouths straining with all their strength and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them 
 beat him let the traitor perish and not disgrace the russian name shouted rostopchin cut him down i command it 
 hearing not so much the words as the angry tone of voice the crowd moaned and heaved forward but again paused 
 count exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of vereshchagin in the midst of the momentary silence that ensued count one god is above us both he lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face 
 he did not finish what he wished to say 
 cut him down i command it shouted rostopchin suddenly growing pale like vereshchagin 
 draw sabers cried the dragoon officer drawing his own 
 another still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch the tall youth with a stony look on his face and rigid and uplifted arm stood beside vereshchagin 
 saber him the dragoon officer almost whispered 
 and one of the soldiers his face all at once distorted with fury struck vereshchagin on the head with the blunt side of his saber 
 ah cried vereshchagin in meek surprise looking round with a frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him a similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd o lord exclaimed a sorrowful voice 
 but after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from vereshchagin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain and that cry was fatal the barrier of human feeling strained to the utmost that had held the crowd in check suddenly broke the crime had begun and must now be completed the plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar of the crowd like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship that last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all the dragoon was about to repeat his blow vereshchagin with a cry of horror covering his head with his hands rushed toward the crowd the tall youth against whom he stumbled seized his thin neck with his hands and yelling wildly fell with him under the feet of the pressing struggling crowd 
 some beat and tore at vereshchagin others at the tall youth and the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd it was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth beaten almost to death and for a long time despite the feverish haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun those who were hitting throttling and tearing at vereshchagin were unable to kill him for the crowd pressed from all sides swaying as one mass with them in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or let him go 
 hit him with an ax eh crushed traitor he sold christ still alive tenacious serves him right torture serves a thief right use the hatchet what still alive 
 only when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places each one came up glanced at what had been done and with horror reproach and astonishment pushed back again 
 o lord the people are like wild beasts how could he be alive voices in the crowd could be heard saying quite a young fellow too must have been a son what men and they say not the right one how not the right one o lord and another has been beaten too they say nearly done for oh the people they afraid of sinning said the same mob now looking with pained distress at the dead body with its long thin neck and its livid face stained with blood and dust 
 a painstaking police officer considering the presence of a corpse in his courtyard unseemly told the dragoons to take it away two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the ground the gory head with its long neck trailed twisting along the ground the crowd shrank back from it 
 at the moment when vereshchagin fell and the crowd closed in with savage yells and swayed about him rostopchin suddenly turned pale and instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him went with hurried steps and bent head not knowing where and why along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor the face was white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw 
 this way your excellency where are you going this way please said a trembling frightened voice behind him 
 count rostopchin was unable to reply and turning obediently went in the direction indicated at the back entrance stood his caleche the distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there he hastily took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in sokolniki 
 when they reached the myasnitski street and could no longer hear the shouts of the mob the count began to repent he remembered with dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his subordinates the mob is terrible disgusting he said to himself in french they are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease count one god is above us both words suddenly recurred to him and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back but this was only a momentary feeling and count rostopchin smiled disdainfully at himself i had other duties thought he the people had to be appeased many other victims have perished and are perishing for the public good and he began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the city entrusted to him and of himself not himself as theodore vasilyevich rostopchin he fancied that theodore vasilyevich rostopchin was sacrificing himself for the public good but himself as governor the representative of authority and of the tsar had i been simply theodore vasilyevich my course of action would have been quite different but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander in chief 
 lightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd rostopchin grew physically calm and as always happens as soon as he became physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too the thought which tranquillized rostopchin was not a new one since the world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with this same idea this idea is le bien public the hypothetical welfare of other people 
 to a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain but he who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies and rostopchin now knew it 
 not only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done but he even found cause for in having so successfully contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a criminal and at the same time pacify the mob 
 vereshchagin was tried and condemned to death thought rostopchin though the senate had only condemned vereshchagin to hard labor he was a traitor and a spy i could not let him go unpunished and so i have killed two birds with one stone to appease the mob i gave them a victim and at the same time punished a miscreant 
 having reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic arrangements the count grew quite tranquil 
 half an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the sokolniki field no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering what was to come he was driving to the yauza bridge where he had heard that kutuzov was count rostopchin was mentally preparing the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to kutuzov for his deception he would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the ruin of russia as rostopchin regarded it would fall upon his doting old head planning beforehand what he would say to kutuzov rostopchin turned angrily in his caleche and gazed sternly from side to side 
 the sokolniki field was deserted only at the end of it in front of the almshouse and the lunatic asylum could be seen some people in white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and gesticulating 
 one of these was running to cross the path of count carriage and the count himself his coachman and his dragoons looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and especially at the one running toward them 
 swaying from side to side on his long thin legs in his fluttering dressing gown this lunatic was running impetuously his gaze fixed on rostopchin shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him to stop the solemn gloomy face was thin and yellow with its beard growing in uneven tufts his black agate pupils with whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids 
 stop pull up i tell you he cried in a piercing voice and again shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures 
 coming abreast of the caleche he ran beside it 
 thrice have they slain me thrice have i risen from the dead they stoned me crucified me i shall rise shall rise shall rise they have torn my body the kingdom of god will be overthrown thrice will i overthrow it and thrice it he cried raising his voice higher and higher 
 count rostopchin suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed in on vereshchagin he turned away go fas faster he cried in a trembling voice to his coachman the caleche flew over the ground as fast as the horses could draw it but for a long time count rostopchin still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the distance while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished frightened bloodstained face of the traitor in the coat 
 recent as that mental picture was rostopchin already felt that it had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood even now he felt clearly that the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time but that the terrible memory would on the contrary dwell in his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life he seemed still to hear the sound of his own words cut him down i command it 
 why did i utter those words it was by some accident i said them i need not have said them he thought and then nothing would have happened he saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon who dealt the blow the look of silent timid reproach that boy in the coat had turned upon him but i did not do it for my own sake i was bound to act that way the mob the traitor the public welfare thought he 
 troops were still crowding at the yauza bridge it was hot kutuzov dejected and frowning sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his whip in the sand when a caleche dashed up noisily a man in a uniform with plumes in his hat went up to kutuzov and said something in french it was count rostopchin he told kutuzov that he had come because moscow the capital was no more and only the army remained 
 things would have been different if your serene highness had not told me that you would not abandon moscow without another battle all this would not have happened he said 
 kutuzov looked at rostopchin as if not grasping what was said to him he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the face of the man addressing him rostopchin grew confused and became silent kutuzov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating gaze from face muttered softly 
 no i shall not give up moscow without a battle 
 whether kutuzov was thinking of something entirely different when he spoke those words or uttered them purposely knowing them to be meaningless at any rate rostopchin made no reply and hastily left him and strange to say the governor of moscow the proud count rostopchin took up a cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts to drive on the carts that blocked the way

 chapter iii 
 
 the vicissitudes of flight 
 this is what had taken place that same night at the la force 
 an escape had been planned between babet brujon guelemer and thenardier although thenardier was in close confinement babet had arranged the matter for his own benefit on the same day as the reader has seen from account to gavroche montparnasse was to help them from outside 
 brujon after having passed a month in the punishment cell had had time in the first place to weave a rope in the second to mature a plan 
 in former times those severe places where the discipline of the prison delivers the convict into his own hands were composed of four stone walls a stone ceiling a flagged pavement a camp bed a grated window and a door lined with iron and were called dungeons but the dungeon was judged to be too terrible nowadays they are composed of an iron door a grated window a camp bed a flagged pavement four stone walls and a stone ceiling and are called chambers of punishment 
 a little light penetrates towards the inconvenient point about these chambers which as the reader sees are not dungeons is that they allow the persons who should be at work to think 
 so brujon meditated and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with a rope 
 as he had the name of being very dangerous in the charlemagne courtyard he was placed in the new building the first thing he found in the new building was guelemer the second was a nail guelemer that is to say crime a nail that is to say liberty 
 brujon of whom it is high time that the reader should have a complete idea was with an appearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor a polished intelligent sprig and a thief who had a caressing glance and an atrocious smile his glance resulted from his will and his smile from his nature his first studies in his art had been directed to roofs 
 he had made great progress in the industry of the men who tear off lead who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the process called double pickings 
 the circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly favorable for an attempt at escape was that the roofers were and at that very moment a portion of the slates on the prison 
 the courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated from the charlemagne and the courts up above there were scaffoldings and ladders in other words bridges and stairs in the direction of liberty 
 the new building which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be seen anywhere in the world was the weak point in the prison the walls were eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on the prisoners in their beds in spite of this antiquity the authorities committed the error of confining in the new building the most troublesome prisoners of placing there the hard cases as they say in prison parlance 
 
 the new building contained four dormitories one above the other and a top story which was called the fineair a large probably from some ancient kitchen of the dukes de la force started from the groundfloor traversed all four stories cut the dormitories where it figured as a flattened pillar into two portions and finally pierced the roof 
 guelemer and brujon were in the same dormitory 
 they had been placed by way of precaution on the lower story 
 chance ordained that the heads of their beds should rest against the chimney 
 thenardier was directly over their heads in the top story known as the pedestrian who halts on the rue after passing the barracks of the firemen in front of the of the bathing establishment beholds a yard full of flowers and shrubs in wooden boxes at the extremity of which spreads out a little white rotunda with two wings brightened up with green shutters the bucolic dream of jean jacques 
 not more than ten years ago there rose above that rotunda an enormous black hideous bare wall by which it was backed up 
 this was the outer wall of la force 
 this wall beside that rotunda was milton viewed through berquin 
 lofty as it was this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof which could be seen beyond 
 this was the roof of the new building there one could descry four guarded with bars they were the windows of the 
 a chimney pierced the roof this was the chimney which traversed the dormitories 
 the that top story of the new building was a sort of large hall with a mansard roof guarded with triple gratings and double doors of sheet iron which were studded with enormous bolts when one entered from the north end one had on left the four on right facing the windows at regular intervals four square tolerably vast cages separated by narrow passages built of masonry to about the height of the elbow and the rest up to the roof of iron bars 
 thenardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since the night of the d of february 
 no one was ever able to discover how and by what connivance he succeeded in procuring and secreting a bottle of wine invented so it is said by desrues with which a narcotic is mixed and which the band of the endormeurs or rendered famous 
 there are in many prisons treacherous employees who assist in escapes who sell to the police an unfaithful service and who turn a penny whenever they can 
 on that same night then when little gavroche picked up the two lost children brujon and guelemer who knew that babet who had escaped that morning was waiting for them in the street as well as montparnasse rose softly and with the nail which brujon had found began to pierce the chimney against which their beds stood the rubbish fell on bed so that they were not heard showers mingled with thunder shook the doors on their hinges and created in the prison a terrible and opportune uproar those of the prisoners who woke pretended to fall asleep again and left guelemer and brujon to their own devices 
 brujon was adroit guelemer was vigorous 
 before any sound had reached the watcher who was sleeping in the grated cell which opened into the dormitory the wall had been pierced the chimney scaled the iron grating which barred the upper orifice of the flue forced and the two redoubtable ruffians were on the roof 
 the wind and rain redoubled the roof was slippery 
 what a good night to leg it said brujon 
 an abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from the surrounding wall 
 at the bottom of this abyss they could see the musket of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom they fastened one end of the rope which brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron bars which they had just wrenched off flung the other over the outer wall crossed the abyss at one bound clung to the coping of the wall got astride of it let themselves slip one after the other along the rope upon a little roof which touches the pulled their rope after them jumped down into the courtyard of the traversed it pushed open the wicket beside which hung his rope pulled this opened the and found themselves in the street 
 of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed in the dark nail in hand and their project in their heads 
 a few moments later they had joined babet and montparnasse who were prowling about the neighborhood 
 they had broken their rope in pulling it after them and a bit of it remained attached to the chimney on the roof 
 they had sustained no other damage however than that of scratching nearly all the skin off their hands 
 that night thenardier was warned without any one being able to explain how and was not asleep 
 towards one in the morning the night being very dark he saw two shadows pass along the roof in the rain and squalls in front of the which was opposite his cage one halted at the window long enough to dart in a glance this was brujon 
 thenardier recognized him and understood 
 this was enough 
 thenardier rated as a burglar and detained as a measure of precaution under the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush with armed force was kept in sight 
 the sentry who was relieved every two hours marched up and down in front of his cage with loaded musket the was lighted by a skylight 
 the prisoner had on his feet fetters weighing fifty pounds 
 every day at four in the afternoon a jailer escorted by two was still in vogue at that his cage deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing two pounds a jug of water a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon in which swam a few mayagan beans inspected his irons and tapped the bars 
 this man and his dogs made two visits during the night 
 thenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall in order to preserve it from the rats as he said 
 as thenardier was kept in sight no objection had been made to this spike 
 still it was remembered afterwards that one of the jailers had said it would be better to let him have only a wooden spike 
 at two in the morning the sentinel who was an old soldier was relieved and replaced by a conscript 
 a few moments later the man with the dogs paid his visit and went off without noticing anything except possibly the excessive youth and the rustic air of the raw recruit 
 two hours afterwards at four when they came to relieve the conscript he was found asleep on the floor lying like a log near cage as for thenardier he was no longer there 
 there was a hole in the ceiling of his cage and above it another hole in the roof one of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off and probably carried away with him as it was not found 
 they also seized in his cell a bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying wine with which the soldier had been drugged the bayonet had disappeared 
 at the moment when this discovery was made it was assumed that thenardier was out of reach 
 the truth is that he was no longer in the new building but that he was still in great danger 
 thenardier on reaching the roof of the new building had found the remains of rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the chimney but as this broken fragment was much too short he had not been able to escape by the outer wall as brujon and guelemer had done 
 when one turns from the rue des ballets into the rue du one almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin there stood on that spot in the last century a house of which only the back wall now remains a regular wall of masonry which rises to the height of the third story between the adjoining buildings this ruin can be recognized by two large square windows which are still to be seen there the middle one that nearest the right gable is barred with a beam adjusted like a prop 
 through these windows there was formerly visible a lofty and lugubrious wall which was a fragment of the outer wall of la force 
 the empty space on the street left by the demolished house is by a fence of rotten boards shored up by five stone posts in this recess lies concealed a little shanty which leans against the portion of the ruin which has remained standing 
 the fence has a gate which a few years ago was fastened only by a latch 
 it was the crest of this ruin that thenardier had succeeded in reaching a little after one in the morning 
 how had he got there 
 that is what no one has ever been able to explain or understand 
 the lightning must at the same time have hindered and helped him 
 had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the slaters to get from roof to roof from enclosure to enclosure from compartment to compartment to the buildings of the charlemagne court then to the buildings of the court to the outer wall and thence to the hut on the rue du but in that itinerary there existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility 
 had he placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the to the outer wall and crawled flat on his belly on the coping of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut but the outer wall of la force formed a crenellated and unequal line it mounted and descended it dropped at the barracks it rose towards the it was cut in twain by buildings it was not even of the same height on the hotel lamoignon as on the rue pavee everywhere occurred falls and right angles and then the sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive hence the route taken by thenardier still remains rather inexplicable in two manners flight was impossible 
 had thenardier spurred on by that thirst for liberty which changes precipices into ditches iron bars into wattles of osier a legless man into an athlete a gouty man into a bird stupidity into instinct instinct into intelligence and intelligence into genius had thenardier invented a third mode no one has ever found out 
 the marvels of escape cannot always be accounted for 
 the man who makes his escape we repeat is inspired there is something of the star and of the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight the effort towards deliverance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime and one says of the escaped thief how did he contrive to scale that wall in the same way that one says of corneille 
 where did he find the means of dying 
 at all events dripping with perspiration drenched with rain with his clothes hanging in ribbons his hands flayed his elbows bleeding his knees torn thenardier had reached what children in their figurative language call the edge of the wall of the ruin there he had stretched himself out at full length and there his strength had failed him 
 a steep escarpment three stories high separated him from the pavement of the street 
 the rope which he had was too short 
 there he waited pale exhausted desperate with all the despair which he had undergone still hidden by the night but telling 
 himself that the day was on the point of dawning alarmed at the idea of hearing the neighboring clock of strike four within a few minutes an hour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found asleep under the pierced roof staring in horror at a terrible depth at the light of the street lanterns the wet black pavement that pavement longed for yet frightful which meant death and which meant liberty 
 he asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded if they had heard him and if they would come to his assistance he listened 
 with the exception of the patrol no one had passed through the street since he had been there 
 nearly the whole of the descent of the from montreuil from charonne from vincennes and from bercy to the markets was accomplished through the rue 
 four struck 
 thenardier shuddered 
 a few moments later that terrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape broke forth in the prison 
 the sound of doors opening and shutting the creaking of gratings on their hinges a tumult in the the hoarse shouts of the turnkeys the shock of on the pavement of the courts reached his ears lights ascended and descended past the grated windows of the dormitories a torch ran along the of the top story of the new building the firemen belonging in the barracks on the right had been summoned their helmets which the torch lighted up in the rain went and came along the roofs 
 at the same time thenardier perceived in the direction of the bastille a wan whiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise 
 he was on top of a wall ten inches wide stretched out under the heavy rains with two gulfs to right and left unable to stir subject to the giddiness of a possible fall and to the horror of a certain arrest and his thoughts like the pendulum of a clock swung from one of these ideas to the other 
 dead if i fall caught if i stay 
 in the midst of this anguish he suddenly saw the street being still dark a man who was gliding along the walls and coming from the rue pavee halt in the recess above which thenardier was as it were suspended 
 here this man was joined by a second who walked with the same caution then by a third then by a fourth 
 when these men were one of them lifted the latch of the gate in the fence and all four entered the enclosure in which the shanty stood 
 they halted directly under thenardier these men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order that they might consult without being seen by the or by the sentinel who guards the wicket of la force a few paces distant it must be added that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box 
 thenardier not being able to distinguish their visages lent an ear to their words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself lost 
 thenardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before his men conversed in slang 
 the first said in a low but distinct voice 
 cut 
 what are we up to here 
 the second replied 
 raining hard enough to put out the very fire 
 and the bobbies will be along instanter a soldier on guard yonder 
 we shall get nabbed here 
 these two words icigo and icicaille both of which mean ici and which belong the first to the slang of the barriers the second to the slang of the temple were flashes of light for thenardier by the icigo he recognized brujon who was a prowler of the barriers by the icicaille he knew babet who among his other trades had been an broker at the temple 
 the antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in the temple and babet was really the only person who spoke it in all its purity 
 had it not been for the icicaille thenardier would not have recognized him for he had entirely changed his voice 
 in the meanwhile the third man had intervened 
 no hurry yet wait a bit 
 how do we know that he stand in need of us 
 by this which was nothing but french thenardier recognized montparnasse who made it a point in his elegance to understand all slangs and to speak none of them 
 as for the fourth he held his peace but his huge shoulders betrayed him 
 thenardier did not hesitate 
 it was guelemer 
 brujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone 
 what are you jabbering about 
 the managed to cut his stick 
 he tumble to the racket that he you have to be a pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt cut up your sheet to make a rope punch holes in doors get up false papers make false keys file your irons hang out your cord hide yourself and disguise yourself 
 the old fellow managed to play it he understand how to work the business 
 babet added still in that classical slang which was spoken by poulailler and cartouche and which is to the bold new highly colored and risky argot used by brujon what the language of racine is to the language of andre chenier 
 your must have been nabbed in the act 
 you have to be knowing 
 only a greenhorn 
 he must have let himself be taken in by a bobby perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as his pal 
 listen montparnasse do you hear those shouts in the prison you have seen all those lights 
 recaptured there 
 get off with twenty years 
 i afraid i a coward but there anything more to do or otherwise lead us a dance 
 get mad come with us go drink a bottle of old wine together 
 one desert friends in a scrape grumbled montparnasse 
 i tell you nabbed retorted brujon 
 at the present moment the worth a we do nothing for him be off 
 every minute i think a bobby has got me in his fist 
 montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance the fact is that these four men with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon each other had prowled all night long about la force great as was their peril in the hope of seeing thenardier make his appearance on the top of some wall 
 but the night which was really growing too the downpour was such as to render all the streets cold which was overpowering them their soaked garments their shoes the alarming noise which had just burst forth in the prison the hours which had elapsed the patrol which they had encountered the hope which was vanishing all urged them to beat a retreat 
 montparnasse himself who was perhaps almost yielded 
 a moment more and they would be gone 
 thenardier was panting on his wall like the shipwrecked sufferers of the meduse on their raft when they beheld the vessel which had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon 
 he dared not call to them a cry might be heard and ruin everything an idea occurred to him a last idea a flash of inspiration he drew from his pocket the end of rope which he had detached from the chimney of the new building and flung it into the space enclosed by the fence 
 this rope fell at their feet 
 a widow said babet 
 argot of the temple 
 my tortouse said brujon 
 argot of the barriers 
 the is there said montparnasse 
 they raised their eyes 
 thenardier thrust out his head a very little 
 quick said montparnasse have you the other end of the rope brujon 
 yes 
 knot the two pieces together fling him the rope he can fasten it to the wall and have enough of it to get down with 
 thenardier ran the risk and spoke 
 i am paralyzed with cold 
 warm you up 
 i budge 
 let yourself slide catch you 
 my hands are benumbed 
 only fasten the rope to the wall 
 i 
 then one of us must climb up said montparnasse 
 three stories ejaculated brujon 
 an ancient plaster flue which had served for a stove that had been used in the shanty in former times ran along the wall and mounted almost to the very spot where they could see thenardier this flue then much damaged and full of cracks has since fallen but the marks of it are still visible 
 it was very narrow 
 one might get up by the help of that said montparnasse 
 by that flue exclaimed babet a cove never it would take a brat 
 a brat must be got resumed brujon 
 where are we to find a young un said guelemer 
 wait said montparnasse 
 got the very article 
 he opened the gate of the fence very softly made sure that no one was passing along the street stepped out cautiously shut the gate behind him and set off at a run in the direction of the bastille 
 seven or eight minutes elapsed eight thousand centuries to thenardier babet brujon and guelemer did not open their lips at last the gate opened once more and montparnasse appeared breathless and followed by gavroche 
 the rain still rendered the street completely deserted 
 little gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these ruffians with a tranquil air 
 the water was dripping from his hair guelemer addressed him 
 are you a man young un 
 gavroche shrugged his shoulders and replied 
 a young un like a man and men like you are babes 
 the well hung exclaimed babet 
 the paris brat made of straw added brujon 
 what do you want asked gavroche 
 montparnasse answered 
 climb up that flue 
 with this rope said babet 
 and fasten it continued brujon 
 to the top of the wall went on babet 
 to the of the window added brujon 
 and then said gavroche 
 there said guelemer 
 the gamin examined the rope the flue the wall the windows and made that indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies 
 is that all 
 a man up there whom you are to save resumed montparnasse 
 will you began brujon again 
 greenhorn replied the lad as though the question appeared a most unprecedented one to him 
 and he took off his shoes 
 guelemer seized gavroche by one arm set him on the roof of the shanty whose planks bent beneath the weight and handed him the rope which brujon had knotted together during absence 
 the gamin directed his steps towards the flue which it was easy to enter thanks to a large crack which touched the roof 
 at the moment when he was on the point of ascending thenardier who saw life and safety approaching bent over the edge of the wall the first light of dawn struck white upon his brow dripping with sweat upon his livid his sharp and savage nose his bristling gray beard and gavroche recognized him 
 hullo my father 
 oh that hinder 
 and taking the rope in his teeth he resolutely began the ascent 
 he reached the summit of the hut bestrode the old wall as though it had been a horse 
 and knotted the rope firmly to the upper of the window 
 a moment later thenardier was in the street 
 as soon as he touched the pavement as soon as he found himself out of danger he was no longer either weary or chilled or trembling the terrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke all that strange and ferocious mind awoke once more and stood erect and free ready to march onward 
 these were this first words 
 now whom are we to eat 
 it is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent remark which signifies both to kill to assassinate and to plunder to eat true sense 
 to devour 
 get well into a corner said brujon 
 settle it in three words and part at once 
 there was an affair that promised well in the rue plumet a deserted street an isolated house an old rotten gate on a garden and lone women 
 well why not demanded thenardier 
 your girl eponine went to see about the matter replied babet 
 and she brought a biscuit to magnon added guelemer 
 nothing to be made there 
 the no fool said thenardier 
 still it must be seen to 
 yes yes said brujon it must be looked up 
 in the meanwhile none of the men seemed to see gavroche who during this colloquy had seated himself on one of the he waited a few moments thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him then he put on his shoes again and said 
 is that all 
 you want any more my men 
 now out of your scrape 
 off 
 i must go and get my brats out of bed 
 and off he went 
 the five men emerged one after another from the enclosure 
 when gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the rue des ballets babet took thenardier aside 
 did you take a good look at that young un he asked 
 what young un 
 the one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope 
 not particularly 
 well i know but it strikes me that it was your son 
 bah said thenardier do you think so

 book eleven 
 chapter xxvi 
 
 toward four in the afternoon troops were entering moscow in front rode a detachment of wurttemberg hussars and behind them rode the king of naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite 
 about the middle of the arbat street near the church of the miraculous icon of st nicholas murat halted to await news from the advanced detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel le kremlin 
 around murat gathered a group of those who had remained in moscow they all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange commander dressed up in feathers and gold 
 is that their tsar himself not bad low voices could be heard saying 
 an interpreter rode up to the group 
 take off your cap your caps these words went from one to another in the crowd the interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it was far to the kremlin the porter listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking russian did not understand what was being said to him and slipped behind the others 
 murat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the russian army was one of the russians understood what was asked and several voices at once began answering the interpreter a french officer returning from the advanced detachment rode up to murat and reported that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was probably an ambuscade there 
 good said murat and turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates 
 the guns emerged at a trot from the column following murat and advanced up the arbat when they reached the end of the vozdvizhenka street they halted and drew in the square several french officers superintended the placing of the guns and looked at the kremlin through field glasses 
 the bells in the kremlin were ringing for vespers and this sound troubled the french they imagined it to be a call to arms a few infantrymen ran to the kutafyev gate beams and wooden screens had been put there and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as an officer and men began to run toward it a general who was standing by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer and the latter ran back again with his men 
 the sound of three more shots came from the gate 
 one shot struck a french foot and from behind the screens came the strange sound of a few voices shouting instantly as at a word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the french general officers and men changed to one of determined concentrated readiness for strife and suffering to all of them from the marshal to the least soldier that place was not the vozdvizhenka mokhavaya or kutafyev street nor the troitsa gate places familiar in moscow but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary and all made ready for that battle the cries from the gates ceased the guns were advanced the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks and an officer gave the word fire this was followed by two whistling sounds of canister shot one after another the shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over the square 
 a few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the kremlin had died away the french heard a strange sound above their head thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the air cawing and noisily flapping their wings together with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a coat he grasped a musket and took aim at the french fire repeated the officer once more and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously the gate again hidden by smoke 
 nothing more stirred behind the screens and the french infantry soldiers and officers advanced to the gate in the gateway lay three wounded and four dead two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall toward the znamenka 
 clear that away said the officer pointing to the beams and the corpses and the french soldiers after dispatching the wounded threw the corpses over the parapet 
 who these men were nobody knew clear that away was all that was said of them and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that they might not stink thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to their memory these wretches had occupied the sacred citadel having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal and fired the wretches at the french some of them were sabered and the kremlin was purged of their presence 
 murat was informed that the way had been cleared the french entered the gates and began pitching their camp in the senate square out of the windows of the senate house the soldiers threw chairs into the square for fuel and kindled fires there 
 other detachments passed through the kremlin and encamped along the moroseyka the lubyanka and pokrovka streets others quartered themselves along the vozdvizhenka the nikolski and the tverskoy streets no masters of the houses being found anywhere the french were not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as in a camp 
 though tattered hungry worn out and reduced to a third of their original number the french entered moscow in good marching order it was a weary and famished but still a fighting and menacing army but it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their different lodgings as soon as the men of the various regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses the army was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript neither citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders when five weeks later these same men left moscow they no longer formed an army they were a mob of marauders each carrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him valuable or useful the aim of each man when he left moscow was no longer as it had been to conquer but merely to keep what he had acquired like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of a jug and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds and therefore perishes the french when they left moscow had inevitably to perish because they carried their loot with them yet to abandon what they had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let go of its nuts ten minutes after each regiment had entered a moscow district not a soldier or officer was left men in military uniforms and hessian boots could be seen through the windows laughing and walking through the rooms in cellars and storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions and in the yards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with sleeves and cooking or frightening amusing or caressing women and children there were many such men both in the shops and houses but there was no army 
 order after order was issued by the french commanders that day forbidding the men to disperse about the town sternly forbidding any violence to the inhabitants or any looting and announcing a roll call for that very evening but despite all these measures the men who had till then constituted an army flowed all over the wealthy deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies as a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich pastures so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city 
 no residents were left in moscow and the soldiers like water percolating through sand spread irresistibly through the city in all directions from the kremlin into which they had first marched the cavalry on entering a house that had been abandoned and finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses went on all the same to the next house which seemed to them better many of them appropriated several houses chalked their names on them and quarreled and even fought with other companies for them before they had had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city and hearing that everything had been abandoned rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the taking the officers followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same in carriage row carriages had been left in the shops and generals flocked there to select caleches and coaches for themselves the few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered there were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it all around the quarters occupied by the french were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where they thought yet greater riches might be found and moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper when water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city 
 the french attributed the fire of moscow au patriotisme feroce de rostopchine the russians to the barbarity of the french in reality however it was not and could not be possible to explain the burning of moscow by making any individual or any group of people responsible for it moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which any town built of wood was bound to burn quite apart from whether it had or had not a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines deserted moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several days a town built of wood where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police force is present cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes make campfires of the senate chairs in the senate square and cook themselves meals twice a day in peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in that district immediately increases how much then must the probability of fire be increased in an abandoned wooden town where foreign troops are quartered le patriotisme feroce de rostopchine and the barbarity of the french were not to blame in the matter moscow was set on fire by the soldiers pipes kitchens and campfires and by the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own even if there was any arson which is very doubtful for no one had any reason to burn the houses in any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do arson cannot be regarded as the cause for the same thing would have happened without any incendiarism 
 to ferocious patriotism 
 however tempting it might be for the french to blame ferocity and for russians to blame the scoundrel bonaparte or later on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people it is impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the fire for moscow had to burn as every village factory or house must burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge moscow was burned by its inhabitants it is true but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained in it moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like berlin vienna and other towns simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the french with bread and salt nor bring them the keys of the city

 book 
 chapter i 
 
 origin 
 pigritia is a terrible word 
 it engenders a whole world la pegre for which read theft and a hell la pegrenne for which read hunger 
 thus idleness is the mother 
 she has a son theft and a daughter hunger 
 where are we at this moment 
 in the land of slang 
 what is slang 
 it is at one and the same time a nation and a dialect it is theft in its two kinds people and language 
 when four and thirty years ago the narrator of this grave and sombre history introduced into a work written with the same aim as this a thief who talked argot there arose amazement and how 
 argot 
 why argot is horrible it is the language of prisons galleys convicts of everything that is most abominable in society etc etc 
 the last day of a condemned man 
 we have never understood this sort of objections 
 since that time two powerful romancers one of whom is a profound observer of the human heart the other an intrepid friend of the people balzac and eugene sue having represented their ruffians as talking their natural language as the author of the last day of a condemned man did in the same objections have been raised people repeated 
 what do authors mean by that revolting dialect slang is odious 
 slang makes one shudder 
 who denies that 
 of course it does 
 when it is a question of probing a wound a gulf a society since when has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom 
 we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and fulfilled merits why should one not explore everything and study everything why should one halt on the way 
 the halt is a matter depending on the and not on the leadsman 
 certainly too it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to undertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order where terra firma comes to an end and where mud begins to rummage in those vague murky waves to follow up to seize and to fling still quivering upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with filth when thus brought to the light that pustulous vocabulary each word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the shadows 
 nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang 
 it seems in fact to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool one thinks one beholds a frightful living and bristling thicket which quivers rustles wavers returns to shadow threatens and glares one word resembles a claw another an extinguished and bleeding eye such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab all this is alive with the hideous vitality of things which have been organized out of disorganization 
 now when has horror ever excluded study 
 since when has malady banished medicine 
 can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper the bat the scorpion the centipede the tarantula and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying 
 oh how ugly that is 
 the thinker who should turn aside from slang would resemble a surgeon who should avert his face from an ulcer or a wart he would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity for it must be stated to those who are ignorant of the case that argot is both a literary phenomenon and a social result what is slang properly speaking 
 it is the language of wretchedness 
 we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating it we may be told that all trades professions it may be added all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence have their own slang the merchant who says 
 montpellier not active marseilles fine quality the broker on change who says 
 assets at end of current month the gambler who says 
 tiers et tout refait de pique the sheriff of the norman isles who says 
 the holder in fee reverting to his landed estate cannot claim the fruits of that estate during the hereditary seizure of the real estate by the mortgagor the playwright who says the piece was hissed the comedian who says 
 made a hit the philosopher who says 
 phenomenal triplicity the huntsman who says 
 voileci allais voileci fuyant the phrenologist who says 
 amativeness combativeness secretiveness the infantry soldier who says 
 my the who says my the who says 
 tierce quarte break the printer who says 
 my and printer cavalry dragoon phrenologist huntsman philosopher comedian playwright sheriff gambler and merchant speak slang 
 the painter who says my grinder the notary who says 
 my the hairdresser who says 
 my mealyback the cobbler who says my cub talks slang 
 strictly speaking if one absolutely insists on the point all the different fashions of saying the right and the left the port and starboard the and the and are slang there is the slang of the affected lady as well as of the precieuses the hotel rambouillet nearly adjoins the cour des miracles 
 there is a slang of duchesses witness this phrase contained in a from a very great lady and a very pretty woman of the restoration you will find in this gossip a fultitude of reasons why i should libertize diplomatic ciphers are slang the pontifical chancellery by using for rome grkztntgzyal for despatch and abfxustgrnogrkzu tu xi 
 for the due de modena speaks slang the physicians of the middle ages who for carrot radish and turnip said opoponach perfroschinum reptitalmus dracatholicum angelorum postmegorum talked slang 
 the who says loaf clarified lumps bastard common honest manufacturer talks slang 
 a certain school of criticism twenty years ago which used to say 
 half of the works of shakespeare consists of plays upon words and slang 
 the poet and the artist who with profound understanding would designate m de montmorency as a bourgeois if he were not a judge of verses and statues speak slang 
 the classic academician who calls flowers flora fruits pomona the sea neptune love fires beauty charms a horse a courser the white or tricolored cockade the rose of bellona the hat mars classical academician talks slang 
 algebra medicine botany have each their slang the tongue which is employed on board ship that wonderful language of the sea which is so complete and so picturesque which was spoken by jean bart duquesne suffren and duperre which mingles with the whistling of the rigging the sound of the the shock of the the roll of the sea the wind the gale the cannon is wholly a heroic and dazzling slang which is to the fierce slang of the thieves what the lion is to the jackal 
 vous trouverez dans ces une foultitude de raisons pour que je me libertise 
 no doubt 
 but say what we will this manner of understanding the word slang is an extension which every one will not admit for our part we reserve to the word its ancient and precise circumscribed and determined significance and we restrict slang to slang 
 the veritable slang and the slang that is slang if the two words can be coupled thus the slang immemorial which was a kingdom is nothing else we repeat than the homely uneasy crafty treacherous venomous cruel equivocal vile profound fatal tongue of wretchedness 
 there exists at the extremity of all abasement and all misfortunes a last misery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into conflict with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights a fearful conflict where now cunning now violent unhealthy and ferocious at one and the same time it attacks the social order with through vice and with through crime 
 to meet the needs of this conflict wretchedness has invented a language of combat which is slang 
 to keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the gulf were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of which civilization is composed or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself 
 this service plautus rendered consciously or unconsciously by making two carthaginian soldiers talk phoenician that service moliere rendered by making so many of his characters talk levantine and all sorts of dialects here objections spring up afresh 
 phoenician very good levantine quite right 
 even dialect let that pass 
 they are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces but slang what is the use of preserving slang 
 what is the good of assisting slang to survive 
 to this we reply in one word only 
 assuredly if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study 
 it is the language which has been spoken in france for example for more than four centuries not only by a misery but by every possible human misery 
 and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy is not a business in which choice is permitted the historian of manners and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events 
 the latter has the surface of civilization the conflicts of crowns the births of princes the marriages of kings battles assemblages great public men revolutions in the daylight everything on the exterior the other historian has the interior the depths the people who toil suffer wait the oppressed woman the agonizing child the secret war between man and man obscure ferocities prejudices plotted iniquities the subterranean the indistinct tremors of multitudes the the of the law the secret evolution of souls the the the disinherited the orphans the unhappy and the infamous all the forms which roam through the darkness 
 he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge to those impenetrable casemates where crawl those who bleed and those who deal the blow those who weep and those who curse those who fast and those who devour those who endure evil and those who inflict it 
 have these historians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians of external facts 
 does any one think that alighieri has any fewer things to say than machiavelli is the under side of civilization any less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre 
 do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern 
 let us say moreover parenthetically that from a few words of what precedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes of historians which does not exist in our mind no one is a good historian of the patent visible striking and public life of peoples if he is not at the same time in a certain measure the historian of their deep and hidden life and no one is a good historian of the interior unless he understands how at need to be the historian of the exterior also the history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events and this is true reciprocally 
 they constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other which are always interlaced and which often bring forth results 
 all the lineaments which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels sombre but distinct in their depths and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullitions on the surface 
 true history being a mixture of all things the true historian mingles in everything 
 man is not a circle with a single centre he is an ellipse with a double focus 
 facts form one of these and ideas the other 
 slang is nothing but a where the tongue having some bad action to perform disguises itself 
 there it clothes itself in in in this guise it becomes horrible 
 one finds it difficult to recognize 
 is it really the french tongue the great human tongue 
 behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort upon crime and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of evil 
 it no longer walks it hobbles it limps on the crutch of the court of miracles a crutch metamorphosable into a club it is called vagrancy every sort of spectre its dressers have painted its face it crawls and rears the double gait of the reptile 
 henceforth it is apt at all roles it is made suspicious by the counterfeiter covered with verdigris by the forger blacked by the soot of the incendiary and the murderer applies its rouge 
 when one listens by the side of honest men at the portals of society one overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside one distinguishes questions and replies 
 one perceives without understanding it a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word it is slang 
 the words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic bestiality 
 one thinks one hears hydras talking 
 it is unintelligible in the dark 
 it gnashes and whispers completing the gloom with mystery 
 it is black in misfortune it is blacker still in crime these two blacknesses amalgamated compose slang 
 obscurity in the atmosphere obscurity in acts obscurity in voices 
 terrible tongue which goes and comes leaps crawls slobbers and stirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain and night of hunger of vice of falsehood of injustice of nudity of suffocation and of winter the high noonday of the miserable 
 let us have compassion on the chastised 
 alas 
 who are we ourselves who am i who now address you 
 who are you who are listening to me and are you very sure that we have done nothing before we were born the earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail 
 who knows whether man is not a recaptured offender against divine justice look closely at life 
 it is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment 
 are you what is called a happy man 
 well you are sad every day each day has its own great grief or its little care 
 yesterday you were trembling for a health that is dear to you you fear for your own it will be anxiety about money the day after the diatribe of a slanderer the day after that the misfortune of some friend then the prevailing weather then something that has been broken or lost then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral column reproach you again the course of public affairs 
 this without reckoning in the pains of the heart and so it goes on 
 one cloud is dispelled another forms there is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny 
 and you belong to that small class who are happy as for the rest of mankind stagnating night rests upon them 
 thoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase 
 the fortunate and the unfortunate 
 in this world evidently the vestibule of another there are no fortunate 
 the real human division is this 
 the luminous and the shady to diminish the number of the shady to augment the number of the is the object 
 that is why we cry education science 
 to teach reading means to light the fire every syllable spelled out sparkles 
 however he who says light does not necessarily say joy people suffer in the light excess burns 
 the flame is the enemy of the wing 
 to burn without ceasing to lies the marvel of genius 
 when you shall have learned to know and to love you will still suffer 
 the day is born in tears 
 the luminous weep if only over those in darkness

 chapter xxvii 
 
 the absorption of the french by moscow radiating starwise as it did only reached the quarter where pierre was staying by the evening of the second of september 
 after the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances pierre was in a state bordering on insanity he was completely obsessed by one persistent thought he did not know how or when this thought had taken such possession of him but he remembered nothing of the past understood nothing of the present and all he saw and heard appeared to him like a dream 
 he had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of demands that enmeshed him and which in his present condition he was unable to unravel he had gone to joseph house on the plea of sorting the books and papers only in search of rest from turmoil for in his mind the memory of joseph alexeevich was connected with a world of eternal solemn and calm thoughts quite contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being drawn he sought a quiet refuge and in joseph study he really found it when he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study calm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination particularly of the battle of borodino and of that vague sense of his own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth simplicity and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they when gerasim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of moscow which he knew was projected and with that object he had asked gerasim to get him a coat and a pistol confiding to him his intentions of remaining in joseph house and keeping his name secret then during the first day spent in inaction and solitude he tried several times to fix his attention on the masonic manuscripts but was unable to do so the idea that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in connection with more than once vaguely presented itself but the idea that he besuhof was destined to set a limit to the power of the beast was as yet only one of the fancies that often passed through his mind and left no trace behind 
 when having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among the people in the defense of moscow pierre had met the rostovs and natasha had said to him are you remaining in moscow how splendid the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing even if moscow were taken for him to remain there and do what he was predestined to do 
 next day with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in any way behind them pierre went to the three hills gate but when he returned to the house convinced that moscow would not be defended he suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable he must remain in moscow concealing his name and must meet napoleon and kill him and either perish or put an end to the misery of all europe which it seemed to him was solely due to napoleon 
 pierre knew all the details of the attempt on life in by a german student in vienna and knew that the student had been shot and the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his design excited him still more 
 two equally strong feelings drew pierre irresistibly to this purpose the first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in view of the common calamity the same feeling that had caused him to go to mozhaysk on the and to make his way to the very thick of the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and in place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed to sleep on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as gerasim the other was that vague and quite russian feeling of contempt for everything conventional artificial and human for everything the majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world pierre had first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the sloboda palace when he had suddenly felt that wealth power and life all that men so painstakingly acquire and guard if it has any worth has so only by reason the joy with which it can all be renounced 
 it was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last penny on drink and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he possesses the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from an ordinary point of view are insane to test as it were his personal power and strength affirming the existence of a higher nonhuman criterion of life 
 from the very day pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time at the sloboda palace he had been continuously under its influence but only now found full satisfaction for it moreover at this moment pierre was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he had already done in that direction if he were now to leave moscow like everyone else his flight from home the peasant coat the pistol and his announcement to the rostovs that he would remain in moscow would all become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous and to this pierre was very sensitive 
 physical condition as is always the case corresponded to his mental state the unaccustomed coarse food the vodka he drank during those days the absence of wine and cigars his dirty unchanged linen two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding all this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity 
 it was two in the afternoon the french had already entered moscow pierre knew this but instead of acting he only thought about his undertaking going over its minutest details in his mind in his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the blow or the death of napoleon but with extraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance 
 yes alone for the sake of all i must do it or perish he thought yes i will approach and then suddenly with pistol or dagger but that is all the same it is not i but the hand of providence that punishes thee i shall say thought he imagining what he would say when killing napoleon well then take me and execute me he went on speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression 
 while pierre standing in the middle of the room was talking to himself in this way the study door opened and on the threshold appeared the figure of makar alexeevich always so timid before but now quite transformed 
 his dressing gown was unfastened his face red and distorted he was obviously drunk on seeing pierre he grew confused at first but noticing embarrassment on face immediately grew bold and staggering on his thin legs advanced into the middle of the room 
 frightened he said confidentially in a hoarse voice i say i surrender i say am i not right sir 
 he paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor 
 gerasim and the porter who had followed makar alexeevich stopped him in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him pierre coming out into the corridor looked with pity and repulsion at the old man makar alexeevich frowning with exertion held on to the pistol and screamed hoarsely evidently with some heroic fancy in his head 
 to arms board them no you get it he yelled 
 that will do please that will do have the goodness please sir to let go please sir pleaded gerasim trying carefully to steer makar alexeevich by the elbows back to the door 
 who are you bonaparte shouted makar alexeevich 
 not right sir come to your room please and rest allow me to have the pistol 
 be off thou base slave touch me not see this shouted makar alexeevich brandishing the pistol board them 
 catch hold whispered gerasim to the porter 
 they seized makar alexeevich by the arms and dragged him to the door 
 the vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of a tipsy hoarse voice 
 suddenly a fresh sound a piercing feminine scream reverberated from the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule 
 them gracious heavens o lord four of them horsemen she cried 
 gerasim and the porter let makar alexeevich go and in the now silent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be heard

 roots 
 slang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness 
 thought is moved in its most sombre depths social philosophy is bidden to its most poignant meditations in the presence of that enigmatic dialect at once so blighted and rebellious therein lies chastisement made visible 
 every syllable has an air of being marked 
 the words of the vulgar tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled as it were beneath the hot iron of the executioner 
 some seem to be still smoking 
 such and such a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a thief branded with the which has suddenly been laid bare ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which are fugitives from justice 
 metaphor is sometimes so shameless that one feels that it has worn the iron 
 moreover in spite of all this and because of all this this strange dialect has by rights its own compartment in that great impartial case of where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as for the gold medal and which is called literature slang whether the public admit the fact or not has its syntax and its poetry 
 it is a language 
 yes by the deformity of certain terms we recognize the fact that it was chewed by mandrin and by the splendor of certain metonymies we feel that villon spoke it 
 that exquisite and celebrated verse 
 mais ou sont les neiges 
 but where are the snows of years gone by 
 is a verse of slang 
 a word of thunes slang which signified the past year and by extension formerly years ago at the epoch of the departure of the great there could be read in one of the cells at bicetre this maxim engraved with a nail on the wall by a king of thunes condemned to the galleys 
 les dabs trimaient siempre pour la pierre du coesre 
 this means kings in days gone by always went and had themselves anointed 
 in the opinion of that king anointment meant the galleys 
 the word decarade which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles at a gallop is attributed to villon and it is worthy of him this word which strikes fire with all four of its feet sums up in a masterly onomatopoeia the whole of la admirable verse 
 six forts chevaux tiraient un coche 
 six stout horses drew a coach 
 from a purely literary point of view few studies would prove more curious and fruitful than the study of slang 
 it is a whole language within a language a sort of sickly excrescence an unhealthy graft which has produced a vegetation a parasite which has its roots in the old gallic trunk and whose sinister foliage crawls all over one side of the language 
 this is what may be called the first the vulgar aspect of slang 
 but for those who study the tongue as it should be studied that is to say as geologists study the earth slang appears like a veritable alluvial deposit 
 according as one digs a longer or shorter distance into it one finds in slang below the old popular french provencal spanish italian levantine that language of the mediterranean ports english and german the romance language in its three varieties french italian and romance romance latin and finally basque and celtic 
 a profound and unique formation a subterranean edifice erected in common by all the miserable each accursed race has deposited its layer each suffering has dropped its stone there each heart has contributed its pebble a throng of evil base or irritated souls who have traversed life and have vanished into eternity linger there almost entirely visible still beneath the form of some monstrous word 
 do you want spanish 
 the old gothic slang abounded in it here is boffete a box on the ear which is derived from bofeton vantane window later on vanterne which comes from vantana gat cat which comes from gato acite oil which comes from aceyte do you want italian 
 here is spade sword which comes from spada carvel boat which comes from caravella 
 do you want english here is bichot which comes from bishop raille spy which comes from rascal rascalion pilche a case which comes from pilcher a sheath do you want german 
 here is the caleur the waiter kellner the hers the master herzog duke do you want latin 
 here is frangir to break frangere affurer to steal fur cadene chain catena there is one word which crops up in every language of the continent with a sort of mysterious power and authority 
 it is the word magnus the scotchman makes of it his mac which designates the chief of the clan the great farlane the great callumore slang turns it into meck and later le meg that is to say god 
 would you like basque 
 here is gahisto the devil which comes from gaiztoa evil sorgabon good night which comes from gabon good evening 
 do you want celtic here is blavin a handkerchief which comes from blavet gushing water menesse a woman in a bad sense which comes from meinec full of stones barant brook from baranton fountain goffeur locksmith from goff blacksmith guedouze death which comes from finally would you like history 
 slang calls crowns les malteses a souvenir of the coin in circulation on the galleys of malta 
 it must be observed however that mac in celtic means son 
 in addition to the philological origins just indicated slang possesses other and still more natural roots which spring so to speak from the mind of man itself 
 in the first place the direct creation of words 
 therein lies the mystery of tongues 
 to paint with words which contains figures one knows not how or why is the primitive foundation of all human languages what may be called their granite 
 slang abounds in words of this description immediate words words created instantaneously no one knows either where or by whom without etymology without analogies without derivatives solitary barbarous sometimes hideous words which at times possess a singular power of expression and which live 
 the executioner le taule the forest le sabri fear flight taf the lackey le larbin the mineral the prefect the minister pharos the devil le rabouin nothing is stranger than these words which both mask and reveal some le rabouin for example are at the same time grotesque and terrible and produce on you the effect of a cyclopean grimace 
 ln the second place metaphor 
 the peculiarity of a language which is desirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in figures 
 metaphor is an enigma wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke the prisoner who is arranging an escape take refuge no idiom is more metaphorical than slang 
 devisser le coco to unscrew the nut to twist the neck tortiller to wriggle to eat etre gerbe to be tried a rat a bread thief il lansquine it rains a striking ancient figure which partly bears its date about it which assimilates long oblique lines of rain with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers and which compresses into a single word the popular expression 
 it rains halberds 
 sometimes in proportion as slang progresses from the first epoch to the second words pass from the primitive and savage sense to the metaphorical sense the devil ceases to be le rabouin and becomes le boulanger the baker who puts the bread into the oven 
 this is more witty but less grand something like racine after corneille like euripides after aeschylus 
 certain slang phrases which participate in the two epochs and have at once the barbaric character and the metaphorical character resemble phantasmagories 
 les sorgueuers vont solliciter des gails a la prowlers are going to steal horses by night this passes before the mind like a group of spectres 
 one knows not what one sees 
 in the third place the expedient 
 slang lives on the language it uses it in accordance with its fancy it dips into it and it often confines itself when occasion arises to alter it in a gross and summary fashion 
 occasionally with the ordinary words thus deformed and complicated with words of pure slang picturesque phrases are formed in which there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements the direct creation and the metaphor le cab jaspine je marronne que la roulotte de pantin trime dans le sabri the dog is barking i suspect that the diligence for paris is passing through the woods 
 le dab est sinve la dabuge est merloussiere la fee est bative the bourgeois is stupid the bourgeoise is cunning the daughter is pretty 
 generally to throw listeners off the track slang confines itself to adding to all the words of the language without distinction an ignoble tail a termination in aille in orgue in iergue or in uche 
 thus 
 vousiergue trouvaille bonorgue ce gigotmuche 
 do you think that leg of mutton good a phrase addressed by cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sum offered for his escape suited him 
 the termination in mar has been added recently 
 slang being the dialect of corruption quickly becomes corrupted itself besides this as it is always seeking concealment as soon as it feels that it is understood it changes its form 
 contrary to what happens with every other vegetation every ray of light which falls upon it kills whatever it touches 
 thus slang is in constant process of decomposition and recomposition an obscure and rapid work which never pauses 
 it passes over more ground in ten years than a language in ten centuries 
 thus le larton bread becomes le lartif le gail horse becomes le gaye la fertanche straw becomes la fertille le momignard brat le momacque les fiques duds frusques la chique the church le colabre neck le colas the devil is at first gahisto then le rabouin then the baker the priest is a ratichon then the boar le sanglier the dagger is le then le surin then le lingre the police are railles then roussins then rousses then marchands de lacets dealers in then coquers then cognes the executioner is le taule then charlot then le becquillard in the seventeenth century to fight was to give each other snuff in the nineteenth it is to chew each throats there have been twenty different phrases between these two extremes talk would have been hebrew to lacenaire 
 all the words of this language are perpetually engaged in flight like the men who utter them 
 still from time to time and in consequence of this very movement the ancient slang crops up again and becomes new once more 
 it has its headquarters where it maintains its sway 
 the temple preserved the slang of the seventeenth century bicetre when it was a prison preserved the slang of thunes 
 there one could hear the termination in anche of the old thuneurs 
 do you drink but perpetual movement remains its law nevertheless 
 if the philosopher succeeds in fixing for a moment for purposes of observation this language which is incessantly evaporating he falls into doleful and useful meditation 
 no study is more efficacious and more fecund in instruction 
 there is not a metaphor not an analogy in slang which does not contain a lesson among these men to beat means to feign one beats a malady ruse is their strength 
 for them the idea of the man is not separated from the idea of darkness 
 the night is called la sorgue man man is a derivative of the night 
 they have taken up the practice of considering society in the light of an atmosphere which kills them of a fatal force and they speak of their liberty as one would speak of his health a man under arrest is a sick man one who is condemned is a dead man 
 the most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls in which he is buried is a sort of glacial chastity and he calls the dungeon the castus 
 in that funereal place life outside always presents itself under its most smiling aspect 
 the prisoner has irons on his feet you think perhaps that his thought is that it is with the feet that one walks 
 no he is thinking that it is with the feet that one dances so when he has succeeded in severing his fetters his first idea is that now he can dance and he calls the saw the bastringue name is a centre profound ruffian has two heads one of which reasons out his actions and leads him all his life long and the other which he has upon his shoulders on the day of his death he calls the head which counsels him in crime la sorbonne and the head which expiates it la a man has no longer anything but rags upon his body and vices in his heart when he has arrived at that double moral and material degradation which the word blackguard characterizes in its two acceptations he is ripe for crime he is like a knife he has two cutting edges his distress and his malice so slang does not say a blackguard it says un are the galleys a brazier of damnation a hell 
 the convict calls himself a fagot and finally what name do malefactors give to their prison the college 
 a whole penitentiary system can be evolved from that word 
 does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of the galleys those refrains called in the special vocabulary lirlonfa have had their birth 
 let him listen to what follows 
 there existed at the chatelet in paris a large and long cellar this cellar was eight feet below the level of the seine 
 it had neither windows nor its only aperture was the door men could enter there air could not 
 this vault had for ceiling a vault of stone and for floor ten inches of mud 
 it was flagged but the pavement had rotted and cracked under the oozing of the water eight feet above the floor a long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side to side from this beam hung at short distances apart chains three feet long and at the end of these chains there were rings for the neck 
 in this vault men who had been condemned to the galleys were incarcerated until the day of their departure for toulon 
 they were thrust under this beam where each one found his fetters swinging in the darkness and waiting for him 
 the chains those pendant arms and the necklets those open hands caught the unhappy wretches by the throat 
 they were rivetted and left there 
 as the chain was too short they could not lie down they remained motionless in that cavern in that night beneath that beam almost hanging forced to efforts to reach their bread jug or their vault overhead mud even to filth flowing to their very calves broken asunder with fatigue with thighs and knees giving way clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain some rest unable to sleep except when standing erect and awakened every moment by the strangling of the collar some woke no more 
 in order to eat they pushed the bread which was flung to them in the mud along their leg with their heel until it reached their hand 
 how long did they remain thus 
 one month two months six months sometimes one stayed a year 
 it was the antechamber of the galleys men were put there for stealing a hare from the king 
 in this what did they do 
 what man can do in a sepulchre they went through the agonies of death and what can man do in hell they sang for song lingers where there is no longer any hope in the waters of malta when a galley was approaching the song could be heard before the sound of the oars 
 poor survincent the poacher who had gone through the of the chatelet said it was the rhymes that kept me up 
 uselessness of poetry what is the good of rhyme 
 it is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth 
 it is from the dungeon of the of paris that comes the melancholy refrain of the montgomery galley timaloumisaine timaloumison 
 the majority of these 
 icicaille est la theatre 
 here is the theatre 
 du petit dardant 
 of the little archer cupid 
 do what you will you cannot annihilate that eternal relic in the heart of man love 
 in this world of dismal deeds people keep their secrets the secret is the thing above all others 
 the secret in the eyes of these wretches is unity which serves as a base of union to betray a secret is to tear from each member of this fierce community something of his own personality 
 to inform against in the energetic slang dialect is called 
 to eat the bit as though the informer drew to himself a little of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit of each flesh 
 what does it signify to receive a box on the ear commonplace metaphor replies 
 it is to see candles 
 here slang intervenes and takes it up 
 candle camoufle thereupon the ordinary tongue gives camouflet as the synonym for soufflet 
 thus by a sort of infiltration from below upwards with the aid of metaphor that incalculable trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to the academy and poulailler saying i light my camoufle causes voltaire to write 
 langleviel la beaumelle deserves a hundred camouflets 
 smoke puffed in the face of a person asleep 
 researches in slang mean discoveries at every step 
 study and investigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point of intersection of regular society with society which is accursed 
 the thief also has his food for cannon stealable matter you i whoever passes by le pantre 
 pan everybody 
 slang is language turned convict 
 that the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever so low that it can be dragged and pinioned there by obscure tyrannies of fatality that it can be bound by no one knows what fetters in that abyss is sufficient to create consternation 
 oh poor thought of miserable wretches 
 alas will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness is it her destiny there to await forever the mind the liberator the immense rider of pegasi and the combatant of heroes of the dawn who shall descend from the azure between two wings the radiant knight of the future 
 will she forever summon in vain to her assistance the lance of light of the ideal 
 is she condemned to hear the fearful approach of evil through the density of the gulf and to catch glimpses nearer and nearer at hand beneath the hideous water of that head that maw streaked with foam and that writhing undulation of claws swellings and rings must it remain there without a gleam of light without hope given over to that terrible approach vaguely scented out by the monster shuddering dishevelled wringing its arms forever chained to the rock of night a sombre andromeda white and naked amid the shadows

 chapter xxviii 
 
 pierre having decided that until he had carried out his design he would disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of french stood at the door of the corridor intending to conceal himself as soon as the french entered but the french entered and still pierre did not retire an irresistible curiosity kept him there 
 there were two of them one was an officer a tall soldierly handsome man the other evidently a private or an orderly sunburned short and thin with sunken cheeks and a dull expression the officer walked in front leaning on a stick and slightly limping when he had advanced a few steps he stopped having apparently decided that these were good quarters turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance and in a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses having done that the officer lifting his elbow with a smart gesture stroked his mustache and lightly touched his hat 
 bonjour la compagnie said he gaily smiling and looking about him 
 good day everybody 
 no one gave any reply 
 vous etes le bourgeois the officer asked gerasim 
 are you the master here 
 gerasim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look 
 quartier quartier logement said the officer looking down at the little man with a condescending and smile les francais sont de bons enfants que diable voyons ne nous fachons pas mon vieux added he clapping the scared and silent gerasim on the shoulder well does no one speak french in this establishment he asked again in french looking around and meeting eyes pierre moved away from the door 
 quarters quarters lodgings the french are good fellows what the devil there let us be cross old fellow 
 again the officer turned to gerasim and asked him to show him the rooms in the house 
 master not here understand me you said gerasim trying to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them 
 still smiling the french officer spread out his hands before nose intimating that he did not understand him either and moved limping to the door at which pierre was standing pierre wished to go away and conceal himself but at that moment he saw makar alexeevich appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand with a cunning makar alexeevich eyed the frenchman raised his pistol and took aim 
 board them yelled the tipsy man trying to press the trigger hearing the yell the officer turned round and at the same moment pierre threw himself on the drunkard just when pierre snatched at and struck up the pistol makar alexeevich at last got his fingers on the trigger there was a deafening report and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke the frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door 
 forgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of french pierre snatching away the pistol and throwing it down ran up to the officer and addressed him in french 
 you are not wounded he asked 
 i think not answered the frenchman feeling himself over but i have had a lucky escape this time he added pointing to the damaged plaster of the wall who is that man said he looking sternly at pierre 
 oh i am really in despair at what has occurred said pierre rapidly quite forgetting the part he had intended to play he is an unfortunate madman who did not know what he was doing 
 the officer went up to makar alexeevich and took him by the collar 
 makar alexeevich was standing with parted lips swaying as if about to fall asleep as he leaned against the wall 
 brigand you shall pay for this said the frenchman letting go of him we french are merciful after victory but we do not pardon traitors he added with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic gesture 
 pierre continued in french to persuade the officer not to hold that drunken imbecile to account the frenchman listened in silence with the same gloomy expression but suddenly turned to pierre with a smile for a few seconds he looked at him in silence his handsome face assumed a melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand 
 you have saved my life you are french said he 
 for a frenchman that deduction was indubitable only a frenchman could perform a great deed and to save his life the life of m ramballe captain of the th light regiment was undoubtedly a very great deed 
 but however indubitable that conclusion and the conviction based upon it pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him 
 i am russian he said quickly 
 tut tut tut tell that to others said the officer waving his finger before his nose and smiling you shall tell me all about that presently i am delighted to meet a compatriot well and what are we to do with this man he added addressing himself to pierre as to a brother 
 even if pierre were not a frenchman having once received that loftiest of human appellations he could not renounce it said the look and tone in reply to his last question pierre again explained who makar alexeevich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from him and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished 
 the frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his arm 
 you have saved my life you are french you ask his pardon i grant it you lead that man away said he quickly and energetically and taking the arm of pierre whom he had promoted to be a frenchman for saving his life he went with him into the room 
 the soldiers in the yard hearing the shot came into the passage asking what had happened and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits but the officer sternly checked them 
 you will be called in when you are wanted he said 
 the soldiers went out again and the orderly who had meanwhile had time to visit the kitchen came up to his officer 
 captain there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen said he shall i serve them up 
 yes and some wine answered the captain

 slang which weeps and slang which laughs 
 as the reader perceives slang in its entirety slang of four hundred years ago like the slang of is permeated with that sombre symbolical spirit which gives to all words a mien which is now mournful now menacing 
 one feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of those vagrants of the court of miracles who played at cards with packs of their own some of which have come down to us 
 the eight of clubs for instance represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil leaves a sort of fantastic personification of the forest at the foot of this tree a fire was burning over which three hares were roasting a huntsman on a spit and behind him on another fire hung a steaming pot whence emerged the head of a dog 
 nothing can be more melancholy than these reprisals in painting by a pack of cards in the presence of stakes for the roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling of counterfeiters 
 the diverse forms assumed by thought in the realm of slang even song even raillery even menace all partook of this powerless and dejected character all the songs the melodies of some of which have been collected were humble and lamentable to the point of evoking tears the pegre is always the poor pegre and he is always the hare in hiding the fugitive mouse the flying bird 
 he hardly complains he contents himself with sighing one of his moans has come down to us 
 i do not understand how god the father of men can torture his children and his grandchildren and hear them cry without himself suffering torture the wretch whenever he has time to think makes himself small before the low and frail in the presence of society he lies down flat on his face he entreats he appeals to the side of compassion we feel that he is conscious of his guilt 
 je que le dail comment meck le daron des orgues peut atiger ses momes et ses momignards et les locher criblant sans etre agite 
 towards the middle of the last century a change took place prison songs and thieves ritournelles assumed so to speak an insolent and jovial mien 
 the plaintive malure was replaced by the larifla we find in the eighteenth century in nearly all the songs of the galleys and prisons a diabolical and enigmatical gayety we hear this strident and lilting refrain which we should say had been lighted up by a phosphorescent gleam and which seems to have been flung into the forest by a playing the fife 
 miralabi suslababo 
 mirliton ribonribette 
 surlababi mirlababo 
 mirliton ribonribo 
 this was sung in a cellar or in a nook of the forest while cutting a throat 
 a serious symptom 
 in the eighteenth century the ancient melancholy of the dejected classes vanishes 
 they began to laugh they rally the grand meg and the grand dab 
 given louis xv they call the king of france le marquis de pantin 
 and behold they are almost gay 
 a sort of gleam proceeds from these miserable wretches as though their consciences were not heavy within them any more 
 these lamentable tribes of darkness have no longer merely the desperate audacity of actions they possess the heedless audacity of mind 
 a sign that they are losing the sense of their criminality and that they feel even among thinkers and dreamers some indefinable support which the latter themselves know not of a sign that theft and pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines and sophisms in such a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness while communicating much of it to sophisms and doctrines 
 a sign in short of some outbreak which is prodigious and near unless some diversion shall arise 
 let us pause a moment 
 whom are we accusing here 
 is it the eighteenth century 
 is it philosophy 
 certainly not 
 the work of the eighteenth century is healthy and good and wholesome the encyclopedists diderot at their head the physiocrates turgot at their head the philosophers voltaire at their head the utopians rousseau at their are four sacred legions immense advance towards the light is due to them they are the four vanguards of the human race marching towards the four cardinal points of progress 
 diderot towards the beautiful turgot towards the useful voltaire towards the true rousseau towards the just 
 but by the side of and above the philosophers there were the sophists a venomous vegetation mingled with a healthy growth hemlock in the virgin forest 
 while the executioner was burning the great books of the liberators of the century on the grand staircase of the writers now forgotten were publishing with the sanction no one knows what strangely disorganizing writings which were eagerly read by the unfortunate some of these publications odd to say which were patronized by a prince are to be found in the secret library 
 these facts significant but unknown were imperceptible on the surface sometimes in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger it is obscure because it is underhand 
 of all these writers the one who probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery was restif de la bretonne 
 this work peculiar to the whole of europe effected more ravages in germany than anywhere else 
 in germany during a given period summed up by schiller in his famous drama the robbers theft and pillage rose up in protest against property and labor assimilated certain specious and false elementary ideas which though just in appearance were absurd in reality enveloped themselves in these ideas disappeared within them after a fashion assumed an abstract name passed into the state of theory and in that shape circulated among the laborious suffering and honest masses unknown even to the imprudent chemists who had prepared the mixture unknown even to the masses who accepted it 
 whenever a fact of this sort presents itself the case is grave 
 suffering engenders wrath and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep which is the same thing as shutting eyes the hatred of the unfortunate classes lights its torch at some aggrieved or spirit which dreams in a corner and sets itself to the scrutiny of society 
 the scrutiny of hatred is a terrible thing 
 hence if the of the times so wills it those fearful commotions which were formerly called jacqueries beside which purely political agitations are the merest play which are no longer the conflict of the oppressed and the oppressor but the revolt of discomfort against comfort 
 then everything crumbles 
 jacqueries are earthquakes of the people 
 it is this peril possibly imminent towards the close of the eighteenth century which the french revolution that immense act of probity cut short 
 the french revolution which is nothing else than the idea armed with the sword rose erect and with the same abrupt movement closed the door of ill and opened the door of good 
 it put a stop to torture promulgated the truth expelled miasma rendered the century healthy crowned the populace 
 it may be said of it that it created man a second time by giving him a second soul the right 
 the nineteenth century has inherited and profited by its work and the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is simply impossible 
 blind is he who announces it 
 foolish is he who fears it 
 revolution is the vaccine of jacquerie 
 thanks to the revolution social conditions have changed feudal and monarchical maladies no longer run in our blood there is no more of the middle ages in our constitution 
 we no longer live in the days when terrible swarms within made irruptions when one heard beneath his feet the obscure course of a dull rumble when indescribable elevations from tunnels appeared on the surface of civilization where the soil cracked open where the roofs of caverns yawned and where one suddenly beheld monstrous heads emerging from the earth 
 the revolutionary sense is a moral sense 
 the sentiment of right once developed develops the sentiment of duty 
 the law of all is liberty which ends where the liberty of others begins according to admirable definition 
 since the whole people has been dilating into a sublime individual there is not a poor man who possessing his right has not his ray of sun the feels within him the honesty of france the dignity of the citizen is an internal armor he who is free is scrupulous he who votes reigns 
 hence incorruptibility hence the miscarriage of unhealthy lusts hence eyes heroically lowered before temptations the revolutionary wholesomeness is such that on a day of deliverance a th of july a th of august there is no longer any populace the first cry of the enlightened and increasing throngs is death to thieves 
 progress is an honest man the ideal and the absolute do not filch by whom were the wagons containing the wealth of the tuileries escorted in 
 by the of the faubourg rags mounted guard over the treasure 
 virtue rendered these tatterdemalions resplendent in those wagons in chests hardly closed and some even amid a hundred dazzling caskets was that ancient crown of france studded with diamonds surmounted by the carbuncle of royalty by the regent diamond which was worth thirty millions 
 barefooted they guarded that crown 
 hence no more jacquerie 
 i regret it for the sake of the skilful the old fear has produced its last effects in that quarter and henceforth it can no longer be employed in politics 
 the principal spring of the red spectre is broken 
 every one knows it now the scares no longer 
 the birds take liberties with the mannikin foul creatures alight upon it the bourgeois laugh at it

 chapter xxix 
 
 when the french officer went into the room with pierre the latter again thought it his duty to assure him that he was not french and wished to go away but the officer would not hear of it he was so very polite amiable and genuinely grateful to pierre for saving his life that pierre had not the heart to refuse and sat down with him in the parlor the first room they entered to assurances that he was not a frenchman the captain evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering an appellation shrugged his shoulders and said that if pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a russian let it be so but for all that he would be forever bound to pierre by gratitude for saving his life 
 had this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the feelings of others and had he at all understood what feelings were the latter would probably have left him but the animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed pierre 
 a frenchman or a russian prince incognito said the officer looking at fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger i owe my life to you and offer you my friendship a frenchman never forgets either an insult or a service i offer you my friendship that is all i can say 
 there was so much good nature and nobility in the french sense of the word in the voice in the expression of his face and in his gestures that pierre unconsciously smiling in response to the smile pressed the hand held out to him 
 captain ramballe of the th light regiment chevalier of the legion of honor for the affair on the seventh of september he introduced himself a irrepressible smile puckering his lips under his mustache will you now be so good as to tell me with whom i have the honor of conversing so pleasantly instead of being in the ambulance with that bullet in my body 
 pierre replied that he could not tell him his name and blushing began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for concealing it but the frenchman hastily interrupted him 
 oh please said he i understand your reasons you are an officer a superior officer perhaps you have borne arms against us not my business i owe you my life that is enough for me i am quite at your service you belong to the gentry he concluded with a shade of inquiry in his tone pierre bent his head your baptismal name if you please that is all i ask monsieur pierre you say all i want to know 
 when the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka brought with some wine which the french had taken from a russian cellar and brought with them ramballe invited pierre to share his dinner and himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth continually smacking his lips and repeating excellent delicious his face grew red and was covered with perspiration pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure morel the orderly brought some hot water in a saucepan and placed a bottle of claret in it he also brought a bottle of kvass taken from the kitchen for them to try that beverage was already known to the french and had been given a special name they called it limonade de cochon lemonade and morel spoke well of the limonade de cochon he had found in the kitchen but as the captain had the wine they had taken while passing through moscow he left the kvass to morel and applied himself to the bottle of bordeaux he wrapped the bottle up to its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for pierre the satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner 
 yes my dear monsieur pierre i owe you a fine votive candle for saving me from that maniac you see i have bullets enough in my body already here is one i got at wagram he touched his side and a second at smolensk he showed a scar on his cheek and this leg which as you see does not want to march i got that on the seventh at the great battle of la moskowa sacre dieu it was splendid that deluge of fire was worth seeing it was a tough job you set us there my word you may be proud of it and on my honor in spite of the cough i caught there i should be ready to begin again i pity those who did not see it 
 i was there said pierre 
 bah really so much the better you are certainly brave foes the great redoubt held out well by my pipe continued the frenchman and you made us pay dear for it i was at it three times sure as i sit here three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back like cardboard figures oh it was beautiful monsieur pierre your grenadiers were splendid by heaven i saw them close up their ranks six times in succession and march as if on parade fine fellows our king of naples who knows what cried bravo ha ha so you are one of us soldiers he added smiling after a momentary pause so much the better so much the better monsieur pierre terrible in battle gallant with the fair he winked and smiled what the french are monsieur pierre they 
 the captain was so naively and gay so real and so pleased with himself that pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily at him probably the word gallant turned the thoughts to the state of moscow 
 apropos tell me please is it true that the women have all left moscow what a queer idea what had they to be afraid of 
 would not the french ladies leave paris if the russians entered it asked pierre 
 ha ha ha the frenchman emitted a merry sanguine chuckle patting pierre on the shoulder what a thing to say he exclaimed paris but paris paris 
 paris the capital of the world pierre finished his remark for him 
 the captain looked at pierre he had a habit of stopping short in the middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing kindly eyes 
 well if you told me you were russian i should have wagered that you were parisian you have that i know what that and having uttered this compliment he again gazed at him in silence 
 i have been in paris i spent years there said pierre 
 oh yes one sees that plainly paris a man who know paris is a savage you can tell a parisian two leagues off paris is talma la duchenois potier the sorbonne the boulevards and noticing that his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before he added quickly there is only one paris in the world you have been to paris and have remained russian well i esteem you the less for it 
 under the influence of the wine he had drunk and after the days he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts pierre involuntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and man 
 to return to your ladies i hear they are lovely what a wretched idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the french army is in moscow what a chance those girls have missed your peasants now another thing but you civilized people you ought to know us better than that we took vienna berlin madrid naples rome warsaw all the capitals we are feared but we are loved we are nice to know and then the emperor he began but pierre interrupted him 
 the emperor pierre repeated and his face suddenly became sad and embarrassed is the emperor 
 the emperor he is generosity mercy justice order genius what the emperor is it is i ramballe who tell you so i assure you i was his enemy eight years ago my father was an emigrant count but that man has vanquished me he has taken hold of me i could not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered france when i understood what he wanted when i saw that he was preparing a bed of laurels for us you know i said to myself that is a monarch and i devoted myself to him so there oh yes mon cher he is the greatest man of the ages past or future 
 is he in moscow pierre stammered with a guilty look 
 the frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled 
 no he will make his entry tomorrow he replied and continued his talk 
 their conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at the gate and by morel who came to say that some wurttemberg hussars had come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the horses were this difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did not understand what was said to them in french 
 the captain had their senior sergeant called in and in a stern voice asked him to what regiment he belonged who was his commanding officer and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already occupied the german who knew little french answered the two first questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding officer but in reply to the third question which he did not understand said introducing broken french into his own german that he was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to occupy all the houses one after another pierre who knew german translated what the german said to the captain and gave the reply to the wurttemberg hussar in german when he had understood what was said to him the german submitted and took his men elsewhere the captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice 
 when he returned to the room pierre was sitting in the same place as before with his head in his hands his face expressed suffering he really was suffering at that moment when the captain went out and he was left alone suddenly he came to himself and realized the position he was in it was not that moscow had been taken or that the happy conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him painful as that was it was not that which tormented pierre at the moment he was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness the few glasses of wine he had drunk and the conversation with this man had destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last few days and which was essential for the execution of his design the pistol dagger and peasant coat were ready napoleon was to enter the town next day pierre still considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the evildoer but now he felt that he would not do it he did not know why but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his intention he struggled against the confession of his weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his former gloomy frame of mind concerning vengeance killing and had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he met 
 the captain returned to the room limping slightly and whistling a tune 
 the chatter which had previously amused pierre now repelled him the tune he was whistling his gait and the gesture with which he twirled his mustache all now seemed offensive i will go away immediately i say another word to him thought pierre he thought this but still sat in the same place a strange feeling of weakness tied him to the spot he wished to get up and go away but could not do so 
 the captain on the other hand seemed very cheerful he paced up and down the room twice his eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he were smiling to himself at some amusing thought 
 the colonel of those wurttembergers is delightful he suddenly said a german but a nice fellow all the same but a german he sat down facing pierre by the way you know german then 
 pierre looked at him in silence 
 what is the german for shelter 
 shelter pierre repeated the german for shelter is unterkunft 
 how do you say it the captain asked quickly and doubtfully 
 unterkunft pierre repeated 
 onterkoff said the captain and looked at pierre for some seconds with laughing eyes these germans are fools you think so monsieur pierre he concluded 
 well have another bottle of this moscow bordeaux shall we morel will warm us up another little bottle morel he called out gaily 
 morel brought candles and a bottle of wine the captain looked at pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression on his face ramballe with genuine distress and sympathy in his face went up to pierre and bent over him 
 there now sad said he touching hand have i upset you no really have you anything against me he asked pierre perhaps the state of affairs 
 pierre did not answer but looked cordially into the eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him 
 honestly without speaking of what i owe you i feel friendship for you can i do anything for you dispose of me it is for life and death i say it with my hand on my heart said he striking his chest 
 thank you said pierre 
 the captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that shelter was unterkunft in german and his face suddenly brightened 
 well in that case i drink to our friendship he cried gaily filling two glasses with wine 
 pierre took one of the glasses and emptied it ramballe emptied his too again pressed hand and leaned his elbows on the table in a pensive attitude 
 yes my dear friend he began such is caprice who would have said that i should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the service of bonaparte as we used to call him yet here i am in moscow with him i must tell you mon cher he continued in the sad and measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story that our name is one of the most ancient in france 
 and with a easy and naive frankness the captain told pierre the story of his ancestors his childhood youth and manhood and all about his relations and his financial and family affairs ma pauvre mere playing of course an important part in the story 
 but all that is only setting the real thing is love love am i not right monsieur pierre said he growing animated another glass 
 pierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third 
 oh women women and the captain looking with glistening eyes at pierre began talking of love and of his love affairs 
 there were very many of these as one could easily believe looking at the handsome face and noting the eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women though all love stories had the sensual character which frenchmen regard as the special charm and poetry of love yet he told his story with such sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love and he described women so alluringly that pierre listened to him with curiosity 
 it was plain that which the frenchman was so fond of was not that low and simple kind that pierre had once felt for his wife nor was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for natasha ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally the one he considered the love of clodhoppers and the other the love of simpletons which the frenchman worshiped consisted principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling 
 thus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a fascinating marquise of and at the same time for a charming innocent child of seventeen daughter of the bewitching marquise the conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter ending in the sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage to her lover even now agitated the captain though it was the memory of a distant past then he recounted an episode in which the husband played the part of the lover and he the lover assumed the role of the husband as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of germany where shelter is called unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the young girls are too blonde 
 finally the latest episode in poland still fresh in the memory and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face was of how he had saved the life of a pole in general the saving of life continually occurred in the stories and the pole had entrusted to him his enchanting wife parisienne de coeur while himself entering the french service the captain was happy the enchanting polish lady wished to elope with him but prompted by magnanimity the captain restored the wife to the husband saying as he did so i have saved your life and i save your honor having repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection 
 listening to the tales pierre as often happens late in the evening and under the influence of wine followed all that was told him understood it all and at the same time followed a train of personal memories which he knew not why suddenly arose in his mind while listening to these love stories his own love for natasha unexpectedly rose to his mind and going over the pictures of that love in his imagination he mentally compared them with tales listening to the story of the struggle between love and duty pierre saw before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of his love at the sukharev water tower at the time of that meeting it had not produced an effect upon him he had not even once recalled it but now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very important and poetic 
 peter kirilovich come here we have recognized you he now seemed to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes her smile her traveling hood and a stray lock of her hair and there seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this 
 having finished his tale about the enchanting polish lady the captain asked pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband 
 challenged by this question pierre raised his head and felt a need to express the thoughts that filled his mind he began to explain that he understood love for a women somewhat differently he said that in all his life he had loved and still loved only one woman and that she could never be his 
 tiens said the captain 
 pierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest years but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too young and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of her because he loved her too well placing her far above everything in the world and especially therefore above himself 
 when he had reached this point pierre asked the captain whether he understood that 
 the captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand it he begged pierre to continue 
 platonic love clouds he muttered 
 whether it was the wine he had drunk or an impulse of frankness or the thought that this man did not and never would know any of those who played a part in his story or whether it was all these things together something loosened tongue speaking thickly and with a faraway look in his shining eyes he told the whole story of his life his marriage love for his best friend her betrayal of him and all his own simple relations with her urged on by questions he also told what he had at first concealed his own position and even his name 
 more than anything else in story the captain was impressed by the fact that pierre was very rich had two mansions in moscow and that he had abandoned everything and not left the city but remained there concealing his name and station 
 when it was late at night they went out together into the street the night was warm and light to the left of the house on the pokrovka a fire glowed the first of those that were beginning in moscow to the right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in heart with his love at the gate stood gerasim the cook and two frenchmen their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in two languages could be heard they were looking at the glow seen in the town 
 there was nothing terrible in the one small distant fire in the immense city 
 gazing at the high starry sky at the moon at the comet and at the glow from the fire pierre experienced a joyful emotion there now how good it is what more does one need thought he and suddenly remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned against the fence to save himself from falling 
 without taking leave of his new friend pierre left the gate with unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep

 the two duties 
 to watch and to hope 
 this being the case is all social danger dispelled 
 certainly not there is no jacquerie society may rest assured on that point blood will no longer rush to its head 
 but let society take heed to the manner in which it breathes 
 apoplexy is no longer to be feared but phthisis is there 
 social phthisis is called misery 
 one can perish from being undermined as well as from being struck by lightning 
 let us not weary of repeating and sympathetic souls must not forget that this is the first of fraternal obligations and selfish hearts must understand that the first of political necessities consists in thinking first of all of the disinherited and sorrowing throngs in solacing airing enlightening loving them in enlarging their horizon to a magnificent extent in lavishing upon them education in every form in offering them the example of labor never the example of idleness in diminishing the individual burden by enlarging the notion of the universal aim in setting a limit to poverty without setting a limit to wealth in creating vast fields of public and popular activity in having like briareus a hundred hands to extend in all directions to the oppressed and the feeble in employing the collective power for that grand duty of opening workshops for all arms schools for all aptitudes and laboratories for all degrees of intelligence in augmenting salaries diminishing trouble balancing what should be and what is that is to say in proportioning enjoyment to effort and a glut to need in a word in evolving from the social apparatus more light and more comfort for the benefit of those who suffer and those who are ignorant 
 and let us say it all this is but the beginning 
 the true question is this 
 labor cannot be a law without being a right 
 we will not insist upon this point this is not the proper place for that 
 if nature calls itself providence society should call itself foresight 
 intellectual and moral growth is no less indispensable than material improvement 
 to know is a sacrament to think is the prime necessity truth is nourishment as well as grain a reason which fasts from science and wisdom grows thin 
 let us enter equal complaint against stomachs and minds which do not eat if there is anything more than a body perishing for lack of bread it is a soul which is dying from hunger for the light 
 the whole of progress tends in the direction of solution some day we shall be amazed 
 as the human race mounts upward the deep layers emerge naturally from the zone of distress the obliteration of misery will be accomplished by a simple elevation of level 
 we should do wrong were we to doubt this blessed consummation 
 the past is very strong it is true at the present moment 
 it censures this rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising 
 behold it is walking and advancing 
 it seems a victor this dead body is a conqueror he arrives with his legions superstitions with his sword despotism with his banner ignorance a while ago he won ten battles he advances he threatens he laughs he is at our doors 
 let us not despair on our side 
 let us sell the field on which hannibal is encamped 
 what have we to fear we who believe 
 no such thing as a of ideas exists any more than there exists a return of a river on its course 
 but let those who do not desire a future reflect on this matter when they say no to progress it is not the future but themselves that they are condemning 
 they are giving themselves a sad malady they are inoculating themselves with the past 
 there is but one way of rejecting and that is to die 
 now no death that of the body as late as possible that of the soul is what we desire 
 yes the enigma will utter its word the sphinx will speak the problem will be solved 
 yes the people sketched out by the eighteenth century will be finished by the nineteenth 
 he who doubts this is an idiot the future blossoming the near blossoming forth of universal is a divinely fatal phenomenon 
 immense combined propulsions direct human affairs and conduct them within a given time to a logical state that is to say to a state of equilibrium that is to say to equity 
 a force composed of earth and heaven results from humanity and governs it this force is a worker of miracles marvellous issues are no more difficult to it than extraordinary vicissitudes 
 aided by science which comes from one man and by the event which comes from another it is not greatly alarmed by these contradictions in the attitude of problems which seem impossibilities to the vulgar herd it is no less skilful at causing a solution to spring forth from the reconciliation of ideas than a lesson from the reconciliation of facts and we may expect anything from that mysterious power of progress which brought the orient and the occident face to face one fine day in the depths of a sepulchre and made the imaums converse with bonaparte in the interior of the great pyramid 
 in the meantime let there be no halt no hesitation no pause in the grandiose onward march of minds 
 social philosophy consists essentially in science and peace 
 its object is and its result must be to dissolve wrath by the study of antagonisms 
 it examines it scrutinizes it analyzes then it puts together once more it proceeds by means of reduction discarding all hatred 
 more than once a society has been seen to give way before the wind which is let loose upon mankind history is full of the shipwrecks of nations and empires manners customs laws some fine day that unknown force the hurricane passes by and bears them all away 
 the civilizations of india of chaldea of persia of syria of egypt have disappeared one after the other 
 why 
 we know not what are the causes of these disasters 
 we do not know could these societies have been saved 
 was it their fault did they persist in the fatal vice which destroyed them what is the amount of suicide in these terrible deaths of a nation and a race 
 questions to which there exists no reply darkness enwraps condemned civilizations 
 they sprung a leak then they sank 
 we have nothing more to say and it is with a sort of terror that we look on at the bottom of that sea which is called the past behind those colossal waves at the shipwreck of those immense vessels babylon nineveh tarsus thebes rome beneath the fearful gusts which emerge from all the mouths of the shadows but shadows are there and light is here 
 we are not acquainted with the maladies of these ancient civilizations we do not know the infirmities of our own 
 everywhere upon it we have the right of light we contemplate its beauties we lay bare its defects where it is ill we probe and the sickness once diagnosed the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy our civilization the work of twenty centuries is its law and its prodigy it is worth the trouble of saving 
 it will be saved it is already much to have solaced it its enlightenment is yet another point 
 all the labors of modern social philosophies must converge towards this point 
 the thinker of has a great duty to auscultate civilization 
 we repeat that this auscultation brings encouragement it is by this persistence in encouragement that we wish to conclude these pages an austere interlude in a mournful drama 
 beneath the social mortality we feel human imperishableness 
 the globe does not perish because it has these wounds craters eruptions sulphur pits here and there nor because of a volcano which ejects its pus the maladies of the people do not kill man 
 and yet any one who follows the course of social clinics shakes his head at times 
 the strongest the tenderest the most logical have their hours of weakness 
 will the future arrive 
 it seems as though we might almost put this question when we behold so much terrible darkness melancholy encounter of selfish and wretched 
 on the part of the selfish the prejudices shadows of costly education appetite increasing through intoxication a giddiness of prosperity which dulls a fear of suffering which in some goes as far as an aversion for the suffering an implacable satisfaction the i so swollen that it bars the soul on the side of the wretched covetousness envy hatred of seeing others enjoy the profound impulses of the human beast towards assuaging its desires hearts full of mist sadness need fatality impure and simple ignorance 
 shall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven is the luminous point which we distinguish there one of those which vanish the ideal is frightful to behold thus lost in the depths small isolated imperceptible brilliant but surrounded by those great black menaces monstrously heaped around it yet no more in danger than a star in the maw of the clouds

 book eleven 
 chapter xxx 
 
 the glow of the first fire that began on the second of september was watched from the various roads by the fugitive muscovites and by the retreating troops with many different feelings 
 the rostov party spent the night at mytishchi fourteen miles from moscow they had started so late on the first of september the road had been so blocked by vehicles and troops so many things had been forgotten for which servants were sent back that they had decided to spend that night at a place three miles out of moscow the next morning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far as great mytishchi at ten that evening the rostov family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and huts of that large village the rostovs servants and coachmen and the orderlies of the wounded officers after attending to their masters had supper fed the horses and came out into the porches 
 in a neighboring hut lay adjutant with a fractured wrist the awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night he had spent the first night in the same yard as the rostovs the countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning and at mytishchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the wounded man 
 in the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed above the high body of a coach standing before the porch the small glow of another fire one glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was little mytishchi burning set on fire by cossacks 
 but look here brothers another fire remarked an orderly 
 all turned their attention to the glow 
 but they told us little mytishchi had been set on fire by cossacks 
 but not mytishchi farther away 
 look it must be in moscow 
 two of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down on its steps 
 more to the left why little mytishchi is over there and this is right on the other side 
 several men joined the first two 
 see how flaring said one a fire in moscow either in the sushchevski or the rogozhski quarter 
 no one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance 
 old daniel terentich the valet as he was called came up to the group and shouted at mishka 
 what are you staring at you the count will be calling and nobody there go and gather the clothes together 
 i only ran out to get some water said mishka 
 but what do you think daniel terentich it look as if that glow were in moscow remarked one of the footmen 
 daniel terentich made no reply and again for a long time they were all silent the glow spread rising and failing farther and farther still 
 god have mercy windy and dry said another voice 
 just look see what doing now o lord you can even see the crows flying lord have mercy on us sinners 
 put it out no fear 
 to put it out daniel terentich who had hitherto been silent was heard to say his voice was calm and deliberate moscow it is brothers said he mother moscow the white his voice faltered and he gave way to an old sob 
 and it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the significance for them of the glow they were watching sighs were heard words of prayer and the sobbing of the old valet

 of dispatch 
 affected dispatch is one of the most dangerous things to business that can be it 
 is like that which the physicians call predigestion or hasty digestion which is 
 sure to fill the body full of crudities and secret seeds of diseases therefore 
 measure not dispatch by the times of sitting but by the advancement of the business 
 
 and as in races it is not the large stride or high lift that makes the speed so 
 in business the keeping close to the matter and not taking of it too much at once procureth dispatch it is the care of some only to come off speedily for the time or to contrive some false periods of business because they may seem men of dispatch 
 
 but it is one thing to abbreviate by contracting another by cutting off and business so handled at several sittings or meetings goeth commonly backward and forward in an unsteady manner i knew a wise man that had it for a when he saw men hasten to a conclusion stay a little that we may make an end the sooner 
 
 on the other side true dispatch is a rich thing for time is the measure of business as money is of wares and business is bought at a dear hand where there is small dispatch the spartans and spaniards have been noted to be of small dispatch mi venga la muerta de spagna 
 
 let my death come from spain for then it will be sure to be long in coming 
 give good hearing to those that give the first information in business and rather 
 direct them in the beginning than interrupt them in the continuance of their speeches for he that is put out of his own order will go forward and backward and be more tedious while he waits upon his memory than he could have been if he had gone on in his own course 
 but sometimes it is seen that the moderator is more troublesome than the actor iterations are commonly loss of time but there is no such gain of time as to iterate often the state of the question for it chaselh away many a frivolous speech as it is coming forth long and curious speeches are as fit for dispatch as a robe or mantle with a long train is for race prefaces and passages and excusations and other speeches of reference to the person are great wastes of 
 time and though they seem to proceed of modesty they are bravery yet beware of being too material when there is any impediment or obstruction in wills for of mind ever requireth preface of speech 
 like a fomentation to make the unguent enter 
 
 above all things order and distribution and singling out of parts is me life of 
 dispatch so as the distribution be not too subtle for he mat doth not divide will 
 never enter well into business and he that divideth too much will never come out 
 of it clearly to choose time is to save time and an unseasonable motion is but beating the air 
 there be three parts of business the preparation the debate or examination 
 and the perfection whereof if you look for dispatch let the middle only be the 
 work of many and the first and last the work of few the proceeding upon somewhat conceived in writing doth for the most part facilitate dispatch for though it should be wholly rejected yet that negative is more pregnant of direction than an indefinite as ashes are more generative than dust

 chapter x 
 
 the man aroused 
 as the cathedral clock struck two in the morning jean valjean awoke 
 what woke him was that his bed was too good 
 it was nearly twenty years since he had slept in a bed and although he had not undressed the sensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers 
 he had slept more than four hours 
 his fatigue had passed away he was accustomed not to devote many hours to repose 
 he opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him then he closed them again with the intention of going to sleep once more 
 when many varied sensations have agitated the day when various matters preoccupy the mind one falls asleep once but not a second time sleep comes more easily than it returns 
 this is what happened to jean valjean 
 he could not get to sleep again and he fell to thinking 
 he was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in mind are troubled 
 there was a sort of dark confusion in his brain his memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there and mingled confusedly losing their proper forms becoming disproportionately large then suddenly disappearing as in a muddy and perturbed pool 
 many thoughts occurred to him but there was one which kept constantly presenting itself afresh and which drove away all others 
 we will mention this thought at once he had observed the six sets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which madame magloire had placed on the table 
 those six sets of silver haunted were few paces as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the one in which he then was the old had been in the act of placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed he had taken careful note of this the right as you entered from the were old silver from the ladle one could get at least two hundred francs double what he had earned in nineteen is true that he would have earned more if the administration had not robbed him 
 his mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was certainly mingled some struggle 
 three struck 
 he opened his eyes again drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture stretched out his arm and felt of his knapsack which he had thrown down on a corner of the alcove then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed and placed his feet on the floor and thus found himself almost without knowing it seated on his bed 
 he remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude which would have been suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him thus in the dark the only person awake in that house where all were sleeping 
 all of a sudden he stooped down removed his shoes and placed them softly on the mat beside the bed then he resumed his thoughtful attitude and became motionless once more 
 throughout this hideous meditation the thoughts which we have above indicated moved incessantly through his brain entered withdrew and in a manner oppressed him and then he thought also without knowing why and with the mechanical persistence of revery of a convict named brevet whom he had known in the galleys and whose trousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton the checkered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind 
 he remained in this situation and would have so remained indefinitely even until daybreak had not the clock struck half or quarter hour 
 it seemed to him that that stroke said to him come on 
 he rose to his feet hesitated still another moment and listened all was quiet in the house then he walked straight ahead with short steps to the window of which he caught a glimpse the night was not very dark there was a full moon across which coursed large clouds driven by the wind 
 this created outdoors alternate shadow and gleams of light eclipses then bright openings of the clouds and indoors a sort of twilight 
 this twilight sufficient to enable a person to see his way intermittent on account of the clouds resembled the sort of livid light which falls through an in a cellar before which the passersby come and go 
 on arriving at the window jean valjean examined it it had no grating it opened in the garden and was fastened according to the fashion of the country only by a small pin he opened it but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly he closed it again immediately 
 he scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks the garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall easy to climb far away at the extremity he perceived tops of trees spaced at regular intervals which indicated that the wall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees 
 having taken this survey he executed a movement like that of a man who has made up his mind strode to his alcove grasped his knapsack opened it fumbled in it pulled out of it something which he placed on the bed put his shoes into one of his pockets shut the whole thing up again threw the knapsack on his shoulders put on his cap drew the visor down over his eyes felt for his cudgel went and placed it in the angle of the window then returned to the bed and resolutely seized the object which he had deposited there it resembled a short bar of iron pointed like a pike at one end it would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed perhaps it was a lever possibly it was a club 
 in the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more than a candlestick 
 convicts were at that period sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ toulon and it was not rare for them to have miners tools at their command 
 these miners candlesticks are of massive iron terminated at the lower extremity by a point by means of which they are stuck into the rock 
 he took the candlestick in his right hand holding his breath and trying to deaden the sound of his tread he directed his steps to the door of the adjoining room occupied by the bishop as we already know 
 on arriving at this door he found it ajar 
 the bishop had not closed it

 the empire strikes back 
 xi 
 
 it was dawn on the gaseous bespin planet 
 as the millennium falcon began its approach through the atmosphere itsoared past several of many moons the planet itself glowed with the samesoft pink hue of dawn that tinted the hull of the powerful pirate starship as the shipneared it swerved to avoid a billowing canyon of clouds that swirled up around theplanet 
 when han solo finally lowered his ship through the clouds he and his crew gottheir first glimpse of the gaseous world of bespin and as they maneuvered throughthe clouds they noticed that they were being followed by some kind of flying recognized the craft as a cloud car but was surprised when the carbegan to bank close to his freighter the falcon suddenly lurched as a round of laserfire struck its hull no one on the falcon had expected this kind of greeting 
 the other craft transmitted a message over the radiosystem 
 no han snarled in reply i do not have a landing permit my registrationis 
 but his words were drowned out by a loud crackle of radio static 
 the car was apparently not willing to accept static for a reply againit opened up fire on the falcon shaking and rattling the ship with each strike 
 a clear warning voice came over the speakers stand by anyaggressive move will bring about your destruction 
 at this point han had no intention of making any aggressive moves bespinwas their only hope of sanctuary he plan to alienate his prospective hosts 
 rather touchy they the reactivated asked 
 i thought you knew these people leia chided casting a suspicious look athan 
 well the corellian hedged been a while 
 chewbacca growled and barked shaking his head meaningfully at han 
 that was a long time ago he answered sharply sure forgotten allabout it but he began to wonder if lando had forgotten the past 
 permission granted to land on platform any deviation of flight patternwill bring about your 
 angrily han switched off the radio why was he being put through thisharassment he was coming here peacefully lando going to let bygones bybygones chewbacca grunted and glanced at solo who turned to leia and herworried robot help us he said trying to reassure them all we go waybackreally worry 
 worried she lied unconvincingly 
 by then they could clearly see the cloud city of bespin through the cockpitwindow the city was immense and seemed to float in the clouds as it emergedthrough the white atmosphere as the millennium falcon approached the city itbecame evident that the expansive city structure was supported from below by a thinunipod the base of this supporting stalk was a large round reactor that floatedthrough its billowing sea of clouds 
 the millennium falcon dipped closer to the huge city and veered in the directionof its landing platforms flying past the rising towers and spires that dotted the in and about these structures cruised more of the cloud effortlessly through the mists 
 han gently brought the falcon in to land on platform and as the ionengines whined to a stop the captain and his crew could see the welcoming partymoving toward the landing platform with weapons drawn like any ofcitizenry of cloud city this group included aliens droids and humans of all racesand description one of these humans was the leader lando calrissian 
 lando a handsome black man perhaps the same age as solo was clad in elegantgray pants blue shirt and a flowing blue cape he stood unsmiling on landingplatform waiting for the crew to disembark 
 han solo and princess leia appeared at the open door of their ship with blastersdrawn standing behind them was the giant wookiee his gun in hand and abandoleer of ammunition packs slung over his left shoulder 
 han speak but quietly surveyed the menacing welcoming party that wasmarching across the platform toward them an early morning wind began to sweepalong the ground making cloak fly up behind him like enormous deep bluewings 
 i like this leia whispered to han 
 he much like it either but he going to let the princess know be all right he said quietly trust me then cautioning her he keep your eyes open wait here 
 han and chewbacca left leia guarding the falcon and they walked down theramp to face calrissian and his motley army the two parties moved toward eachother until han and calrissian stopped three meters apart the face each other for along moment each one eyed the other silently 
 finally calrissian spoke shaking his head and squinting at han why youslimy swindler he said grimly 
 i can explain everything ol buddy han said quickly if just listen 
 still unsmiling lando surprised alien and human alike when he said glad tosee you 
 han lifted an eyebrow skeptically no hard feelings 
 are you kidding lando asked coolly 
 han was becoming nervous had he been forgiven or not the guard andaides still had not lowered their weapons and attitude was to conceal his worry han remarked gallantly i always said you were agentleman 
 with that the other man broke into a grin bet he chuckled 
 han laughed in relief as the two old friends at last embraced each other like accomplices they were 
 lando waved at the wookiee standing behind his boss how you he asked amiably still wasting your time with this clown eh 
 the wookiee growled a reserved greeting 
 calrissian was not certain what to make of that growl right he uncomfortable but his attention was distracted from this shaggy mass ofmuscle and hair when he saw leia beginning to walk down the ramp this lovelyvision was followed closely by her protocol droid who cautiously glanced around asthey walked toward lando and ha 
 hello what have we here calrissian welcomed her admiringly i amlando calrissian administrator of this facility and who might you be 
 the princess remained coolly polite you may call me leia she replied 
 lando bowed formally and gently kissed the hand 
 and i her robot companion said introducing himself to the administrator relations at your 
 but before threepio could finish his little speech han draped one arm shoulder and steered him away from the princess traveling with he advised his old friend and i intend to gamble her away so youmight as well forget she exists 
 lando looked longingly over his shoulder as he and han began to walk acrossthe landing platform followed by leia threepio and chewbacca that beeasy my friend lando said regretfully 
 then he turned to han what bring you here anyway 
 repairs 
 mock panic spread across face what have you done to my ship 
 grinning han glanced back at leia lando used to own the falcon heexplained and he sometimes forgets that he lost her fair and square 
 lando shrugged as he conceded to boastful claim that ship saved mylife more than a few times the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy with her 
 hyperdrive 
 have my people get to work on it right away lando said i hate thethought of the millennium falcon without her heart 
 the group crossed the narrow bridge that joined the landing area to the instantly dazzled by its beauty they saw numerous small plazas ringed towers and spires and buildings the structures that constituted business and residential sections were gleaming white shining brightly in themorning sun numerous alien races made up the populace and many of thesecitizens leisurely walked through the spacious streets alongside the falcon visitors 
 your mining operation going han asked lando 
 not as well as like calrissian answered a small outpost and notvery had supply problems of every kind and theadministrator noticed amused grin so funny 
 nothing then han chuckled i never would have guessed that underneaththat wild schemer i knew was a responsible leader and businessman had to admit that he was impressed you wear it well 
 lando looked at his old friend reflectively seeing you sure brings back a fewmemories he shook his head smiling yes responsible these days aprice of success and you know what han you were right all along 
 both burst out laughing causing a head or two to turn as the group movedthrough the city walkways 
 lagged a bit behind fascinated by the bustling alien crowds in thecloud city streets the floating cars the fabulous fanciful buildings he turned hishead back and forth trying to register it all in his computer circuits 
 as the golden droid gawked at the new sights he passed a door facing thewalkway hearing it open he turned to see a silver threepio unit emerging andstopped to watch the other robot move away while threepio paused there he hearda muffled beeping and whistling coming from behind the door 
 he peeked in and saw a droid sitting in the anteroom oh anr unit he chirped in delight almost forgotten what they sound like 
 threepio moved through the doorway and walked into the room instantly hesensed that he and the r unit were not alone he threw his golden arms up insurprise the expression of wonder on his gilded faceplate frozen in place he exclaimed those look like 
 as he spoke a rocketing laser bolt crashed into his metal chest sending himflying in twenty directions around the room his bronzed arms and legs crashedagainst the walls and settled in a smoldering heap with the rest of his mechanicalbody 
 behind him the door slammed shut 
 some distance away lando guided the small group into his hall of out objects of interest as they moved through the white corridors none ofthem had noticed absence as they walked along discussing life in bespin 
 but chewbacca suddenly stopped and curiously sniffed the air as he lookedbehind him then he shrugged his huge shoulders and continued to follow theothers 
 luke was perfectly calm even his present position did not make him feel tenseor strained or unsure or any of the negative things he used to feel when he firstattempted this feat he stood perfectly balanced on one hand he knew the forcewas with him 
 his patient master yoda sat calmly on the soles of upturned feet lukeconcentrated serenely on his task and all at once he lifted four fingers from the balance undisturbed he held his one thumb 
 determination had made him a quick study he was eager to learn andwas undaunted by the tests yoda had devised for him and now he felt confidentthat when he finally left this planet it would be as a jedi knight preparedto fight only for the noblest of causes 
 luke was rapidly growing stronger with the force and indeed wasaccomplishing miracles yoda grew more pleased with his while yoda stood watching nearby luke used the force to lift two largeequipment cases and suspend them in midair yoda was pleased but observing this apparent impossibility and emitting electronic beeps ofdisbelief the jedi master raised his hand and with the force lifted the little droidoff the ground 
 artoo hovered his baffled internal circuits and sensors trying to detect theunseen power that held him suspended in the air and suddenly the invisible handplayed still another joke on him while hanging in midair the little robot was abruptlyturned upside down his white legs kicked desperately and his dome head spunhelplessly around when yoda finally lowered his hand the droid along with twosupply cases began to drop but only the boxes smashed against the remained suspended in space 
 turning his head artoo perceived his young master standing with handextended preventing artoo from a fatal tumble 
 yoda shook his head impressed by his quick thinking and by hiscontrol 
 yoda sprang onto arm and the two of them turned back toward the they had forgotten something was still hanging in the air beepingand whistling frantically trying to get their attention yoda was merely playinganother joke on the fretful droid and as yoda and luke strolled away artoo heard thejedi laugh float in gay peals behind him as the droid slowly loweredto the ground 
 some time later as dusk crept through the dense foliage of the bog artoo wascleaning the hull through a hose that ran from the pond to an orifice inhis side the robot sprayed down the ship with a powerful stream of water andwhile he worked luke and yoda sat in the clearing eyes closed inconcentration 
 be calm yoda told him through the force things you will see otherplaces other thoughts the future the past old friends long gone 
 luke was losing himself as he concentrated on words he wasbecoming unaware of his body and let his consciousness drift with the words of hismaster my mind fills with so many images 
 control control you must learn of what you see the jedi master easy not fast 
 luke closed his eyes relaxed and began to free his mind began to control theimages at last there was something not clear at first but something gradually the image cleared it seemed to be that of a city a city thatperhaps floated in a billowing white sea 
 i see a city in the clouds he finally said 
 bespin yoda identified it i see it too friends you have there and see them you will 
 concentration intensified and the city in the clouds became he concentrated he was able to see forms familiar forms of people he knew 
 i see them luke exclaimed his eyes still shut then a sudden agony ofbody and spirit took hold of him in pain suffering 
 it is the future you see the voice of yoda explained 
 the future luke thought then the pain he had felt had not yet been inflictedon his friends so perhaps the future was not unchangeable 
 will they die he asked his master 
 yoda shook his head and shrugged gently difficult to see always inmotion is the future 
 luke opened his eyes again he stood up and quickly began to gather hisequipment my friends he said guessing that the jedi master might try todissuade him from doing what he knew he must 
 and therefore yoda added decide you must how to serve them best if youleave now help them you could but you would destroy all for which they havefought and suffered 
 his words stopped luke cold the youth sank to the ground feeling a shroudof gloom envelop him could he really destroy everything he had worked for andpossibly also destroy his friends but how could he not try to save them 
 artoo perceived his despair and rolled over to stand by him and providewhat comfort he could 
 chewbacca who had grown concerned about slipped away fromhan solo and the others and began hunting for the missing droid all he had tofollow were his keen wookiee instincts as he wandered through the unfamiliar whitepassageways and corridors of bespin 
 following his senses chewbacca finally came upon an enormous room in acorridor on the outside of the cloud city he approached the entrance to the roomand heard the clamor of metallic object clattering together along with the heard the low grunting of creatures he had never encountered before 
 the room he had found was a cloud city junk repository of all broken machines and other discarded metal junk 
 standing amid the scattered pieces of metal and tangled wire were four hoglikecreatures white hair grew thickly on their heads and partially covered theirwrinkled piggish faces the humanoid ugnaughts on busy separating the junked pieces of metal and casting them into a pit ofmolten metal 
 chewbacca entered the room and saw that one of the ugnaught held piece of golden metal 
 the piglike creature was already raising his arm to toss the severed metal leg intothe sizzling pit when chewbacca roared at him barking desperately the ugnaughtdropped the leg and ran to cower in terror with his fellows 
 the wookiee grabbed the metal leg and inspected it closely he beenmistaken and as he growled angrily at the huddled ugnaughts they shivered andgrunted like a pack of frightened pigs 
 sunlight streamed into the circular lounge of the apartments assigned to hansolo and his group the lounge was white and furnished simple with a couch and atable and little any anything else each of the four sliding doors placed along thecircular wall led to an adjoining apartment 
 han leaned out the large bay window to take in the panoramic view ofcloud city the sight was breathtaking even to such a jaded star jockey hewatched the flying cloud cars weave between the towering buildings then lookeddown to see the people moving through the networks of streets below the air swept against his face and at least for the present he felt as if he a care in all the universe 
 a door behind him opened and he turned to see princess leia standing in theentranceway to her apartment she was stunning dressed in red with cloak flowing to the floor leia looked more beautiful than han had everseen her her long dark hair was tied with ribbons and it softly framed her oval she was looking at him smiling at his astounded expression 
 what are you staring at she asked beginning to blush 
 staring 
 you look silly she said laughing 
 you look great 
 leia looked away in embarrassment has threepio turned up yet she to change the subject 
 solo was taken off guard huh oh chewie went to look for him gone too long just to be lost he patted the softly cushioned sofa comeover here he beckoned i want to check this out 
 she thought about his invitation for a moment then walked over and sat next tohim on the couch han was overjoyed at her apparent compliance and leaned over toput his arm around her but just before he had quite succeeded she spoke again ihope luke made it to the fleet all right 
 luke he was becoming exasperated how hard did he have to play at thisgame of it was her game and her he had chosen to was too lovely to resist sure fine han said soothingly probablysitting around wondering what doing right now 
 he moved closer and put his arm around her shoulders pulling her closer to gazed at him invitingly and he moved to kiss her 
 just then one of the doors zapped open chewbacca lumbered in carrying alarge packing case filled with disturbingly familiar metal remains inbronzed bits and pieces of the wookiee dropped the case on thetable gesturing toward han he barked and growled in distress 
 what happened leia asked moving closer to inspect the pile of disjointedpart 
 he found threepio in a junk room 
 leia gasped what a mass chewie do you think you can repair him 
 chewbacca studied the collection of robot parts then looking back at theprincess shrugged his shoulders howled it looked to him like an impossible job 
 why we just turn him over to lando to fix han suggested 
 no thanks leia answered with a cold look in her eyes wronghere your friend lando is very charming but i trust him 
 well i do trust him han argued defending his host listen sweetheart going to have you accusing my friend of 
 but he was interrupted by a buzz as a door slid open and lando calrissianentered the lounge smiling cordially he walked toward the small group i interrupting anything 
 not really the princess said distantly 
 my dear lando said ignoring her coldness toward him your beauty isunparalleled truly you belong here with us among the clouds 
 she smiled icily thanks 
 would you care to join me for a little refreshment 
 han had to admit that he was a bit hungry but for some reason he could notquite name he felt a wave of suspicion about his friend flood over him he calrissian being quite so polite quite so smooth perhaps leia wascorrect in her suspicions 
 his thoughts were interrupted by enthusiastic bark at the mentionof food the big wookiee was licking his lips at the prospect of a hearty meal 
 invited of course lando said 
 leia took proffered arm and as the group moved toward the glimpsed the box of golden robot parts having problems with yourdroid he asked 
 han and leia exchanged a quick glance if han was going to ask for in repairing the droid now was the moment an accident he we handle 
 they left the lounge leaving behind them the shattered remains of the protocoldroid 
 the group strolled through the long white corridors and leia walked betweenhan and lando han at all certain he liked the prospect of competing withlando for under the circumstance but they weredependent on good graces now they had no other choice 
 joining them as they walked was personal aide a tall bald man dressedin a gray jacket with ballooning yellow sleeves the aide wore a radio device thatwrapped around the back of his head and covered both his ears he walked alongwith chewbacca a short distance behind han leia and lando and as they walkedtoward dining hall the administrator described the status of his 
 so you see lando explained we are a free station and do not fall under thejurisdiction of the empire 
 part of the mining guild then leia asked 
 not actually our operation is small enough not to be noticed much of ourtrade is wellunofficial 
 they stepped onto a veranda that overlooked the spiraled top of cloud here they saw several flying cloud cars gracefully swooping around thebeautiful spired buildings of the city it was a spectacular view and the visitors werevery impressed 
 a lovely outpost leia marveled 
 yes proud of it lando replied find the air quite specialherevery simulating he smiled at leia meaningfully you could grow to likeit 
 han miss flirtatious he like it either plan on staying that long he said brusquely 
 leia raised an eyebrow and glanced mischievously at the han find it most relaxing 
 lando chuckled and led them from the veranda they approached the dininghall with its massive closed doors and as they paused in front of them chewbaccalifted his head and sniffed the air curiously he turned and barked urgently at han 
 not now chewie han reproved turning to calrissian lando youafraid the empire might eventually discover this little operation and shut you down 
 always been the danger the administrator replied loomed like ashadow over everything built here but circumstances have developed whichwill insure security you see made a deal that will keep the empire out of hereforever 
 with that the mighty door slid immediately han understood just whatthat deal must have involved at the far end of the huge banquet table stood thebounty hunter boba fett 
 fett stood next to a chair that held the black essence of evil the dark lord rose to his full menacing height 
 han shot his meanest look at lando 
 sorry friend lando said sounding mildly apologetic i had no arrived right before you did 
 sorry too han snapped in that instant he cleared his blaster from itsholster aimed it directly at the figure in black and began to pump laser bolts 
 but the man who may have been the fastest draw in the galaxy was not fastenough to surprise vader before those bolts zipped halfway across the table thedark lord had lifted a hand and effortlessly deflected them so theyexploded against the wall in a harmless spray of flying white shards 
 astounded by what he had just seen han tried firing again but before hecould discharge another laser blast unseen yet the weapon from his hand and sent it flying into grip theraven figure calmly placed the weapon on top of the dining table 
 hissing through his obsidian mask the dark lord addressed his we would be honored if you joined us 
 felt the rain plunking on top of his metal dome as he trudgedthrough the muddy puddles of the bog he was headed for the sanctuary of hut and soon his optical sensors picked up the golden glow shining through itswindows as he neared the inviting house he felt a relief that at last hewould get out of this annoying persistent rain 
 but when he tried to pass through the entrance he discovered that his inflexibledroid body just could not get in he tried from one angle then from another at lastthe perception that he was simply the wrong shape to get in seeped into his computermind 
 he could scarcely believe his sensors as he peered into the house he scanneda busy figure bustling about the kitchen stirring steaming pots chopping this andthat running back and forth but the figure in tiny kitchen doing tasks was not the jedi his apprentice 
 yoda it appeared from scan was simply sitting back observing hisyoung pupil from the adjacent room and quietly smiling then suddenly in themidst of all his kitchen activity luke paused as if a painful vision had appearedbefore him 
 yoda noticed troubled look as he watched his student three appeared from behind yoda and noiselessly shot through the air to attack theyoung jedi from behind instantly luke turned to face them a pot lid in one handand a spoon in the other 
 the seekers sent one rocketing bolt after another directly at luke but withastounding skill he warded off every one he knocked one of the seekers toward theopen door where artoo stood watching his performance but the faithfuldroid saw the shining ball too late to avoid the bolt it shot at him the impactknocked the shrieking robot onto the ground with a clunk that nearly shook loose hiselectronic insides 
 later that evening after the student had successfully passed a number of tests a weary luke skywalker finally fell asleep on the tossing and softlymoaning his concerned droid stood by him reaching out an extension arm andcovering luke with the blanket that had slipped halfway off but when artoo startedto roll away luke began to groan and shudder as if in the grip of some horriblenightmare 
 inside the house yoda heard the groans and hurried to his doorway 
 luke awoke from his sleep with a start dazed he looked about him then sawhis teacher worriedly watching him from his house i keep the vision out ofmy head luke told yoda my in troubleand i feel that 
 luke you must not go yoda warned 
 but han and leia will die if i 
 you know that it was the whispered voice of ben who was beginningto materialize before them the figure stood a shimmering image andtold luke even yoda cannot see their fate 
 but luke was deeply worried about his friends and was determined to dosomething i can help them he insisted 
 not ready yet ben said gently you still have much to learn 
 i feel the force luke said 
 but you cannot control it this is a dangerous stage for you luke you arenow most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side 
 yes yes yoda added to you listen young one the your failure at the tree heh 
 painfully luke remembered though he felt he had gained a great deal ofstrength and understanding in that experience learned much since then return to finish i promise that master 
 you underestimate the emperor ben told him gravely it is you he is why your friends suffer 
 and that luke said is why i must go 
 kenobi was firm i will not lose you to the emperor as i once lost vader 
 you 
 only a fully trained jedi knight with the force as his ally will conquer vaderand his emperor ben emphasized if you end your training now if you choosethe quick and easy vader will become an agent of evil and thegalaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate and despair 
 stopped they must be yoda interjected do you hear on this alldepends 
 you are the last jedi luke you are our only hope be patient 
 and sacrifice han and leia the youth asked incredulously 
 if you honor what they fight for yoda said pausing for a long 
 great anguish overcame luke he certain that he could reconcile theadvice of these two great mentors with his own feelings his friends were in terribledanger and of course he must save them but his teachers thought he was not he might be too vulnerable to the powerful vader and his emperor that he mightbring harm to his friends and possibly be lost forever on the path ofevil 
 yet how could he fear these abstract things when han and leia were real andwere suffering how could he permit himself to fear possible danger to himselfwhen his friends were presently in real danger of death 
 there was no longer any question in his mind as to what he had to do 
 it was dusk the next day on the bog planet when settled himself intohis nook behind the cockpit of fighter 
 yoda stood on one of the storage cases watching luke load the cases one by oneinto the underbelly as he worked in the glow of the lights 
 i cannot protect you luke the voice of ben kenobi came as his robed figuretook solid form if you choose to face vader you will do it alone once this decision i cannot interfere 
 i understand luke replied calmly then turning to his droid he said up the power converters 
 artoo who had already unfastened the power couplings on the ship whistledhappily grateful to be leaving this dismal bog world which was certainly no place fora droid 
 luke ben advised use the force only for knowledge and for defense not asa weapon give in to hate or anger they lead the way to the dark side 
 luke nodded only his mind was on the long journey and on thedifficult tasks ahead of him he must save his friends whose lives were in dangerbecause of him he climbed into the cockpit then looked at his little jedi master 
 yoda was deeply concerned about his apprentice strong is vader he warnedominously clouded is your fate mind what you have learned noticeeverything everything it can save you 
 i will master yoda luke assured him i will and be back to finish whati have begun i give you my word 
 artoo closed the cockpit and luke started the engines 
 yoda and kenobi watched the gear its engines and begin tomove away for takeoff 
 told you i did yoda said sorrowfully as the sleek fighter craft began to liftinto the misty heavens reckless is he now things are going to worse 
 that boy is our last hope ben kenobi said his voice heavy with emotion 
 no former teacher corrected with a knowing gleam in his large is another 
 yoda lifted his head toward the darkening sky where ship was already abarely distinguishable point of light among the flickering stars

 on the morning of the day that the young couple were to mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointedfor the morning greeting crossing herself with trepidation andrepeating a silent prayer every morning she came in like that andevery morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well 
 an old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rosequietly and said in a whisper please walk in 
 through the door came the regular hum of a lathe the princesstimidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily she pausedat the entrance the prince was working at the lathe and afterglancing round continued his work 
 the enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use thelarge table covered with books and plans the tall with keys in the locks the high desk for writing whilestanding up on which lay an open exercise book and the lathe withtools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around allindicated continuous varied and orderly activity the motion ofthe small foot shod in a tartar boot embroidered with silver andthe firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand showed that the princestill possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from thepedal wiped his chisel dropped it into a leather pouch attached tothe lathe and approaching the table summoned his daughter he nevergave his children a blessing so he simply held out his bristlycheek as yet unshaven and regarding her tenderly and severely 
 quite well all right then sit down he took the exercise bookcontaining lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up achair with his foot 
 for tomorrow said he quickly finding the page and making ascratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail 
 the princess bent over the exercise book on the table 
 wait a bit a letter for you said the old man a letter addressed in a hand from a bag hanging abovethe table onto which he threw it 
 at the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on theprincess face she took it quickly and bent her head over it 
 from heloise asked the prince with a cold smile that showed hisstill sound yellowish teeth 
 yes from julie replied the princess with a timid glance anda timid smile 
 let two more letters pass but the third read saidthe prince sternly afraid you write much nonsense read thethird 
 read this if you like father said the princess blushing stillmore and holding out the letter 
 the third i said the third cried the prince abruptly pushingthe letter away and leaning his elbows on the table he drew towardhim the exercise book containing geometrical figures 
 well madam he began stooping over the book close to hisdaughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent ofold age and tobacco which she had known so long now madam thesetriangles are equal please note that the angle abc 
 the princess looked in a scared way at her eyesglittering close to her the red patches on her face came and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightenedthat her fear would prevent her understanding any of her explanations however clear they might be whether it wasthe fault or the this same thing happened everyday the princess eyes grew dim she could not see and could not hearanything but was only conscious of her stern withered faceclose to her of his breath and the smell of him and could think onlyof how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problemin peace the old man was beside himself moved the chair on whichhe was sitting noisily backward and forward made efforts to controlhimself and not become vehement but almost always did becomevehement scolded and sometimes flung the exercise book away 
 the princess gave a wrong answer 
 well now she a fool shouted the prince pushing the bookaside and turning sharply away but rising immediately he paced upand down lightly touched his hair and sat down again 
 he drew up his chair and continued to explain 
 this do princess it do said he when princess taken and closed the exercise book with the next was about to leave mathematics are most important want to have you like our silly ladies get used to it like it and he patted her cheek it will drive all thenonsense out of your head 
 she turned to go but he stopped her with a gesture and took anuncut book from the high desk 
 here is some sort of key to the mysteries that your heloise hassent you religious i interfere with belief ihave looked at it take it well now go go 
 he patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her 
 princess mary went back to her room with the sad scaredexpression that rarely left her and which made her plain sicklyface yet plainer she sat down at her writing table on which stoodminiature portraits and which was littered with books and princess was as untidy as her father was tidy she put down thegeometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter it was fromher most intimate friend from childhood that same julie karaginawho had been at the rostovs party 
 julie wrote in french 
 dear and precious friend how terrible and frightful a thing isseparation though i tell myself that half my life and half myhappiness are wrapped up in you and that in spite of the distanceseparating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds my heartrebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractionsaround me i cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been inmy heart ever since we parted why are we not together as we were lastsummer in your big study on the blue sofa the confidential cannot i now as three months ago draw fresh moral strengthfrom your look so gentle calm and penetrating a look i loved sowell and seem to see before me as i write 
 having read thus far princess mary sighed and glanced into themirror which stood on her right it reflected a weak ungracefulfigure and thin face her eyes always sad now looked with particularhopelessness at her reflection in the glass she flatters the princess turning away and continuing to read but juliedid not flatter her friend the princess eyes large deep andluminous it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shaftsof warm light were so beautiful that very often in spite of theplainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful thanthat of beauty but the princess never saw the beautiful expression ofher own eyes the look they had when she was not thinking ofherself as with everyone her face assumed a forced unnaturalexpression as soon as she looked in a glass she went on reading 
 all moscow talks of nothing but war one of my two brothers isalready abroad the other is with the guards who are starting ontheir march to the frontier our dear emperor has left petersburgand it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chancesof war god grant that the corsican monster who is destroying thepeace of europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased thealmighty in his goodness to give us as sovereign to say nothingof my brothers this war has deprived me of one of the associationsnearest my heart i mean young nicholas rostov who with hisenthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left theuniversity to join the army i will confess to you dear mary that inspite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a greatgrief to me this young man of whom i spoke to you last summer is and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom findsnowadays among our old men of twenty and particularly he is so frankand has so much heart he is so pure and poetic that my relations withhim transient as they were have been one of the sweetest comforts tomy poor heart which has already suffered so much someday i will tellyou about our parting and all that was said then that is still toofresh ah dear friend you are happy not to know these poignantjoys and sorrows you are fortunate for the latter are generallythe stronger i know very well that count nicholas is too young everto be more to me than a friend but this sweet friendship this poeticand pure intimacy were what my heart needed but enough of chief news about which all moscow gossips is the death of oldcount bezukhov and his inheritance fancy the three princesseshave received very little prince vasili nothing and it is monsieurpierre who has inherited all the property and has besides beenrecognized as legitimate so that he is now count bezukhov andpossessor of the finest fortune in russia it is rumored that princevasili played a very despicable part in this affair and that hereturned to petersburg quite crestfallen 
 i confess i understand very little about all these matters ofwills and inheritance but i do know that since this young man whomwe all used to know as plain monsieur pierre has become countbezukhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in russia iam much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of themammas burdened by marriageable daughters and of the young ladiesthemselves toward him though between you and me he always seemedto me a poor sort of fellow as for the past two years people haveamused themselves by finding husbands for me most of whom i know the matchmaking chronicles of moscow now speak of me asthe future countess bezukhova but you will understand that i haveno desire for the post a propos of marriages do you know that awhile ago that universal auntie anna mikhaylovna told me under theseal of strict secrecy of a plan of marriage for you it is neithermore nor less than with prince son anatole whom they wish toreform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguee and it is onyou that his relations choice has fallen i know what youwill think of it but i consider it my duty to let you know of is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace that isall i have been able to find out about him 
 but enough of gossip i am at the end of my second sheet of mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the apraksins read themystical book i am sending you it has an enormous success there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind tograsp it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the give my respects to monsieur your father and my complimentsto mademoiselle bourienne i embrace you as i love you 
 julie 
 let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife 
 the princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and herluminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed thenshe suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table shetook a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it this isthe reply she wrote also in french 
 dear and precious friend your letter of the th has given me greatdelight so you still love me my romantic julie separation of whichyou say so much that is bad does not seem to have had its usualeffect on you you complain of our separation what then should i i dared complain i who am deprived of all who are dear to if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad whydo you suppose that i should look severely on your affection forthat young man on such matters i am only severe with myself iunderstand such feelings in others and if never having felt them icannot approve of them neither do i condemn them only it seems to methat christian love love of neighbor love of enemy isworthier sweeter and better than the feelings which the beautifuleyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girllike yourself 
 the news of count death reached us before your letter andmy father was much affected by it he says the count was the lastrepresentative but one of the great century and that it is his ownturn now but that he will do all he can to let his turn come aslate as possible god preserve us from that terrible misfortune 
 i cannot agree with you about pierre whom i knew as a child healways seemed to me to have an excellent heart and that is thequality i value most in people as to his inheritance and the partplayed by prince vasili it is very sad for both ah my dearfriend our divine words that it is easier for a camel togo through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter thekingdom of god are terribly true i pity prince vasili but am stillmore sorry for pierre so young and burdened with such riches towhat temptations he will be exposed if i were asked what i desiremost on earth it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar athousand thanks dear friend for the volume you have sent me andwhich has such success in moscow yet since you tell me that amongsome good things it contains others which our weak human understandingcannot grasp it seems to me rather useless to spend time in readingwhat is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit i nevercould understand the fondness some people have for confusing theirminds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubtsand excite their imagination giving them a bent for exaggerationquite contrary to christian simplicity let us rather read theepistles and gospels let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries theycontain for how can we miserable sinners that we are know theterrible and holy secrets of providence while we remain in thisflesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the eternal letus rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules whichour divine saviour has left for our guidance here below let us try toconform to them and follow them and let us be persuaded that the lesswe let our feeble human minds roam the better we shall please rejects all knowledge that does not come from him and the less weseek to fathom what he has been pleased to conceal from us the soonerwill he vouchsafe its revelation to us through his divine spirit 
 my father has not spoken to me of a suitor but has only told methat he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from princevasili in regard to this project of marriage for me i will tell sweet friend that i look on marriage as a divine institutionto which we must conform however painful it may be to me shouldthe almighty lay the duties of wife and wife and mother upon me ishall try to perform them as faithfully as i can withoutdisquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom he maygive me for husband 
 i have had a letter from my brother who announces his speedyarrival at bald hills with his wife this pleasure will be but a briefone however for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappywar into which we have been drawn god knows how or why not onlywhere you are at the heart of affairs and of the world is the talkall of war even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature whichtownsfolk consider characteristic of the country rumors of war areheard and painfully felt my father talks of nothing but marches andcountermarches things of which i understand nothing and the daybefore yesterday during my daily walk through the village iwitnessed a heartrending scene it was a convoy of conscriptsenrolled from our people and starting to join the army you shouldhave seen the state of the mothers wives and children of the men whowere going and should have heard the sobs it seems as thoughmankind has forgotten the laws of its divine saviour who preachedlove and forgiveness of injuries and that men attribute thegreatest merit to skill in killing one another 
 adieu dear and kind friend may our divine saviour and his mostholy mother keep you in their holy and care 
 mary 
 ah you are sending off a letter princess i have alreadydispatched mine i have written to my poor mother said the smilingmademoiselle bourienne rapidly in her pleasant mellow tones andwith guttural she brought into princess and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere and 
 princess i must warn you she added lowering her voice andevidently listening to herself with pleasure and speaking withexaggerated grasseyement the prince has been scolding michaelivanovich he is in a very bad humor very morose be prepared 
 ah dear friend replied princess mary i have asked you never towarn me of the humor my father is in i do not allow myself to judgehim and would not have others do so 
 the princess glanced at her watch and seeing that she was fiveminutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord went into thesitting room with a look of alarm between twelve and two the day was mapped out the prince rested and the princess playedthe clavichord

 chapter 
 
 these things happened last winter sir said mrs dean hardly more than a year ago last winter i did not think at another twelve months end i should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them yet who knows how long be a stranger too young to rest always contented living by yourself and i some way fancy no one could see catherine linton and not love her you smile but why do you look so lively and interested when i talk about her and why have you asked me to hang her picture over your fireplace and why 
 stop my good friend i cried it may be very possible that i should love her but would she love me i doubt it too much to venture my tranquillity by running into temptation and then my home is not here of the busy world and to its arms i must return go on was catherine obedient to her commands 
 she was continued the housekeeper her affection for him was still the chief sentiment in her heart and he spoke without anger he spoke in the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and foes where his remembered words would be the only aid that he could bequeath to guide her he said to me a few days afterwards 
 i wish my nephew would write ellen or call tell me sincerely what you think of him is he changed for the better or is there a prospect of improvement as he grows a man 
 very delicate sir i replied and scarcely likely to reach manhood but this i can say he does not resemble his father and if miss catherine had the misfortune to marry him he would not be beyond her control unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent however master have plenty of time to get acquainted with him and see whether he would suit her it wants four years and more to his being of age 
 edgar sighed and walking to the window looked out towards gimmerton kirk it was a misty afternoon but the february sun shone dimly and we could just distinguish the two fir trees in the yard and the sparely scattered gravestones 
 prayed often he half soliloquized for the approach of what is coming and now i begin to shrink and fear it i thought the memory of the hour i came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the anticipation that i was soon in a few months or possibly weeks to be carried up and laid in its lonely hollow ellen been very happy with my little cathy through winter nights and summer days she was a living hope at my side but been as happy musing by myself among those stones under that old church lying through the long june evenings on the green mound of her grave and for the time when i might lie beneath it what can i do for cathy how must i quit her not care one moment for linton being son nor for his taking her from me if he could console her for my loss not care that heathcliff gained his ends and triumphed in robbing me of my last blessing but should linton be a feeble tool to his cannot abandon her to him and hard though it be to crush her buoyant spirit i must persevere in making her sad while i live and leaving her solitary when i die darling rather resign her to god and lay her in the earth before me 
 resign her to god as it is sir i answered and if we should lose may he his providence stand her friend and counsellor to the last miss catherine is a good girl i fear that she will go wilfully wrong and people who do their duty are always finally rewarded 
 spring advanced yet my master gathered no real strength though he resumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter to her inexperienced notions this itself was a sign of convalescence and then his cheek was often flushed and his eyes were bright she felt sure of his recovering on her seventeenth birthday he did not visit the churchyard it was raining and i observed 
 surely not go out tonight sir 
 he answered 
 no defer it this year a little longer 
 he wrote again to linton expressing his great desire to see him and had the invalid been presentable no doubt his father would have permitted him to come as it was being instructed he returned an answer intimating that mr heathcliff objected to his calling at the grange but his kind remembrance delighted him and he hoped to meet him sometimes in his rambles and personally to petition that his cousin and he might not remain long so utterly divided 
 that part of his letter was simple and probably his own heathcliff knew he could plead eloquently enough for company then 
 i do not ask he said that she may visit here but am i never to see her because my father forbids me to go to her home and you forbid her to come to mine do now and then ride with her towards the heights and let us exchange a few words in your presence we have done nothing to deserve this separation and you are not angry with me you have no reason to dislike me you allow yourself dear uncle send me a kind note tomorrow and leave to join you anywhere you please except at thrushcross grange i believe an interview would convince you that my character is not mine he affirms i am more your nephew than his son and though i have faults which render me unworthy of catherine she has excused them and for her sake you should also you inquire after my is better but while i remain cut off from all hope and doomed to solitude or the society of those who never did and never will like me how can i be cheerful and well 
 edgar though he felt for the boy could not consent to grant his request because he could not accompany catherine he said in summer perhaps they might meet meantime he wished him to continue writing at intervals and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by letter being well aware of his hard position in his family linton complied and had he been unrestrained would probably have spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations but his father kept a sharp watch over him and of course insisted on every line that my master sent being shown so instead of penning his peculiar personal sufferings and distresses the themes constantly uppermost in his thoughts he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from his friend and love and gently intimated that mr linton must allow an interview soon or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with empty promises 
 cathy was a powerful ally at home and between them they at length persuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk together about once a week under my guardianship and on the moors nearest the grange for june found him still declining and though he had set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young fortune he had a natural desire that she might at least return in a short time house of her ancestors and he considered her only prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir he had no idea that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself nor had anyone i believe no doctor visited the heights and no one saw master heathcliff to make report of his condition among us i for my part began to fancy my forebodings were false and that he must be actually rallying when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors and seemed so earnest in pursuing his object i could not picture a father treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as i afterwards learned heathcliff had treated him to compel this apparent eagerness his efforts redoubling the more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened with defeat by death

 chapter 
 
 the june roses over the porch were awake bright and early on that morning rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless sunshine like friendly little neighbors as they were quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces as they swung in the wind whispering to one another what they had seen for some peeped in at the dining room windows where the feast was spread some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden porch and hall and all from the rosiest flower to the palest baby bud offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long 
 meg looked very like a rose herself for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day making it fair and tender with a charm more beautiful than beauty neither silk lace nor orange flowers would she have i want a fashionable wedding but only those about me whom i love and to them i wish to look and be my familiar self 
 so she made her wedding gown herself sewing into it the tender hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart her sisters braided up her pretty hair and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the valley which her john liked best of all the flowers that grew 
 you do look just like our own dear meg only so very sweet and lovely that i should hug you if it crumple your dress cried amy surveying her with delight when all was done 
 then i am satisfied but please hug and kiss me everyone and mind my dress i want a great many crumples of this sort put into it today and meg opened her arms to her sisters who clung about her with april faces for a minute feeling that the new love had not changed the old 
 now going to tie cravat for him and then to stay a few minutes with father quietly in the study and meg ran down to perform these little ceremonies and then to follow her mother wherever she went conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest 
 as the younger girls stand together giving the last touches to their simple toilet it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which three years have wrought in their appearance for all are looking their best just now 
 angles are much softened she has learned to carry herself with ease if not grace the curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure there is a fresh color in her brown cheeks a soft shine in her eyes and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today 
 beth has grown slender pale and more quiet than ever the beautiful kind eyes are larger and in them lies an expression that saddens one although it is not sad itself it is the shadow of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience but beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of being better soon 
 amy is with truth considered the flower of the family for at sixteen she has the air and bearing of a woman not beautiful but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace one saw it in the lines of her figure the make and motion of her hands the flow of her dress the droop of her hair unconscious yet harmonious and as attractive to many as beauty itself nose still afflicted her for it never would grow grecian so did her mouth being too wide and having a decided chin these offending features gave character to her whole face but she never could see it and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion keen blue eyes and curls more golden and abundant than ever 
 all three wore suits of thin silver gray their best gowns for the summer with blush roses in hair and bosom and all three looked just what they were girls pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood 
 there were to be no ceremonious performances everything was to be as natural and homelike as possible so when aunt march arrived she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm 
 upon my word a state of things cried the old lady taking the seat of honor prepared for her and settling the folds of her lavender moire with a great rustle you to be seen till the last minute child 
 not a show aunty and no one is coming to stare at me to criticize my dress or count the cost of my luncheon too happy to care what anyone says or thinks and going to have my little wedding just as i like it john dear your hammer and away went meg to help that man in his highly improper employment 
 mr brooke even say thank you but as he stooped for the unromantic tool he kissed his little bride behind the folding door with a look that made aunt march whisk out her pocket handkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes 
 a crash a cry and a laugh from laurie accompanied by the indecorous exclamation jupiter ammon upset the cake again caused a momentary flurry which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived and the party came in as beth used to say when a child 
 let that young giant come near me he worries me worse than mosquitoes whispered the old lady to amy as the rooms filled and black head towered above the rest 
 he has promised to be very good today and he can be perfectly elegant if he likes returned amy and gliding away to warn hercules to beware of the dragon which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her 
 there was no bridal procession but a sudden silence fell upon the room as mr march and the young couple took their places under the green arch mother and sisters gathered close as if loath to give meg up the fatherly voice broke more than once which only seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn the hand trembled visibly and no one heard his replies but meg looked straight up in her eyes and said i will with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her heart rejoiced and aunt march sniffed audibly 
 jo did not cry though she was very near it once and was only saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that laurie was staring fixedly at her with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his wicked black eyes beth kept her face hidden on her shoulder but amy stood like a graceful statue with a most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair 
 it at all the thing afraid but the minute she was fairly married meg cried the first kiss for marmee and turning gave it with her heart on her lips during the next fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever for everyone availed themselves of their privileges to the fullest extent from mr laurence to old hannah who adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made fell upon her in the hall crying with a sob and a chuckle bless you deary a hundred times the cake hurt a mite and everything looks lovely 
 everybody cleared up after that and said something brilliant or tried to which did just as well for laughter is ready when hearts are light there was no display of gifts for they were already in the little house nor was there an elaborate breakfast but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit dressed with flowers mr laurence and aunt march shrugged and smiled at one another when water lemonade and coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three hebes carried around no one said anything till laurie who insisted on serving the bride appeared before her with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face 
 has jo smashed all the bottles by accident he whispered or am i merely laboring under a delusion that i saw some lying about loose this morning 
 no your grandfather kindly offered us his best and aunt march actually sent some but father put away a little for beth and dispatched the rest to the home you know he thinks that wine should be used only in illness and mother says that neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof 
 meg spoke seriously and expected to see laurie frown or laugh but he did neither for after a quick look at her he said in his impetuous way i like that for seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do 
 you are not made wise by experience i hope and there was an anxious accent in voice 
 no i give you my word for it think too well of me either this is not one of my temptations being brought up where wine is as common as water and almost as harmless i care for it but when a pretty girl offers it one like to refuse you see 
 but you will for the sake of others if not for your own come laurie promise and give me one more reason to call this the happiest day of my life 
 a demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment for ridicule is often harder to bear than meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs and feeling her power used it as a woman may for her good she did not speak but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness and a smile which said no one can refuse me anything today 
 laurie certainly could not and with an answering smile he gave her his hand saying heartily i promise mrs brooke 
 i thank you very very much 
 and i drink long life to your resolution teddy cried jo baptizing him with a splash of lemonade as she waved her glass and beamed approvingly upon him 
 so the toast was drunk the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of many temptations for with instinctive wisdom the girls seized a happy moment to do their friend a service for which he thanked them all his life 
 after lunch people strolled about by twos and threes through the house and garden enjoying the sunshine without and within meg and john happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot when laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding 
 all the married people take hands and dance round the husband and wife as the germans do while we bachelors and spinsters prance in couples outside cried laurie promenading down the path with amy with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their example without a murmur mr and mrs march aunt and uncle carrol began it others rapidly joined in even sallie moffat after a hesitation threw her train over her arm and whisked ned into the ring but the crowning joke was mr laurence and aunt march for when the stately old gentleman solemnly up to the old lady she just tucked her cane under arm and hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day 
 want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close and then people began to go 
 i wish you well my dear i heartily wish you well but i think be sorry for it said aunt march to meg adding to the bridegroom as he led her to the carriage got a treasure young man see that you deserve it 
 that is the prettiest wedding been to for an age ned and i see why for there a bit of style about it observed mrs moffat to her husband as they drove away 
 laurie my lad if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing get one of those little girls to help you and i shall be perfectly satisfied said mr laurence settling himself in his easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning 
 do my best to gratify you sir was unusually dutiful reply as he carefully unpinned the posy jo had put in his buttonhole 
 the little house was not far away and the only bridal journey meg had was the quiet walk with john from the old home to the new when she came down looking like a pretty quakeress in her dovecolored suit and straw bonnet tied with white they all gathered about her to say goodby as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour 
 feel that i am separated from you marmee dear or that i love you any the less for loving john so much she said clinging to her mother with full eyes for a moment i shall come every day father and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts though i am married beth is going to be with me a great deal and the other girls will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles thank you all for my happy wedding day goodby goodby 
 they stood watching her with faces full of love and hope and tender pride as she walked away leaning on her arm with her hands full of flowers and the june sunshine brightening her happy so married life began

lionfish nov chapter the egg and the eyecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the golden egg he decided to do it at night when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted reluctant though he was to accept more favors from cedric he also decided to use the prefects bathroom far fewer people were allowed in there so it was much less likely that he would be disturbed 
 
 harry planned his excursion carefully because he had been caught out of bed and by filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before and had no desire to repeat the experience the invisibility cloak would of course be essential and as an added precaution harry thought he would take the marauders map which next to the cloak was the most useful aid to harry owned the map showed the whole of hogwarts including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and most important of all it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule labeled dots moving around the corridors so that harry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom 
 
 on thursday night harry sneaked up to bed put on the cloak crept back downstairs and just as he had done on the night when hagrid had shown him the dragons waited for the portrait hole to open this time it was ron who waited outside to give the fat lady the password banana fritters good luck ron muttered climbing into the room as harry crept out past him 
 
 it was awkward moving under the cloak tonight because harry had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other however the moonlit corridors were empty and silent and by checking the map at strategic intervals harry was able to ensure that he run into anyone he wanted to avoid when he reached the statue of boris the bewildered a wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands he located the right door leaned close to it and muttered the password pine fresh just as cedric had told him 
 
 the door creaked open harry slipped inside bolted the door behind him and pulled off the invisibility cloak looking around 
 
 his immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be able to use this bathroom it was softly lit by a splendid chandelier and everything was made of white marble including what looked like an empty rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor about a hundred golden taps stood all around the pools edges each with a differently colored jewel set into its handle there was also a diving board long white linen curtains hung at the windows a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner and there was a single painting on the wall it featured a blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock her long hair over her face it fluttered every time she snored 
 
 harry moved forward looking around his footsteps echoing off the walls magnificent though the bathroom was and quite keen though he was to try out a few of those taps now he was here he quite suppress the feeling that cedric might have been having him on how on earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg nevertheless he put one of the huffy towels the cloak the map and the egg at the side of the bath then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps 
 
 he could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble bath mixed with the water though it bubble bath as harry had ever experienced it one tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs another poured foam so thick that harry thought it would have supported his weight if cared to test it a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water harry amused himself for awhile turning the taps on and off particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs then when the deep pool was full of hot water foam and bubbles which took a very short time considering its size harry turned off all the taps pulled off his pajamas slippers and dressing gown and slid into the water 
 
 it was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom and he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water staring at the egg highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of steam wafting all around him no stroke of brilliance came to him no sudden burst of understanding 
 
 harry stretched out his arms lifted the egg in his wet hands and opened it the wailing screeching sound filled the bathroom echoing and reverberating off the marble walls but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever if not more so with all the echoes he snapped it shut again worried that the sound would attract filch wondering whether that been plan and then making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg which clattered away across the bathroom floor someone spoke 
 
 try putting it in the water if i were you 
 
 harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock he stood up sputtering and saw the ghost of a very girl sitting on top of one of the taps it was moaning myrtle who was usually to be heard sobbing in the of a toilet three floors below 
 
 myrtle harry said in outrage not wearing anything 
 
 the foam was so dense that this hardly mattered but he had a nasty feeling that myrtle had been spying on him from out of one of the taps ever since he had arrived 
 
 i closed my eyes when you got in she said blinking at him through her thick spectacles you been to see me for ages 
 
 yeahwell said harry bending his knees slightly just to make absolutely sure myrtle see anything but his head not supposed to come into your bathroom am i a girls one 
 
 you used to care said myrtle miserably you used to be in there all the time 
 
 this was true though only because harry ron and hermione had found toilets a convenient place to brew polyjuice potion in secret a forbidden potion that had turned him and ron into living replicas of crabbe and goyle for an hour so that they could sneak into the slytherin common room 
 
 i got told off for going in there said harry which was percy had once caught him coming out of myrtles bathroom i thought better not come back after that 
 
 ohi see said myrtle picking at a spot on her chin in a morose sort of way try the egg in the water what cedric diggory did 
 
 have you been spying on him too said harry indignantly what do sneak up here in the evenings to watch the prefects take baths 
 
 sometimes said myrtle rather slyly but never come out to speak to anyone before 
 
 honored said harry darkly you keep your eyes shut 
 
 he made sure myrtle had her glasses well covered before hoisting himself out of the bath wrapping the towel firmly around his waist and going to retrieve the egg once he was back in the water myrtle peered through her fingers and said go on thenopen it under the water 
 
 harry lowered the egg beneath the foamy surface and opened itand this time it did not wail a gurgling song was coming out of it a song whose words he couldnt distinguish through the water 
 
 you need to put your head under too said myrtle who seemed to be thoroughly enjoying bossing him around go on 
 
 harry took a great breath and slid under the surface and now sitting on the marble bottom of the bath he heard a chorus of eerie voices singing to him from the open egg in his hands 
 
 come seek us where our voices sound 
 we cannot sing above the ground 
 and while you re searching ponder this 
 wove taken what sorely miss 
 an hour long have to look 
 and to recover what we took 
 but past an hour the black 
 too late gone it wont come back 
 
 harry let himself float back upward and broke the bubbly surface shaking his hair out of his eyes 
 
 hear it said myrtle 
 
 seek us where our voices sound and if i need persuadinghang on i need to listen again 
 
 he sank back beneath the water it took three more underwater renditions of the song before harry had it memorized then he trod water for a while thinking hard while myrtle sat and watched him 
 
 got to go and look for people who use their voices above the ground he said slowly erwho could that be 
 
 slow you 
 
 he had never seen moaning myrtle so cheerful apart from the day when a dose of polyjuice potion had given hermione the hairy face and tail of a cat harry stared around the bathroom thinkingif the voices could only be heard underwater then it made sense for them to belong to underwater creatures he ran this theory past myrtle who smirked at him 
 
 well thats what diggory thought she said he lay there talking to himself for ages about it ages and agesnearly all the bubbles had gone 
 
 underwater harry said slowly myrtlewhat lives in the lake apart from the giant squid 
 
 oh all sorts she said i sometimes go down theresometimes have any choice if someone flushes my toilet when not expecting it 
 
 trying not to think about moaning myrtle zooming down a pipe to the lake with the contents of a toilet harry said well does anything in there have a human voice hang on 
 
 eyes had fallen on the picture of the snoozing mermaid on the wall 
 
 myrtle there merpeople in there are there 
 
 oooh very good she said her thick glasses twinkling it took diggory much longer than that and that was with her awake too myrtle jerked her head toward the mermaid with an expression of great dislike on her glum face giggling and showing off and flashing her fins 
 
 thats it it said harry excitedly the second to go and find the merpeople in the lake andand 
 
 but he suddenly realized what he was saying and he felt the excitement drain out of him as though someone had just pulled a plug in his stomach he a very good swimmer never had much practice dudley had had lessons in his youth but aunt petunia and uncle vernon no doubt hoping that harry would drown one day bothered to give him any a couple of lengths of this bath were all very well but that lake was very large and very deepand merpeople would surely live right at the bottom 
 
 myrtle harry said slowly how am i supposed to breathe 
 
 at this eyes filled with sudden tears again 
 
 tactless she muttered groping in her robes for a handkerchief 
 
 tactless said harry bewildered 
 
 talking about breathing in front of me she said shrilly and her voice echoed loudly around the bathroom when i i for ages 
 
 she buried her face in her handkerchief and sniffed loudly harry remembered how touchy myrtle had always been about being dead but none of the other ghosts he knew made such a fuss about it 
 
 sorry he said impatiently i mean i just forgot 
 
 oh yes very easy to forget dead said myrtle gulping looking at him out of swollen eyes nobody missed me even when i was alive took them hours and hours to find my body i know i was sitting there waiting for them olive hornby came into the bathroom are you in here again sulking myrtle she said because professor dippet asked me to look for you and then she saw my bodyooooh she forget it until her dying day i made sure of thatfollowed her around and reminded her i did i remember at her wedding 
 
 but harry listening he was thinking about the song again taken what you ii sorely miss that sounded as though they were going to steal something of his something he had to get back what were they going to take 
 
 and then of course she went to the ministry of magic to stop me stalking her so i had to come back here and live in my toilet 
 
 good said harry vaguely well a lot further on than i your eyes again will you getting out 
 
 he retrieved the egg from the bottom of the bath climbed out dried himself and pulled on his pajamas and dressing gown again 
 
 will you come and visit me in my bathroom again sometime moaning myrtle asked mournfully as harry picked up the invisibility cloak 
 
 try harry said though privately thinking the only way be visiting bathroom again was if every other toilet in the castle got blocked see you myrtlethanks for your help 
 
 bye bye she said gloomily and as harry put on the invisibllity cloak he saw her zoom back up the tap 
 
 out in the dark corridor harry examined the marauders map to check that the coast was still clear yes the dots belonging to filch and his cat mrs norris were safely in their officenothing else seemed to be moving apart from peeves though he was bouncing around the trophy room on the floor had taken his first step back toward gryffindor tower when something else on the map caught his eyesomething distinctly odd 
 
 peeves was not the only thing that was moving a single dot was flitting around a room in the bottom corner office but the dot labeled severus was bartemius crouch 
 
 harry stared at the dot mr crouch was supposed to be too ill to go to work or to come to the yule ball so what was he doing sneaking into hogwarts at one in the morning harry watched closely as the dot moved around and around the room pausing here and there 
 
 harry hesitated thinkingand then his curiosity got the better of him he turned and set off in the opposite direction toward the nearest staircase he was going to see what crouch was up to 
 
 harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard the rustle of his pajamas he crept along the corridor below pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along and proceeded down a narrower staircase a shortcut that would take him down two floors he kept glancing down at the map wonderingit just seem in character somehow for correct mr crouch to be sneaking around somebody office this late at night 
 
 and then halfway down the staircase not thinking about what he was doing not concentrating on anything but the peculiar behavior of mr crouch leg suddenly sank right through the trick step neville always forgot to jump he gave an ungainly wobble and the golden egg still damp from the bath slipped from under his arm he lurched forward to try and catch it but too late the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step the invisibility cloak slipped harry snatched at it and the map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs where sunk in the step to above his knee he reach it 
 
 the golden egg fell through the tapestry at the bottom of the staircase burst open and began wailing loudly in the corridor below harry pulled out his wand and struggled to touch the map to wipe it blank but it was too far away to reach 
 
 pulling the cloak back over himself harry straightened up listening hard with his eyes screwed up with fearand almost immediately 
 
 peeves 
 
 it was the unmistakable hunting cry of filch the caretaker harry could hear his rapid shuffling footsteps coming nearer and nearer his wheezy voice raised in fury 
 
 this racket wake up the whole castle will you have you peeves have you what is this 
 
 footsteps halted there was a clink of metal on metal and the wailing stopped filch had picked up the egg and closed it harry stood very still one leg still jammed tightly in the magical step listening any moment now filch was going to pull aside the tapestry expecting to see peevesand there would be no peevesbut if he came up the stairs he would spot the mapand invisibility cloak or not the map would show harry potter standing exactly where he was 
 
 egg filch said quietly at the foot of the stairs my sweet mrs norris was obviously with him this is a triwizard clue this belongs to a school champion 
 
 harry felt sick his heart was hammering very fast 
 
 peeves filch roared gleefully been stealing 
 
 he ripped back the tapestry below and harry saw his horrible pouchy face and bulging pale eyes staring up the dark and to filch deserted staircase 
 
 hiding are you he said softly coming to get you gone and stolen a triwizard clue have you out of here for this you filthy pilfering poltergeist 
 
 filch started to climb the stairs his scrawny cat at his heels mrs eyes so very like her masters were fixed directly upon harry he had had occasion before now to wonder whether the invisibility cloak worked on with apprehension he watched filch drawing nearer and nearer in his old flannel dressing gown he tried desperately to pull his trapped leg free but it merely sank a few more inches any second now filch was going to spot the map or walk right into him 
 
 filch whats going on 
 
 filch stopped a few steps below harry and turned at the foot of the stairs stood the only person who could make situation worse snape he was wearing a long gray nightshirt and he looked livid 
 
 its peeves professor filch whispered malevolently he threw this egg down the stairs 
 
 snape climbed up the stairs quickly and stopped beside filch harry gritted his teeth convinced his loudly thumping heart would give him away at any second 
 
 peeves said snape softly staring at the egg in hands but peeves get into my office 
 
 this egg was in your office professor 
 
 of course not snape snapped i heard banging and wailing 
 
 yes professor that was the egg 
 
 i was coming to investigate 
 
 peeves threw it professor 
 
 and when i passed my office i saw that the torches were lit and a cupboard door was ajar somebody has been searching it 
 
 but peeves 
 
 i know he filch snape snapped again i seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break snape looked up the stairs straight through harry and then down into the corridor below i want you to come and help me search for the intruder filch 
 
 i yes professor but 
 
 filch looked yearningly up the stairs right through harry who could see that he was very reluctant to forgo the chance of cornering peeves go harry pleaded with him silently go with snapegomrs norris was peering around had the distinct impression that she could smell had he filled that bath with so much perfumed foam 
 
 the thing is professor said filch plaintively the headmaster will have to listen to me this time peeves has been stealing from a student it might be my chance to get him thrown out of the castle once and for all 
 
 filch i give a damn about that wretched poltergeist my office 
 
 clunk clunk clunk 
 
 snape stopped talking very abruptly he and filch both looked down at the foot of the stairs harry saw moody limp into sight through the narrow gap between their heads moody was wearing his old traveling cloak over his nightshirt and leaning on his staff as usual 
 
 pajama party is it he growled up the stairs 
 
 professor snape and i heard noises professor said filch at once peeves the poltergeist throwing things around as usual and then professor snape discovered that someone had broken into his off 
 
 shut up snape hissed to filch 
 
 moody took a step closer to the foot of the stairs harry saw magical eye travel over snape and then unmistakably onto himself 
 
 heart gave a horrible jolt moody could see through invisibility cloakshe alone could see the full strangeness of the scene 
 
 snape in his nightshirt filch clutching the egg and he harry trapped in the stairs behind them lopsided gash of a mouth opened in surprise for a few seconds he and harry stared straight into each eyes then moody closed his mouth and turned his blue eye upon snape again 
 
 did i hear that correctly snape he asked slowly someone broke into your office 
 
 it is unimportant said snape coldly on the contrary growled moody it is very important want to break into your office 
 
 a student i daresay said snape harry could see a vein flickering horribly on greasy temple it has happened before potion ingredients have gone missing from my private store cupboardstudents attempting illicit mixtures no doubt 
 
 reckon they were after potion ingredients eh said moody not hiding anything else in your office are you 
 
 harry saw the edge of sallow face turn a nasty brick color the vein in his temple pulsing more rapidly 
 
 you know hiding nothing moody he said in a soft and dangerous voice as searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself 
 
 face twisted into a smile privilege snape dumbledore told me to keep an eye 
 
 dumbledore happens to trust me said snape through clenched teeth i refuse to believe that he gave you orders to search my office 
 
 course dumbledore trusts you growled moody hes a trusting man he believes in second chances but me i say there are spots that come off snape spots that never come off know what i mean 
 
 snape suddenly did something very strange he seized his left forearm convulsively with his right hand as though something on it had hurt him 
 
 moody laughed get back to bed snape 
 
 you have the authority to send me anywhere snape hissed letting go of his arm as though angry with himself i have as much right to prowl this school after dark as you do 
 
 prowl away said moody but his voice was full of menace i look forward to meeting you in a dark corridor some dropped something by the way 
 
 with a stab of horror harry saw moody point at the marauders map still lying on the staircase six steps below him as snape and filch both turned to look at it harry threw caution to the winds he raised his arms under the cloak and waved furiously at moody to attract his attention mouthing mine mine 
 
 snape had reached out for it a horrible expression of dawning comprehension on his face 
 
 accio parchment 
 
 the map flew up into the air slipped through outstretched fingers and soared down the stairs into hand 
 
 my mistake moody said calmly mine dropped it earlier 
 
 but black eyes were darting from the egg in arms to the map in hand and harry could tell he was putting two and two together as only snape could 
 
 potter he said quietly 
 
 that said moody calmly folding up the map and pocketing it 
 
 potter snape snarled and he actually turned his head and stared right at the place where harry was as though he could suddenly see him that egg is potters egg that piece of parchment belongs to potter i have seen it before i recognize it potter is here potter in his invisibility cloak 
 
 snape stretched out his hands like a blind man and began to move up the stairs harry could have sworn his nostrils were dilating trying to sniff harry out trapped harry leaned backward trying to avoid fingertips but any moment now 
 
 nothing there snape barked moody but be happy to tell the headmaster how quickly your mind jumped to harry potter 
 
 meaning what snape turned again to look at moody his hands still outstretched inches from chest 
 
 meaning that very interested to know got it in for that boy said moody limping nearer still to the foot of the stairs and so am i snapevery interested the torchlight flickered across his mangled face so that the scars and the chunk missing from his nose looked deeper and darker than ever 
 
 snape was looking down at moody and harry see the expression on his face for a moment nobody moved or said anything then snape slowly lowered his hands 
 
 i merely thought said snape in a voice of forced calm that if potter was wandering around after hours an unfortunate habit of hishe should be stopped for for his own safety 
 
 ah i see said moody softly got best interests at heart have you 
 
 there was a pause snape and moody were still staring at each other mrs norris gave a loud meow still peering around legs looking for the source of smell 
 
 i think i will go back to bed snape said curtly 
 
 best idea had all night said moody now filch if just give me that egg 
 
 no said filch clutching the egg as though it were his firstborn son professor moody this is evidence of peeves treachery 
 
 the property of the champion he stole it from said moody hand it over now 
 
 snape swept downstairs and passed moody without another word filch made a chirruping noise to mrs norris who stared blankly at harry for a few more seconds before turning and following her master still breathing very fast harry heard snape walking away down the corridor filch handed moody the egg and disappeared from view too muttering to mrs norris never mind my see dumbledore in the morningtell him what peeves was up to 
 
 a door slammed harry was left staring down at moody who placed his staff on the bottommost stair and started to climb laboriously toward him a dull clunk on every other step 
 
 close shave potter he muttered 
 
 yeahi erthanks said harry weakly 
 
 what is this thing said moody drawing the map out of his pocket and unfolding it 
 
 map of hogwarts said harry hoping moody was going to pull him out of the staircase soon his leg was really hurting him 
 
 merlins beard moody whispered staring at the map his magical eye going haywire thisthis is some map potter 
 
 yeah itsquite useful harry said his eyes were starting to water from the pain er professor moody think you could help me 
 
 what oh yesyes of course 
 
 moody took hold of arms and pulled leg came free of the trick step and he climbed onto the one above it moody was still gazing at the map 
 
 potter he said slowly you happen by any chance to see who broke into office did you on this map i mean 
 
 eryeah i did harry admitted it was mr crouch 
 
 magical eye whizzed over the entire surface of the map he looked suddenly alarmed 
 
 crouch he said sure potter 
 
 positive said harry 
 
 well not here anymore said moody his eye still whizzing over the map very very interesting 
 
 he said nothing for almost a minute still staring at the map harry could tell that this news meant something to moody and very much wanted to know what it was he wondered whether he dared ask moody scared him slightlyyet moody had just helped him avoid an awful lot of trouble 
 
 erprofessor moodywhy reckon mr crouch wanted to look around office 
 
 magical eye left the map and fixed quivering upon harry it was a penetrating glare and harry had the impression that moody was sizing him up wondering whether to answer or not or how much to tell him 
 
 put it this way potter moody muttered finally they say old obsessed with catching dark wizardsbut nothing nothing compared to barty crouch 
 
 he continued to stare at the map harry was burning to know more 
 
 professor moody he said again thinkcould this have anything to do withmaybe mr crouch thinks something going on 
 
 like what said moody sharply 
 
 harry wondered how much he dare say he want moody to guess that he had a source of information outside hogwarts that might lead to tricky questions about sirius 
 
 i know harry muttered odd stuffs been happening lately it been in the daily prophetthe dark mark at the world cup and the death eaters and everything 
 
 both of mismatched eyes widened 
 
 a sharp boy potter he said his magical eye roved back to the map crouch could be thinking along those lines he said slowly very possiblethere have been some funny rumors flying around lately helped along by rita skeeter of course making a lot of people nervous i reckon a grim smile twisted his lopsided mouth oh if one thing i hate he muttered more to himself than to harry and his magical eye was fixed on the corner of the map its a death eater who walked free 
 
 harry stared at him could moody possibly mean what harry thought he meant 
 
 and now i want to ask you a question potter said moody in a more businesslike tone 
 
 heart sank he had thought this was coming moody was going to ask where he had got this map which was a very dubious magical object and the story of how it had fallen into his hands incriminated not only him but his own father fred and george weasley and professor lupin their last defense against the dark arts teacher moody waved the map in front of harry who braced himself 
 
 can i borrow this 
 
 oh said harry 
 
 he was very fond of his map but on the other hand he was extremely relieved that moody asking where got it and there was no doubt that he owed moody a favor 
 
 yeah okay 
 
 good boy growled moody i can make good use of thisthis might be exactly what been looking bed potter come on now 
 
 they climbed to the top of the stairs together moody still examining the map as though it was a treasure the like of which he had never seen before they walked in silence to the door of office where he stopped and looked up at harry 
 
 you ever thought of a career as an auror potter 
 
 no said harry taken aback 
 
 you want to consider it said moody nodding and looking at harry thoughtfully yes indeedand guessing you werent just taking that egg for a walk tonight 
 
 er no said harry grinning been working out the clue 
 
 moody winked at him his magical eye going haywire again nothing like a nighttime stroll to give you ideas you in the morning 
 
 he went back into his office staring down at the marauders map again and closed the door behind him 
 
 harry walked slowly back to gryffindor tower lost in thought about snape and crouch and what it all was crouch pretending to be ill if he could manage to get to hogwarts when he wanted to what did he think snape was concealing in his office 
 
 and moody thought he harry ought to be an auror interesting ideabut somehow harry thought as he got quietly into his ten minutes later the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk he thought like to check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire

 question was answered the very next morning when daily prophet arrived she smoothed it out gazed for a moment at the front page and gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her 
 
 what said harry and ron together 
 
 for answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten photographs that filled the whole of the front page nine showing wizards faces and the tenth a some of the people in the photographs were silently jeering others were tapping their fingers on the frame of their pictures looking insolent each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to azkaban 
 
 antonin dolohov read the legend beneath a wizard with a long pale twisted face who was sneering up at harry convicted of the brutal murders of gideon and fabian prewett 
 
 algernon rookwood said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who was leaning against the edge of his picture looking bored convicted of leaking ministry of magic secrets to he who must not be named 
 
 but eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page she had long dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture though he had seen it sleek thick and shining she glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes an arrogant disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth like sirius she retained vestiges of great good looks but somethingperhaps azkabanhad taken most of her beauty 
 
 bellatrix lestrange convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of frank and alice longbottom 
 
 hermione nudged harry and pointed at the headline over the pictures which harry concentrating on bellatrix had not yet read 
 
 mass breakout from azkaban 
 
 ministry fears black is rallying point 
 
 for old death eaters 
 
 black said harry loudly not 
 
 shhh whispered hermione desperately not so loudjust read it 
 
 the ministry of magic announced late last night that there has been a mass breakout from azkaban 
 
 speaking to reporters in his private office cornelius fudge minister for magic confirmed that ten prisoners escaped in the early hours of yesterday evening and that he has already informed the muggle prime minister of the dangerous nature of these individuals 
 
 we find ourselves most unfortunately in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer sirius black fudge last do we think the two breakouts are unrelated an escape of this magnitude suggests outside help and we must remember that black as the first person ever to break out of azkaban would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footsteps we think it likely that these individuals who include cousin bellatrix lestrange have rallied around black as their leader we are however doing all we can to round up the criminals and we beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious on no account should any of these individuals be approached 
 
 there you are harry said ron looking awestruck why he was happy last night 
 
 i believe this snarled harry fudge is blaming the breakout on sirius 
 
 what other options does he have said hermione bitterly he can hardly say sorry everyone dumbledore warned me this might happen the azkaban guards have joined lord now worst supporters have broken out too i mean spent a good six months telling everyone you and dumbledore are liars he 
 
 hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while harry looked around the great hall he could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page but very few of them took the newspaper every day like hermione there they all were talking about homework and quidditch and who knew what other rubbish when outside these walls ten more death eaters had swollen ranks 
 
 he glanced up at the staff table it was a different story there dumbledore and professor mcgonagall were deep in conversation both looking extremely grave professor sprout had the prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon meanwhile at the far end of the table professor umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge for once her pouchy eyes were not sweeping the great hall looking for misbehaving students she scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where dumbledore and mcgonagall were talking so intently 
 
 oh my said hermione wonderingly still staring at the newspaper 
 
 what now said harry quickly he was feeling jumpy 
 
 horrible said hermione looking shaken she folded back page ten of the newspaper and handed it to harry and ron 
 
 tragic demise of ministry of magic worker 
 st hospital promised a full inquiry last night after ministry of magic worker broderich bode was discovered dead in his bed strangled by a pot plant healers called to the scene were unable to revive mr bode who had been injured in a workplace accident some weeks prior to his death 
 
 healer miriam strout who was in charge of mr ward at the time of the incident has been suspended on full pay and was unavailable for comment yesterday but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a statement 
 
 st deeply regrets the death of mr bode whose health was improving steadily prior to this tragic accident 
 
 we have strict guidelines on the decorations permitted on our wards but it appears that healer strout busy over the christmas period overlooked the dangers of the plant on mr bedside table as his speech and mobility improved healer strout encouraged mr bode to look after the plant himself unaware that it was not an innocent flitterbloom but a cutting of snare which when touched by the convalescent mr bode throttled him instantly 
 
 st is as yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward 
 
 bode said ron rings a bell 
 
 we saw him hermione whispered in st remember he was in the bed opposite just lying there staring at the ceiling and we saw the snare arrive shethe healersaid it was a christmas present 
 
 harry looked back at the story a feeling of horror was rising like bile in his throat 
 
 how come we recognise snare seen it before we stopped this from happening 
 
 who expects snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a pot plant said ron sharply not our fault whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame they must be a real prat why they check what they were buying 
 
 oh come on ron said hermione shakily i think anyone could put snare in a pot and not realise it tries to kill whoever touches it thisthis was murder a clever murder as well if the plant was sent anonymously anyone ever going to find out who did it 
 
 harry was not thinking about snare he was remembering taking the lift down to the ninth level of the ministry on the day of his hearing and the man who had got in on the atrium level 
 
 i met bode he said slowly i saw him at the ministry with your dad 
 
 mouth fell open 
 
 heard dad talk about him at home he was an unspeakablehe worked in the department of mysteries 
 
 they looked at each other for a moment then hermione pulled the newspaper back towards her closed it glared for a moment at the pictures of the ten escaped death eaters on the front then leapt to her feet 
 
 where are you going said ron startled 
 
 to send a letter said hermione swinging her bag on to her shoulder it well i know whether but worth trying and the only one who can 
 
 i hate it when she does that grumbled ron as he and harry got up from the table and made their own slower way out of the great hall would it kill her to tell us what up to for once take her about ten more secondshey hagrid 
 
 hagrid was standing beside the doors into the entrance hall waiting for a crowd of ravenclaws to pass he was still as heavily bruised as he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the giants and there was a new cut right across the bridge of his nose 
 
 all righ you two he said trying to muster a smile but managing only a kind of pained grimace 
 
 are you ok hagrid asked harry following him as he lumbered after the ravenclaws 
 
 fine fine said hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness he waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a professor vector who was passing jus busy yeh know usual stufflessons ter prepare couple o salamanders got scale rotan on probation he mumbled 
 
 on probation said ron very loudly so that many of the passing students looked around curiously sorryi on probation he whispered 
 
 yeah said hagrid i expected ter tell yer the truth yeh migh picked up on it bu that inspection didn go too well yeh know anyway he sighed deeply bes go an rub a bit more chilli powder on them salamanders or their be hangin off em next see yeh harry ron 
 
 he trudged away out of the front doors and down the stone steps into the damp grounds harry watched him go wondering how much more bad news he could stand 
 
 the fact that hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days but to indignation hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it indeed some people draco malfoy prominent among them seemed positively gleeful as for the freakish death of an obscure department of mysteries employee in st harry ron and hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared there was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now the ten escaped death eaters whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers rumours were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in hogsmeade that they were supposed to be hiding out in the shrieking shack and that they were going to break into hogwarts just as sirius black had once done 
 
 those who came from wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these death eaters spoken with almost as much fear as voldemorts the crimes they had committed during the days of reign of terror were legendary there were relatives of their victims among the hogwarts students who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors susan bones whose uncle aunt and cousins had all died at the hands of one of the ten said miserably during herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be harry 
 
 and i know how you stand horrible she said bluntly dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of screechsnap seedlings causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort 
 
 it was true that harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers voices they sounded curious rather than hostile now and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the version of how and why ten death eaters had managed to break out of the azkaban fortress in their confusion and fear these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them the one that harry and dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year 
 
 it was not only the students mood that had changed it was now quite common to come across two or three teachers conversing in low urgent whispers in the corridors breaking off their conversations the moment they saw students approaching 
 
 they obviously talk freely in the staff room any more said hermione in a low voice as she harry and ron passed professors mcgonagall flitwick and sprout huddled together outside the charms classroom one day not with umbridge there 
 
 reckon they know anything new said ron gazing back over his shoulder at the three teachers 
 
 if they do not going to hear about it are we said harry angrily not after decree what number are we on now for new notices had appeared on the house noticeboards the morning after news of the azkaban breakout 
 
 by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts 
 
 
 
 teachers are hereby banned from giving students any information 
 
 that is not strictly related to the subjects they are paid to teach 
 
 
 
 the above is in accordance with educational decree 
 
 number 
 
 
 
 signed dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor 
 
 this latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students lee jordan had pointed out to umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell fred and george off for playing exploding snap in the back of the class 
 
 exploding got nothing to do with defence against the dark arts professor not information relating to your subject 
 
 when harry next saw lee the back of his hand was bleeding rather badly harry recommended essence of murtlap 
 
 harry had thought the breakout from azkaban might have humbled umbridge a little that she might have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under the nose of her beloved fudge it seemed however to have only intensified her furious desire to bring every aspect of life at hogwarts under her personal control she seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long and the only question was whether it would be professor trelawney or hagrid who went first 
 
 every single divination and care of magical creatures lesson was now conducted in the presence of umbridge and her clipboard she lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room interrupting professor increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about ornithomancy and heptomology insisting that she predicted students answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball the tea leaves and the rune stones in turn harry thought professor trelawney might soon crack under the strain several times he passed her in the corridorsin itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower roommuttering wildly to herself wringing her hands and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder and all the while giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry if he had not been so worried about hagrid he would have felt sorry for herbut if one of them was to be ousted from their job there could be only one choice for harry as to who should remain 
 
 unfortunately harry could not see that hagrid was putting up a better show than trelawney though he seemed to be following advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than a crupa creature indistinguishable from a jack russell terrier except for its forked tailsince before christmas he too seemed to have lost his nerve he was oddly distracted and jumpy during lessons losing the thread of what he was saying to the class answering questions wrongly and all the time glancing anxiously at umbridge he was also more distant with harry ron and hermione than he had ever been before and had expressly forbidden them to visit him after dark 
 
 if she catches yeh be all of our necks on the line he told them flatly and with no desire to do anything that might jeopardise his job further they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evenings 
 
 it seemed to harry that umbridge was steadily depriving him of everything that made his life at hogwarts worth living visits to house letters from sirius his firebolt and quidditch he took his revenge the only way he couldby redoubling his efforts for the da 
 
 harry was pleased to see that all of them even zacharias smith had been spurred on to work harder than ever by the news that ten more death eaters were now on the loose but in nobody was this improvement more pronounced than in neville the news of his parents attackers escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him he had not once mentioned his meeting with harry ron and hermione on the closed ward in st and taking their lead from him they had kept quiet about it too nor had he said anything on the subject of bellatrix and her fellow torturers escape in fact neville barely spoke during the da meetings any more but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and harry taught them his plump face screwed up in concentration apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents and working harder than anyone else in the room he was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when harry taught them the shield charma means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attackeronly hermione mastered the charm faster than neville 
 
 harry would have given a great deal to be making as much progress at occlumency as neville was making during the da meetings sessions with snape which had started badly enough were not improving on the contrary harry felt he was getting worse with every lesson 
 
 before he had started studying occlumency his scar had prickled occasionally usually during the night or else following one of those strange flashes of thoughts or mood that he experienced every now and then nowadays however his scar hardly ever stopped prickling and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar he had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in mood and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first occlumency lesson with snape what was more he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor towards the entrance to the department of mysteries almost every night dreams which always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door 
 
 maybe a bit like an illness said hermione looking concerned when harry confided in her and ron a fever or something it has to get worse before it gets better 
 
 the lessons with snape are making it worse said harry flatly getting sick of my scar hurting and getting bored with walking down that corridor every night he rubbed his forehead angrily i just wish the door would open sick of standing staring at it 
 
 not funny said hermione sharply dumbledore want you to have dreams about that corridor at all or he have asked snape to teach you occlumency just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons 
 
 i am working said harry nettled you try it some timesnape trying to get inside your not a bundle of laughs you know 
 
 maybe said ron slowly 
 
 maybe what said hermione rather snappishly 
 
 maybe not fault he close his mind said ron darkly 
 
 what do you mean said hermione 
 
 well maybe snape really trying to help harry 
 
 harry and hermione stared at him ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other 
 
 maybe he said again in a lower voice actually trying to open mind a bit wider make it easier for 
 
 shut up ron said hermione angrily how many times have you suspected snape and when have you ever been right dumbledore trusts him he works for the order that ought to be enough 
 
 he used to be a death eater said ron stubbornly and never seen proof that he really swapped sides 
 
 dumbledore trusts him hermione repeated and if we trust dumbledore we trust anyone 
 
 with so much to worry about and so much to do startling amounts of homework that frequently kept the working until past midnight secret da sessions and regular classes with snape january seemed to be passing alarmingly fast before harry knew it february had arrived bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second hogsmeade visit of the year harry had had very little time to spare for conversations with cho since they had agreed to visit the village together but suddenly found himself facing a day spent entirely in her company 
 
 on the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully he and ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owls hedwig was not there not that harry had expected herbut hermione was tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl as they sat down 
 
 and about time if it come today she said eagerly tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment her eyes sped from left to right as she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face 
 
 listen harry she said looking up at him this is really important do you think you could meet me in the three broomsticks around midday 
 
 well i dunno said harry uncertainly cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her we never said what we were going to do 
 
 well bring her along if you must said hermione urgently but will you come 
 
 well all right but why 
 
 i got time to tell you now got to answer this quickly 
 
 and she hurried out of the great hall the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of toast in the other 
 
 are you coming harry asked ron but he shook his head looking glum 
 
 i come into hogsmeade at all angelina wants a full training like going to help the worst team ever seen you should see sloper and kirke pathetic even worse than i am he heaved a great sigh i dunno why angelina just let me resign 
 
 because good when on form why said harry irritably 
 
 he found it very hard to be sympathetic to plight when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against hufflepuff ron seemed to have noticed tone because he did not mention quidditch again during breakfast and there was a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterwards ron departed for the quidditch pitch and harry after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon proceeded alone to the entrance hall to meet cho feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about 
 
 she was waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front doors looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long feet seemed to be too big for his body as he walked towards her and he was suddenly horribly aware of his arms and how stupid they must look swinging at his sides 
 
 hi said cho slightly breathlessly 
 
 hi said harry 
 
 they stared at each other for a moment then harry said wellershall we go then 
 
 ohyes 
 
 they joined the queue of people being signed out by filch occasionally catching each eye and grinning shiftily but not talking to each other harry was relieved when they reached the fresh air finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand about looking awkward it was a fresh breezy sort of a day and as they passed the quidditch stadium harry glimpsed ron and ginny skimming along over the stands and felt a horrible pang that he was not up there with them 
 
 you really miss it you said cho 
 
 he looked round and saw her watching him 
 
 yeah sighed harry i do 
 
 remember the first time we played against each other in the third year she asked him 
 
 yeah said harry grinning you kept blocking me 
 
 and wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to said cho smiling reminiscently i heard he got taken on by pride of portree is that right 
 
 nah it was puddlemere united i saw him at the world cup last year 
 
 oh i saw you there too remember we were on the same campsite it was really good it 
 
 the subject of the quidditch world cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gates harry could hardly believe how easy it was to talk to herno more difficult in fact than talking to ron and hermioneand he was just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of slytherin girls passed them including pansy parkinson 
 
 potter and chang screeched pansy to a chorus of snide giggles urgh chang i think much of your taste at least diggory was 
 
 the girls sped up talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glances back at harry and cho leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake harry could think of nothing else to say about quidditch and cho slightly flushed was watching her feet 
 
 so where want to go harry asked as they entered hogsmeade the high street was full of students ambling up and down peering into the shop windows and messing about together on the pavements 
 
 oh i mind said cho shrugging um shall we just have a look in the shops or something 
 
 they wandered towards dervish and banges a large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few hogsmeaders were looking at it they moved aside when harry and cho approached and harry found himself staring once more at the pictures of the ten escaped death eaters the poster by order of the ministry of magic offered a reward to any witch or wizard with information leading to the recapture of any of the convicts pictured 
 
 funny it said cho in a low voice gazing up at the pictures of the death eaters remember when that sirius black escaped and there were dementors all over hogsmeade looking for him and now ten death eaters are on the loose and there are no dementors anywhere 
 
 yeah said harry tearing his eyes away from bellatrix face to glance up and down the high street yeah that is weird 
 
 he sorry that there were no dementors nearby but now he came to think of it their absence was highly significant they had not only let the death eaters escape they bothering to look for them it looked as though they really were outside ministry control now 
 
 the ten escaped death eaters were staring out of every shop window he and cho passed it started to rain as they passed cold heavy drops of water kept hitting face and the back of his neck 
 
 um want to get a coffee said cho tentatively as the rain began to fall more heavily 
 
 yeah all right said harry looking around where 
 
 oh a really nice place just up here you ever been to madam she said brightly leading him up a side road and into a small teashop that harry had never noticed before it was a cramped steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frills or bows harry was reminded unpleasantly of office 
 
 cute it said cho happily 
 
 er yeah said harry untruthfully 
 
 look decorated it for day said cho indicating a number of golden cherubs that were hovering over each of the small circular tables occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupants 
 
 aaah 
 
 they sat down at the last remaining table which was over by the steamy window roger davies the ravenclaw quidditch captain was sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl they were holding hands the sight made harry feel uncomfortable particularly when looking around the teashop he saw that it was full of nothing but couples all of them holding hands perhaps cho would expect him to hold her hand 
 
 what can i get you said madam puddifoot a very stout woman with a shiny black bun squeezing between their table and roger with great difficulty 
 
 two coffees please said cho 
 
 in the time it took for their coffees to arrive roger davies and his girlfriend had started kissing over their sugar bowl harry wished they he felt that davies was setting a standard with which cho would soon expect him to compete he felt his face growing hot and tried staring out of the window but it was so steamed up he see the street outside to postpone the moment when he would have to look at cho he stared up at the ceiling as though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub 
 
 after a few more painful minutes cho mentioned umbridge harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moments abusing her but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during da meetings it did not last very long silence fell again harry was very conscious of the slurping noises coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say 
 
 er listen want to come with me to the three broomsticks at lunchtime meeting hermione granger there 
 
 cho raised her eyebrows 
 
 meeting hermione granger today 
 
 yeah well she asked me to so i thought i would want to come with me she said it matter if you did 
 
 oh well that was nice of her 
 
 but cho did not sound as though she thought it was nice at all on the contrary her tone was cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding 
 
 a few more minutes passed in total silence harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup beside them roger davies and his girlfriend seemed glued together at the tips 
 
 hand was lying on the table beside her coffee and harry was feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it just do it he told himself as a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest just reach out and grab it amazing how much more difficult it was to extend his arm twelve inches and touch her hand than it was to snatch a speeding snitch from midair 
 
 but just as he moved his hand forwards cho took hers off the table she was now watching roger davies kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression 
 
 he asked me out you know she said in a quiet voice a couple of weeks ago roger i turned him down though 
 
 harry who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table could not think why she was telling him this if she wished she were sitting at the next table being heartily kissed by roger davies why had she agreed to come out with him 
 
 he said nothing their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them some of it landed in the last cold dregs of coffee harry had been about to drink 
 
 i came in here with cedric last year said cho 
 
 in the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said insides had become glacial he could not believe she wanted to talk about cedric now while kissing couples surrounded them and a cherub floated over their heads 
 
 voice was rather higher when she spoke again 
 
 been meaning to ask you for ages did cedricdid hemmmention me at all before he died 
 
 this was the very last subject on earth harry wanted to discuss and least of all with cho 
 
 wellno he said quietly therethere time for him to say anything erm so get to see a lot of quidditch in the holidays you support the tornados right 
 
 his voice sounded falsely bright and cheery to his horror he saw that her eyes were swimming with tears again just as they had been after the last da meeting before christmas 
 
 look he said desperately leaning in so that nobody else could overhear not talk about cedric right now talk about something else 
 
 but this apparently was quite the wrong thing to say 
 
 i thought she said tears spattering down on to the table i thought u uunderstand i need to talk about it surely you nneed to talk about it ttoo i mean you saw it happen you 
 
 everything was going nightmarishly wrong roger girlfriend had even unglued herself to look round at cho crying 
 
 welli have talked about it harry said in a whisper to ron and hermione but 
 
 oh talk to hermione granger she said shrilly her face now shining with tears several more kissing couples broke apart to stare but you talk to me p perhaps it would be best if we just just ppaid and you went and met up with hermione ggranger like you obviously want to 
 
 harry stared at her utterly bewildered as she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it 
 
 cho he said weakly wishing roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and cho 
 
 go on leave she said now crying into the napkin i know why you asked me out in the first place if going to make arrangements to meet other girls right after me how many are you meeting after hermione 
 
 not like that said harry and he was so relieved at finally understanding what she was annoyed about that he laughed which he realised a split second too late was also a mistake 
 
 cho sprang to her feet the whole tearoom was quiet and everybody was watching them now 
 
 see you around harry she said dramatically and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain 
 
 cho harry called after her but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle 
 
 there was total silence within the teashop every eye was on harry he threw a galleon down on to the table shook pink confetti out of his hair and followed cho out of the door 
 
 it was raining hard now and she was nowhere to be seen he simply did not understand what had happened half an hour ago they had been getting along fine 
 
 women he muttered angrily sloshing down the street with his hands in his pockets what did she want to talk about cedric for anyway why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe 
 
 he turned right and broke into a splashy run and within minutes he was turning into the doorway of the three broomsticks he knew he was too early to meet hermione but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time he shook his wet hair out of his eyes and looked around hagrid was sitting alone in a corner looking morose 
 
 hi hagrid he said when he had squeezed through the crammed tables and pulled up a chair beside him 
 
 hagrid jumped and looked down at harry as though he barely recognised him harry saw that he had two fresh cuts on his face and several new bruises 
 
 oh yeh harry said hagrid yeh all righ 
 
 yeah fine lied harry but next to this battered and hagrid he felt he really have much to complain about erare you ok 
 
 me said hagrid oh yeah grand harry grand 
 
 he gazed into the depths of his pewter tankard which was the size of a large bucket and sighed harry know what to say to him they sat side by side in silence for a moment then hagrid said abruptly in the same boat yeh an me aren we arry 
 
 er said harry 
 
 yeah said it before both outsiders like said hagrid nodding wisely an both orphans yeah both orphans 
 
 he took a great swig from his tankard 
 
 makes a havin a decent family he said me dad was decent an your mum an dad were decent if lived life woulda bin eh 
 
 yeah i said harry cautiously hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood 
 
 family said hagrid gloomily whatever yeh say important 
 
 and he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye 
 
 hagrid said harry unable to stop himself where are you getting all these injuries 
 
 eh said hagrid looking startled wha injuries 
 
 all those said harry pointing at face 
 
 oh jus normal bumps an bruises harry said hagrid dismissively i got a rough job 
 
 he drained his tankard set it back on the table and got to his feet 
 
 be seein yeh harry take care now 
 
 and he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and disappeared into the torrential rain harry watched him go feeling miserable hagrid was unhappy and he was hiding something but he seemed determined not to accept help what was going on but before harry could think about it any further he heard a voice calling his name 
 
 harry harry over here 
 
 hermione was waving at him from the other side of the room he got up and made his way towards her through the crowded pub he was still a few tables away when he realised that hermione was not alone she was sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mates he could ever have imagined luna lovegood and none other than rita skeeter on the daily prophet and one of least favourite people in the world 
 
 early said hermione moving along to give him room to sit down i thought you were with cho i expecting you for another hour at least 
 
 cho said rita at once twisting round in her seat to stare avidly at harry a girl 
 
 she snatched up her handbag and groped within it 
 
 its none of your business if been with a hundred girls hermione told rita coolly so you can put that away right now 
 
 rita had been on the point of withdrawing an quill from her bag looking as though she had been forced to swallow stinksap she snapped her bag shut again 
 
 what are you up to harry asked sitting down and staring from rita to luna to hermione 
 
 little miss perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived said rita taking a large slurp of her drink i suppose allowed to talk to him am i she shot at hermione 
 
 yes i suppose you are said hermione coldly 
 
 unemployment did not suit rita the hair that had once been set in elaborate curls now hung lank and unkempt around her face the scarlet paint on her talons was chipped and there were a couple of false jewels missing from her winged glasses she took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth pretty girl is she harry 
 
 one more word about love life and the off and a promise said hermione irritably 
 
 what deal said rita wiping her mouth on the back of her hand you mentioned a deal yet miss prissy you just told me to turn up oh one of these days she took a deep shuddering breath 
 
 yes yes one of these days write more horrible stories about harry and me said hermione indifferently find someone who cares why you 
 
 run plenty of horrible stories about harry this year without my help said rita shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper how has that made you feel harry betrayed distraught misunderstood 
 
 he feels angry of course said hermione in a hard clear voice because told the minister for magic the truth and the too much of an idiot to believe him 
 
 so you actually stick to it do you that he who must not be named is back said rita lowering her glass and subjecting harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag you stand by all this garbage been telling everybody about returning and you being the sole witness 
 
 i the sole witness snarled harry there were a death eaters there as well want their names 
 
 love them breathed rita now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him as though he was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen a great bold headline potter accuses a harry potter names death eaters still among us and then beneath a nice big photograph of you disturbed teenage survivor of attack harry potter caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the wizarding community of being death eaters 
 
 the quill was actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression on her face died 
 
 but of course she said lowering the quill and looking daggers at hermione little miss perfect want that story out there would she 
 
 as a matter of fact said hermione sweetly exactly what little miss perfect does want 
 
 rita stared at her so did harry luna on the other hand sang weasley is our king dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick 
 
 you want me to report what he says about he who must not be named rita asked hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 yes i do said hermione the true story all the facts exactly as harry reports them give you all the details tell you the names of the undiscovered death eaters he saw there tell you what voldemort looks like nowoh get a grip on yourself she added contemptuously throwing a napkin across the table for at the sound of name rita had jumped so badly she had slopped half her glass of firewhisky down herself 
 
 rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat still staring at hermione then she said baldly the prophet print it in case you noticed nobody believes his story everyone thinks delusional now if you let me write the story from that angle 
 
 we need another story about how lost his marbles said hermione angrily had plenty of those already thank you i want him given the opportunity to tell the truth 
 
 no market for a story like that said rita coldly 
 
 you mean the prophet print it because fudge let them said hermione irritably 
 
 rita gave hermione a long hard look then leaning forwards across the table towards her she said in a businesslike tone all right fudge is leaning on the prophet but it comes to the same thing they print a story that shows harry in a good light nobody wants to read it against the public mood this last azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough people just want to believe back 
 
 so the daily prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear does it said hermione scathingly 
 
 rita sat up straight again her eyebrows raised and drained her glass of firewhisky 
 
 the prophet exists to sell itself you silly girl she said coldly 
 
 my dad thinks an awful paper said luna chipping into the conversation unexpectedly sucking on her cocktail onion she gazed at rita with her enormous protuberant slightly mad eye he publishes important stories he thinks the public needs to know he care about making money 
 
 rita looked disparagingly at luna 
 
 guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter she said probably ways to mingle with muggles and the dates of the next bring and fly sale 
 
 no said luna dipping her onion back into her gillywater the editor of the quibbler 
 
 rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked round in alarm 
 
 important stories he thinks the public needs to know eh she said witheringly i could manure my garden with the contends of that rag 
 
 well this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit it said hermione pleasantly luna says her quite happy to take interview be publishing it 
 
 rita stared at them both for a moment then let out a great whoop of laughter 
 
 the quibbler she said cackling you think people will take him seriously if published in the quibbler 
 
 some people said hermione in a level voice but the daily version of the azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it i think a lot of people will be wondering whether there a better explanation of what happened and if an alternative story available even if it is published in a she glanced sideways at luna in awell an unusual magazinei think they might be rather keen to read it 
 
 rita say anything for a while but eyed hermione shrewdly her head a little to one side 
 
 all right say for a moment do it she said abruptly what kind of fee am i going to get 
 
 i think daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine said luna dreamily they do it because an honour and of course to see their names in print 
 
 rita skeeter looked as though the taste of stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on hermione 
 
 supposed to do this for free 
 
 well yes said hermione calmly taking a sip of her drink otherwise as you very well know i will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered animagus of course the prophet might give you rather a lot for an account of life in azkaban 
 
 rita looked as though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella sticking out of drink and thrust it up her nose 
 
 i suppose got any choice have i said rita her voice shaking slightly she opened her crocodile bag once more withdrew a piece of parchment and raised her quill 
 
 daddy will be pleased said luna brightly a muscle twitched in jaw 
 
 ok harry said hermione turning to him ready to tell the public the truth 
 
 i suppose said harry watching rita balancing the quill at the ready on the parchment between them 
 
 fire away then rita said hermione serenely fishing a cherry out from the bottom of her glass 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter

lionfish nov chapter the seer overheardcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the fact that harry potter was going out with ginny weasley seemed to interest a great number of people most of them girls yet harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks after all it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that was making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time rather than because he had been involved in horrific scenes of dark magic 
 
 think people had better things to gossip about said ginny as she sat on the floor leaning against legs and reading the daily prophet three dementor attacks in a week and all romilda vane does is ask me if true got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest 
 
 ron and hermione both roared with laughter harry ignored them 
 
 what did you tell her 
 
 i told her a hungarian horntail said ginny turning a page of the newspaper idly much more macho 
 
 thanks said harry grinning and what did you tell her got 
 
 a pygmy puff but i say where 
 
 ron scowled as hermione rolled around laughing 
 
 watch it he said pointing wamingly at harry and ginny just because given my permission mean i withdraw it 
 
 your permission scoffed ginny since when did you give me permission to do anything anyway you said yourself rather it was harry than michael or dean 
 
 yeah i would said ron grudgingly and just as long as you start snogging each other in public 
 
 you filthy hypocrite what about you and lavender thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the place demanded ginny 
 
 but tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved into june for harry and time together was becoming increasingly restricted were approaching and she was therefore forced to revise for hours into the night on one such evening when ginny had retired to the library and harry was sitting beside the window in the common room supposedly finishing his herbology but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with ginny at hermione dropped into the seat between him and ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face 
 
 i want to talk to you harry 
 
 what about said harry suspiciously only the previous day hermione had told him off for distracting ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations 
 
 the prince 
 
 oh not again he groaned will you please drop it 
 
 he had not dared to return to the room of requirement to retrieve his book and his performance in potions was suffering accordingly though slughorn who approved of ginny had jocularly attributed this to harry being lovesick but harry was sure that snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the book and was determined to leave it where it was while snape remained on the lookout 
 
 not dropping it said hermione firmly until heard me out now been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing dark spells 
 
 he make a hobby of it 
 
 he hewho says a he 
 
 been through this said harry crossly prince hermione prince 
 
 right said hermione red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of harry look at that look at the picture 
 
 harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph yellowed with age ron leaned over for a look too the picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen she was not pretty she looked simultaneously cross and sullen with heavy brows and a long pallid face underneath the photograph was the caption eileen prince captain of the hogwarts gobstones team 
 
 so said harry scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged it was a rather dull story about competitions 
 
 her name was eileen prince prince harry 
 
 they looked at each other and harry realised what hermione was trying to say he burst out laughing 
 
 no way 
 
 what 
 
 you think she was the oh come on 
 
 well why not harry there any real princes in the wizarding world either a nickname a title given themselves or it could be their actual name it no listen if say her father was a wizard whose surname was prince and her mother was a muggle then that would make her a prince 
 
 yeah very ingenious hermione 
 
 but it would maybe she was proud of being half a prince 
 
 listen hermione i can tell not a girl i can just tell 
 
 the truth is that you think a girl would have been clever enough said hermione angrily 
 
 how can i have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are clever said harry stung by this the way he writes i just know the prince was a bloke i can tell this girl got anything to do with it where did you get this anyway 
 
 the library said hermione predictably a whole collection of old prophets up there well going to find out more about eileen prince if i can 
 
 enjoy yourself said harry irritably 
 
 i will said hermione and the first place look she shot at him as she reached the portrait hole is records of old potions awards 
 
 harry scowled after her for a moment then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky 
 
 just never got over you outperforming her in potions said ron returning to his copy of one thousand magical herbs and fungi 
 
 you think mad wanting that book back do you 
 
 course not said ron robustly he was a genius the prince anyway without his bezoar tip he drew his finger significantly across his own throat i be here to discuss it would i i mean not saying that spell you used on malfoy was great 
 
 nor am i said harry quickly 
 
 but he healed all right he back on his feet in no time 
 
 yeah said harry this was perfectly true although his conscience squirmed slightly all the same thanks to snape 
 
 you still got detention with snape this saturday ron continued 
 
 yeah and the saturday after that and the saturday after that sighed harry and hinting now that if i get all the boxes done by the end of term carry on next year 
 
 he was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with ginny indeed he had frequently wondered lately whether snape did not know this for he was keeping harry later and later every time while making pointed asides about harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered 
 
 harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance at his side of jimmy peakes who was holding out a scroll of parchment 
 
 thanks jimmy hey from dumbledore said harry excitedly unrolling the parchment and scanning it he wants me to go to his office as quick as i can 
 
 they stared at each other 
 
 blimey whispered ron you reckon he found 
 
 better go and see i said harry jumping to his feet 
 
 he hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor as fast as he could passing nobody but peeves who swooped past in the opposite direction throwing bits of chalk at harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged defensive jinx once peeves had vanished there was silence in the corridors with only fifteen minutes left until curfew most people had already returned to their common rooms 
 
 and then harry heard a scream and a crash he stopped in his tracks listening 
 
 howdareyouaaaaargh 
 
 the noise was coming from a corridor nearby harry sprinted towards it his wand at the ready hurtled round another corner and saw professor trelawney sprawled upon the floor her head covered in one of her many shawls several sherry bottles lying beside her one broken 
 
 professor 
 
 harry hurried forwards and helped professor trelawney to her feet some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her glasses she hiccoughed loudly patted her hair and pulled herself up on helping arm 
 
 what happened professor 
 
 you may well ask she said shrilly i was strolling along brooding upon certain dark portents i happen to have glimpsed 
 
 but harry was not paying much attention he had just noticed where they were standing there on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls and on the left that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall that concealed 
 
 professor were you trying to get into the room of requirement 
 
 omens i have been vouchsafedwhat 
 
 she looked suddenly shifty 
 
 the room of requirement repeated harry were you trying to get in there 
 
 iwelli know students knew about 
 
 not all of them do said harry but what happened you screamed it sounded as though you were hurt 
 
 iwell said professor trelawney drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes i wished toahdeposit certain c umpersonal items in the room and she muttered something about nasty accusations 
 
 right said harry glancing down at the sherry bottles but you get in and hide them 
 
 he found this very odd the room had opened for him after all when he had wanted to hide the book 
 
 oh i got in all right said professor trelawney glaring at the wall but there was somebody already in there 
 
 somebody in who demanded harry who was in there 
 
 i have no idea said professor trelawney looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in voice i walked into the room and i heard a voice which has never happened before in all my years of hidingof using the room i mean 
 
 a voice saying what 
 
 i know that it was saying anything said professor trelawney it was whooping 
 
 whooping 
 
 gleefully she said nodding 
 
 harry stared at her 
 
 was it male or female 
 
 i would hazard a guess at male said professor trelawney 
 
 and it sounded happy 
 
 very happy said professor trelawney sniffily 
 
 as though it was celebrating 
 
 most definitely 
 
 and then 
 
 and then i called out there 
 
 you have found out who it was without asking harry asked her slightly frustrated 
 
 the inner eye said professor trelawney with dignity straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices 
 
 right said harry hastily he had heard about professor inner eye all too often before and did the voice say who was there 
 
 no it did not she said everything went pitch black and the next thing i knew i was being hurled headfirst out of the room 
 
 and you see that coming said harry unable to help himself 
 
 no i did not as i say it was pitch she stopped and glared at him suspiciously 
 
 i think better tell professor dumbledore said harry he ought to know celebratingi mean that someone threw you out of the room 
 
 to his surprise professor trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion looking haughty 
 
 the headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me she said coldly i am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it if dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show 
 
 her bony hand closed suddenly around wrist 
 
 again and again no matter how i lay them out 
 
 and she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls 
 
 the tower she whispered calamity disaster coming nearer all the time 
 
 right said harry again well i still think you should tell dumbledore about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the room 
 
 you think so professor trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment but harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure 
 
 going to see him right now said harry got a meeting with him we could go together 
 
 oh well in that case said professor trelawney with a smile she bent down scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blue and white vase standing in a nearby niche 
 
 i miss having you in my classes harry she said soulfully as they set off together you were never much of a seer but you were a wonderful object 
 
 harry did not reply he had loathed being the object of professor continual predictions of doom 
 
 i am afraid she went on that the sorry the centaurknows nothing of cartomancy i asked himone seer to anotherhad he not too sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe but he seemed to find me almost comical yes comical 
 
 her voice rose rather hysterically and harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind 
 
 perhaps the horse has heard people say that i have not inherited my gift those rumours have been bandied about by the jealous for years you know what i say to such people harry would dumbledore have let me teach at this great school put so much trust in me all these years had i not proved myself to him 
 
 harry mumbled something indistinct 
 
 i well remember my first interview with dumbledore went on professor trelawney in throaty tones he was deeply impressed of course deeply impressed i was staying at the head which i do not advise incidentallybed bugs dear boybut funds were low dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room at the inn he questioned me i must confess that at first i thought he seemed towards divination and i remember i was starting to feel a little odd i had not eaten much that day but then 
 
 and now harry was paying attention properly for the first time for he knew what had happened then professor trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life the prophecy about him and voldemort 
 
 but then we were rudely interrupted by severus snape 
 
 what 
 
 yes there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with snape who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs although afraid that i myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with dumbledoreyou see he himself was seeking a job at the time and no doubt hoped to pick up tips well after that you know dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job and i could not help thinking harry that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent compared to the pushing thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholesharry dear 
 
 she looked back over her shoulder having only just realised that harry was no longer with her he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other 
 
 harry she repeated uncertainly 
 
 perhaps his face was white to make her look so concerned and frightened harry was standing as waves of shock crashed over him wave after wave obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from him for so long 
 
 it was snape who had overheard the prophecy it was snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to voldemort snape and peter pettigrew together had sent voldemort hunting after lily and james and their son 
 
 nothing else mattered to harry just now 
 
 harry said professor trelawney again harry i thought we were going to see the headmaster together 
 
 you stay here said harry through numb lips 
 
 but dear i was going to tell him how i was assaulted in the room of 
 
 you stay here harry repeated angrily 
 
 she looked alarmed as he ran past her round the corner into corridor where the lone gargoyle stood sentry harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time he did not knock upon door he hammered and the calm voice answered enter after harry had already flung himself into the room 
 
 fawkes the phoenix looked round his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the window dumbledore was standing at the window looking out at the grounds a long black travelling cloak in his arms 
 
 well harry i promised that you could come with me 
 
 for a moment or two harry did not understand the conversation with trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly 
 
 come with you 
 
 only if you wish it of course 
 
 if i 
 
 and then harry remembered why he had been eager to come to office in the first place 
 
 found one found a horcrux 
 
 i believe so 
 
 rage and resentment fought shock and excitement for several moments harry could not speak 
 
 it is natural to be afraid said dumbledore 
 
 not scared said harry at once and it was perfectly true fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all which horcrux is it where is it 
 
 i am not sure which it isthough i think we can rule out the snakebut i believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here a cave i have been trying to locate for a very long time the cave in which tom riddle once terrorised two children from his orphanage on their annual trip you remember 
 
 yes said harry how is it protected 
 
 i do not know i have suspicions that may be entirely wrong dumbledore hesitated then said harry i promised you that you could come with me and i stand by that promise but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous 
 
 coming said harry almost before dumbledore had finished speaking boiling with anger at snape his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minutes this seemed to show on face for dumbledore moved away from the window and looked more closely at harry a slight crease between his silver eyebrows 
 
 what has happened to you 
 
 nothing lied harry promptly 
 
 what has upset you 
 
 not upset 
 
 harry you were never a good occlumens 
 
 the word was the spark that ignited fury 
 
 snape he said very loudly and fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them happened he told voldemort about the prophecy it was him he listened outside the door trelawney told me 
 
 expression did not change but harry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun for a long moment dumbledore said nothing 
 
 when did you find out about this he asked at last 
 
 just now said many who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty and then suddenly he could not stop himself and you let him teach here and he told voldemort to go after my mum and dad 
 
 breathing hard as though he were fighting harry turned away from dumbledore who still had not moved a muscle and paced up and down the study rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over he wanted to rage and storm at dumbledore but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy the horcrux he wanted to tell him that he was a foolish old man for trusting snape but he was terrified that dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger 
 
 harry said dumbledore quietly please listen to me 
 
 it was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting harry paused biting his lip and looked into lined face 
 
 professor snape made a terrible 
 
 tell me it was a mistake sir he was listening at the door 
 
 please let me finish dumbledore waited until harry had nodded curtly then went on professor snape made a terrible mistake he was still in lord employ on the night he heard the first half of professor prophecy naturally he hastened to tell his master what he had heard for it concerned his master most deeply but he did not knowhe had no possible way of knowingwhich boy voldemort would hunt from then onwards or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that professor snape knew that they were your mother and father 
 
 harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter 
 
 he hated my dad like he hated sirius you noticed professor how the people snape hates tend to end up dead 
 
 you have no idea of the remorse professor snape felt when he realised how lord voldemort had interpreted the prophecy harry i believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned 
 
 but hes a very good occlumens he sir said harry whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady and voldemort convinced that on his side even now professor how can you be sure on our side 
 
 dumbledore did not speak for a moment he looked as though he was trying to make up his mind about something at last he said i am sure i trust severus snape completely 
 
 harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself it did not work 
 
 well i he said as loudly as before up to something with draco malfoy right now right under your nose and you still 
 
 we have discussed this harry said dumbledore and now he sounded stern again i have told you my views 
 
 leaving the school tonight and bet you even considered that snape and malfoy might decide to 
 
 to what asked dumbledore his eyebrows raised what is it that you suspect them of doing precisely 
 
 i up to something said harry and his hands curled into fists as he said it professor trelawney was just in the room of requirement trying to hide her sherry bottles and she heard malfoy whooping celebrating trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me fixed it at last and about to just walk out of school without 
 
 enough said dumbledore he said it quite calmly and yet harry fell silent at once he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line do you think that i have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year i have not tonight when i leave there will again be additional protection in place please do not suggest that i do not take the safety of my students seriously harry 
 
 i mumbled harry a little abashed but dumbledore cut across him 
 
 i do not wish to discuss the matter any further 
 
 harry bit back his retort scared that he had gone too far that he had ruined his chance of accompanying dumbledore but dumbledore went on do you wish to come with me tonight 
 
 yes said harry at once 
 
 very well then listen 
 
 dumbledore drew himself up to his full height 
 
 i take you with me on one condition that you obey any command i might give you at once and without question 
 
 of course 
 
 be sure to understand me harry i mean that you must follow even such orders as run hide or go back do i have your word 
 
 iyes of course 
 
 if i tell you to hide you will do so 
 
 yes 
 
 if i tell you to flee you will obey 
 
 yes 
 
 if i tell you to leave me and save yourself you will do as i tell you 
 
 i 
 
 harry 
 
 they looked at each other for a moment 
 
 yes sir 
 
 very good then i wish you to go and fetch your cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minutes time 
 
 dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window the sun was now a glare along the horizon harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase his mind was oddly clear all of a sudden he knew what to do 
 
 ron and hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back what does dumbledore want hermione said at once harry are you okay she added anxiously 
 
 fine said harry shortly racing past them he dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the map and a pair of socks then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room skidding to a halt where ron and hermione sat looking stunned 
 
 i got much time harry panted dumbledore thinks getting my invisibility cloak listen 
 
 quickly he told them where he was going and why he did not pause either for gasps of horror or for hasty questions they could work out the finer details for themselves later 
 
 so you see what this means harry finished at a gallop dumbledore be here tonight so going to have another clear shot at whatever up to no listen to me he hissed angrily as both ron and hermione showed every sign of interrupting i know it was malfoy celebrating in the room of requirement here he shoved the map into hand got to watch him and got to watch snape too use anyone else who you can rustle up from the da hermione those contact galleons will still work right dumbledore says put extra protection in the school but if involved know what protection is and how to avoid itbut he be expecting you lot to be on the watch will he 
 
 harry began hermione her eyes huge with fear 
 
 i got time to argue said harry curtly take this as well he thrust the socks into hands 
 
 thanks said ron erwhy do i need socks 
 
 you need wrapped in them the felix felicis share it between yourselves and ginny too say goodbye to her from me better go waiting 
 
 no said hermione as ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion looking awestruck we want it you take it who knows what going to be facing 
 
 be fine be with dumbledore said harry i want to know you lot are okay look like that hermione see you later 
 
 and he was off hurrying back through the portrait hole towards the entrance hall 
 
 dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors he turned as harry came skidding out on to the topmost stone step panting hard a searing stitch in his side 
 
 i would like you to wear your cloak please said dumbledore and he waited until harry had thrown it on before saying very good shall we go 
 
 dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps his own travelling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air harry hurried alongside him under the invisibility cloak still panting and sweating rather a lot 
 
 but what will people think when they see you leaving professor harry asked his mind on malfoy and snape 
 
 that i am off into hogsmeade for a drink said dumbledore lightly i sometimes offer rosmerta my custom or else visit the head or i appear to it is as good a way as any of disguising true destination 
 
 they made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight the air was full of the smells of warm grass lake water and wood smoke from cabin it was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening 
 
 professor said harry quietly as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view will we be apparating 
 
 yes said dumbledore you can apparate now i believe 
 
 yes said harry but i got a licence 
 
 he felt it best to be honest what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go 
 
 no matter said dumbledore i can assist you again 
 
 they turned out of the gates into the twilit deserted lane to hogsmeade darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the high street night was falling in earnest lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the three broomsticks they heard raucous shouting 
 
 and stay out shouted madam rosmerta forcibly ejecting a wizard oh hello albus out late 
 
 good evening rosmerta good evening forgive me off to the head no offence but i feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight 
 
 a minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the sign creaked a little though there was no breeze in contrast to the three broomsticks the pub appeared to be completely empty 
 
 it will not be necessary for us to enter muttered dumbledore glancing around as long as nobody sees us go now place your hand upon my arm harry there is no need to grip too hard i am merely guiding you on the count of threeone two three 
 
 harry turned at once there was that horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube he could not draw breath every part of him was being compressed almost past endurance and then just when he thought he must suffocate the invisible bands seemed to burst open and he was standing in cool darkness breathing in lungfuls of fresh salty air

lionfish nov chapter shell cottagecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 bill and fleurs cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed it was a lonely and beautiful place wherever harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea like the breathing of some great slumbering creature he spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage craving the view of open sky and wide empty sea and the feel of cold salty wind on his face the enormity of his decision not to race voldemort to the wand still scared harry he could not remember ever before choosing not to act he was full of doubts doubts that ron could not help voicing whenever they were together 
 
 what if dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand 
 
 what if working out what the symbol meant made you worthy to get the hallows 
 
 harry if that really is the elder wand how the hell are we supposed to finish off 
 
 harry had no answers there were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent voldemort breaking open the tomb he could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision they sounded feebler to him 
 
 the odd thing was that hermiones support made him feel just as confused as rons doubts now forced to accept that the elder wand was real she maintained that it was an evil object and that the way voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent not to be considered 
 
 you could never have done that harry she said again and again you couldnt have broken into dumbledores grave 
 
 but the idea of dumbledores corpse frightened harry much less than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living dumbledores intentions he felt that he was still groping in the dark he had chosen his path but kept looking back wondering whether he had misread the signs whether he should not have taken the other way from time to time anger at dumbledore crashed over him again powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage anger that dumbledore had not explained before he died 
 
 but is he dead said ron three days after they had arrived at the cottage harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when ron and hermione had found him he wished they had not having no wish to join in with their argument 
 
 yes he is ron please dont start that again 
 
 look at the facts hermione said ron speaking across harry who continued to gaze at the horizon the solve doe the sword the eye harry saw in the mirror c 
 
 harry admits he could have imagined the eye dont you harry 
 
 i could have said harry without looking at her 
 
 but you dont thing you did do you asked ron 
 
 no i dont said harry 
 
 there you go said ron quickly before hermione could carry on if it wasnt dumbledore explain how dobby knew we were in the cellar hermione 
 
 i cant c but can you explain how dumbledore sent him to us if hes lying in a tomb at hogwarts 
 
 i dunno it couldve been his ghost 
 
 dumbledore wouldnt come back as a ghost said harry there was little about dumbledore he was sure of now but he knew that much he would have gone on 
 
 what dyou mean gone on asked ron but before harry could say any more a voice behind them said arry 
 
 fleur had come out of the cottage her long silver hair flying in the breeze 
 
 arry gripook would like to speak to you e eez in ze smallest bedroom e says e does not want to be overeard 
 
 her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear she looked irritable as she walked back around the house 
 
 griphook was waiting for them as fleur had said in the tiniest of the cottages three bedrooms in which hermione and luna slept by night he had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright cloudy sky which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy light cottage 
 
 i have reached my decision harry potter said the goblin who was sitting in a low chair drumming its arms with his spindly fingers though the goblins of gringotts will consider it base treachery i have decided to help you c 
 
 thats great said harry relief surging through him griphook thank you were really c 
 
 c in return said the goblin firmly for payment 
 
 slightly taken aback harry hesitated 
 
 how much do you want ive got gold 
 
 not gold said griphook i have gold 
 
 his black eyes glittered there were no whites to his eyes 
 
 i want the sword the sword of godric gryffindor 
 
 harrys spirits plummeted 
 
 you cant have that he said im sorry 
 
 then said the goblin softly we have a problem 
 
 we can give you something else said ron eagerly ill bet the lestranges have got loads of stuff you can take your pick once we get into the vault 
 
 he had said the wrong thing griphook flushed angrily 
 
 i am not a thief boy i am not trying to procure treasures to which i have no right 
 
 the swords ours c 
 
 it is not said the goblin 
 
 were gryffindors and it was godric gryffindors c 
 
 and before it was gryffindors whose was it demanded the goblin sitting up straight 
 
 no ones said ron it was made for him wasnt it 
 
 no cried the goblin bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at ron wizarding arrogance again that sword was ragnuk the firsts taken from him by godric gryffindor it is a c a masterpiece of goblinwork it belongs with the goblc the sword is the price of my hire take it or leave it 
 
 griphook glared at them harry glanced at the other c then said we need to discuss this griphook if thats all right could you give us a few minutes 
 
 the goblin nodded looking sour 
 
 downstairs in the empty sitting room harry walked to the fireplace brow furrowed trying to think what to do behind him ron said hes having a laugh we cant let him have that sword 
 
 it is true harry asked hermione was the sword stolen by gryffindor 
 
 i dont know she said hopelessly wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races but theres no account that i know of that says gryffindor stole the sword 
 
 itll be one of those goblin stories said ron about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them i suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasnt asked for one of our wands 
 
 goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards ron said hermione theyve been treated brutally in the past 
 
 goblins arent exactly fluffy little bunnies though are they said ron theyve killed plenty of us theyve fought dirty too 
 
 but arguing with griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isnt going to make him more likely to help us is it 
 
 there was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem harry looked out of the window at dobbys grave luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone 
 
 okay said ron and harry turned back to face him hows this we tell griphook we need the sword until we get inside the c and then he can have it theres a fake in these isnt there we switch them and give him the fake 
 
 ron hed know the difference better than we would said hermione hes the only one who realized there had been a swap 
 
 yeah but we could c caper before he realizes c 
 
 he quailed beneath the look hermione was giving him 
 
 that she said quietly is despicable ask for his help then him and you wonder why goblins dont like wizards ron 
 
 rons ears had turned red 
 
 all right all right it was the only thing i could think of whats your solution then 
 
 we need to offer him something else something just as valuable 
 
 brilliant ill go and get one of our ancient swords and you can gift wrap it 
 
 silence fell between them again harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword even if they had something as valuable to offer him yet the sword was their one indispensable weapon against the horcruxes 
 
 he closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea the idea that gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him he had always been proud to be a gryffindor gryffindor had been the champion of the wizard who had clashed with the slytherin 
 
 maybe hes lying harry said opening his eyes again griphook maybe gryffindor didnt take the sword how do we know the goblin version of historys right 
 
 does it make a difference asked hermione 
 
 changes how i feel about it said harry 
 
 he took a deep breath 
 
 well tell him he can have the sword after hes helped us get into that vault c but well be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it 
 
 a grin spread slowly across rons face hermione however looked alarmed 
 
 harry we cant c 
 
 he can have it harry went on after weve used it on all of the horcruxes ill make sure he gets it then ill keep my word 
 
 but that could be years said hermione 
 
 i know that but he neednt i wont be lying really 
 
 harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame he remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to nurmengard for the greater good he pushed the idea away what choice did they have 
 
 i dont like it said hermione 
 
 nor do i much harry admitted 
 
 well i think its genius said ron standing up again lets go and tell him 
 
 back in the smallest bedroom harry made the offer careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking he felt irritated at her afraid that she might give the game away however griphook had eyes for nobody but harry 
 
 i have your word harry potter that you will give me the sword of gryffindor if i help you 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 then shake said the goblin holding out his hand 
 
 harry took it and shook he wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own then griphook relinquished him clapped his hands together and said so we begin 
 
 it was like planning to break into the ministry all over again they settled to work in the smallest bedroom which was kept according to griphooks preference in semidarkness 
 
 i have visited the lestranges vault only once griphook told them on the occasion i was told to place inside it the false sword it is one of the most ancient chambers the oldest wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level where the vaults are largest and best protected 
 
 they remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time slowly the days stretched into weeks there was problem after problem to overcome not least of which was that their store of polyjuice potion was greatly depleted 
 
 theres really only enough left for one of us said hermione tilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight 
 
 thatll be enough said harry who was examining griphooks map of the deepest passageways 
 
 the other inhabitants of shell cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that harry ron and hermione only emerged for mealtimes nobody asked questions although harry often felt bills eyes on the three of them at the table thoughtful concerned 
 
 the longer they spent together the more harry realized that he did not much like the goblin griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the lestranges vault harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two but they did not discuss it they needed griphook 
 
 the goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them even after his legs had mended he continued to request trays of food in his room like the ollivander until bill following an angry outburst from fleur went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue thereafter griphook joined them at the overcrowded table although he refused to eat the same food insisting instead on lumps of raw meat roots and various fungi 
 
 harry felt responsible it was after all he who had insisted that the goblin remain at shell cottage so that he could question him his fault that the whole weasley family had been driven into hiding that bill fred george and mr weasley could no longer work 
 
 im sorry he told fleur one blustery april evening as he helped her prepare dinner i never meant you to have to deal with all of this 
 
 she had just set some knives to work chipping up steaks for griphook and bill who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by greyback while the knives sliced behind her her somewhat irritable expression softened 
 
 arry you saved my sisters life i do not forget 
 
 this was not strictly speaking true but harry decided against reminding her that gabrielle had never been in real danger 
 
 anyway fleur went on pointing her want at a pot of sauce on the stove which began to bubble at once mr ollivander leaves for muriels zis evening zat will make zings easier ze goblin she scowled a little at the mention of him can move downstairs and you ron and dean can take zat room 
 
 we dont mind sleeping in the living room said harry who knew that griphook would thing poorly of having to sleep on the sofa keeping griphook happy was essential to their plans dont worry about us and when she tried to protest he went on well be off your hands soon too ron hermione and i we wont need to be here much longer 
 
 but what do you mean she said frowning at him her wand pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair of course you must not leave you are safe ere 
 
 she looked rather like mrs weasley as she said it and he was glad that the back door opened at that moment luna and dean entered their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood 
 
 and tiny little ears luna was saying a bit like hippos daddy says only purple and hairy and if you want to call them you have to hum they prefer a waltz nothing too fast 
 
 looking uncomfortable dean shrugged at harry as he passed following luna into the combined dining and sitting room where ron and hermione were laying the dinner table 
 
 seizing the chance to escape fleurs questions harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed them 
 
 and if you ever come to our house ill be able to show you the horn daddy wrote to me about it but i havent seen it yet because the death eaters took me from the hogwarts express and i never got home for christmas luna was saying as she and dean relit the fire 
 
 luna we told you hermione called over to her that horn exploded it came from an erumpent not a snorkack c 
 
 no it was definitely a snorkack horn said luna serenely daddy told me it will probably have by now they mend themselves you know 
 
 hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as bill appeared leading mr ollivander down the stairs the wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail and he clung to bills arm as the latter supported him carrying a large suitcase 
 
 im going to miss you mr ollivander said luna approaching the old man 
 
 and i you my dear said ollivander patting her on the shoulder 
 
 you were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place 
 
 so au revoir mr ollivander said fleur kissing him on both cheeks and i wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to bills auntie muriel i never returned er tiara 
 
 it will be an honor said ollivander with a little bow the very least i can do in return for your generous hospitality 
 
 fleur drew out a worn velvet case which she opened to show the wandmaker the tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the lamp 
 
 moonstones and diamonds said griphook who had sidled into the room without harry noticing made by goblins i think 
 
 and paid for by wizards said bill quietly and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging 
 
 a strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as bill and ollivander set off into the night the rest of them squeezed in around the table elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move they started to eat the fire crackled and popped in the grate beside them fleur harry noticed was merely playing with her food she glanced at the window every few minutes however bill returned before they had finished their first course his long hair tangled by the wind 
 
 everythings fine he told fleur ollivander settled in mum and dad say hello ginny sends you all her love fred and george are driving muriel up the wall theyre still operating an business out of her back room it cheered her up to have her tiara back though she said she thought wed stolen it 
 
 ah she eez charmant your aunt said fleur crossly waving her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair she caught them and marched out of the room 
 
 daddys made a tiara piped up luna well more of a crown really 
 
 ron caught harrys eye and grinned harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to xenophilius 
 
 yes hes trying to the lost diadem of ravenclaw he thinks hes identified most of the main elements now adding the billywig wings really made a difference c 
 
 there was a bang on the front door everyones head turned toward it fleur came running out of the kitchen looking frightened bill jumped to his feed his wand pointing at the door harry ron and hermione did the same silently griphook slipped beneath the table out of sight 
 
 who is it bill called 
 
 it is i remus john lupin called a voice over the howling wind harry experienced a thrill of fear what had happened i am a werewolf married to nymphadora tonks and you the of shell cottage told me the address and bade me come in an emergency 
 
 lupin muttered bill and he ran to the door and wrenched it open 
 
 lupin fell over the threshold he was wrapped in a traveling cloak his graying hair windswept he straightened up looked around the room making sure of who was there then cried aloud its a boy weve named him ted after doras father 
 
 hermione shrieked 
 
 wha c tonks c tonks has had the baby 
 
 yes yes shes had the baby shouted lupin all around the table came cries of delight sighs of relief hermione and fleur both squealed congratulations and ron said blimey a baby as if he had never heard of such a thing before 
 
 yes c yes c a boy said lupin again who seemed dazed by his own happiness he strode around the table and hugged harry the scene in the basement of grimmauld place might never have happened 
 
 youll be godfather he said as he released harry 
 
 stammered harry 
 
 you yes of course c dora quite agrees no one better c 
 
 i c yeah c blimey c 
 
 harry felt overwhelmed astonished delighted now bill was hurrying to fetch wine and fleur was persuading lupin to join them for a drink 
 
 i cant stay long i must get back said lupin beaming around at them all he looked years younger than harry had ever seen him thank you thank you bill 
 
 bill had soon filled all of their goblets they stood and raised them high in a toast 
 
 to teddy remus lupin said lupin a great wizard in the making 
 
 oo does e look like fleur inquired 
 
 i think he looks like dora but she thinks he is like me not much hair it looked black when he was born but i swear its turned ginger in the hour since probably blond by the time i get back andromeda says tonkss hair started changing color the day that she was born he drained his goblet oh go on then just one more he added beaming as bill made to fill it again 
 
 the wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled and bill was soon opening another bottle of wine lupins news seemed to have taken them out of themselves removed them for a while from their state of siege tidings of new life were exhilarating only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this until he saw bills eyes following the goblin up the stairs 
 
 no no i really must get back said lupin at last declining yet another goblet of wine he got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself 
 
 c ill try and bring some pictures in a few days time c theyll all be so glad to know that ive seen you c 
 
 he fastened his cloak and made his farewells hugging the women and grasping hands with the men then still beaming returned into the wild night 
 
 godfather harry said bill as they walked into the kitchen together helping clear the table a real honor congratulations 
 
 as harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying bill pulled the door behind him closed shutting out the voices of the others who were continuing to celebrate even in lupins absence 
 
 i wanted a private word actually harry it hasnt been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people 
 
 bill hesitated 
 
 harry youre planning something with griphook 
 
 it was a statement not a question and harry did not bother to deny it he merely looked at bill waiting 
 
 i know goblins said bill ive worked for gringotts ever since i left hogwarts as far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins i have goblin friends c or at least goblins i know well and like again bill hesitated 
 
 harry what do you want from griphook and what have you promised him in return 
 
 i cant tell you that said harry sorry bill 
 
 the kitchen door opened behind them fleur was trying to bring through more empty goblets 
 
 wait bill told her just a moment 
 
 she backed out and he closed the door again 
 
 then i have to say this bill went on if you have struck any kind of bargain with griphook and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure you must be exceptionally careful goblin notions of ownership payment and repayment are not the same as human ones 
 
 harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort as though a small snake had stirred inside him 
 
 what do you mean he asked 
 
 we are talking about a different breed of being said bill dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries c but youll know all that from history of magic there has been fault on both sides i would never claim that wizards have been innocent however there is a belief among some goblins and those at gringotts are perhaps most prone to it that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure that they have no respect for goblin ownership 
 
 i respect c harry began but bill shook his head 
 
 you dont understand harry nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins to a goblin the rightful and true master of any object is the maker not the purchaser all goblin made objects are in goblin eyes rightfully theirs 
 
 but it was bought c 
 
 c then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money they have however great difficulty with the idea of objects passing from wizard to wizard you saw griphooks face when the tiara passed under his eyes he disapproves i believe he thinks as do the fiercest of his kind that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died they consider our habit of keeping objects passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment little more than theft 
 
 harry had an ominous feeling now he wondered whether bill guessed more than he was letting on 
 
 all i am saying said bill setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room is to be very careful what you promise goblins harry it would be less dangerous to break into gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin 
 
 right said harry as bill opened the door yeah thanks ill bear that in mind 
 
 as he followed bill back to the others a wry thought came to him born no doubt of the wine he had drunk he seemed set on ccc to become just as reckless a godfather to teddy lupin as sirius black had been to him

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 the 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 there is nobody in the world who knows so many stories as 
 or who can relate them so nicely in the evening while 
 the children are seated at the table or in their little chairs he 
 comes up the stairs very softly for he walks in his socks then he 
 opens the doors without the slightest noise and throws a small 
 quantity of very fine dust in their eyes just enough to prevent 
 them from keeping them open and so they do not see him then he 
 creeps behind them and blows softly upon their necks till their 
 heads begin to droop but does not wish to hurt them 
 for he is very fond of children and only wants them to be quiet 
 that he may relate to them pretty stories and they never are quiet 
 until they are in bed and asleep as soon as they are asleep 
 seats himself upon the bed he is nicely dressed his coat is made of silken stuff it is impossible to say of what color for it changes from green to red and from red to blue as he turns from 
 side to side under each arm he carries an umbrella one of them with 
 pictures on the inside he spreads over the good children and then 
 they dream the most beautiful stories the whole night but the other 
 umbrella has no pictures and this he holds over the naughty 
 children so that they sleep heavily and wake in the morning without 
 having dreamed at all 
 
 now we shall hear how came every night during a 
 whole week to the little boy named hjalmar and what he told him 
 there were seven stories as there are seven days in the week 
 
 monday 
 now pay attention said in the evening when 
 hjalmar was in bed and i will decorate the room 
 
 immediately all the flowers in the became large trees 
 with long branches reaching to the ceiling and stretching along the 
 walls so that the whole room was like a greenhouse all the 
 branches were loaded with flowers each flower as beautiful and as 
 fragrant as a rose and had any one tasted them he would have 
 found them sweeter even than jam the fruit glittered like gold and 
 there were cakes so full of plums that they were nearly bursting it 
 was incomparably beautiful at the same time sounded dismal moans from the in which lay school books 
 
 what can that be now said going to the table and 
 pulling out the drawer 
 
 it was a slate in such distress because of a false number in 
 the sum that it had almost broken itself to pieces the pencil pulled 
 and tugged at its string as if it were a little dog that wanted to 
 help but could not 
 
 and then came a moan from oh it was quite 
 terrible to hear on each leaf stood a row of capital letters every 
 one having a small letter by its side this formed a copy under these 
 were other letters which hjalmar had written they fancied they 
 looked like the copy but they were mistaken for they were leaning on 
 one side as if they intended to fall over the 
 
 see this is the way you should hold yourselves said the 
 copy look here you should slope thus with a graceful curve 
 
 oh we are very willing to do so but we cannot said 
 letters we are so wretchedly made 
 
 you must be scratched out then said 
 
 oh no they cried and then they stood up so gracefully it 
 was quite a pleasure to look at them 
 
 now we must give up our stories and exercise these letters 
 said one two one two so he drilled them till 
 they stood up gracefully and looked as beautiful as a copy could 
 look but after was gone and hjalmar looked at them in 
 the morning they were as wretched and as awkward as ever 
 
 tuesday 
 as soon as hjalmar was in bed touched with his 
 little magic wand all the furniture in the room which immediately 
 began to chatter and each article only talked of itself 
 
 over the chest of drawers hung a large picture in a gilt frame 
 representing a landscape with fine old trees flowers in the grass 
 and a broad stream which flowed through the wood past several 
 castles far out into the wild ocean touched the 
 picture with his magic wand and immediately the birds commenced 
 singing the branches of the trees rustled and the clouds moved 
 across the sky casting their shadows on the landscape beneath them 
 
 then lifted little hjalmar up to the frame and placed his 
 feet in the picture just on the high grass and there he stood with 
 the sun shining down upon him through the branches of the trees he 
 ran to the water and seated himself in a little boat which lay there 
 and which was painted red and white the sails glittered like 
 silver and six swans each with a golden circlet round its neck 
 and a bright blue star on its forehead drew the boat past the green 
 wood where the trees talked of robbers and witches and the flowers 
 of beautiful little elves and fairies whose histories the butterflies 
 had related to them brilliant fish with scales like silver and gold 
 swam after the boat sometimes making a spring and splashing the water round them while birds red and blue small and great flew after him in two long lines the gnats danced round them and the cockchafers cried buz buz they all wanted to follow hjalmar and all had some story to tell him it was a most pleasant sail sometimes the forests were thick and dark sometimes like a beautiful garden gay 
 with sunshine and flowers then he passed great palaces of glass and 
 of marble and on the balconies stood princesses whose faces were 
 those of little girls whom hjalmar knew well and had often played 
 with one of them held out her hand in which was a heart made of 
 sugar more beautiful than any confectioner ever sold as hjalmar 
 sailed by he caught hold of one side of the sugar heart and held 
 it fast and the princess held fast also so that it broke in two 
 pieces hjalmar had one piece and the princess the other but 
 was the largest at each castle stood little princes 
 acting as sentinels they presented arms and had golden swords and 
 made it rain plums and tin soldiers so that they must have been 
 real princes 
 
 hjalmar continued to sail sometimes through woods sometimes as 
 it were through large halls and then by large cities at last he came 
 to the town where his nurse lived who had carried him in her arms 
 when he was a very little boy and had always been kind to him she 
 nodded and beckoned to him and then sang the little verses she had 
 herself composed and set to him 
 how oft my memory turns to thee 
 my own hjalmar ever dear 
 when i could watch thy infant glee 
 or kiss away a pearly tear 
 twas in my arms thy lisping tongue 
 first spoke the word 
 while thy tottering steps i hung 
 my fond protection to afford 
 farewell i pray the heavenly power 
 to keep thee till thy dying hour 
 and all the birds sang the same tune the flowers danced on their 
 stems and the old trees nodded as if had been telling 
 them stories as well 
 
 wednesday 
 how the rain did pour down hjalmar could hear it in his sleep 
 and when opened the window the water flowed quite up to the it had the appearance of a large lake outside and 
 a beautiful ship lay close to the house 
 
 wilt thou sail with me little hjalmar said 
 then we shall see foreign countries and thou shalt 
 return here in the morning 
 
 all in a moment there stood hjalmar in his best clothes on 
 the deck of the noble ship and immediately the weather became fine 
 they sailed through the streets round by the church and on every 
 side rolled the wide great sea they sailed till the land disappeared and then they saw a flock of storks who had left their own country and were travelling to warmer climates the storks flew one behind the other and had already been a long long time on the wing one of them seemed so tired that his wings could scarcely carry him he was the last of the row and was soon left very far behind at length he sunk lower and lower with outstretched wings flapping them in vain till his feet touched the rigging of the ship and he slided from the sails to the deck and stood before them 
 
 then a caught him and put him in the with the 
 fowls the ducks and the turkeys while the poor stork stood quite 
 bewildered amongst them 
 
 just look at that fellow said the chickens 
 
 then the puffed himself out as large as he could 
 and inquired who he was and the ducks waddled backwards crying 
 
 quack quack 
 
 then the stork told them all about warm africa of the pyramids 
 and of the ostrich which like a wild horse runs across the 
 desert but the ducks did not understand what he said and quacked 
 amongst themselves we are all of the same opinion namely that he 
 is stupid 
 
 yes to be sure he is stupid said the and gobbled 
 
 then the stork remained quite silent and thought of his home in 
 africa 
 
 those are handsome thin legs of yours said the 
 
 what do they cost a yard 
 
 quack quack quack grinned the ducks but the stork pretended 
 not to hear 
 
 you may as well laugh said the turkey for that remark was 
 rather witty or perhaps it was above you ah ah is he not clever 
 he will be a great amusement to us while he remains here and then he gobbled and the ducks quacked gobble gobble quack quack 
 
 what a terrible uproar they made while they were having such 
 fun among themselves 
 
 then hjalmar went to the and opening the door 
 called to the stork then he hopped out on the deck he had rested 
 himself now and he looked happy and seemed as if he nodded to 
 hjalmar as if to thank him then he spread his wings and flew away 
 to warmer countries while the hens clucked the ducks quacked and 
 the turned quite scarlet in the head 
 
 you shall be made into soup said hjalmar to the 
 fowls and then he awoke and found himself lying in his little bed 
 it was a wonderful journey which had made him take 
 this night 
 
 thursday 
 what do you think i have got here said do not 
 be frightened and you shall see a little mouse and then he held out 
 his hand to him in which lay a lovely little creature it has come 
 to invite you to a wedding two little mice are going to enter into 
 the marriage state tonight they reside under the floor of your 
 and that must be a fine 
 
 but how can i get through the little in the floor 
 asked hjalmar 
 
 leave me to manage that said i will soon make you 
 small enough and then he touched hjalmar with his magic wand 
 whereupon he became less and less until at last he was not longer 
 than a little finger now you can borrow the dress of the tin 
 soldier i think it will just fit you it looks well to wear a uniform 
 when you go into company 
 
 yes certainly said hjalmar and in a moment he was dressed 
 as neatly as the neatest of all tin soldiers 
 
 will you be so good as to seat yourself in your thimble 
 said the little mouse that i may have the pleasure of drawing you to 
 the wedding 
 
 will you really take so much trouble young lady said 
 hjalmar and so in this way he rode to the wedding 
 first they went under the floor and then passed through a long 
 passage which was scarcely high enough to allow the thimble to 
 drive under and the whole passage was lit up with the 
 phosphorescent light of rotten wood 
 
 does it not smell delicious asked the mouse as she drew him 
 along the wall and the floor have been smeared with 
 nothing can be nicer 
 
 very soon they arrived at the bridal hall on the right stood 
 all the little whispering and giggling as if they were 
 making game of each other to the left were the 
 stroking their whiskers with their and in the centre of the 
 hall could be seen the bridal pair standing side by side in a hollow 
 and kissing each other while all eyes were upon them 
 for they had already been betrothed and were soon to be married more and more friends kept arriving till the mice were nearly treading 
 each other to death for the bridal pair now stood in the doorway and 
 none could pass in or out 
 
 the room had been rubbed over with like the passage 
 which was all the refreshment offered to the guests but for dessert 
 they produced a pea on which a mouse belonging to the bridal pair had bitten the first letters of their names this was something quite 
 uncommon all the mice said it was a very beautiful wedding and 
 that they had been very agreeably entertained 
 
 after this hjalmar returned home he had certainly been in 
 grand society but he had been obliged to creep under a room and to 
 make himself small enough to wear the uniform of a tin soldier 
 
 friday 
 it is incredible how many old people there are who would be 
 glad to have me at night said especially those who 
 have done something wrong good little ole say they to me we 
 cannot close our eyes and we lie awake the whole night and see all 
 our evil deeds sitting on our beds like little imps and sprinkling us 
 with hot water will you come and drive them away that we may have 
 a good rest and then they sigh so deeply and say we 
 would gladly pay you for it the money lies on 
 the window but i never do anything for gold what shall we do 
 asked hjalmar i do not know whether you would care to 
 go to another wedding he replied although it is quite a different affair to the one we saw last night your large doll that is dressed like a man and is called herman intends to marry the doll bertha it is also the dolls birthday and they will receive many presents 
 
 yes i know that already said hjalmar my sister always allows 
 her dolls to keep their birthdays or to have a wedding when they 
 require new clothes that has happened already a hundred times i am 
 quite sure 
 
 yes so it may but is the hundred and first wedding 
 and when that has taken place it must be the last therefore this is 
 to be extremely beautiful only look 
 
 hjalmar looked at the table and there stood the little 
 house with lights in all the windows and drawn up before it 
 were the tin soldiers presenting arms the bridal pair were seated 
 on the floor leaning against the leg of the table looking very 
 thoughtful and with good reason then dressed up in 
 black gown married them 
 
 as soon as the ceremony was concluded all the furniture in the 
 room joined in singing a beautiful song which had been composed by the lead pencil and which went to the melody of a military tattoo 
 what merry sounds are on the wind 
 as marriage rites together bind 
 a quiet and a loving pair 
 though formed of kid yet smooth and fair 
 hurrah if they are deaf and blind 
 sing though weather prove unkind 
 and now came the present but the bridal pair had nothing to 
 eat for love was to be their food 
 
 shall we go to a country house or travel asked the bridegroom 
 then they consulted the swallow who had travelled so far and 
 the old hen in the yard who had brought up five broods of chickens 
 and the swallow talked to them of warm countries where the grapes 
 hang in large clusters on the vines and the air is soft and mild and 
 about the mountains glowing with colors more beautiful than we can 
 think of 
 
 but they have no red cabbage like we have said the hen i 
 was once in the country with my chickens for a whole summer there was a large in which we could walk about and scratch as we 
 liked then we got into a garden in which grew red cabbage oh how 
 nice it was i cannot think of anything more delicious 
 
 but one cabbage stalk is exactly like another said the swallow 
 
 and here we have often bad weather 
 
 yes but we are accustomed to it said the hen 
 
 but it is so cold here and freezes sometimes 
 
 cold weather is good for cabbages said the hen besides we 
 do have it warm here sometimes four years ago we had a summer that lasted more than five weeks and it was so hot one could scarcely 
 breathe and then in this country we have no poisonous animals and we are free from robbers he must be wicked who does not consider our country the finest of all lands he ought not to be allowed to live 
 here and then the hen wept very much and said i have also 
 travelled i once went twelve miles in a coop and it was not pleasant 
 travelling at all 
 
 the hen is a sensible woman said the doll bertha i care 
 for travelling over mountains just to go up and come down again 
 no let us go to the in front of the gate and then take a 
 walk in the cabbage garden 
 
 and so they settled it 
 
 saturday 
 saturday 
 am i to hear any more stories asked little hjalmar as soon 
 as had sent him to sleep 
 
 we shall have no time this evening said he spreading out his 
 prettiest umbrella over the child look at these chinese and then 
 the whole umbrella appeared like a large china bowl with blue trees 
 and pointed bridges upon which stood little chinamen nodding their 
 heads we must make all the world beautiful for for it will be a holiday it is sunday i must now go to the church steeple and see if the little sprites who live 
 there have polished the bells so that they may sound sweetly then 
 i must go into the fields and see if the wind has blown the dust 
 from the grass and the leaves and the most difficult task of all 
 which i have to do is to take down all the stars and brighten them 
 up i have to number them first before i put them in my apron and 
 also to number the places from which i take them so that they may 
 go back into the right holes or else they would not remain and we 
 should have a number of falling stars for they would all tumble 
 down one after the other 
 
 hark ye mr said an old portrait which hung on the 
 wall of bedroom do you know me i am 
 i thank you for telling the boy stories but you 
 must not confuse his ideas the stars cannot be taken down from the 
 sky and polished they are spheres like our earth which is a good 
 thing for them 
 
 thank you old said i thank 
 you you may be the head of the family as no doubt you are but i 
 am older than you i am an ancient heathen the old romans and 
 greeks named me the i have visited the noblest houses 
 and continue to do so still i know how to conduct myself both to high and low and now you may tell the stories yourself and so 
 walked off taking his umbrellas with him 
 
 well well one is never to give an opinion i suppose grumbled 
 the portrait and it woke hjalmar 
 
 sunday 
 good evening said 
 
 hjalmar nodded and then sprang out of bed and turned his 
 portrait to the wall so that it might not 
 interrupt them as it had done yesterday now said he you must 
 tell me some stories about five green peas that lived in one pod or 
 of the chickseed that courted the chickweed or of the darning needle 
 who acted so proudly because she fancied herself an embroidery 
 needle 
 
 you may have too much of a good thing said you 
 know that i like best to show you something so i will show you my 
 brother he is also called but he never visits any one but 
 once and when he does come he takes him away on his horse and tells him stories as they ride along he knows only two stories one of these is so wonderfully beautiful that no one in the world can 
 imagine anything at all like it but the other is just as ugly and 
 frightful so that it would be impossible to describe it then 
 lifted hjalmar up to the window there now you can see my brother the other he is also called death you 
 perceive he is not so bad as they represent him in picture books 
 there he is a skeleton but now his coat is embroidered with silver 
 and he wears the splendid uniform of a hussar and a mantle of black 
 velvet flies behind him over the horse look how he gallops 
 along hjalmar saw that as this rode on he lifted up old 
 and young and carried them away on his horse some he seated in front of him and some behind but always inquired first how stands the 
 
 good they all answered 
 
 yes but let me see for myself he replied and they were 
 obliged to give him the books then all those who had very good 
 or exceedingly good came in front of the horse and heard the 
 beautiful story while those who had middling or tolerably 
 good in their books were obliged to sit behind and listen to the 
 frightful tale they trembled and cried and wanted to jump down 
 from the horse but they could not get free for they seemed 
 fastened to the seat 
 
 why death is a most splendid said hjalmar i am not 
 in the least afraid of him 
 
 you need have no fear of him said if you take 
 care and keep a good conduct book 
 
 now i call that very instructive murmured the portrait it is useful sometimes to express an opinion so he was quite satisfied 
 
 these are some of the doings and sayings of i hope he 
 may visit you himself this evening and relate some more

 book and desolations 
 chapter i 
 
 full light 
 the reader has probably understood that eponine having recognized through the gate the inhabitant of that rue plumet whither magnon had sent her had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the rue plumet and had then conducted marius thither and that after many days spent in ecstasy before that gate marius drawn on by that force which draws the iron to the magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is built the house of her whom he loves had finally entered garden as romeo entered the garden of juliet 
 this had even proved easier for him than for romeo romeo was obliged to scale a wall marius had only to use a little force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate which vacillated in its rusty recess after the fashion of old teeth marius was slender and readily passed through 
 as there was never any one in the street and as marius never entered the garden except at night he ran no risk of being seen 
 beginning with that blessed and holy hour when a kiss betrothed these two souls marius was there every evening 
 if at that period of her existence cosette had fallen in love with a man in the least unscrupulous or debauched she would have been lost for there are generous natures which yield themselves and cosette was one of them one of magnanimities is to yield 
 love at the height where it is absolute is complicated with some indescribably celestial blindness of modesty 
 but what dangers you run o noble souls often you give the heart and we take the body 
 your heart remains with you you gaze upon it in the gloom with a shudder 
 love has no middle course it either ruins or it saves 
 all human destiny lies in this dilemma 
 this dilemma ruin or safety is set forth no more inexorably by any fatality than by love 
 love is life if it is not death 
 cradle also coffin 
 the same sentiment says yes and no in the human heart 
 of all the things that god has made the human heart is the one which sheds the most light alas and the most darkness 
 god willed that love should encounter one of the loves which save 
 throughout the whole of the month of may of that year there were there in every night in that poor neglected garden beneath that thicket which grew thicker and more fragrant day by day two beings composed of all chastity all innocence overflowing with all the felicity of heaven nearer to the archangels than to mankind pure honest intoxicated radiant who shone for each other amid the shadows 
 it seemed to cosette that marius had a crown and to marius that cosette had a nimbus 
 they touched each other they gazed at each other they clasped each hands they pressed close to each other but there was a distance which they did not pass not that they respected it they did not know of its existence marius was conscious of a barrier innocence and cosette of a support marius loyalty 
 the first kiss had also been the last 
 marius since that time had not gone further than to touch hand or her kerchief or a lock of her hair with his lips for him cosette was a perfume and not a woman 
 he inhaled her she refused nothing and he asked nothing 
 cosette was happy and marius was satisfied 
 they lived in this ecstatic state which can be described as the dazzling of one soul by another soul it was the ineffable first embrace of two maiden souls in the ideal two swans meeting on the jungfrau 
 at that hour of love an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely mute beneath the omnipotence of ecstasy marius the pure and seraphic marius would rather have gone to a woman of the town than have raised robe to the height of her ankle 
 once in the moonlight cosette stooped to pick up something on the ground her bodice fell apart and permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat marius turned away his eyes 
 what took place between these two beings 
 nothing 
 they adored each other 
 at night when they were there that garden seemed a living and a sacred spot 
 all flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense and they opened their souls and scattered them over the flowers the wanton and vigorous vegetation quivered full of strength and intoxication around these two innocents and they uttered words of love which set the trees to trembling 
 what words were these 
 breaths 
 nothing more 
 these breaths sufficed to trouble and to touch all nature round about magic power which we should find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book these conversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smoke wreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves take from those murmurs of two lovers that melody which proceeds from the soul and which accompanies them like a lyre and what remains is nothing more than a shade you say 
 what is that all eh yes childish prattle repetitions laughter at nothing nonsense everything that is deepest and most sublime in the world the only things which are worth the trouble of saying and hearing 
 the man who has never heard the man who has never uttered these absurdities these paltry remarks is an imbecile and a malicious fellow 
 cosette said to marius 
 dost thou know 
 in all this and athwart this celestial maidenliness and without either of them being able to say how it had come about they had begun to call each other thou 
 dost thou know 
 my name is euphrasie 
 euphrasie 
 why no thy name is cosette 
 oh 
 cosette is a very ugly name that was given to me when i was a little thing 
 but my real name is euphrasie 
 dost thou like that 
 yes 
 but cosette is not ugly 
 do you like it better than euphrasie 
 why yes 
 then i like it better too 
 truly it is pretty cosette call me cosette 
 and the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy of a grove situated in heaven 
 on another occasion she gazed intently at him and exclaimed 
 monsieur you are handsome you are you are witty you are not at all stupid you are much more learned than i am but i bid you defiance with this word 
 i love you 
 and marius in the very heavens thought he heard a strain sung by a star 
 or she bestowed on him a gentle tap because he coughed and she said to him 
 cough sir i will not have people cough on my domain without my permission 
 very naughty to cough and to disturb me i want you to be well because in the first place if you were not well i should be very unhappy 
 what should i do then 
 and this was simply divine 
 once marius said to cosette 
 just imagine i thought at one time that your name was ursule 
 this made both of them laugh the whole evening 
 in the middle of another conversation he chanced to exclaim 
 oh 
 one day at the luxembourg i had a good mind to finish breaking up a veteran 
 but he stopped short and went no further he would have been obliged to speak to cosette of her garter and that was impossible 
 this bordered on a strange theme the flesh before which that immense and innocent love recoiled with a sort of sacred fright 
 marius pictured life with cosette to himself like this without anything else to come every evening to the rue plumet to displace the old and accommodating bar of the gate to sit elbow to elbow on that bench to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of the night to fit a fold of the knee of his trousers into the ample fall of gown to caress her to call her thou to smell of the same flower one after the other forever indefinitely 
 during this time clouds passed above their heads 
 every time that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men than of the clouds of heaven 
 this chaste almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry by any means 
 to pay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method of bestowing caresses and he is half audacious who tries it 
 a compliment is something like a kiss through a veil voluptuousness mingles there with its sweet tiny point while it hides itself 
 the heart draws back before voluptuousness only to love the more 
 marius blandishments all saturated with fancy were so to speak of azure hue 
 the birds when they fly up yonder in the direction of the angels must hear such words 
 there were mingled with them nevertheless life humanity all the positiveness of which marius was capable 
 it was what is said in the bower a prelude to what will be said in the chamber a lyrical effusion strophe and sonnet intermingled pleasing hyperboles of cooing all the refinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet and exhaling a celestial perfume an ineffable twitter of heart to heart 
 oh murmured marius how beautiful you are 
 i dare not look at you it is all over with me when i contemplate you 
 you are a grace i know not what is the matter with me 
 the hem of your gown when the tip of your shoe peeps from beneath upsets me 
 and then what an enchanted gleam when you open your thought even but a little you talk astonishingly good sense 
 it seems to me at times that you are a dream 
 speak i listen i admire 
 oh cosette how strange it is and how charming 
 i am really beside myself you are adorable mademoiselle 
 i study your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope 
 and cosette answered 
 i have been loving a little more all the time that has passed since this morning 
 questions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue which always turned with mutual consent upon love as the little pith figures always turn on their peg 
 whole person was ingenuousness ingenuity transparency whiteness candor radiance 
 it might have been said of cosette that she was clear 
 she produced on those who saw her the sensation of april and dawn 
 there was dew in her eyes cosette was a condensation of the auroral light in the form of a woman 
 it was quite simple that marius should admire her since he adored her but the truth is that this little fresh from the convent talked with exquisite penetration and uttered at times all sorts of true and delicate sayings 
 her prattle was conversation she never made a mistake about anything and she saw things justly the woman feels and speaks with the tender instinct of the heart which is infallible 
 no one understands so well as a woman how to say things that are at once both sweet and deep 
 sweetness and depth they are the whole of woman in them lies the whole of heaven 
 in this full felicity tears welled up to their eyes every instant a crushed a feather fallen from a nest a branch of hawthorn broken aroused their pity and their ecstasy sweetly mingled with melancholy seemed to ask nothing better than to weep the most sovereign symptom of love is a tenderness that is at times almost unbearable 
 and in addition to these contradictions are the lightning play of were fond of laughing they laughed readily and with a delicious freedom and so familiarly that they sometimes presented the air of two boys 
 still though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity nature is always present and will not be forgotten 
 she is there with her brutal and sublime object and however great may be the innocence of souls one feels in the most modest private interview the adorable and mysterious shade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends 
 they idolized each other 
 the permanent and the immutable are persistent 
 people live they smile they laugh they make little grimaces with the tips of their lips they interlace their fingers they call each other thou and that does not prevent eternity 
 two lovers hide themselves in the evening in the twilight in the invisible with the birds with the roses they fascinate each other in the darkness with their hearts which they throw into their eyes they murmur they whisper and in the meantime immense librations of the planets fill the infinite universe

 chapter xxxi 
 
 the valet returning to the cottage informed the count that moscow was burning the count donned his dressing gown and went out to look sonya and madame schoss who had not yet undressed went out with him only natasha and the countess remained in the room petya was no longer with the family he had gone on with his regiment which was making for troitsa 
 the countess on hearing that moscow was on fire began to cry natasha pale with a fixed look was sitting on the bench under the icons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her words she was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant three houses off 
 oh how terrible said sonya returning from the yard chilled and frightened i believe the whole of moscow will burn an awful glow natasha do look you can see it from the window she said to her cousin evidently wishing to distract her mind 
 but natasha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove she had been in this condition of stupor since the morning when sonya to the surprise and annoyance of the countess had for some unaccountable reason found it necessary to tell natasha of prince wound and of his being with their party the countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as she was with sonya sonya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now as if trying to atone for her fault paid unceasing attention to her cousin 
 look natasha how dreadfully it is burning said she 
 burning asked natasha oh yes moscow 
 and as if in order not to offend sonya and to get rid of her she turned her face to the window looked out in such a way that it was evident that she could not see anything and again settled down in her former attitude 
 but you see it 
 yes really i did natasha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left in peace 
 both the countess and sonya understood that naturally neither moscow nor the burning of moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to natasha 
 the count returned and lay down behind the partition the countess went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she was wont to do when natasha was ill then touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish and finally kissed her 
 you are cold you are trembling all over better lie down said the countess 
 lie down all right i will lie down at once said natasha 
 when natasha had been told that morning that prince andrew was seriously wounded and was traveling with their party she had at first asked many questions where was he going how was he wounded was it serious and could she see him but after she had been told that she could not see him that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all evidently disbelieving what they told her and convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same all the way she had sat motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes and the expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving she was planning something and either deciding or had already decided something in her mind the countess knew this but what it might be she did not know and this alarmed and tormented her 
 natasha undress darling lie down on my bed 
 a bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only madame schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor 
 no mamma i will lie down here on the floor natasha replied irritably and she went to the window and opened it through the open window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly she put her head out into the damp night air and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame natasha knew it was not prince andrew who was moaning she knew prince andrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob the countess exchanged a look with sonya 
 lie down darling lie down my pet said the countess softly touching shoulders come lie down 
 oh yes lie down at once said natasha and began hurriedly undressing tugging at the tapes of her petticoat 
 when she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the floor jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front and began replaiting it her long thin practiced fingers rapidly unplaited replaited and tied up her plait her head moved from side to side from habit but her eyes feverishly wide looked fixedly before her when her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door 
 natasha better lie in the middle said sonya 
 stay here muttered natasha do lie down she added crossly and buried her face in the pillow 
 the countess madame schoss and sonya undressed hastily and lay down the small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the room but in the yard there was a light from the fire at little mytishchi a mile and a half away and through the night came the noise of people shouting at a tavern cossacks had set up across the street and the unceasing moans could still be heard 
 for a long time natasha listened attentively to the sounds that reached her from inside and outside the room and did not move first she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her then madame schoss familiar whistling snore and gentle breathing then the countess called to natasha natasha did not answer 
 i think asleep mamma said sonya softly 
 after short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one replied 
 soon after that natasha heard her even breathing natasha did not move though her little bare foot thrust out from under the quilt was growing cold on the bare floor 
 as if to celebrate a victory over everybody a cricket chirped in a crack in the wall a cock crowed far off and another replied near by the shouting in the tavern had died down only the moaning of the adjutant was heard natasha sat up 
 sonya are you asleep mamma she whispered 
 no one replied natasha rose slowly and carefully crossed herself and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim supple bare feet the boards of the floor creaked stepping cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle 
 it seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room it was her own heart sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love 
 she opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold damp earthen floor of the passage the cold she felt refreshed her with her bare feet she touched a sleeping man stepped over him and opened the door into the part of the hut where prince andrew lay it was dark in there in the farthest corner on a bench beside a bed on which something was lying stood a tallow candle with a long thick and smoldering wick 
 from the moment she had been told that of prince wound and his presence there natasha had resolved to see him she did not know why she had to she knew the meeting would be painful but felt the more convinced that it was necessary 
 all day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night but now that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might see how was he maimed what was left of him was he like that incessant moaning of the yes he was altogether like that in her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified when she saw an indistinct shape in the corner and mistook his knees raised under the quilt for his shoulders she imagined a horrible body there and stood still in terror but an irresistible impulse drew her forward she cautiously took one step and then another and found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage another man timokhin was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons and two others the doctor and a valet lay on the floor 
 the valet sat up and whispered something timokhin kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg gazed with eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise dressing jacket and nightcap the sleepy frightened exclamation what do you want the matter made natasha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the corner horribly unlike a man as that body looked she must see him she passed the valet the snuff fell from the candle wick and she saw prince andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt and such as she had always seen him 
 he was the same as ever but the feverish color of his face his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her and especially his neck delicate as a revealed by the collar of his shirt gave him a peculiarly innocent childlike look such as she had never seen on him before she went up to him and with a swift flexible youthful movement dropped on her knees 
 he smiled and held out his hand to her

 book and desolations 
 chapter ii 
 
 the bewilderment of perfect happiness 
 they existed vaguely frightened at their happiness 
 they did not notice the cholera which decimated paris precisely during that very month they had confided in each other as far as possible but this had not extended much further than their names 
 marius had told cosette that he was an orphan that his name was marius pontmercy that he was a lawyer that he lived by writing things for publishers that his father had been a colonel that the latter had been a hero and that he marius was on bad terms with his grandfather who was rich 
 he had also hinted at being a baron but this had produced no effect on cosette 
 she did not know the meaning of the word marius was marius 
 on her side she had confided to him that she had been brought up at the convent that her mother like his own was dead that her name was m fauchelevent that he was very good that he gave a great deal to the poor but that he was poor himself and that he denied himself everything though he denied her nothing 
 strange to say in the sort of symphony which marius had lived since he had been in the habit of seeing cosette the past even the most recent past had become so confused and distant to him that what cosette told him satisfied him completely it did not even occur to him to tell her about the nocturnal adventure in the hovel about thenardier about the burn and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father marius had momentarily forgotten all this in the evening he did not even know that there had been a morning what he had done where he had breakfasted nor who had spoken to him he had songs in his ears which rendered him deaf to every other thought he only existed at the hours when he saw cosette 
 then as he was in heaven it was quite natural that he should forget earth both bore languidly the indefinable burden of immaterial pleasures thus lived these somnambulists who are called lovers 
 alas 
 who is there who has not felt all these things 
 why does there come an hour when one emerges from this azure and why does life go on afterwards 
 loving almost takes the place of thinking 
 love is an ardent forgetfulness of all the rest 
 then ask logic of passion if you will there is no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than there is a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism for cosette and marius nothing existed except marius and cosette the universe around them had fallen into a hole 
 they lived in a golden minute 
 there was nothing before them nothing behind it hardly occurred to marius that cosette had a father 
 his brain was dazzled and obliterated 
 of what did these lovers talk then we have seen of the flowers and the swallows the setting sun and the rising moon and all sorts of important things 
 they had told each other everything except everything 
 the everything of lovers is nothing 
 but the father the realities that lair the ruffians that adventure to what purpose 
 and was he very sure that this nightmare had actually existed 
 they were two and they adored each other and beyond that there was nothing 
 nothing else existed it is probable that this vanishing of hell in our rear is inherent to the arrival of paradise 
 have we beheld demons 
 are there any have we trembled 
 have we suffered 
 we no longer know 
 a rosy cloud hangs over it 
 so these two beings lived in this manner high aloft with all that improbability which is in nature neither at the nadir nor at the zenith between man and seraphim above the mire below the ether in the clouds hardly flesh and blood soul and ecstasy from head to foot already too sublime to walk the earth still too heavily charged with humanity to disappear in the blue suspended like atoms which are waiting to be precipitated apparently beyond the bounds of destiny ignorant of that rut yesterday amazed rapturous floating soaring at times so light that they could take their flight out into the infinite almost prepared to soar away to all eternity 
 they slept thus sweetly lulled oh splendid lethargy of the real overwhelmed by the ideal 
 sometimes beautiful as cosette was marius shut his eyes in her presence 
 the best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes 
 marius and cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead them they considered that they had already arrived 
 it is a strange claim on part to wish that love should lead to something

 seven days had passed since prince andrew found himself in the ambulance station on the field of borodino his feverish state and the inflammation of his bowels which were injured were in the opinion sure to carry him off but on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some tea and the doctor noticed that his temperature was lower he had regained consciousness that morning the first night after they left moscow had been fairly warm and he had remained in the caleche but at mytishchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given some tea the pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness when he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes then he opened them and whispered softly and the tea his remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the doctor he felt prince pulse and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved he was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die now he would do so a little later with greater suffering timokhin the major of prince regiment had joined him in moscow and was being taken along with him having been wounded in the leg at the battle of borodino they were accompanied by a doctor prince valet his coach man and two orderlies 
 they gave prince andrew some tea he drank it eagerly looking with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and remember something 
 i want any more is timokhin here he asked 
 timokhin crept along the bench to him 
 i am here your excellency 
 your wound 
 mine sir all right but how about you 
 prince andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something 
 one get a book he asked 
 what book 
 the gospels i one 
 the doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was feeling prince andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but reasonably and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain the doctor and valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and making wry faces at the noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound began examining that dreadful place the doctor was very much displeased about something and made a change in the dressings turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony he kept asking them to get him the book and put it under him 
 what trouble would it be to you he said i have not got one please get it for me and put it under for a moment he pleaded in a piteous voice 
 the doctor went into the passage to wash his hands 
 you fellows have no conscience said he to the valet who was pouring water over his hands for just one moment i look after you such pain you know that i wonder how he can bear it 
 by the lord jesus christ i thought we had put something under him said the valet 
 the first time prince andrew understood where he was and what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked to be carried into the hut after his caleche had stopped at mytishchi after growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he again regained consciousness and while drinking tea once more recalled all that had happened to him and above all vividly remembered the moment at the ambulance station when at the sight of the sufferings of a man he disliked those new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness and those thoughts though now vague and indefinite again possessed his soul he remembered that he had now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the gospels that was why he asked for a copy of them the uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night everybody near him was sleeping a cricket chirped from across the passage someone was shouting and singing in the street cockroaches rustled on the table on the icons and on the walls and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the candle beside him the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom 
 his mind was not in a normal state a healthy man usually thinks of feels and remembers innumerable things simultaneously but has the power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his whole attention a healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts but prince mind was not in a normal state in that respect all the powers of his mind were more active and clearer than ever but they acted apart from his will most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously at times his brain suddenly began to work with a vigor clearness and depth it had never reached when he was in health but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again 
 yes a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be deprived he thought as he lay in the of the quiet hut gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes a happiness lying beyond material forces outside the material influences that act on man a happiness of the soul alone the happiness of loving every man can understand it but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for god but how did god enjoin that law and why was the son 
 and suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off and prince andrew heard without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating and then titi and then again and once more at the same time he felt that above his face above the very middle of it some strange airy structure was being erected out of slender needles or splinters to the sound of this whispered music he felt that he had to balance carefully though it was difficult so that this airy structure should not collapse but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic music it stretches stretches spreading out and stretching said prince andrew to himself while listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure though it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising but besides this there was something else of importance it was something white by the door the statue of a sphinx which also oppressed him 
 but perhaps my shirt on the table he thought and my legs and that is the door but why is it always stretching and drawing itself out and and and enough please leave off prince andrew painfully entreated someone and suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and force 
 yes love he thought again quite clearly but not love which loves for something for some quality for some purpose or for some reason but the love which i while dying first experienced when i saw my enemy and yet loved him i experienced that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object now again i feel that bliss to love neighbors to love enemies to love everything to love god in all his manifestations it is possible to love someone dear to you with human love but an enemy can only be loved by divine love that is why i experienced such joy when i felt that i loved that man what has become of him is he alive 
 when loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred but divine love cannot change no neither death nor anything else can destroy it it is the very essence of the soul yet how many people have i hated in my life and of them all i loved and hated none as i did her and he vividly pictured to himself natasha not as he had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight but for the first time picturing to himself her soul and he understood her feelings her sufferings shame and remorse he now understood for the first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her the cruelty of his rupture with her if only it were possible for me to see her once more just once looking into those eyes to say 
 and and boom flopped the fly and his attention was suddenly carried into another world a world of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening in that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall something was still stretching out and the candle with its red halo was still burning and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door but besides all this something creaked there was a whiff of fresh air and a new white sphinx appeared standing at the door and that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very natasha of whom he had just been thinking 
 oh how oppressive this continual delirium is thought prince andrew trying to drive that face from his imagination but the face remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer prince andrew wished to return that former world of pure thought but he could not and delirium drew him back into its domain the soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur something oppressed him and stretched out and the strange face was before him prince andrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his senses he moved a little and suddenly there was a ringing in his ears a dimness in his eyes and like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness when he came to himself natasha that same living natasha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to him was kneeling before him he realized that it was the real living natasha and he was not surprised but quietly happy natasha motionless on her knees she was unable to stir with frightened eyes riveted on him was restraining her sobs her face was pale and rigid only in the lower part of it something quivered 
 prince andrew sighed with relief smiled and held out his hand 
 you he said how fortunate 
 with a rapid but careful movement natasha drew nearer to him on her knees and taking his hand carefully bent her face over it and began kissing it just touching it lightly with her lips 
 forgive me she whispered raising her head and glancing at him forgive me 
 i love you said prince andrew 
 forgive 
 forgive what he asked 
 forgive me for what i faltered natasha in a scarcely audible broken whisper and began kissing his hand more rapidly just touching it with her lips 
 i love you more better than before said prince andrew lifting her face with his hand so as to look into her eyes 
 those eyes filled with happy tears gazed at him timidly compassionately and with joyous love thin pale face with its swollen lips was more than plain it was dreadful but prince andrew did not see that he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful they heard the sound of voices behind them 
 peter the valet who was now wide awake had roused the doctor timokhin who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg had long been watching all that was going on carefully covering his bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench 
 this said the doctor rising from his bed please go away madam 
 at that moment a maid sent by the countess who had noticed her absence knocked at the door 
 like a somnambulist aroused from her sleep natasha went out of the room and returning to her hut fell sobbing on her bed 
 from that time during all the rest of the rostovs journey at every halting place and wherever they spent a night natasha never left the wounded bolkonski and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded man 
 dreadful as the countess imagined it would be should prince andrew die in her arms during the journey as judging by what the doctor said it seemed might easily happen she could not oppose natasha though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and natasha the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed no one least of all natasha and prince andrew spoke of this the unsettled question of life and death which hung not only over bolkonski but over all russia shut out all other considerations

 chapter iii 
 
 the beginning of shadow 
 jean valjean suspected nothing 
 cosette who was rather less dreamy than marius was gay and that sufficed for jean happiness 
 the thoughts which cosette cherished her tender preoccupations marius image which filled her heart took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful chaste and smiling brow 
 she was at the age when the virgin bears her love as the angel his lily 
 so jean valjean was at ease 
 and then when two lovers have come to an understanding things always go well the third party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect blindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the same in the case of all lovers thus cosette never objected to any of jean proposals did she want to take a walk 
 yes dear little father 
 did she want to stay at home 
 very good 
 did he wish to pass the evening with cosette 
 she was delighted 
 as he always went to bed at ten marius did not come to the garden on such occasions until after that hour when from the street he heard cosette open the long glass door on the veranda 
 of course no one ever met marius in the daytime 
 jean valjean never even dreamed any longer that marius was in existence 
 only once one morning he chanced to say to cosette 
 why you have whitewash on your back 
 on the previous evening marius in a transport had pushed cosette against the wall 
 old toussaint who retired early thought of nothing but her sleep and was as ignorant of the whole matter as jean valjean 
 marius never set foot in the house 
 when he was with cosette 
 they hid themselves in a recess near the steps in order that they might neither be seen nor heard from the street and there they sat frequently contenting themselves by way of conversation with pressing each hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of the trees 
 at such times a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces from them and they would not have noticed it so deeply was the revery of the one absorbed and sunk in the revery of the other 
 limpid purity 
 hours wholly white almost all alike 
 this sort of love is a recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove 
 the whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street every time that marius entered and left he carefully adjusted the bar of the gate in such a manner that no displacement was visible 
 he usually went away about midnight and returned to lodgings 
 courfeyrac said to bahorel 
 would you believe it 
 marius comes home nowadays at one in the morning 
 bahorel replied 
 what do you expect 
 always a petard in a seminary fellow 
 at times courfeyrac folded his arms assumed a serious air and said to marius 
 you are getting irregular in your habits young man 
 courfeyrac being a practical man did not take in good part this reflection of an invisible paradise upon marius he was not much in the habit of concealed passions it made him impatient and now and then he called upon marius to come back to reality 
 one morning he threw him this admonition 
 my dear fellow you produce upon me the effect of being located in the moon the realm of dreams the province of illusions capital come be a good boy her name 
 but nothing could induce marius to talk 
 they might have torn out his nails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable name cosette was composed 
 true love is as luminous as the dawn and as silent as the tomb 
 only courfeyrac saw this change in marius that his taciturnity was of the beaming order 
 during this sweet month of may marius and cosette learned to know these immense delights 
 to dispute and to say you for thou simply that they might say thou the better afterwards 
 to talk at great length with very minute details of persons in whom they took not the slightest interest in the world another proof that in that ravishing opera called love the libretto counts for almost nothing 
 for marius to listen to cosette discussing finery 
 for cosette to listen to marius talk in politics 
 to listen knee pressed to knee to the carriages rolling along the rue de babylone 
 to gaze upon the same planet in space or at the same glowworm gleaming in the grass 
 to hold their peace together a still greater delight than conversation 
 etc etc 
 in the meantime divers complications were approaching 
 one evening marius was on his way to the rendezvous by way of the boulevard des invalides 
 he habitually walked with drooping head as he was on the point of turning the corner of the rue plumet he heard some one quite close to him say 
 good evening monsieur marius 
 he raised his head and recognized eponine 
 this produced a singular effect upon him 
 he had not thought of that girl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the rue plumet he had not seen her again and she had gone completely out of his mind 
 he had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her he owed her his happiness and yet it was embarrassing to him to meet her 
 it is an error to think that passion when it is pure and happy leads man to a state of perfection it simply leads him as we have noted to a state of oblivion 
 in this situation man forgets to be bad but he also forgets to be good 
 gratitude duty matters essential and important to be remembered vanish 
 at any other time marius would have behaved quite differently to eponine absorbed in cosette he had not even clearly put it to himself that this eponine was named eponine thenardier and that she bore the name inscribed in his will that name for which but a few months before he would have so ardently sacrificed himself we show marius as he was 
 his father himself was fading out of his soul to some extent under the splendor of his love 
 he replied with some embarrassment 
 ah so you eponine 
 why do you call me you 
 have i done anything to you 
 no he answered 
 certainly he had nothing against her 
 far from it 
 only he felt that he could not do otherwise now that he used thou to cosette than say you to eponine 
 as he remained silent she exclaimed 
 say 
 then she paused 
 it seemed as though words failed that creature formerly so heedless and so bold 
 she tried to smile and could not then she resumed 
 well 
 then she paused again and remained with downcast eyes 
 good evening mr marius said she suddenly and abruptly and away she went

 chapter xxxiii 
 
 on the third of september pierre awoke late his head was aching the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his body and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before that something shameful was his conversation with captain ramballe 
 it was eleven by the clock but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors pierre rose rubbed his eyes and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock which gerasim had replaced on the writing table he remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day 
 am i not too late he thought no probably he make his entry into moscow before noon 
 pierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him but hastened to act 
 after arranging his clothes he took the pistol and was about to go out but it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets it was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat he could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm besides it had been discharged and he had not had time to reload it no matter dagger will do he said to himself though when planning his design he had more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in had been to try to kill napoleon with a dagger but as his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design but in proving to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could to achieve it pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought at the sukharev market with the pistol and hid it under his waistcoat 
 having tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head pierre went down the corridor trying to avoid making a noise or meeting the captain and passed out into the street 
 the conflagration at which he had looked with so much indifference the evening before had greatly increased during the night moscow was on fire in several places the buildings in carriage row across the river in the bazaar and the povarskoy as well as the barges on the moskva river and the timber yards by the dorogomilov bridge were all ablaze 
 way led through side streets to the povarskoy and from there to the church of st nicholas on the arbat where he had long before decided that the deed should should be done the gates of most of the houses were locked and the shutters up the streets and lanes were deserted the air was full of smoke and the smell of burning now and then he met russians with anxious and timid faces and frenchmen with an air not of the city but of the camp walking in the middle of the streets both the russians and the french looked at pierre with surprise besides his height and stoutness and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure the russians stared at pierre because they could not make out to what class he could belong the french followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because pierre unlike all the other russians who gazed at the french with fear and curiosity paid no attention to them at the gate of one house three frenchmen who were explaining something to some russians who did not understand them stopped pierre asking if he did not know french 
 pierre shook his head and went on in another side street a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at him but only when the shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the musket as he raised it did pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the street he heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him he carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste like something dreadful and alien to him for after the previous experience he was afraid of losing it but he was not destined to bring his mood safely to his destination and even had he not been hindered by anything on the way his intention could not now have been carried out for napoleon had passed the arbat more than four hours previously on his way from the dorogomilov suburb to the kremlin and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the kremlin giving detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire to prevent looting and to reassure the inhabitants but pierre did not know this he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him and was tortured as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures by the fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his 
 though he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the povarskoy 
 as pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser he even felt the heat of the fire occasionally curly tongues of flame rose from under the roofs of the houses he met more people in the streets and they were more excited but pierre though he felt that something unusual was happening around him did not realize that he was approaching the fire as he was going along a foot path across a space adjoining the povarskoy on one side and the gardens of prince house on the other pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman close to him he stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted his head 
 by the side of the path on the dusty dry grass all sorts of household goods lay in a heap featherbeds a samovar icons and trunks on the ground beside the trunks sat a thin woman no longer young with long prominent upper teeth and wearing a black cloak and cap this woman swaying to and fro and muttering something was choking with sobs two girls of about ten and twelve dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale frightened faces the youngest child a boy of about seven who wore an overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own was crying in his old arms a dirty barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk and having undone her plait was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair the husband a short man in the undress uniform of a civilian official with whiskers and showing under his cap the hair smoothly brushed forward over his temples with expressionless face was moving the trunks which were placed one on another and was dragging some garments from under them 
 as soon as she saw pierre the woman almost threw herself at his feet 
 dear people good christians save me help me dear friends help us somebody she muttered between her sobs my girl my daughter my youngest daughter is left behind burned ooh was it for this i nursed you ooh 
 mary nikolievna said her husband to her in a low voice evidently only to justify himself before the stranger sister must have taken her or else where can she be he added 
 monster villain shouted the woman angrily suddenly ceasing to weep you have no heart you feel for your own child another man would have rescued her from the fire but this is a monster and neither a man nor a father you honored sir are a noble man she went on addressing pierre rapidly between her sobs the fire broke out alongside and blew our way the maid called out fire and we rushed to collect our things we ran out just as we were this is what we have brought away the icons and my dowry bed all the rest is lost we seized the children but not katie ooh o lord and again she began to sob my child my dear one burned burned 
 but where was she left asked pierre 
 from the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man might help her 
 oh dear sir she cried seizing him by the legs my benefactor set my heart at ease aniska go you horrid girl show him the way she cried to the maid angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing her long teeth 
 show me the way show me i do it gasped pierre rapidly 
 the dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk put up her plait sighed and went on her short bare feet along the path pierre felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon he held his head higher his eyes shone with the light of life and with swift steps he followed the maid overtook her and came out on the povarskoy the whole street was full of clouds of black smoke tongues of flame here and there broke through that cloud a great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration in the middle of the street stood a french general saying something to those around him pierre accompanied by the maid was advancing to the spot where the general stood but the french soldiers stopped him 
 on ne passe pas cried a voice 
 you pass 
 this way uncle cried the girl pass through the side street by the nikulins 
 pierre turned back giving a spring now and then to keep up with her she ran across the street turned down a side street to the left and passing three houses turned into a yard on the right 
 here close by said she and running across the yard opened a gate in a wooden fence and stopping pointed out to him a small wooden wing of the house which was burning brightly and fiercely one of its sides had fallen in another was on fire and bright flames issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof 
 as pierre passed through the fence gate he was enveloped by hot air and involuntarily stopped 
 which is it which is your house he asked 
 ooh wailed the girl pointing to the wing it that was our lodging burned to death our treasure katie my precious little missy ooh lamented aniska who at the sight of the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings 
 pierre rushed to the wing but the heat was so great that he involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet burning only at one end just below the roof and around which swarmed a crowd of frenchmen at first pierre did not realize what these men who were dragging something out were about but seeing before him a frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a coat he vaguely understood that looting was going on there but he had no time to dwell on that idea 
 the sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings the whistle and hiss of the flames the excited shouts of the people and the sight of the swaying smoke now gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks with here and there dense sheaves of flame now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion produced on pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration it had a peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down he felt young bright adroit and resolute he ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still standing when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him 
 pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest filled with metal articles other french soldiers standing below went up to the drawer 
 what does this fellow want shouted one of them referring to pierre 
 a child in that house you seen a child cried pierre 
 he talking about get along said several voices and one of the soldiers evidently afraid that pierre might want to take from them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer moved threateningly toward him 
 a child shouted a frenchman from above i did hear something squealing in the garden perhaps his brat that the fellow is looking for after all one must be human you know 
 where is it where said pierre 
 there there shouted the frenchman at the window pointing to the garden at the back of the house wait a bit coming down 
 and a minute or two later the frenchman a fellow with a spot on his cheek in shirt sleeves really did jump out of a window on the ground floor and clapping pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the garden 
 hurry up you others he called out to his comrades getting hot 
 when they reached a gravel path behind the house the frenchman pulled pierre by the arm and pointed to a round graveled space where a girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat 
 there is your child oh a girl so much the better said the frenchman fatty we must be human we are all mortal you know and the frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades 
 breathless with joy pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take her in his arms but seeing a stranger the sickly child unattractively like her mother began to yell and run away pierre however seized her and lifted her in his arms she screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little animal but he made an effort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large house it was now however impossible to get back the way he had come the maid aniska was no longer there and pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out

 chapter iv 
 
 a cab runs in english and barks in slang 
 the following day was the d of june a date which it is necessary to indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on the horizon of paris in the state of clouds 
 marius at nightfall was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening with the same thoughts of delight in his heart when he caught sight of eponine approaching through the trees of the boulevard 
 two days in succession this was too much 
 he turned hastily aside quitted the boulevard changed his course and went to the rue plumet through the rue monsieur 
 this caused eponine to follow him to the rue plumet a thing which she had not yet done 
 up to that time she had contented herself with watching him on his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to encounter him 
 it was only on the evening before that she had attempted to address him 
 so eponine followed him without his suspecting the fact she saw him displace the bar and slip into the garden 
 she approached the railing felt of the bars one after the other and readily recognized the one which marius had moved 
 she murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents 
 none of that lisette 
 she seated herself on the underpinning of the railing close beside the bar as though she were guarding it 
 it was precisely at the point where the railing touched the neighboring wall there was a dim nook there in which eponine was entirely concealed 
 she remained thus for more than an hour without stirring and without breathing a prey to her thoughts 
 towards ten in the evening one of the two or three persons who passed through the rue plumet an old belated bourgeois who was making haste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute as he skirted the garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall heard a dull and threatening voice saying 
 no longer surprised that he comes here every evening 
 the cast a glance around him saw no one dared not peer into the black niche and was greatly alarmed 
 he redoubled his pace 
 this had reason to make haste for a very few instants later six men who were marching separately and at some distance from each other along the wall and who might have been taken for a gray patrol entered the rue plumet 
 the first to arrive at the garden railing halted and waited for the others a second later all six were reunited 
 these men began to talk in a low voice 
 this is the place said one of them 
 is there a cab dog in the garden asked another 
 i know 
 in any case i have fetched a ball that make him eat 
 have you some putty to break the pane with 
 yes 
 the railing is old interpolated a fifth who had the voice of a ventriloquist 
 so much the better said the second who had spoken 
 it screech under the saw and it be hard to cut 
 the sixth who had not yet opened his lips now began to inspect the gate as eponine had done an hour earlier grasping each bar in succession and shaking them cautiously 
 thus he came to the bar which marius had loosened 
 as he was on the point of grasping this bar a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness fell upon his arm he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in the middle of his breast and a hoarse voice said to him but not loudly 
 a dog 
 at the same moment he perceived a pale girl standing before him 
 the man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings he bristled up in hideous wise nothing is so formidable to behold as ferocious beasts who are uneasy their terrified air evokes terror 
 he recoiled and stammered 
 what jade is this 
 your daughter 
 it was in fact eponine who had addressed thenardier 
 at the apparition of eponine the other five that is to say claquesous guelemer babet brujon and montparnasse had noiselessly drawn near without precipitation without uttering a word with the sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night 
 some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands guelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call fanchons 
 ah see here what are you about there 
 what do you want with us are you crazy exclaimed thenardier as loudly as one can exclaim and still speak low what have you come here to hinder our work for 
 eponine burst out laughing and threw herself on his neck 
 i am here little father because i am here 
 a person allowed to sit on the stones nowadays 
 you who ought not to be here 
 what have you come here for since a biscuit i told magnon so 
 nothing to be done here 
 but embrace me my good little father 
 a long time since seen you so out 
 thenardier tried to disentangle himself from arms and grumbled 
 good 
 embraced me 
 yes out 
 not in now get away with you 
 but eponine did not release her hold and redoubled her caresses 
 but how did you manage it little pa 
 you must have been very clever to get out of that 
 tell me about it 
 and my mother where is mother 
 tell me about mamma 
 thenardier replied 
 well 
 i know let me alone and be off i tell you 
 i go so there now pouted eponine like a spoiled child you send me off and four months since i saw you and hardly had time to kiss you 
 and she caught her father round the neck again 
 come now this is stupid said babet 
 make haste said guelemer the cops may pass 
 the voice repeated his distich 
 nous n sommes pas le jour de this new day 
 a becoter papa maman 
 to peck at pa and ma 
 eponine turned to the five ruffians 
 why monsieur brujon 
 good day monsieur babet 
 good day monsieur claquesous 
 you know me monsieur guelemer how goes it montparnasse 
 yes they know you ejaculated thenardier 
 but good day good evening sheer off leave us alone 
 the hour for foxes not for chickens said montparnasse 
 you see the job we have on hand here added babet 
 eponine caught hand 
 take care said he cut yourself a knife open 
 my little montparnasse responded eponine very gently you must have confidence in people 
 i am the daughter of my father perhaps monsieur babet monsieur guelemer the person who was charged to investigate this matter 
 it is remarkable that eponine did not talk slang 
 that frightful 
 tongue had become impossible to her since she had known marius 
 she pressed in her hand small bony and feeble as that of a skeleton huge coarse fingers and continued 
 you know well that no fool 
 ordinarily i am believed i have rendered you service on various occasions 
 well i have made inquiries you will expose yourselves to no purpose you see i swear to you that there is nothing in this house 
 there are lone women said guelemer 
 no the persons have moved away 
 the candles anyway ejaculated babet 
 and he pointed out to eponine across the tops of the trees a light which was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion it was toussaint who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry 
 eponine made a final effort 
 well said she very poor folks and a hovel where there a sou 
 go to the devil cried thenardier 
 when turned the house upside down and put the cellar at the top and the attic below tell you what there is inside and whether francs or sous or 
 and he pushed her aside with the intention of entering 
 my good friend mr montparnasse said eponine i entreat you you are a good fellow enter 
 take care cut yourself replied montparnasse 
 thenardier resumed in his decided tone 
 decamp my girl and leave men to their own affairs 
 eponine released hand which she had grasped again and said 
 so you mean to enter this house 
 rather grinned the ventriloquist 
 then she set her back against the gate faced the six ruffians who were armed to the teeth and to whom the night lent the visages of demons and said in a firm low voice 
 well i mean that you shall 
 they halted in amazement 
 the ventriloquist however finished his grin she went on 
 friends 
 listen well 
 this is not what you want 
 now talking in the first place if you enter this garden if you lay a hand on this gate scream beat on the door rouse everybody have the whole six of you seized call the police 
 do it too said thenardier in a low tone to brujon and the ventriloquist 
 she shook her head and added 
 beginning with my father 
 thenardier stepped nearer 
 not so close my good man said she 
 he retreated growling between his teeth 
 why the matter with her 
 and he added 
 bitch 
 she began to laugh in a terrible way 
 as you like but you shall not enter here 
 not the daughter of a dog since the daughter of a wolf 
 there are six of you what matters that to me 
 you are men 
 well a woman you frighten me 
 i tell you that you enter this house because it suit me 
 if you approach bark 
 i told you the dog and i care a straw for you 
 go your way you bore me 
 go where you please but come here i forbid it you can use your knives 
 use kicks all the same to me come on 
 she advanced a pace nearer the ruffians she was terrible she burst out laughing 
 pardine 
 not afraid 
 i shall be hungry this summer and i shall be cold this winter 
 they ridiculous these ninnies of men to think they can scare a girl 
 what 
 scare 
 oh yes much because you have finical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on a big voice forsooth 
 i afraid of anything that i 
 she fastened her intent gaze upon thenardier and said 
 not even of you father 
 then she continued as she cast her eyes upon the ruffians in turn 
 what do i care if picked up morning on the pavement of the rue plumet killed by the blows of my club or whether found a year from now in the nets at or the isle of swans in the midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs 
 she was forced to pause she was seized by a dry cough her breath came from her weak and narrow chest like the 
 she resumed 
 i have only to cry out and people will come and then slap bang there are six of you i represent the whole world 
 thenardier made a movement towards her 
 approach she cried 
 he halted and said gently 
 well no i approach but speak so loud 
 so you intend to hinder us in our work my daughter 
 but we must earn our living all the same 
 have you no longer any kind feeling for your father 
 you bother me said eponine 
 but we must live we must eat 
 burst 
 so saying she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and hummed 
 mon bras si dodu 
 my arm so plump 
 ma jambe bien faite 
 my leg well formed 
 et le temps perdu 
 and time wasted 
 she had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand and she swung her foot with an air of indifference 
 her tattered gown permitted a view of her thin the neighboring street lantern illuminated her profile and her attitude nothing more resolute and more surprising could be seen 
 the six rascals speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a girl retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern and held counsel with furious and humiliated shrugs 
 in the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air 
 something the matter with her said babet 
 a reason is she in love with the dog 
 a shame to miss this anyway two women an old fellow who lodges in the and curtains that so bad at the windows 
 the old cove must be a jew i think the a good one 
 well go in then the rest of you exclaimed montparnasse do the job 
 stay here with the girl and if she fails us 
 he flashed the knife which he held open in his hand in the light of the lantern 
 thenardier said not a word and seemed ready for whatever the rest pleased 
 brujon who was somewhat of an oracle and who had as the reader knows put up the job had not as yet spoken 
 he seemed thoughtful he had the reputation of not sticking at anything and it was known that he had plundered a police post simply out of bravado besides this he made verses and songs which gave him great authority 
 babet interrogated him 
 you say nothing brujon 
 brujon remained silent an instant longer then he shook his head in various ways and finally concluded to speak 
 see here this morning i came across two sparrows fighting this evening i jostled a woman who was quarrelling 
 all bad quit 
 they went away 
 as they went montparnasse muttered 
 never mind if they had wanted have cut her throat 
 babet responded 
 i i hit a lady 
 at the corner of the street they halted and exchanged the following enigmatical dialogue in a low tone 
 where shall we go to sleep 
 under pantin paris 
 have you the key to the gate thenardier 
 pardi 
 eponine who never took her eyes off of them saw them retreat by the road by which they had come 
 she rose and began to creep after them along the walls and the houses 
 she followed them thus as far as the boulevard 
 there they parted and she saw these six men plunge into the gloom where they appeared to melt away

 chapter xxxiv 
 
 having run through different yards and side streets pierre got back with his little burden to the gruzinski garden at the corner of the povarskoy he did not at first recognize the place from which he had set out to look for the child so crowded was it now with people and goods that had been dragged out of the houses besides russian families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings there were several french soldiers in a variety of clothing pierre took no notice of them he hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else pierre felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly glowing with the heat and from running he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth animation and determination that had come on him when he ran to save the child she had now become quiet and clinging with her little hands to coat sat on his arm gazing about her like some little wild animal he glanced at her occasionally with a slight smile he fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened sickly little face 
 he did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them he walked among the crowd with rapid steps scanning the various faces he met involuntarily he noticed a georgian or armenian family consisting of a very handsome old man of oriental type wearing a new sheepskin coat and new boots an old woman of similar type and a young woman that very young woman seemed to pierre the perfection of oriental beauty with her sharply outlined arched black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft bright color of her long beautiful expressionless face amid the scattered property and the crowd on the open space she in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow she was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman and looked from under her long lashes with motionless large eyes at the ground before her evidently she was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it her face struck pierre and hurrying along by the fence he turned several times to look at her when he had reached the fence still without finding those he sought he stopped and looked about him 
 with the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than before and a group of russians both men and women gathered about him 
 have you lost anyone my dear fellow of the gentry yourself you whose child is it they asked him 
 pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who had been sitting there with her other children and he asked whether anyone knew where she had gone 
 why that must be the anferovs said an old deacon addressing a pockmarked peasant woman lord have mercy lord have mercy he added in his customary bass 
 the anferovs no said the woman they left in the morning that must be either mary or the ivanovs 
 he says a woman and mary nikolievna is a lady remarked a house serf 
 do you know her thin with long teeth said pierre 
 mary nikolievna they went inside the garden when these wolves swooped down said the woman pointing to the french soldiers 
 o lord have mercy added the deacon 
 go over that way there she she kept on lamenting and crying continued the woman she here this way 
 but pierre was not listening to the woman he had for some seconds been intently watching what was going on a few steps away he was looking at the armenian family and at two french soldiers who had gone up to them one of these a nimble little man was wearing a blue coat tied round the waist with a rope he had a nightcap on his head and his feet were bare the other whose appearance particularly struck pierre was a long lank man slow in his movements and with an idiotic expression of face he wore a loose gown of frieze blue trousers and large torn hessian boots the little barefooted frenchman in the blue coat went up to the armenians and saying something immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots the other in the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful armenian girl and with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her motionless and silent 
 here take the child said pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the woman handing the little girl to her give her back to them give her back he almost shouted putting the child who began screaming on the ground and again looking at the frenchman and the armenian family 
 the old man was already sitting barefoot the little frenchman had secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other the old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs but pierre caught but a glimpse of this his whole attention was directed to the frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile swaying slowly from side to side had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his pockets had seized her by the neck 
 the beautiful armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the soldier was doing to her 
 while pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the frenchman the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing from her neck the necklace the young armenian was wearing and the young woman clutching at her neck screamed piercingly 
 let that woman alone exclaimed pierre hoarsely in a furious voice seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside 
 the soldier fell got up and ran away but his comrade throwing down the boots and drawing his sword moved threateningly toward pierre 
 voyons pas de betises he cried 
 look here no nonsense 
 pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and his strength increased tenfold he rushed at the barefooted frenchman and before the latter had time to draw his sword knocked him off his feet and hammered him with his fists shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around and at the same moment a mounted patrol of french uhlans appeared from round the corner the uhlans came up at a trot to pierre and the frenchman and surrounded them pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that he only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of french soldiers stood around him and were searching him 
 lieutenant he has a dagger were the first words pierre understood 
 ah a weapon said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with pierre all right you can tell all about it at the then he turned to pierre do you speak french 
 pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply his face probably looked very terrible for the officer said something in a whisper and four more uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of pierre 
 do you speak french the officer asked again keeping at a distance from pierre call the interpreter 
 a little man in russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks and by his clothes and manner of speaking pierre at once knew him to be a french salesman from one of the moscow shops 
 he does not look like a common man said the interpreter after a searching look at pierre 
 ah he looks very much like an incendiary remarked the officer and ask him who he is he added 
 who are you asked the interpreter in poor russian you must answer the chief 
 i will not tell you who i am i am your prisoner take me pierre suddenly replied in french 
 ah ah muttered the officer with a frown well then march 
 a crowd had collected round the uhlans nearest to pierre stood the pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl and when the patrol started she moved forward 
 where are they taking you to you poor dear said she and the little girl the little girl what am i to do with her if not theirs said the woman 
 what does that woman want asked the officer 
 pierre was as if intoxicated his elation increased at the sight of the little girl he had saved 
 what does she want he murmured she is bringing me my daughter whom i have just saved from the flames said he and without knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him he went along with resolute and triumphant steps between the french soldiers 
 the french patrol was one of those sent out through the various streets of moscow by order to put a stop to the pillage and especially to catch the incendiaries who according to the general opinion which had that day originated among the higher french officers were the cause of the conflagrations after marching through a number of streets the patrol arrested five more russian suspects a small shopkeeper two seminary students a peasant and a house serf besides several looters but of all these various suspected characters pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all when they had all been brought for the night to a large house on the zubov rampart that was being used as a guardhouse pierre was placed apart under strict guard

 things of the night 
 after the departure of the ruffians the rue plumet resumed its tranquil nocturnal aspect 
 that which had just taken place in this street would not have astonished a forest 
 the lofty trees the copses the heaths the branches rudely interlaced the tall grass exist in a sombre manner the savage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden apparitions of the invisible that which is below man distinguishes through the mists that which is beyond man and the things of which we living beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the night 
 nature bristling and wild takes alarm at certain approaches in which she fancies that she feels the supernatural 
 the forces of the gloom know each other and are strangely balanced by each other 
 teeth and claws fear what they cannot grasp 
 bestiality voracious appetites hunger in search of prey the armed instincts of nails and jaws which have for source and aim the belly glare and smell out uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a shroud erect in its vague and shuddering robe and which seem to them to live with a dead and terrible life 
 these brutalities which are only matter entertain a confused fear of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an unknown being a black figure barring the way stops the wild beast short that which emerges from the cemetery intimidates and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave the ferocious fear the sinister wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul

 chapter i 
 
 in petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on with greater heat than ever in the highest circles between the parties of rumyantsev the french marya fedorovna the tsarevich and others drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones but the calm luxurious life of petersburg concerned only about phantoms and reflections of real life went on in its old way and made it hard except by a great effort to realize the danger and the difficult position of the russian people there were the same receptions and balls the same french theater the same court interests and service interests and intrigues as usual only in the very highest circles were attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position stories were whispered of how differently the two empresses behaved in these difficult circumstances the empress marya concerned for the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her patronage had given directions that they should all be removed to kazan and the things belonging to these institutions had already been packed up the empress elisabeth however when asked what instructions she would be pleased to give with her characteristic russian patriotism had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for that was the affair of the sovereign but as far as she personally was concerned she would be the last to quit petersburg 
 at anna on the of august the very day of the battle of borodino there was a soiree the chief feature of which was to be the reading of a letter from his lordship the bishop when sending the emperor an icon of the venerable sergius it was regarded as a model of ecclesiastical patriotic eloquence prince vasili himself famed for his elocution was to read it he used to read at the empress the art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words quite independently of their meaning in a loud and singsong voice alternating between a despairing wail and a tender murmur so that the wail fell quite at random on one word and the murmur on another this reading as was always the case at anna soirees had a political significance that evening she expected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of their visits to the french theater and aroused to a patriotic temper a good many people had already arrived but anna pavlovna not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general conversation 
 the news of the day in petersburg was the illness of countess bezukhova she had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously had missed several gatherings of which she was usually ornament and was said to be receiving no one and instead of the celebrated petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way 
 they all knew very well that the enchanting countess illness arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time and that the cure consisted in removing such inconvenience but in anna presence no one dared to think of this or even appear to know it 
 they say the poor countess is very ill the doctor says it is angina pectoris 
 angina oh a terrible illness 
 they say that the rivals are reconciled thanks to the angina and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction 
 the count is pathetic they say he cried like a child when the doctor told him the case was dangerous 
 oh it would be a terrible loss she is an enchanting woman 
 you are speaking of the poor countess said anna pavlovna coming up just then i sent to ask for news and hear that she is a little better oh she is certainly the most charming woman in the world she went on with a smile at her own enthusiasm we belong to different camps but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves she is very unfortunate added anna pavlovna 
 supposing that by these words anna pavlovna was somewhat lifting the veil from the secret of the countess malady an unwary young man ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been called in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might employ dangerous remedies 
 your information maybe better than mine anna pavlovna suddenly and venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man but i know on good authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man he is private physician to the queen of spain 
 and having thus demolished the young man anna pavlovna turned to another group where bilibin was talking about the austrians having wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again and utter one of his mots 
 i think it is delightful he said referring to a diplomatic note that had been sent to vienna with some austrian banners captured from the french by wittgenstein the hero of petropol as he was then called in petersburg 
 what that asked anna pavlovna securing silence for the mot which she had heard before 
 and bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch which he had himself composed 
 the emperor returns these austrian banners said bilibin friendly banners gone astray and found on a wrong path and his brow became smooth again 
 charming charming observed prince vasili 
 the path to warsaw perhaps prince hippolyte remarked loudly and unexpectedly everybody looked at him understanding what he meant prince hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise he knew no more than the others what his words meant during his diplomatic career he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very witty and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words that entered his head it may turn out very well he thought but if not know how to arrange matters and really during the awkward silence that ensued that insufficiently patriotic person entered whom anna pavlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert and she smiling and shaking a finger at hippolyte invited prince vasili to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin everyone became silent 
 most gracious sovereign and emperor prince vasili sternly declaimed looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had anything to say to the contrary but no one said anything moscow our ancient capital the new jerusalem receives her christ he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her as a mother receives her zealous sons into her arms and through the gathering mists foreseeing the brilliant glory of thy rule sings in exultation hosanna blessed is he that cometh 
 prince vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice 
 bilibin attentively examined his nails and many of those present appeared intimidated as if asking in what they were to blame anna pavlovna whispered the next words in advance like an old woman muttering the prayer at communion let the bold and insolent goliath she whispered 
 prince vasili continued 
 let the bold and insolent goliath from the borders of france encompass the realms of russia with terrors humble faith the sling of the russian david shall suddenly smite his head in his pride this icon of the venerable sergius the servant of god and zealous champion of old of our weal is offered to your imperial majesty i grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence i raise fervent prayers to heaven that the almighty may exalt the race of the just and mercifully fulfill the desires of your majesty 
 what force what a style was uttered in approval both of reader and of author 
 animated by that address anna guests talked for a long time of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days 
 you will see said anna pavlovna that tomorrow on the birthday we shall receive news i have a favorable presentiment

 chapter vi 
 
 marius becomes practical once more to the extent of giving cosette his address 
 while this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over the gate and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl marius was by side 
 never had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming the trees more trembling the odor of the grass more penetrating never had the birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise never had all the harmonies of universal serenity responded more thoroughly to the inward music of love never had marius been more captivated more happy more ecstatic 
 but he had found cosette sad cosette had been weeping 
 her eyes were red 
 this was the first cloud in that wonderful dream 
 marius first word had been 
 what is the matter 
 and she had replied 
 this 
 then she had seated herself on the bench near the steps and while he tremblingly took his place beside her she had continued 
 my father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness because he has business and we may go away from here 
 marius shivered from head to foot 
 when one is at the end of life to die means to go away when one is at the beginning of it to go away means to die 
 for the last six weeks marius had little by little slowly by degrees taken possession of cosette each day 
 as we have already explained in the case of first love the soul is taken long before the body later on one takes the body long before the soul sometimes one does not take the soul at all the faublas and the prudhommes add because there is none but the sarcasm is fortunately a blasphemy so marius possessed cosette as spirits possess but he enveloped her with all his soul and seized her jealously with incredible conviction he possessed her smile her breath her perfume the profound radiance of her blue eyes the sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand the charming mark which she had on her neck all her thoughts therefore he possessed all dreams 
 he incessantly gazed at and he sometimes touched lightly with his breath the short locks on the nape of her neck and he declared to himself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not belong to him marius 
 he gazed upon and adored the things that she wore her knot of ribbon her gloves her sleeves her shoes her cuffs as sacred objects of which he was the master he dreamed that he was the lord of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair and he even said to himself in confused and suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness which did not make their way to the light that there was not a ribbon of her gown not a mesh in her stockings not a fold in her bodice which was not his 
 beside cosette he felt himself beside his own property his own thing his own despot and his slave 
 it seemed as though they had so intermingled their souls that it would have been impossible to tell them apart had they wished to take them back is mine 
 no it is mine 
 i assure you that you are mistaken this is my property 
 what you are taking as your own is myself marius was something that made a part of cosette and cosette was something which made a part of marius 
 marius felt cosette within him 
 to have cosette to possess cosette this to him was not to be distinguished from breathing 
 it was in the midst of this faith of this intoxication of this virgin possession unprecedented and absolute of this sovereignty that these words we are going away fell suddenly at a blow and that the harsh voice of reality cried to him 
 cosette is not yours 
 marius awoke 
 for six weeks marius had been living as we have said outside of life those words going away caused him to it harshly 
 he found not a word to say 
 cosette merely felt that his hand was very cold 
 she said to him in her turn 
 what is the matter 
 he replied in so low a tone that cosette hardly heard him 
 i did not understand what you said 
 she began again 
 this morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to hold myself in readiness that he would give me his linen to put in a trunk that he was obliged to go on a journey that we were to go away that it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for him and that all is to be ready in a week from now and that we might go to england 
 but this is outrageous exclaimed marius 
 it is certain that at that moment no abuse of power no violence not one of the abominations of the worst tyrants no action of busiris of tiberius or of henry viii could have equalled this in atrocity in the opinion of marius m fauchelevent taking his daughter off to england because he had business there 
 he demanded in a weak voice 
 and when do you start 
 he did not say when 
 and when shall you return 
 he did not say when 
 marius rose and said coldly 
 cosette shall you go 
 cosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes all filled with anguish and replied in a sort of bewilderment 
 where 
 to england 
 shall you go 
 why do you say you to me 
 i ask you whether you will go 
 what do you expect me to do she said clasping her hands 
 so you will go 
 if my father goes 
 so you will go 
 cosette took marius hand and pressed it without replying 
 very well said marius then i will go elsewhere 
 cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words she turned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom she stammered 
 what do you mean 
 marius looked at her then raised his eyes to heaven and answered 
 nothing 
 when his eyes fell again he saw cosette smiling at him the smile of a woman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance even at night 
 how silly we are 
 marius i have an idea 
 what is it 
 if we go away do you go too 
 i will tell you where 
 come and join me wherever i am 
 marius was now a thoroughly roused man 
 he had fallen back into reality 
 he cried to cosette 
 go away with you 
 are you mad 
 why i should have to have money and i have none 
 go to england 
 but i am in debt now i owe i know how much more than ten louis to courfeyrac one of my friends with whom you are not acquainted 
 i have an old hat which is not worth three francs i have a coat which lacks buttons in front my shirt is all ragged my elbows are torn my boots let in the water for the last six weeks i have not thought about it and i have not told you about it 
 you only see me at night and you give me your love if you were to see me in the daytime you would give me a sou 
 go to england 
 eh 
 i enough to pay for a passport 
 he threw himself against a tree which was close at hand erect his brow pressed close to the bark feeling neither the wood which flayed his skin nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples and there he stood motionless on the point of falling like the statue of despair 
 he remained a long time thus 
 one could remain for eternity in such abysses 
 at last he turned round 
 he heard behind him a faint stifled noise which was sweet yet sad 
 it was cosette sobbing 
 she had been weeping for more than two hours beside marius as he meditated 
 he came to her fell at her knees and slowly prostrating himself he took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe and kissed it 
 she let him have his way in silence 
 there are moments when a woman accepts like a sombre and resigned goddess the religion of love 
 do not weep he said 
 she murmured 
 not when i may be going away and you cannot come 
 he went on 
 do you love me 
 she replied sobbing by that word from paradise which is never more charming than amid tears 
 i adore you 
 he continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress 
 do not weep 
 tell me will you do this for me and cease to weep 
 do you love me said she 
 he took her hand 
 cosette i have never given my word of honor to any one because my word of honor terrifies me 
 i feel that my father is by my side 
 well i give you my most sacred word of honor that if you go away i shall die 
 in the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so solemn and so tranquil that cosette trembled 
 she felt that chill which is produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by the shock made her cease weeping 
 now listen said he do not expect me 
 why 
 do not expect me until the day after 
 oh 
 why 
 you will see 
 a day without seeing you 
 but that is impossible 
 let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives perhaps 
 and marius added in a low tone and in an aside 
 he is a man who never changes his habits and he has never received any one except in the evening 
 of what man are you speaking asked cosette 
 i 
 i said nothing 
 what do you hope then 
 wait until the day after 
 you wish it 
 yes cosette 
 she took his head in both her hands raising herself on tiptoe in order to be on a level with him and tried to read his hope in his eyes 
 marius resumed 
 now that i think of it you ought to know my address something might happen one never knows i live with that friend named courfeyrac rue de la verrerie no 
 he searched in his pocket pulled out his penknife and with the blade he wrote on the plaster of the wall 
 rue de la verrerie 
 in the meantime cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more 
 tell me your thought marius you have some idea 
 tell it to me oh tell me so that i may pass a pleasant night 
 this is my idea 
 that it is impossible that god should mean to part us 
 wait expect me the day after 
 what shall i do until then said cosette you are outside you go and come 
 how happy men are i shall remain entirely alone 
 oh 
 how sad i shall be 
 what is it that you are going to do evening tell me 
 i am going to try something 
 then i will pray to god and i will think of you here so that you may be successful 
 i will question you no further since you do not wish it 
 you are my master 
 i shall pass the evening in singing that music from euryanthe that you love and that you came one evening to listen to outside my shutters but day after you will come early 
 i shall expect you at dusk at nine precisely i warn you 
 mon dieu how sad it is that the days are so long 
 on the stroke of nine do you understand i shall be in the garden 
 and i also 
 and without having uttered it moved by the same thought impelled by those electric currents which place lovers in continual communication both being intoxicated with delight even in their sorrow they fell into each arms without perceiving that their lips met while their uplifted eyes overflowing with rapture and full of tears gazed upon the stars 
 when marius went forth the street was deserted 
 this was the moment when eponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard 
 while marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree an idea had crossed his mind an idea alas that he himself judged to be senseless and impossible 
 he had come to a desperate decision

 chapter ii 
 
 anna presentiment was in fact fulfilled next day during the service at the palace church in honor of the birthday prince volkonski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from prince kutuzov it was report written from tatarinova on the day of the battle kutuzov wrote that the russians had not retreated a step that the french losses were much heavier than ours and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full information it followed that there must have been a victory and at once without leaving the church thanks were rendered to the creator for his help and for the victory 
 anna presentiment was justified and all that morning a joyously festive mood reigned in the city everyone believed the victory to have been complete and some even spoke of having been captured of his deposition and of the choice of a new ruler for france 
 it is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the scene of action general events involuntarily group themselves around some particular incident so now the courtiers pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on the birthday as on the fact of the victory itself it was like a successfully arranged surprise mention was made in report of the russian losses among which figured the names of tuchkov bagration and kutaysov in the petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single incident death everybody knew him the emperor liked him and he was young and interesting that day everyone met with the words 
 what a wonderful coincidence just during the service but what a loss kutaysov is how sorry i am 
 what did i tell about kutuzov prince vasili now said with a pride i always said he was the only man capable of defeating napoleon 
 but next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew anxious the courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense occasioned the emperor 
 fancy the position said they and instead of extolling kutuzov as they had done the day before they condemned him as the cause of the anxiety that day prince vasili no longer boasted of his protege kutuzov but remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned moreover toward evening as if everything conspired to make petersburg society anxious and uneasy a terrible piece of news was added countess helene bezukhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to mention officially at large gatherings everyone said that countess bezukhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private physician of the queen of spain had prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect but helene tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom she had written that wretched profligate pierre had not replied had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her it was said that prince vasili and the old count had turned upon the italian but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop 
 talk in general centered round three melancholy facts the lack of news the loss of kutuzov and the death of helene 
 on the third day after report a country gentleman arrived from moscow and news of the surrender of moscow to the french spread through the whole town this was terrible what a position for the emperor to be in kutuzov was a traitor and prince vasili during the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his death said of kutuzov whom he had formerly praised it was excusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said that it was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old man 
 i only wonder that the fate of russia could have been entrusted to such a man 
 as long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it but the next day the following communication was received from count rostopchin 
 prince adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands police officers to guide the army to the ryazan road he writes that he is regretfully abandoning moscow sire action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire russia will shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors i shall follow the army i have had everything removed and it only remains for me to weep over the fate of my fatherland 
 on receiving this dispatch the emperor sent prince volkonski to kutuzov with the following rescript 
 prince michael ilarionovich since the of august i have received no communication from you yet on the first of september i received from the commander in chief of moscow via yaroslavl the sad news that you with the army have decided to abandon moscow you can yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me and your silence increases my astonishment i am sending this by prince volkonski to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy decision

 book and desolations 
 chapter vii 
 
 the old heart and the young heart in the presence of each other 
 at that epoch father gillenormand was well past his birthday 
 he still lived with mademoiselle gillenormand in the rue des no in the old house which he owned he was as the reader will remember one of those antique old men who await death perfectly erect whom age bears down without bending and whom even sorrow cannot curve 
 still his daughter had been saying for some time 
 my father is sinking 
 he no longer boxed the maids ears he no longer thumped the so vigorously with his cane when basque was slow in opening the door 
 the revolution of july had exasperated him for the space of barely six months 
 he had viewed almost tranquilly that coupling of words in the moniteur 
 m peer of france 
 the fact is that the old man was deeply dejected he did not bend he did not yield this was no more a characteristic of his physical than of his moral nature but he felt himself giving way internally 
 for four years he had been waiting for marius with his foot firmly planted that is the exact word in the conviction that that young scamp would ring at his door some day or other now he had reached the point where at certain gloomy hours he said to himself that if marius made him wait much was not death that was insupportable to him it was the idea that perhaps he should never see marius again the idea of never seeing marius again had never entered his brain until that day now the thought began to recur to him and it chilled him 
 absence as is always the case in genuine and natural sentiments had only served to augment the love for the ungrateful child who had gone off like a flash it is during december nights when the cold stands at ten degrees that one thinks oftenest of the son 
 m gillenormand was or thought himself above all things incapable of taking a single step grandfather towards his grandson i would die rather he said to himself he did not consider himself as the least to blame but he thought of marius only with profound tenderness and the mute despair of an elderly kindly old man who is about to vanish in the dark 
 he began to lose his teeth which added to his sadness 
 m gillenormand without however acknowledging it to himself for it would have rendered him furious and ashamed had never loved a mistress as he loved marius 
 he had had placed in his chamber opposite the head of his bed so that it should be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking an old portrait of his other daughter who was dead madame pontmercy a portrait which had been taken when she was eighteen 
 he gazed incessantly at that portrait 
 one day he happened to say as he gazed upon it 
 i think the likeness is strong 
 to my sister inquired mademoiselle gillenormand 
 yes certainly 
 the old man added 
 and to him also 
 once as he sat with his knees pressed together and his eyes almost closed in a despondent attitude his daughter ventured to say to him 
 father are you as angry with him as ever 
 she paused not daring to proceed further 
 with whom he demanded 
 with that poor marius 
 he raised his aged head laid his withered and emaciated fist on the table and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone 
 poor marius do you say 
 that gentleman is a knave a wretched scoundrel a vain little ingrate a heartless soulless haughty and wicked man 
 and he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that stood in his eye 
 three days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours to say to his daughter 
 i had the honor to ask mademoiselle gillenormand never to mention him to me 
 aunt gillenormand renounced every effort and pronounced this acute diagnosis 
 my father never cared very much for my sister after her folly 
 it is clear that he detests marius 
 after her folly meant 
 after she had married the colonel 
 however as the reader has been able to conjecture mademoiselle gillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite the officer of lancers for marius 
 the substitute theodule had not been a success 
 m gillenormand had not accepted the quid pro quo 
 a vacancy in the heart does not accommodate itself to a theodule on his side though he scented the inheritance was disgusted at the task of pleasing 
 the goodman bored the lancer and the lancer shocked the goodman 
 lieutenant theodule was gay no doubt but a frivolous but vulgar a high liver but a frequenter of bad company he had mistresses it is true and he had a great deal to say about them it is true also but he talked badly 
 all his good qualities had a defect m gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about the love affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the rue de babylone 
 and then lieutenant gillenormand sometimes came in his uniform with the tricolored cockade 
 this rendered him downright intolerable 
 finally father gillenormand had said to his daughter 
 had enough of that theodule 
 i much taste for warriors in time of peace 
 receive him if you choose i know but i prefer slashers to fellows that drag their swords the clash of blades in battle is less dismal after all than the clank of the scabbard on the pavement 
 and then throwing out your chest like a bully and lacing yourself like a girl with stays under your cuirass is doubly ridiculous 
 when one is a veritable man one holds equally aloof from swagger and from affected airs 
 he is neither a blusterer nor a man 
 keep your theodule for yourself 
 it was in vain that his daughter said to him 
 but he is your grandnephew turned out that m gillenormand who was a grandfather to the very was not in the least a 
 in fact as he had good sense and as he had compared the two theodule had only served to make him regret marius all the more 
 one was the th of june which did not prevent father gillenormand having a rousing fire on the had dismissed his daughter who was sewing in a neighboring apartment he was alone in his chamber amid its pastoral scenes with his feet propped on the andirons half enveloped in his huge screen of coromandel lacquer with its nine leaves with his elbow resting on a table where burned two candles under a green shade engulfed in his tapestry armchair and in his hand a book which he was not reading he was dressed according to his wont like an incroyable and resembled an antique portrait by garat 
 this would have made people run after him in the street had not his daughter covered him up whenever he went out in a vast wadded cloak which concealed his attire 
 at home he never wore a dressing gown except when he rose and retired 
 it gives one a look of age said he 
 father gillenormand was thinking of marius lovingly and bitterly and as usual bitterness predominated 
 his tenderness once soured always ended by boiling and turning to indignation he had reached the point where a man tries to make up his mind and to accept that which rends his heart 
 he was explaining to himself that there was no longer any reason why marius should return that if he intended to return he should have done it long ago that he must renounce the idea 
 he was trying to accustom himself to the thought that all was over and that he should die without having beheld that gentleman again 
 but his whole nature revolted his aged paternity would not consent to this 
 well said he this was his doleful will not return 
 his bald head had fallen upon his breast and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gaze upon the ashes on his hearth 
 in the very midst of his revery his old servant basque entered and inquired 
 can monsieur receive m marius 
 the old man sat up erect pallid and like a corpse which rises under the influence of a galvanic shock 
 all his blood had retreated to his heart 
 he stammered 
 m marius what 
 i know replied basque intimidated and put out of countenance by his air i have not seen him 
 nicolette came in and said to me 
 a young man here say that it is m marius 
 father gillenormand stammered in a low voice 
 show him in 
 and he remained in the same attitude with shaking head and his eyes fixed on the door 
 it opened once more 
 a young man entered it was marius 
 marius halted at the door as though waiting to be bidden to enter 
 his almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused by the shade 
 nothing could be seen but his calm grave but strangely sad face 
 it was several minutes before father gillenormand dulled with amazement and joy could see anything except a brightness as when one is in the presence of an apparition 
 he was on the point of swooning he saw marius through a dazzling light 
 it certainly was he it certainly was marius 
 at last 
 after the lapse of four years 
 he grasped him entire so to speak in a single glance 
 he found him noble handsome distinguished a complete man with a suitable mien and a charming air 
 he felt a desire to open his arms to call him to fling himself forward his heart melted with rapture affectionate words swelled and overflowed his breast at length all his tenderness came to the light and reached his lips and by a contrast which constituted the very foundation of his nature what came forth was harshness 
 he said abruptly 
 what have you come here for 
 marius replied with embarrassment 
 monsieur 
 m gillenormand would have liked to have marius throw himself into his arms 
 he was displeased with marius and with himself he was conscious that he was brusque and that marius was cold it caused the goodman unendurable and irritating anxiety to feel so tender and forlorn within and only to be able to be hard outside bitterness returned 
 he interrupted marius in a peevish tone 
 then why did you come 
 that then signified 
 if you do not come to embrace me marius looked at his grandfather whose pallor gave him a face of marble 
 monsieur 
 have you come to beg my pardon 
 do you acknowledge your faults 
 he thought he was putting marius on the right road and that the child would yield 
 marius shivered it was the denial of his father that was required of him he dropped his eyes and replied 
 no sir 
 then exclaimed the old man impetuously with a grief that was poignant and full of wrath what do you want of me 
 marius clasped his hands advanced a step and said in a feeble and trembling voice 
 sir have pity on me 
 these words touched m gillenormand uttered a little sooner they would have rendered him tender but they came too late the grandfather rose he supported himself with both hands on his cane his lips were white his brow wavered but his lofty form towered above marius as he bowed 
 pity on you sir 
 it is youth demanding pity of the old man of you are entering into life i am leaving it you go to the play to balls to the cafe to the you have wit you please the women you are a handsome fellow as for me i spit on my brands in the heart of summer you are rich with the only riches that are really such i possess all the poverty of age infirmity isolation 
 you have your teeth a good digestion bright eyes strength appetite health gayety a forest of black hair i have no longer even white hair i have lost my teeth i am losing my legs i am losing my memory there are three names of streets that i confound incessantly the rue charlot the rue du chaume and the rue that is what i have come to you have before you the whole future full of sunshine and i am beginning to lose my sight so far am i advancing into the night you are in love that is a matter of course i am beloved by no one in all the world and you ask pity of me 
 parbleu 
 moliere forgot that 
 if that is the way you jest at the courthouse messieurs the lawyers i sincerely compliment you you are droll 
 and the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice 
 come now what do you want of me 
 sir said marius i know that my presence is displeasing to you but i have come merely to ask one thing of you and then i shall go away immediately 
 you are a fool said the old man 
 who said that you were to go away 
 this was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom of his heart 
 ask my pardon 
 throw yourself on my neck 
 m gillenormand felt that marius would leave him in a few moments that his harsh reception had repelled the lad that his hardness was driving him away he said all this to himself and it augmented his grief and as his grief was straightway converted into wrath it increased his harshness 
 he would have liked to have marius understand and marius did not understand which made the goodman furious 
 he began again 
 what you deserted me your grandfather you left my house to go no one knows whither you drove your aunt to despair you went off it is easily guessed to lead a bachelor life more convenient to play the dandy to come in at all hours to amuse yourself you have given me no signs of life you have contracted debts without even telling me to pay them you have become a smasher of windows and a blusterer and at the end of four years you come to me and that is all you have to say to me 
 this violent fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was productive only of silence on the part of marius 
 m gillenormand folded his arms a gesture which with him was peculiarly imperious and apostrophized marius bitterly 
 let us make an end of this 
 you have come to ask something of me you say 
 well what 
 what is it 
 speak 
 sir said marius with the look of a man who feels that he is falling over a precipice i have come to ask your permission to marry 
 m gillenormand rang the bell 
 basque opened the door 
 call my daughter 
 a second later the door was opened once more mademoiselle gillenormand did not enter but showed herself marius was standing mute with pendant arms and the face of a criminal m gillenormand was pacing back and forth in the room 
 he turned to his daughter and said to her 
 nothing 
 it is monsieur marius 
 say good day to him monsieur wishes to marry 
 all 
 go away 
 the curt hoarse sound of the old voice announced a strange degree of excitement 
 the aunt gazed at marius with a frightened air hardly appeared to recognize him did not allow a gesture or a syllable to escape her and disappeared at her breath more swiftly than a straw before the hurricane 
 in the meantime father gillenormand had returned and placed his back against the once more 
 you marry 
 at one and twenty 
 you have arranged that 
 you have only a permission to ask a formality 
 sit down sir 
 well you have had a revolution since i had the honor to see you last the jacobins got the upper hand 
 you must have been delighted are you not a republican since you are a baron 
 you can make that agree 
 the republic makes a good sauce for the barony are you one of those decorated by july 
 have you taken the louvre at all sir 
 quite near here in the rue opposite the rue des nonamdieres there is a incrusted in the wall of the third story of a house with this inscription july th 
 go take a look at that 
 it produces a good effect ah those friends of yours do pretty things 
 by the way they erecting a fountain in the place of the monument of m le duc de berry so you want to marry 
 whom 
 can one inquire without indiscretion 
 he paused and before marius had time to answer he added violently 
 come now you have a profession 
 a fortune made 
 how much do you earn at your trade of lawyer 
 nothing said marius with a sort of firmness and resolution that was almost fierce 
 nothing 
 then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred livres that i allow you 
 marius did not reply 
 m gillenormand continued 
 then i understand the girl is rich 
 as rich as i am 
 what 
 no dowry 
 no 
 expectations 
 i think not 
 utterly naked 
 the father 
 i know 
 and her name 
 mademoiselle fauchelevent 
 fauchewhat 
 fauchelevent 
 pttt ejaculated the old gentleman 
 sir exclaimed marius 
 m gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking to himself 
 right one and twenty years of age no profession twelve hundred livres a year madame la baronne de pontmercy will go and purchase a couple of sous worth of parsley from the fruiterer 
 sir repeated marius in the despair at the last hope which was vanishing i entreat you 
 i conjure you in the name of heaven with clasped hands sir i throw myself at your feet permit me to marry her 
 the old man burst into a shout of strident and mournful laughter coughing and laughing at the same time 
 ah ah ah 
 you said to yourself 
 pardine go hunt up that old blockhead that absurd numskull 
 what a shame that not how treat him to a nice respectful summons how nicely get along without him 
 nothing to me say to him 
 only too happy to see me you old idiot i want to marry i desire to wed mamselle daughter of monsieur i have no shoes she has no chemise that just suits i want to throw my career my future my youth my life to the dogs i wish to take a plunge into wretchedness with a woman around my neck an idea and you must consent to it and the old fossil will consent 
 go my lad do as you like attach your marry your pousselevent your coupelevent never sir never 
 father 
 never 
 at the tone in which that never was uttered marius lost all hope he traversed the chamber with slow steps with bowed head tottering and more like a dying man than like one merely taking his departure m gillenormand followed him with his eyes and at the moment when the door opened and marius was on the point of going out he advanced four paces with the senile vivacity of impetuous and spoiled old gentlemen seized marius by the collar brought him back energetically into the room flung him into an armchair and said to him 
 tell me all about it 
 it was that single word father which had effected this revolution 
 marius stared at him in bewilderment 
 m mobile face was no longer expressive of anything but rough and ineffable the grandsire had given way before the grandfather 
 come see here speak tell me about your love affairs jabber tell me everything 
 sapristi how stupid young folks are 
 father repeated marius 
 the old entire countenance lighted up with indescribable radiance 
 yes right call me father and see 
 there was now something so kind so gentle so openhearted and so paternal in this brusqueness that marius in the sudden transition from discouragement to hope was stunned and intoxicated by it as it were 
 he was seated near the table the light from the candles brought out the dilapidation of his costume which father gillenormand regarded with amazement 
 well father said marius 
 ah by the way interrupted m gillenormand you really have not a penny then 
 you are dressed like a pickpocket 
 he rummaged in a drawer drew forth a purse which he laid on the table 
 here are a hundred louis buy yourself a hat 
 father pursued marius my good father if you only knew 
 i love her you cannot imagine it the first time i saw her was at the luxembourg she came there in the beginning i did not pay much heed to her and then i know how it came about i fell in love with her oh how unhappy that made me 
 now at last i see her every day at her own home her father does not know it just fancy they are going away it is in the garden that we meet in the evening her father means to take her to england then i said to myself go and see my grandfather and tell him all about the affair i should go mad first i should die i should fall ill i should throw myself into the water 
 i absolutely must marry her since i should go mad otherwise 
 this is the whole truth and i do not think that i have omitted anything 
 she lives in a garden with an iron fence in the rue plumet 
 it is in the neighborhood of the invalides 
 father gillenormand had seated himself with a beaming countenance beside marius 
 as he listened to him and drank in the sound of his voice he enjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff at the words rue plumet he interrupted his inhalation and allowed the remainder of his snuff to fall upon his knees 
 the rue plumet the rue plumet did you us there not barracks in that yes it 
 your cousin theodule has spoken to me about it 
 the lancer the officer a gay girl my good friend a gay yes the rue plumet it is what used to be called the rue all comes back to me now 
 i have heard of that little girl of the iron railing in the rue plumet 
 in a garden a pamela 
 your taste is not bad she is said to be a very tidy creature 
 between ourselves i think that simpleton of a lancer has been courting her a bit i know where he did it 
 however not to the purpose besides he is not to be believed 
 he brags marius 
 i think it quite proper that a young man like you should be in love the right thing at your age 
 i like you better as a lover than as a jacobin 
 i like you better in love with a petticoat sapristi with twenty petticoats than with m de robespierre for my part i will do myself the justice to say that in the line of i have never loved any one but women 
 pretty girls are pretty girls the deuce 
 no objection to that 
 as for the little one she receives you without her knowledge in the established order of things 
 i have had adventures of that same sort myself 
 more than one 
 do you know what is done then one does not take the matter ferociously one does not precipitate himself into the tragic one does not make mind to marriage and m le maire with his scarf 
 one simply behaves like a fellow of spirit 
 one shows good sense 
 slip along mortals marry you come and look up your grandfather who is a fellow at bottom and who always has a few rolls of louis in an old drawer you say to him 
 see here grandfather 
 and the grandfather says a simple matter 
 youth must amuse itself and old age must wear out 
 i have been young you will be old 
 come my boy you shall pass it on to your grandson 
 here are two hundred pistoles amuse yourself deuce take it 
 nothing better 
 the way the affair should be treated 
 you marry but that does no harm you understand me 
 marius petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable made a sign with his head that he did not 
 the old man burst out laughing winked his aged eye gave him a slap on the knee stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming air and said to him with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder 
 booby make her your mistress 
 marius turned pale 
 he had understood nothing of what his grandfather had just said 
 this twaddle about the rue blomet pamela the barracks the lancer had passed before marius like a dissolving view nothing of all that could bear any reference to cosette who was a lily 
 the good man was wandering in his mind 
 but this wandering terminated in words which marius did understand and which were a mortal insult to cosette 
 those words make her your mistress entered the heart of the strict young man like a sword 
 he rose picked up his hat which lay on the floor and walked to the door with a firm assured step 
 there he turned round bowed deeply to his grandfather raised his head erect again and said 
 five years ago you insulted my father you have insulted my wife 
 i ask nothing more of you sir 
 farewell 
 father gillenormand utterly confounded opened his mouth extended his arms tried to rise and before he could utter a word the door closed once more and marius had disappeared 
 the old man remained for several minutes motionless and as though struck by lightning without the power to speak or breathe as though a clenched fist grasped his throat 
 at last he tore himself from his ran so far as a man can run at to the door opened it and cried 
 help 
 help 
 his daughter made her appearance then the domestics 
 he began again with a pitiful rattle 
 run after him 
 bring him back 
 what have i done to him 
 he is mad 
 he is going away 
 ah my god 
 ah my god this time he will not come back 
 he went to the window which looked out on the street threw it open with his aged and palsied hands leaned out more than while basque and nicolette held him behind and shouted 
 marius 
 marius 
 marius 
 marius 
 but marius could no longer hear him for at that moment he was turning the corner of the rue 
 the octogenarian raised his hands to his temples two or three times with an expression of anguish recoiled tottering and fell back into an pulseless voiceless tearless with quivering head and lips which moved with a stupid air with nothing in his eyes and nothing any longer in his heart except a gloomy and profound something which resembled night

 book twelve 
 chapter iii 
 
 nine days after the abandonment of moscow a messenger from kutuzov reached petersburg with the official announcement of that event this messenger was michaud a frenchman who did not know russian but who was quoique etranger russe de coeur et as he said of himself 
 though a foreigner russian in heart and soul 
 the emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace on stone island michaud who had never seen moscow before the campaign and who did not know russian yet felt deeply moved as he wrote when he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain with the news of the burning of moscow dont les flammes eclairaient sa route 
 our most gracious sovereign 
 whose flames illumined his route 
 though the source of m chagrin must have been different from that which caused russians to grieve he had such a sad face when shown into the study that the latter at once asked 
 have you brought me sad news colonel 
 very sad sire replied michaud lowering his eyes with a sigh the abandonment of moscow 
 have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle asked the emperor quickly his face suddenly flushing 
 michaud respectfully delivered the message kutuzov had entrusted to him which was that it had been impossible to fight before moscow and that as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as moscow or losing moscow alone the field marshal had to choose the latter 
 the emperor listened in silence not looking at michaud 
 has the enemy entered the city he asked 
 yes sire and moscow is now in ashes i left it all in flames replied michaud in a decided tone but glancing at the emperor he was frightened by what he had done 
 the emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly his lower lip trembled and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes 
 but this lasted only a moment he suddenly frowned as if blaming himself for his weakness and raising his head addressed michaud in a firm voice 
 i see colonel from all that is happening that providence requires great sacrifices of us i am ready to submit myself in all things to his will but tell me michaud how did you leave the army when it saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle did you not notice discouragement 
 seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more michaud also grew calm but was not immediately ready to reply to the direct and relevant question which required a direct answer 
 sire will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier he asked to gain time 
 colonel i always require it replied the emperor conceal nothing from me i wish to know absolutely how things are 
 sire said michaud with a subtle scarcely perceptible smile on his lips having now prepared a reply sire i left the whole army from its chiefs to the lowest soldier without exception in desperate and agonized terror 
 how is that the emperor interrupted him frowning sternly would misfortune make my russians lose heart never 
 michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had prepared 
 sire he said with respectful playfulness they are only afraid lest your majesty in the goodness of your heart should allow yourself to be persuaded to make peace they are burning for the combat declared this representative of the russian nation and to prove to your majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are 
 ah said the emperor reassured and with a kindly gleam in his eyes he patted michaud on the shoulder you set me at ease colonel 
 he bent his head and was silent for some time 
 well then go back to the army he said drawing himself up to his full height and addressing michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that when i have not a soldier left i shall put myself at the head of my beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of my empire it still offers me more than my enemies suppose said the emperor growing more and more animated but should it ever be ordained by divine providence he continued raising to heaven his fine eyes shining with emotion that my dynasty should cease to reign on the throne of my ancestors then after exhausting all the means at my command i shall let my beard grow to here he pointed halfway down his chest and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants rather than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose sacrifices i know how to appreciate 
 having uttered these words in an agitated voice the emperor suddenly turned away as if to hide from michaud the tears that rose to his eyes and went to the further end of his study having stood there a few moments he strode back to michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow with a vigorous movement the mild and handsome face was flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger 
 colonel michaud do not forget what i say to you here perhaps we may recall it with pleasure someday napoleon or i said the emperor touching his breast we can no longer both reign together i have learned to know him and he will not deceive me any more 
 and the emperor paused with a frown 
 when he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in the eyes michaud quoique etranger russe de coeur et at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard as he used afterwards to say and gave expression to his own feelings and those of the russian people whose representative he considered himself to be in the following words 
 sire said he your majesty is at this moment signing the glory of the nation and the salvation of europe 
 with an inclination of the head the emperor dismissed him

 jean valjean 
 that same day towards four in the afternoon jean valjean was sitting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary slopes in the either from prudence or from a desire to meditate or simply in consequence of one of those insensible changes of habit which gradually introduce themselves into the existence of every one he now rarely went out with cosette he had on his waistcoat and trousers of gray linen and his cap concealed his countenance 
 he was calm and happy now beside cosette that which had for a time alarmed and troubled him had been dissipated but for the last week or two anxieties of another nature had come up 
 one day while walking on the boulevard he had caught sight of thenardier thanks to his disguise thenardier had not recognized him but since that day jean valjean had seen him repeatedly and he was now certain that thenardier was prowling about in their neighborhood 
 this had been sufficient to make him come to a decision 
 moreover paris was not tranquil 
 political troubles presented this inconvenient feature for any one who had anything to conceal in his life that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious and that while seeking to ferret out a man like pepin or morey they might very readily discover a man like jean valjean 
 jean valjean had made up his mind to quit paris and even france and go over to england 
 he had warned cosette 
 he wished to set out before the end of the week 
 he had seated himself on the slope in the turning over all sorts of thoughts in his the police the journey and the difficulty of procuring a passport 
 he was troubled from all these points of view 
 last of all an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his attention and from which he had not yet recovered had added to his state of alarm 
 on the morning of that very day when he alone of the household was stirring while strolling in the garden before shutters were open he had suddenly perceived on the wall the following line engraved probably with a nail 
 rue de la verrerie 
 this was perfectly fresh the grooves in the ancient black mortar were white a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with the fine fresh plaster 
 this had probably been written on the preceding night 
 what was this 
 a signal for others 
 a warning for himself 
 in any case it was evident that the garden had been violated and that strangers had made their way into it 
 he recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household 
 his mind was now filling in this canvas 
 he took good care not to speak to cosette of the line written on the wall for fear of alarming her 
 in the midst of his preoccupations he perceived from a shadow cast by the sun that some one had halted on the crest of the slope immediately behind him 
 he was on the point of turning round when a paper folded in four fell upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head 
 he took the paper unfolded it and read these words written in large characters with a pencil 
 move away from your house 
 jean valjean sprang hastily to his feet there was no one on the slope he gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a child not so large as a man clad in a gray blouse and trousers of cotton velvet who was jumping over the parapet and who slipped into the moat of the 
 jean valjean returned home at once in a very thoughtful mood

 chapter iv 
 
 it is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that when half russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were ficeing to distant provinces and one levy after another was being raised for the defense of the fatherland all russians from the greatest to the least were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves saving their fatherland or weeping over its downfall the tales and descriptions of that time without exception speak only of the patriotic devotion despair grief and the heroism of the russians but it was not really so it appears so to us because we see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests that people had yet in reality those personal interests of the moment so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt or even noticed most of the people at that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were guided only by their private interests and they were the very people whose activities at that period were most useful 
 those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take part in it by and heroism were the most useless members of society they saw everything upside down and all they did for the common good turned out to be useless and foolish like and regiments which looted russian villages and the lint the young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded and so on even those fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings who discussed position at the time involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty of in historic events the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is specially applicable only unconscious action bears fruit and he who plays a part in an historic event never understands its significance if he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless 
 the more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in russia the less did he realize their significance in petersburg and in the provinces at a distance from moscow ladies and gentlemen in militia uniforms wept for russia and its ancient capital and talked of and so on but in the army which retired beyond moscow there was little talk or thought of moscow and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the french but they thought about their next pay their next quarters of matreshka the vivandiere and like matters 
 as the war had caught him in the service nicholas rostov took a close and prolonged part in the defense of his country but did so casually without any aim at and he therefore looked at what was going on in russia without despair and without dismally racking his brains over it had he been asked what he thought of the state of russia he would have said that it was not his business to think about it that kutuzov and others were there for that purpose but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple of years time 
 as he looked at the matter in this way he learned that he was being sent to voronezh to buy remounts for his division not only without regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle but with the greatest pleasure which he did not conceal and which his comrades fully understood 
 a few days before the battle of borodino nicholas received the necessary money and warrants and having sent some hussars on in advance he set out with post horses for voronezh 
 only a man who has experienced it that is has passed some months continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war can understand the delight nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the foraging operations provision trains and hospitals when free from soldiers wagons and the filthy traces of a camp he saw villages with peasants and peasant women country houses fields where cattle were grazing posthouses with stationmasters asleep in them he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time what for a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women young and healthy without a dozen officers making up to each of them women too who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke with them 
 in the highest spirits nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in voronezh ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp and next day very and in a uniform he had not worn for a long time went to present himself to the authorities 
 the commander of the militia was a civilian general an old man who was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank he received nicholas brusquely imagining this to be characteristically military and questioned him with an important air as if considering the general progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do so nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him 
 from the commander of the militia he drove to the governor the governor was a brisk little man very simple and affable he indicated the stud farms at which nicholas might procure horses recommended to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had the best horses and promised to assist him in every way 
 you are count ilya son my wife was a great friend of your we are at home on thursdays today is thursday so please come and see us quite informally said the governor taking leave of him 
 immediately on leaving the nicholas hired post horses and taking his squadron quartermaster with him drove at a gallop to the landowner fourteen miles away who had the stud everything seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in voronezh and as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind everything went well and easily 
 the landowner to whom nicholas went was a bachelor an old cavalryman a horse fancier a sportsman the possessor of some brandy and some old hungarian wine who had a snuggery where he smoked and who owned some splendid horses 
 in very few words nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six thousand rubles to serve as he said as samples of his remounts after dining and taking rather too much of the hungarian wine nicholas having exchanged kisses with the landowner with whom he was already on the friendliest terms galloped back over abominable roads in the brightest frame of mind continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for the party 
 when he had changed poured water over his head and scented himself nicholas arrived at the rather late but with the phrase better late than never on his lips 
 it was not a ball nor had dancing been announced but everyone knew that catherine petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the clavichord and that there would be dancing and so everyone had come as to a ball 
 provincial life in went on very much as usual but with this difference that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the arrival of many wealthy families from moscow and as in everything that went on in russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable an in for a penny in for a pound who cares spirit and the inevitable small talk instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances now turned on moscow the army and napoleon 
 the society gathered together at the was the best in voronezh 
 there were a great many ladies and some of nicholas moscow acquaintances but there were no men who could at all vie with the cavalier of st george the hussar remount officer the and count rostov among the men was an italian prisoner an officer of the french army and nicholas felt that the presence of that prisoner enhanced his own importance as a russian hero the italian was as it were a war trophy nicholas felt this it seemed to him that everyone regarded the italian in the same light and he treated him cordially though with dignity and restraint 
 as soon as nicholas entered in his hussar uniform diffusing around him a fragrance of perfume and wine and had uttered the words better late than never and heard them repeated several times by others people clustered around him all eyes turned on him and he felt at once that he had entered into his proper position in the province that of a universal favorite a very pleasant position and intoxicatingly so after his long privations at posting stations at inns and in the snuggery maidservants had been flattered by his notice and here too at the party there were as it seemed to nicholas an inexhaustible number of pretty young women married and unmarried impatiently awaiting his notice the women and girls flirted with him and from the first day the people concerned themselves to get this fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down among these was the wife herself who welcomed rostov as a near relative and called him nicholas 
 catherine petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise and dancing began in which nicholas still further captivated the provincial society by his agility his particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them all nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that evening he had never danced like that in moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad form but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something unusual something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces 
 all the evening nicholas paid attention to a plump and pleasing little blonde the wife of one of the provincial officials with the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other wives were created for them rostov did not leave the side and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style as if without speaking of it they knew how capitally nicholas and the lady would get on together the husband however did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with rostov but the naivete was so boundless that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to nicholas good humor toward the end of the evening however as the face grew more flushed and animated the became more and more melancholy and solemn as though there were but a given amount of animation between them and as the share increased the diminished

 marius 
 marius had left m gillenormand in despair 
 he had entered the house with very little hope and quitted it with immense despair 
 however and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will understand this the officer the lancer the ninny cousin theodule had left no trace in his mind 
 not the slightest the dramatic poet might apparently expect some complications from this revelation made by the grandfather to the grandson but what the drama would gain thereby truth would lose marius was at an age when one believes nothing in the line of evil later on comes the age when one believes everything 
 suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles 
 early youth has none of them that which overwhelmed othello glides innocuous over candide suspect cosette 
 there are hosts of crimes which marius could sooner have committed 
 he began to wander about the streets the resource of those who suffer he thought of nothing so far as he could afterwards remember at two in the morning he returned to quarters and flung himself without undressing on his mattress 
 the sun was shining brightly when he sank into that frightful leaden slumber which permits ideas to go and come in the brain 
 when he awoke he saw courfeyrac enjolras feuilly and combeferre standing in the room with their hats on and all ready to go out 
 courfeyrac said to him 
 are you coming to general funeral 
 it seemed to him that courfeyrac was speaking chinese 
 he went out some time after them 
 he put in his pocket the pistols which javert had given him at the time of the adventure on the d of february and which had remained in his hands 
 these pistols were still loaded 
 it would be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his mind when he took them with him 
 all day long he prowled about without knowing where he was going it rained at times he did not perceive it for his dinner he purchased a penny roll at a put it in his pocket and forgot it it appears that he took a bath in the seine without being aware of it there are moments when a man has a furnace within his skull marius was passing through one of those moments 
 he no longer hoped for anything this step he had taken since the preceding evening he waited for night with feverish impatience he had but one idea clearly before his was that at nine he should see cosette 
 this last happiness now constituted his whole future after that gloom 
 at intervals as he roamed through the most deserted boulevards it seemed to him that he heard strange noises in paris he thrust his head out of his revery and said 
 is there fighting on hand 
 at nightfall at nine precisely as he had promised cosette he was in the rue plumet 
 when he approached the grating he forgot everything 
 it was hours since he had seen cosette he was about to behold her once more every other thought was effaced and he felt only a profound and joy 
 those minutes in which one lives centuries always have this sovereign and wonderful property that at the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely 
 marius displaced the bar and rushed headlong into the garden cosette was not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him he traversed the thicket and approached the recess near the flight of steps 
 she is waiting for me there said he 
 cosette was not there 
 he raised his eyes and saw that the shutters of the house were closed 
 he made the tour of the garden the garden was deserted then he returned to the house and rendered senseless by love intoxicated terrified exasperated with grief and uneasiness like a master who returns home at an evil hour he tapped on the shutters 
 he knocked and knocked again at the risk of seeing the window open and her gloomy face make its appearance and demand 
 what do you want 
 this was nothing in comparison with what he dimly caught a glimpse of 
 when he had rapped he lifted up his voice and called he cried cosette he repeated imperiously 
 there was no reply 
 all was over no one in the garden no one in the house 
 marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house which was as black and as silent as a tomb and far more empty 
 he gazed at the stone seat on which he had passed so many adorable hours with cosette then he seated himself on the flight of steps his heart filled with sweetness and resolution he blessed his love in the depths of his thought and he said to himself that since cosette was gone all that there was left for him was to die 
 all at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street and which was calling to him through the trees 
 mr marius 
 he started to his feet 
 hey said he 
 mr marius are you there 
 yes 
 mr marius went on the voice your friends are waiting for you at the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie 
 this voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him 
 it resembled the hoarse rough voice of eponine 
 marius hastened to the gate thrust aside the movable bar passed his head through the aperture and saw some one who appeared to him to be a young man disappearing at a run into the gloom

 chapter v 
 
 nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair bending closely over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a smile that never left his face jauntily shifting the position of his legs in their tight riding breeches diffusing an odor of perfume and admiring his partner himself and the fine outlines of his legs in their hessian boots nicholas told the blonde lady that he wished to run away with a certain lady here in voronezh 
 which lady 
 a charming lady a divine one her eyes nicholas looked at his partner are blue her mouth coral and ivory her figure he glanced at her shoulders like 
 the husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking about 
 ah nikita ivanych cried nicholas rising politely and as if wishing nikita ivanych to share his joke he began to tell him of his intention to elope with a blonde lady 
 the husband smiled gloomily the wife gaily the wife came up with a look of disapproval 
 anna ignatyevna wants to see you nicholas said she pronouncing the name so that nicholas at once understood that anna ignatyevna was a very important person come nicholas you know you let me call you so 
 oh yes aunt who is she 
 anna ignatyevna malvintseva she has heard from her niece how you rescued her can you guess 
 i rescued such a lot of them said nicholas 
 her niece princess bolkonskaya she is here in voronezh with her aunt oho how you blush why are 
 not a bit please aunt 
 very well very well oh what a fellow you are 
 the wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a blue headdress who had just finished her game of cards with the most important personages of the town this was malvintseva princess aunt on her side a rich childless widow who always lived in voronezh when rostov approached her she was standing settling up for the game she looked at him and screwing up her eyes sternly continued to upbraid the general who had won from her 
 very pleased mon cher she then said holding out her hand to nicholas pray come and see me 
 after a few words about princess mary and her late father whom malvintseva had evidently not liked and having asked what nicholas knew of prince andrew who also was evidently no favorite of hers the important old lady dismissed nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see her 
 nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed at the mention of princess mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear which he himself did not understand 
 when he had parted from malvintseva nicholas wished to return to the dancing but the little wife placed her plump hand on his sleeve and saying that she wanted to have a talk with him led him to her sitting room from which those who were there immediately withdrew so as not to be in her way 
 do you know dear boy began the wife with a serious expression on her kind little face that really would be the match for you would you like me to arrange it 
 whom do you mean aunt asked nicholas 
 i will make a match for you with the princess catherine petrovna speaks of lily but i say no the princess do you want me to do it i am sure your mother will be grateful to me what a charming girl she is really and she is not at all so plain either 
 not at all replied nicholas as if offended at the idea as befits a soldier aunt i force myself on anyone or refuse anything he said before he had time to consider what he was saying 
 well then remember this is not a joke 
 of course not 
 yes yes the wife said as if talking to herself but my dear boy among other things you are too attentive to the other the blonde one is sorry for the husband really 
 oh no we are good friends with him said nicholas in the simplicity of his heart it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else 
 but what nonsense i have been saying to the wife thought nicholas suddenly at supper she will really begin to arrange a match and soyna and on taking leave of the wife when she again smilingly said to him well then remember he drew her aside 
 but see here to tell the truth aunt 
 what is it my dear come sit down here said she 
 nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate thoughts which he would not have told to his mother his sister or his friend to this woman who was almost a stranger when he afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which had very important results for him it seemed to him as it seems to everyone in such cases that it was merely some silly whim that seized him yet that burst of frankness together with other trifling events had immense consequences for him and for all his family 
 you see aunt mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress but the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me 
 oh yes i understand said the wife 
 but princess bolkonskaya another matter i will tell you the truth in the first place i like her very much i feel drawn to her and then after i met her under such circumstances so strangely the idea often occurred to me this is fate especially if you remember that mamma had long been thinking of it but i had never happened to meet her before somehow it had always happened that we did not meet and as long as my sister natasha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of marrying her and it must needs happen that i should meet her just when engagement had been broken off and then everything so you see i never told this to anyone and never will only to you 
 the wife pressed his elbow gratefully 
 you know sonya my cousin i love her and promised to marry her and will do so so you see there can be no question about said nicholas incoherently and blushing 
 my dear boy what a way to look at it you know sonya has nothing and you yourself say your affairs are in a very bad way and what about your mother it would kill her one thing and what sort of life would it be for sonya if a girl with a heart your mother in despair and you all ruined no my dear you and sonya ought to understand that 
 nicholas remained silent it comforted him to hear these arguments 
 all the same aunt it is impossible he rejoined with a sigh after a short pause besides would the princess have me and besides she is now in mourning how can one think of it 
 but you suppose going to get you married at once there is always a right way of doing things replied the wife 
 what a matchmaker you are aunt said nicholas kissing her plump little hand

 m mabeuf 
 jean purse was of no use to m mabeuf 
 m mabeuf in his venerable infantile austerity had not accepted the gift of the stars he had not admitted that a star could coin itself into louis he had not divined that what had fallen from heaven had come from gavroche 
 he had taken the purse to the police commissioner of the quarter as a lost article placed by the finder at the disposal of claimants 
 the purse was actually lost it is unnecessary to say that no one claimed it and that it did not succor m mabeuf 
 moreover m mabeuf had continued his downward course 
 his experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the jardin des plantes than in his garden at austerlitz 
 the year before he had owed his wages now as we have seen he owed three quarters of his rent 
 the pawnshop had sold the plates of his flora after the expiration of thirteen months some coppersmith had made stewpans of them 
 his copper plates gone and being unable to complete even the incomplete copies of his flora which were in his possession he had disposed of the text at a miserable price as waste paper to a bookseller nothing now remained to him of his work 
 he set to work to eat up the money for these copies 
 when he saw that this wretched resource was becoming exhausted he gave up his garden and allowed it to run to waste 
 before this a long time before he had given up his two eggs and the morsel of beef which he ate from time to time 
 he dined on bread and potatoes 
 he had sold the last of his furniture then all duplicates of his bedding his clothing and his blankets then his herbariums and prints but he still retained his most precious books many of which were of the greatest rarity among others les quadrins historiques de la bible edition of la concordance des bibles by pierre de besse les marguerites de la marguerite of jean de la haye with a dedication to the queen of navarre the book de la charge et dignite de by the sieur de villiers hotman a florilegium rabbinicum of a tibullus of with this magnificent inscription 
 venetiis in aedibus manutianis and lastly a diogenes laertius printed at lyons in which contained the famous variant of the manuscript thirteenth century of the vatican and those of the two manuscripts of venice and consulted with such fruitful results by henri estienne and all the passages in doric dialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfth century belonging to the naples library 
 m mabeuf never had any fire in his chamber and went to bed at sundown in order not to consume any candles it seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors 
 people avoided him when he went out he perceived the fact 
 the wretchedness of a child interests a mother the wretchedness of a young man interests a young girl the wretchedness of an old man interests no one it is of all distresses the coldest 
 still father mabeuf had not entirely lost his childlike serenity 
 his eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested on his books and he smiled when he gazed at the diogenes laertius which was a unique copy 
 his bookcase with glass doors was the only piece of furniture which he had kept beyond what was strictly indispensable 
 one day mother plutarque said to him 
 i have no money to buy any dinner 
 what she called dinner was a loaf of bread and four or five potatoes 
 on credit suggested m mabeuf 
 you know well that people refuse me 
 m mabeuf opened his bookcase took a long look at all his books one after another as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze upon them before making a choice then seized one hastily put it in under his arm and went out 
 he returned two hours later without anything under his arm laid thirty sous on the table and said 
 you will get something for dinner 
 from that moment forth mother plutarque saw a sombre veil which was never more lifted descend over the old candid face 
 on the following day on the day after and on the day after that it had to be done again 
 m mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin as the dealers perceived that he was forced to sell they purchased of him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty francs sometimes at those very shops 
 volume by volume the whole library went the same road 
 he said at times 
 but i am eighty as though he cherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end of his days before reaching the end of his books his melancholy increased 
 once however he had a pleasure he had gone out with a robert estienne which he had sold for sous under the quai malaquais and he returned with an aldus which he had bought for forty sous in the rue des owe five sous he said beaming on mother plutarque 
 that day he had no dinner 
 he belonged to the horticultural society 
 his destitution became known there 
 the president of the society came to see him promised to speak to the minister of agriculture and commerce about him and did what exclaimed the minister i should think so 
 an old savant a botanist an inoffensive man something must be done for him 
 on the following day m mabeuf received an invitation to dine with the minister 
 trembling with joy he showed the letter to mother plutarque 
 we are saved said he on the day appointed he went to the house 
 he perceived that his ragged cravat his long square coat and his waxed shoes astonished the ushers 
 no one spoke to him not even the minister about ten in the evening while he was still waiting for a word he heard the wife a beautiful woman in a gown whom he had not ventured to approach inquire who is that old gentleman 
 he returned home on foot at midnight in a driving he had sold an elzevir to pay for a carriage in which to go thither 
 he had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his diogenes laertius every night before he went to bed 
 he knew enough greek to enjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned he had now no other enjoyment 
 several weeks passed 
 all at once mother plutarque fell ill 
 there is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy bread at the and that is having no money to purchase drugs at the one evening the doctor had ordered a very expensive potion 
 and the malady was growing worse a nurse was required 
 m mabeuf opened his bookcase there was nothing there 
 the last volume had taken its departure all that was left to him was diogenes laertius 
 he put this unique copy under his arm and went out 
 it was the th of june he went to the porte to successor and returned with one hundred francs 
 he laid the pile of pieces on the old nightstand and returned to his chamber without saying a word 
 on the following morning at dawn he seated himself on the overturned post in his garden and he could be seen over the top of the hedge sitting the whole morning motionless with drooping head his eyes vaguely fixed on the withered it rained at intervals the old man did not seem to perceive the fact 
 in the afternoon extraordinary noises broke out in paris they resembled shots and the clamors of a multitude 
 father mabeuf raised his head 
 he saw a gardener passing and inquired 
 what is it 
 the gardener spade on back replied in the most unconcerned tone 
 it is the riots 
 what riots 
 yes they are fighting 
 why are they fighting 
 ah good heavens ejaculated the gardener 
 in what direction went on m mabeuf 
 in the neighborhood of the arsenal 
 father mabeuf went to his room took his hat mechanically sought for a book to place under his arm found none said 
 ah truly and went off with a bewildered air

 on reaching moscow after her meeting with rostov princess mary had found her nephew there with his tutor and a letter from prince andrew giving her instructions how to get to her aunt malvintseva at voronezh that feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her illness since his death and especially since her meeting with rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey anxiety about her brother settling in a new house meeting new people and attending to her education she was sad now after a month passed in quiet surroundings she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which was associated in her mind with the ruin of russia she was agitated and incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother the only intimate person now remaining to her was exposed she was worried too about her education for which she had always felt herself incompetent but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace a peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were related to her meeting with rostov 
 the day after her party the wife came to see malvintseva and after discussing her plan with the aunt remarked that though under present circumstances a formal betrothal was of course not to be thought of all the same the young people might be brought together and could get to know one another malvintseva expressed approval and the wife began to speak of rostov in presence praising him and telling how he had blushed when princess name was mentioned but princess mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful feeling her mental tranquillity was destroyed and desires doubts and hopes reawoke 
 during the two days that elapsed before rostov called princess mary continually thought of how she ought to behave to him first she decided not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt that it would not be proper for her in her deep mourning to receive visitors then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her then it occurred to her that her aunt and the wife had intentions concerning herself and rostov their looks and words at times seemed to confirm this supposition then she told herself that only she with her sinful nature could think this of them they could not forget that situated as she was while still wearing deep mourning such matchmaking would be an insult to her and to her memory assuming that she did go down to see him princess mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she would say to him and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold and then to mean too much more than anything she feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she saw him 
 but when on sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing room that count rostov had called the princess showed no confusion only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new and radiant light 
 you have met him aunt said she in a calm voice unable herself to understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural 
 when rostov entered the room the princess dropped her eyes for an instant as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt and then just as nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with shining eyes with a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose with a smile of pleasure held out her slender delicate hand to him and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep womanly notes vibrated mademoiselle bourienne who was in the drawing room looked at princess mary in bewildered surprise herself a consummate coquette she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a man she wished to attract 
 either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly improved without my having noticed it and above all what tact and grace thought mademoiselle bourienne 
 had princess mary been capable of reflection at that moment she would have been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne at the change that had taken place in herself from the moment she recognized that dear loved face a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will from the time rostov entered her face became suddenly transformed it was as if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate skillful artistic work on its sides that previously seemed dark coarse and meaningless was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty for the first time all that pure spiritual inward travail through which she had lived appeared on the surface all her inward labor her dissatisfaction with herself her sufferings her strivings after goodness her meekness love and all this now shone in those radiant eyes in her delicate smile and in every trait of her gentle face 
 rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life he felt that the being before him was quite different from and better than anyone he had met before and above all better than himself 
 their conversation was very simple and unimportant they spoke of the war and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about it they spoke of their last meeting nicholas trying to change the subject they talked of the kind wife of nicholas relations and of princess 
 she did not talk about her brother diverting the conversation as soon as her aunt mentioned andrew evidently she could speak of misfortunes with a certain artificiality but her brother was too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him nicholas noticed this as he noticed every shade of princess character with an observation unusual to him and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the princess as she did when he was mentioned and even when he thought of her but in her presence he felt quite at ease and said not at all what he had prepared but what quite appropriately occurred to him at the moment 
 when a pause occurred during his short visit nicholas as is usual when there are children turned to prince little son caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar he took the boy on his knee played with him and looked round at princess mary with a softened happy timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved nicholas also noticed that look and as if understanding it flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness 
 as she was in mourning princess mary did not go out into society and nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again but all the same the wife went on with her matchmaking passing on to nicholas the flattering things princess mary said of him and vice versa and insisting on his declaring himself to princess mary for this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the house before mass 
 though rostov told the wife that he would not make any declaration to princess mary he promised to go 
 as at tilsit rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody considered right was right so now after a short but sincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice and in obedient submission to circumstances he chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where he knew that after his promise to sonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to princess mary and he knew that he would never act basely but he also knew or rather felt at the bottom of his heart that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were guiding him he was not only doing nothing wrong but was doing something very important more important than anything he had ever done in his life 
 after meeting princess mary though the course of his life went on externally as before all his former amusements lost their charm for him and he often thought about her but he never thought about her as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met in society nor as he had for a long time and at one time rapturously thought about sonya he had pictured each of those young ladies as almost all young men do that is as a possible wife adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life a white dressing gown his wife at the tea table his carriage little ones mamma and papa their relations to her and so on and these pictures of the future had given him pleasure but with princess mary to whom they were trying to get him engaged he could never picture anything of future married life if he tried his pictures seemed incongruous and false it made him afraid

 of seeming wise 
 it hath been an opinion that the french are wiser than they seem 
 and the spaniards seem wiser than they are but howsoever it be between nations certainly it is so between man and man for as the apostle saith of godliness having a show of godliness but denying the power thereof so certainly there are in points of wisdom and sufficiency that do nothing or little very solemnly magno conatu nugas 
 it is a ridiculous thing and fit for a satire to persons of judgement to see what shifts these formalists have and what prospectives to make superficies to seem body that hath depth and bulk some are so close and reserved as they will not show their wares but by a dark light and seem always to keep back somewhat and when they know within themselves they speak of that they do not well know would nevertheless seem to others to know of that which they may not well speak 
 some help themselves with countenance and gesture and are wise by signs as cicero saith of piso that when he answered him he fetched one of his brows up to his forehead and bent the other down to his chin ad fronton sublato altero ad mention depresso supercilio cnudelitatem tibi non placere 
 some think to bear it by speaking a great word and being peremptory and go on and take by admittance that which they cannot make good some whatsoever is beyond their recall will seem to despise or make light of it as impertinent or curious and so would have their ignorance seem judgement some are never without a difference and commonly by amusing men with a 
 subtlety blanch the matter of whom a gellius saith hominem delirum qui verborum minutiis rerum frangit pondera of which kind also plato in his protagoras bringeth in prodicus in scorn and maketh him make a speech that consisted of distinctions from the beginning to the end generally such men in all deliberations find ease to be of the negative side and affect a credit to object and foretell difficulties for when propositions are denied there is an end of them but if they be allowed it requireth a new work which false point of wisdom is the bane of business 
 to conclude there is no decaying merchant or inward beggar hath so many tricks to uphold the credit of their wealth as these empty persons have to maintain the credit of their sufficiency seeming wise men may make shift to get opinion but let no man choose them for employment for certainly you were better take for business a man somewhat absurd than over formal

 chapter xi 
 
 what he does 
 jean valjean listened 
 not a sound 
 he gave the door a push 
 he pushed it gently with the tip of his finger lightly with the furtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering 
 the door yielded to this pressure and made an imperceptible and silent movement which enlarged the opening a little 
 he waited a moment then gave the door a second and a bolder push 
 it continued to yield in silence 
 the opening was now large enough to allow him to pass 
 but near the door there stood a little table which formed an embarrassing angle with it and barred the entrance 
 jean valjean recognized the difficulty 
 it was necessary at any cost to enlarge the aperture still further 
 he decided on his course of action and gave the door a third push more energetic than the two preceding 
 this time a badly oiled hinge suddenly emitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry 
 jean valjean shuddered 
 the noise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the day of judgment 
 in the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined that that hinge had just become animated and had suddenly assumed a terrible life and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one and warn and to wake those who were asleep 
 he halted shuddering bewildered and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels he heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers and it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern 
 it seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the entire household like the shock of an earthquake the door pushed by him had taken the alarm and had shouted the old man would rise at once the two old women would shriek out people would come to their assistance in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an uproar and the gendarmerie on hand for a moment he thought himself lost 
 he remained where he was petrified like the statue of salt not daring to make a movement 
 several minutes elapsed 
 the door had fallen wide open 
 he ventured to peep into the next room nothing had stirred there 
 he lent an ear 
 nothing was moving in the house 
 the noise made by the rusty hinge had not awakened any one 
 this first danger was past but there still reigned a frightful tumult within him 
 nevertheless he did not retreat 
 even when he had thought himself lost he had not drawn back 
 his only thought now was to finish as soon as possible 
 he took a step and entered the room 
 this room was in a state of perfect calm 
 here and there vague and confused forms were distinguishable which in the daylight were papers scattered on a table open folios volumes piled upon a stool an heaped with clothing a and which at that hour were only shadowy corners and whitish spots 
 jean valjean advanced with precaution taking care not to knock against the furniture he could hear at the extremity of the room the even and tranquil breathing of the sleeping bishop 
 he suddenly came to a halt 
 he was near the bed 
 he had arrived there sooner than he had thought for 
 nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our actions with sombre and intelligent appropriateness as though she desired to make us reflect 
 for the last a large cloud had covered the heavens 
 at the moment when jean valjean paused in front of the bed this cloud parted as though on purpose and a ray of light traversing the long window suddenly illuminated the pale face 
 he was sleeping peacefully 
 he lay in his bed almost completely dressed on account of the cold of the in a garment of brown wool which covered his arms to the wrists 
 his head was thrown back on the pillow in the careless attitude of repose his hand adorned with the pastoral ring and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy actions was hanging over the edge of the bed 
 his whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction of hope and of felicity it was more than a smile and almost a radiance 
 he bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible the soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven 
 a reflection of that heaven rested on the bishop 
 it was at the same time a luminous transparency for that heaven was within him 
 that heaven was his conscience 
 at the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself so to speak upon that inward radiance the sleeping bishop seemed as in a glory it remained however gentle and veiled in an ineffable that moon in the sky that slumbering nature that garden without a quiver that house which was so calm the hour the moment the silence added some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white hair those closed eyes that face in which all was hope and all was confidence that head of an old man and that slumber of an infant 
 there was something almost divine in this man who was thus august without being himself aware of it 
 jean valjean was in the shadow and stood motionless with his iron candlestick in his hand frightened by this luminous old man never had he beheld anything like this 
 this confidence terrified him the moral world has no grander spectacle than this 
 a troubled and uneasy conscience which has arrived on the brink of an evil action contemplating the slumber of the just 
 that slumber in that isolation and with a neighbor like himself had about it something sublime of which he was vaguely but imperiously conscious 
 no one could have told what was passing within him not even himself in order to attempt to form an idea of it it is necessary to think of the most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle even on his visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything with certainty 
 it was a sort of haggard astonishment he gazed at it and that was all 
 but what was his thought it would have been impossible to divine it 
 what was evident was that he was touched and astounded 
 but what was the nature of this emotion 
 his eye never quitted the old man 
 the only thing which was clearly to be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision one would have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses the one in which one loses self and that in which one saves self 
 he seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that hand 
 at the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards his brow and he took off his cap then his arm fell back with the same deliberation and jean valjean fell to meditating once more his cap in his left hand his club in his right hand his hair bristling all over his savage head 
 the bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying gaze 
 the gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them with a benediction for one and pardon for the other 
 suddenly jean valjean replaced his cap on his brow then stepped rapidly past the bed without glancing at the bishop straight to the cupboard which he saw near the head he raised his iron candlestick as though to force the lock the key was there he opened it the first thing which presented itself to him was the basket of silverware he seized it traversed the chamber with long strides without taking any precautions and without troubling himself about the noise gained the door the oratory opened the window seized his cudgel bestrode the of the put the silver into his knapsack threw away the basket crossed the garden leaped over the wall like a tiger and fled

 the empire strikes back 
 xii 
 
 chewbacca thought he was going mad 
 the prison cell was flooded with hot blinding light that seared his sensitivewookiee eyes not even his huge hands and hairy arms thrust up over his entirely protect him from the glare and to add to his misery a blared into the cubicle tormenting his keen sense of hearing he roared inagony but his guttural roars were drowned out by the piercing screeching noise 
 the wookiee paced back and forth within the confines of the cell moaningpitifully he pounded at the thick walls in desperation wanting someone anyone tocome and free him while he pounded the whistle that had nearly exploded hiseardrums suddenly stopped and the deluge of light flickered and went out 
 chewbacca staggered back a step with the sudden absence of torture and thenmoved to one of the cell walls to try to detect whether anyone was approaching torelease him but the thick walls revealed nothing and maddened to a slammed a giant fist against the wall 
 but the wall stood undamaged and as impenetrable as before and chewbaccarealized it would take more than wookiee brute strength to topple it 
 despairing of his chances of breaking through the cell to freedom chewbaccashuffled toward the bed where the box of po parts had been placed 
 idly at first and then with more interest the wookiee began poking through thebox it dawned jointed droid not only would doing so pass the time but it mightbe helpful to have threepio back in working condition 
 he picked up the golden head and gazed into its darkened eyes he held thehead and barked a few soliloquizing words as if to prepare the robot for the joy into for the disappointment of possible failure toreconstruct him properly 
 then quite delicately for a creature of his size and strength the giant wookieeplaced the staring head atop the bronzed torso tentatively he began experimentingwith tangle of wires and circuits his mechanical skills had previouslyonly been tested in repairs on the millennium falcon so he at all certain hecould complete the delicate task chewbacca juggled and fiddled with the by this intricate mechanism when suddenly eyes lit up 
 a whine came from inside the robot it sounded vaguely like voice but was so low and so slow that the words were unintelligible 
 
 bewildered chewbacca scratched his furry head and studied the broken robotintently an idea came to him and he tried switching one wire to another threepio began speaking in his normal voice what he had to say soundedlike words from a bad dream 
 chewbacca the head of cried watch out there are imperialstormtroopers hidden in he paused as if reliving the whole traumatic then he cried oh no been shot 
 chewbacca shook his head in sympathy all he could do at this point was try toput the rest of back together again 
 quite possibly it was the first time han solo had ever screamed never had heendured such excruciating torment he was strapped to a platform that angled awayfrom the floor at approximately degrees while he was strapped currents of searing power shot through his body at short intervals each joltmore painfully powerful than the last he squirmed to free himself but his agonywas so severe that it was all he could do just to remain conscious 
 standing near the torture rack darth vader silently watched han neither pleased nor displeased he watched until he had seen enough andthen the dark lord turned his back on the writhing figure and left the cell the doorsliding behind him to muffle anguished screams 
 outside the torture chamber boba fett waited for lord vader with landocalrissian and the aide 
 with obvious disdain vader turned to fett bounty hunter vader addressedthe man in the silver helmet if you are waiting for your reward youwill wait until i have skywalker 
 the boba fett appeared unruffled by this news i am in no vader my concern is that captain solo not be damaged the reward fromjabba the hut is double if alive 
 his pain is considerable bounty hunter vader hissed but he will not beharmed 
 what about leia and the wookiee lando asked with some concern 
 you will find them well enough vader answered but he added withunmistakable finality they must never again leave this city 
 that was never a condition of our agreement calrissian argued nor wasgiving han to this bounty hunter 
 perhaps you think being treated unfairly vader said sarcastically 
 no lando said glancing at his aide 
 good vader continued adding a veiled threat it would be most unfortunateif i had to leave a permanent garrison here 
 bowing his head reverently lando calrissian waited until darth vader hadturned and swept into a waiting elevator with the bounty taking his aide with him the administrator of cloud city strode swiftly down corridor 
 this becoming worse all the time lando complained 
 maybe you should have tried to negotiate with him the aide suggested 
 lando looked at his aide grimly he was beginning to realize that the deal withdarth vader was giving nothing to him and beyond that it was bringing harm topeople he might have called friends finally he said low enough not to be heard byany of spies got a bad feeling about this 
 was at last beginning to feel something like his old self 
 the wookiee had been busily working on reconnecting the many wiresand internal circuits and just now was beginning to figure out how to attach the far he had reattached the head to the torso and had successfully completedconnecting an arm the rest of parts still lay on the table with wires andcircuits hanging out of the severed joints 
 but though the wookiee was diligently working to complete his task the goldendroid began to complain vociferously well not right he now i see 
 the patient wookiee barked and adjusted a wire in neck at last therobot could see again and he breathed a little mechanical sigh of relief there better 
 but it much better when he cast his newly activated sensor gaze towardwhere his chest should be he back my what have youdone backwards threepio sputtered you furball only anovergrown mophead like you would be stupid enough to put my head 
 the wookiee growled menacingly he had forgotten what a complainer thisdroid was and this cell was too small for him to listen to any more of that beforethreepio knew what was happening to him the wookiee lumbered over and pulled awire instantly the grumbling ceased and the room became quiet again 
 then there was a familiar scent nearing the cell 
 the wookiee sniffed the air and hurried to the door 
 the cell door buzzed open and a ragged exhausted han solo was shoved in bytwo imperial stormtroopers the troopers left and chewbacca quickly moved to hisfriend embracing him with relief face was pale with dark circles under hiseyes it seemed that he was on the verge of collapse and chewbacca barked hisconcern to his companion 
 no han said wearily all right all right 
 the door opened once again and princess leia was thrown into the cell by thestormtroopers she was still dressed in her elegant cloak but like han she lookedtired and disheveled 
 when the stormtroopers left and the door slid shut behind them chewbaccahelped leia over to han the two gazed at one another with great emotion thenreached out and tightly embraced after a moment they kissed tenderly 
 while han still held her luke weakly asked him why are they doing this understand what up to 
 han was as puzzled as she they had me howling on the scan grid but theynever asked me any question 
 then the door slid open again admitting lando and two of his cloud cityguards 
 get out of here lando han snarled if he had felt stronger he would haveleaped up to attack his traitorous friend 
 shut up a minute and listen lando snapped doing what i can to makethis easier for you 
 this ought to be good han remarked caustically 
 vader has agreed to turn leia and chewie over to me explained have to stay here but at least be safe 
 leia gasped what about han 
 lando looked solemnly at his friend i know you had a price on yourhead vader has given you to the bounty hunter 
 the princess quickly looked at han concern flooding her eyes 
 you know much about much han said to calrissian if you think want us dead before all this is over 
 he want you all lando said after someone called skywalker 
 the two prisoners caught their breath at the casual mention of that name 
 han seemed puzzled luke i get it 
 the mind was racing all the facts were beginning to fit togetherinto a terrible mosaic in the past vader had wanted leia because of her politicalimportance in the war between empire and rebel alliance now she was almostbeneath his notice useful only for one possible function 
 lord vader has set a trap for him lando added and 
 leia finished his statement the bait 
 all this just to get the kid han asked so important about him 
 ask me but on his way 
 coming here 
 lando calrissian nodded 
 you fixed us all pretty good han growled spitting his words at 
 as he snarled that last accusing word han strength returned in a put all of his might into a punch that sent lando reeling instantly the two formerfriends were engaged in a furious battle two guards movedcloser to the two grappling opponents and began striking at han with the butts of theirlaser rifles one powerful blow struck han on the chin and sent him flying acrossthe room blood streaming from his jaw 
 chewbacca began to growl savagely and started for the guards as they raisedtheir laser weapons lando shouted shoot 
 bruised and winded the administrator turned to han done what i can foryou he said sorry not better but got my own problems thenturning to leave the cell lando calrissian added already stuck my neck outfarther than i should 
 yeah han solo retorted regaining his composure a real hero 
 when lando had left with his guards leia and chewbacca helped han back tohis feet and led him to one of the bunks he eased his weary battered body onto thebunk and leia took a piece of her cloak and began gently dabbing at his off the oozing blood 
 as she did so she started to chuckle softly you certainly have a way withpeople she teased 
 head swiveled atop his barrellike body as his scanners perceivedthe void of the bespin system 
 the speeding had just entered the system and was swooping throughblack space like a great white bird 
 the r unit had a lot to communicate to his pilot his electronic thoughts weretumbling out one on top of the other and were translated on the cockpit scope 
 the luke quickly responded to the first of urgent luke replied sure threepio is with them 
 the little robot whistled an excited exclamation 
 just hold on luke said patiently be there soon 
 turning head perceived the regal clusters of stars his innards warm andcheerful as the continued like a celestial arrow toward a planet with a city inthe clouds 
 lando calrissian and darth vader stood near the hydraulic platform thatdominated the huge chamber the dark lord was quiet while aideshurried to prepare the room 
 the hydraulic platform was housed within a deep pit in the center of the chamberand was surrounded by countless steam pipes and enormous chemical tanks ofvarying shapes 
 standing guards with laser rifles clutched in their hands were four stormtroopers 
 darth vader turned to calrissian after appraising the chamber the facility iscrude he remarked but it should suit our needs 
 one of officers rushed to the sith side lord vader hereported ship class 
 good vader said coldly monitor progress and allow him toland have the chamber ready for him shortly 
 we only use this facility for the administrator of cloud citysaid nervously if you put him in there it might kill him 
 but vader had already considered that possibility he knew a way to find outjust how powerful this freezing unit was i wish the prize to bedamaged test it first he caught the attention of his in solo the dark lord commanded 
 lando quickly glanced at vader he been prepared for the pure evil thatwas manifested in this terrifying being 
 the speedily made its descent and began to pierce the dense cloudblanket enveloping the planet 
 luke checked his monitor screens with growing concern maybe artoo hadmore information than he was getting on his own panel he tapped out a question tothe robot 
 you picked up any patrol ships 
 reply was negative 
 and so luke thoroughly convinced that his arrival was thus far his ship onward toward the city of his troubled vision 
 six of the piglike ugnaughts frantically prepared the chamberfor use while lando calrissian and darth the true master of the hasty activity 
 as they scurried about the platform the ugnaughts lowered anetwork of some alien circulatory the raised the carbonite hoses and hammered them into place then the sixhumanoids lifted the heavy coffinlike container and set it securely onto the platform 
 boba fett rushed in leading a squad of six imperial stormtroopers thetroopers shoved and pulled han leia and the wookiee in front of them forcing themto hurry into the chamber strapped to the broad back was the partiallyreassembled whose unattached arm and legs were roughly bundledagainst his gilded torso the head facing the opposite direction frantically turned around to try to see where they were going and whatlay in store for them 
 vader turned to the bounty hunter put him in the chamber 
 what if he survive the calculating boba fett asked he is worth alot to me 
 the empire will compensate you for the loss vader said succinctly 
 anguished leia protested no 
 chewbacca threw back his maned head gave out a bellowing wookiee he charged directly at the line of stormtroopers guarding han 
 screaming in panic raised his one functioning arm to protect hisface 
 wait the robot yelled what are you doing 
 but the wookiee wrestled and grappled with the troopers undaunted by theirnumber or by frightened shrieks 
 oh hit me the droid begged trying to protect his disassembledparts with his arm no he mean it calm down you hairy fool 
 more stormtroopers had come into the room and joined the fight some of thetroopers began to club the wookiee with the butts of their rifles banging againstthreepio in the process 
 ouch the droid screamed i do anything 
 the stormtroopers had begun to overpower chewbacca and were about to smashhim in the face with their weapons when over the sounds of the fray han no stop it chewbacca 
 only han solo could deflect the maddened wookiee from his battle strainingagainst the hold of his guards han broke away from them and rushed over to breakup the fight 
 vader signaled his guards to let han go and signaled the battling stormtroopers tostop the fight 
 han gripped the massive forearms of his hairy friends to calm him down thengave him a stern look 
 the flustered threepio was still fussing and fuming oh yesstop with a robotic sigh of relief he said thank heavens 
 han and chewbacca faced each other the former looking grimly into his for a moment they embraced tightly then han told the wookiee save yourstrength for another time pal when the odds are better he mustered a reassuringwink but the wookiee was and barked a mournful wail 
 yeah han said trying his best to crack a grin i know i feel the same well han solo turned to one of the guards better chain him until 
 the subdued chewbacca did not resist as the stormtrooper placed restrainingbands around his wrists han gave his partner a final farewell hug then turned toprincess leia he took her in his arms and they embraced as if they would never letgo 
 then leia pressed her lips to his in a lingering kiss of passion when their kissended tears were in her eyes i love you she said softly i tell youbefore but true 
 he smiled his familiar cocky smile just remember that because be his face grew tender and he kissed her gently on the forehead 
 tears began to roll down her cheeks as han turned away from her and walkedquietly and fearlessly toward the waiting platform 
 the ugnaughts rushed to his side and positioned him on the platform bindinghis arms and legs tightly onto the hydraulic deck he stood alone and helpless andgazed one last time at his friends chewbacca looked at his friend head peeking over the shoulder to get one last look at the braveman the administrator calrissian watched this ordeal a solemn look of regretetched deeply into his face and then there was leia her face was contorted withthe pain of her grief as she stood regally trying to be strong 
 was the last face han saw when he felt the hydraulic platform suddenlydrop as it dropped the wookiee bellowed a final baleful farewell 
 in that terrible moment the grieving leia turned away and lando grimaced insorrow 
 instantly fiery liquid began to pour down into the pit in a great cascading showerof fluid and sparks 
 chewbacca from the horrifying spectacle giving threepio a betterview of the process 
 encasing him in carbonite the droid reported better than my own he should be quite well protectedthis is if hesurvived the freezing process 
 chewbacca quickly glanced over his shoulder at threepio silencing his technicaldescription with an angry bark 
 when the liquid finally solidified huge metal tongs lifted the smoldering figurefrom the pit the figure which was cooling rapidly had a recognizably humanshape but was featureless and rocky like an unfinished sculpture 
 some of the hogmen their hands protected by thick black gloves approached body of han solo and shoved the block over after the figure crashedto the platform with a loud metallic clang the ugnaughts hoisted it into container they then attached a boxlike electronic device to its sideand stepped away 
 kneeling lando turned some knobs on the device and checked the gaugemeasuring the temperature of body he sighed with relief and nodded hishead alive he informed han anxious friends and in perfecthibernation 
 darth vader turned to boba fett all yours bounty hunter he the chamber for skywalker 
 just landed my lord an aide informed him 
 see to it that he finds his way here 
 indicating leia and chewbacca lando told vader take what is mine was determined to whisk them out of clutches before the dark lordreneged on their contract 
 take them vader said but keeping a detachment of troops here to watchover them 
 that part of the bargain lando protested hotly you said the interfere in 
 altering the bargain pray i alter it any further 
 a sudden tightness grasped throat a threatening sign of what wouldhappen to him if he gave vader any difficulty hand automatically went tohis neck but in the next moment the unseen hold was released and the administratorturned to face leia and chewbacca the look in his eyes might have expresseddespair but neither of them cared to look at him at all 
 luke and artoo moved cautiously through a deserted corridor 
 it concerned luke that thus far they had not been stopped for questioning noone had asked them for landing permits identification papers purpose of visit noone in cloud city seemed at all curious about who this young man and his little droidmight what they were doing there it all seemed rather ominous and lukewas beginning to feel very uneasy 
 suddenly he heard a sound at the far end of the corridor luke halted pressinghimself close against the corridor wall artoo thrilled to think that they might beback among familiar droids and humans began to whistle and beep excitedly lukeglanced at him to be still and the little robot emitted one last feeble squeak lukethen peered around a corner and saw a group approaching from a side the group was an imposing figure in battered armor and helmet behindhim two cloud city armed guards pushed a transparent case down the where luke stood it appeared the case contained a floating statuelike humanfigure following the case were two imperial stormtroopers who spotted luke 
 instantly the troopers took aim and began to fire 
 but luke dodged their laser bolts and before they could shoot another round theyouth fired his blaster ripping two sizzling holes into the stormtroopers armoredchests 
 as the troopers fell the two guards quickly whisked the encased figure intoanother hallway and the figure leveled his laser blaster at luke sending adeadly bolt at him the beam just missed the youth and nicked a large chunk out ofthe wall next to him shattering it into a showed of dustlike particles when theparticles had cleared luke peeked back around the corner and saw that the namelessattacker the guards and the case had all disappeared behind a thick metal door 
 hearing sounds behind him luke turned to see leia chewbacca an unfamiliar man in a cloak moving down yet another hallway and guarded by asmall band of imperial stormtroopers 
 he gestured to catch the attention 
 leia he shouted 
 luke no she exclaimed her voice charged with fear a trap 
 leaving artoo trailing behind luke ran off to follow them but when hereached a small anteroom leia and the others had disappeared luke heard artoowhistling frantically as he scooted toward the anteroom yet as the youth swiftlyturned he saw a mammoth metal door crash down in front of the startled robot with athundering clang 
 with the slamming of that door luke was cut off from the main corridor he turned to find another way out he saw more metal doors bang shut in theother doorway of the chamber 
 meanwhile artoo stood somewhat dazed by the shock of his close call if hehad rolled just a tiny bit farther into the anteroom the door would have squashed himinto scrap metal he pressed his metal nose against the door then gave out a whistleof relief and wandered off in the opposite direction 
 the anteroom was full of hissing pipes and steam that belched from the began to explore the room and noticed an opening above his head leading to aplace he could not even imagine he moved forward to get a better look and as hedid the section of floor he stood on began to rise slowly upward luke rode up withthe lifting platform determined to face the foe he had traveled so far to meet 
 keeping his blaster clutched in his hand luke rose into the then room was deathly quiet except for the hissing of steam escapingsome of the pipes in the room it appeared to luke that he was the only livingcreature in this chamber of strange machinery and chemical containers but he sensedthat he was not alone 
 vader 
 he spoke the name to himself as he looked around the chamber 
 lord vader i feel your presence show yourself luke taunted his unseenenemy or do you fear me 
 while luke spoke the escaping steam began to billow out in great unaffected by the searing heat vader appeared and strode through the hissingvapors stepping onto the narrow walkway above the chamber his black cloak trailingbehind him 
 luke took a cautious step toward the demonic figure in black and holstered hisblaster he experienced a surge of confidence and felt completely ready to face thedark lord as one jedi against another there was no need for his blaster hesensed that the force was with him and that at last he was ready for this inevitablebattle slowly he began to mount the stairs toward vader 
 the force is with you young skywalker darth vader said from above butyou are not a jedi yet 
 words had a chilling effect briefly luke hesitated recalling the wordsof another former jedi knight luke use the force only for knowledge and fordefense not as a weapon give in to hate or anger they lead the way to thedark side 
 but throwing aside any fragment of doubt luke gripped the smoothly finishedhandle of his lightsaber and quickly ignited the laser blade 
 at the same instant vader ignited his own laser sword and quietly waited for theyoung skywalker to attack 
 his great hatred for vader impelled luke to lunge at him savagely bring hissizzling blade down upon but effortlessly the dark lord deflected theblow with a defensive turn of his own weapon 
 again luke attacked once again their energy blades clashed 
 and then they stood staring at one another for an endless moment through theircrossed lightsabers

 book one 
 chapter xxvi 
 
 the valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince who was in his large study from the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages twenty times repeated of a sonata by dussek 
 just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch prince andrew got out of the carriage helped his little wife to alight and let her pass into the house before him old tikhon wearing a wig put his head out of the door of the antechamber reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping and hastily closed the door tikhon knew that neither the arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day prince andrew apparently knew this as well as tikhon he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his habits had changed since he was at home last and having assured himself that they had not he turned to his wife 
 he will get up in twenty minutes let us go across to room he said 
 the little princess had grown stouter during this time but her eyes and her short downy smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily and prettily as ever 
 why this is a palace she said to her husband looking around with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball come quick quick and with a glance round she smiled at tikhon at her husband and at the footman who accompanied them 
 is that mary practicing go quietly and take her by surprise 
 prince andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression 
 grown older tikhon he said in passing to the old man who kissed his hand 
 before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came the pretty fair haired frenchwoman mademoiselle bourienne rushed out apparently beside herself with delight 
 ah what joy for the princess exclaimed she at last i must let her know 
 no no please not you are mademoiselle bourienne said the little princess kissing her i know you already through my friendship for you she was not expecting us 
 they went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of the passage of the sonata prince andrew stopped and made a grimace as if expecting something unpleasant 
 the little princess entered the room the passage broke off in the middle a cry was heard then princess heavy tread and the sound of kissing when prince andrew went in the two princesses who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding were in each arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch mademoiselle bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned as lovers of music do when they hear a false note the two women let go of one another and then as if afraid of being too late seized each hands kissing them and pulling them away and again began kissing each other on the face and then to prince surprise both began to cry and kissed again mademoiselle bourienne also began to cry prince andrew evidently felt ill at ease but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting 
 ah my dear ah mary they suddenly exclaimed and then laughed i dreamed last night you were not expecting us ah mary you have got thinner and you have grown stouter 
 i knew the princess at once put in mademoiselle bourienne 
 and i had no idea exclaimed princess mary ah andrew i did not see you 
 prince andrew and his sister hand in hand kissed one another and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever princess mary had turned toward her brother and through her tears the loving warm gentle look of her large luminous eyes very beautiful at that moment rested on prince face 
 the little princess talked incessantly her short downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes she told of an accident they had had on the spasski hill which might have been serious for her in her condition and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here and that andrew had quite changed and that kitty odyntsova had married an old man and that there was a suitor for mary a real one but that they would talk of that later princess mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness it was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her words in the midst of a description of the last petersburg fete she addressed her brother 
 so you are really going to the war andrew she said sighing 
 lise sighed too 
 yes and even tomorrow replied her brother 
 he is leaving me here god knows why when he might have had promotion 
 princess mary did not listen to the end but continuing her train of thought turned to her with a tender glance at her figure 
 is it certain she said 
 the face of the little princess changed she sighed and said yes quite certain ah it is very dreadful 
 her lip descended she brought her face close to her and unexpectedly again began to cry 
 she needs rest said prince andrew with a frown you lise take her to your room and go to father how is he just the same 
 yes just the same though i know what your opinion will be answered the princess joyfully 
 and are the hours the same and the walks in the avenues and the lathe asked prince andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that in spite of all his love and respect for his father he was aware of his weaknesses 
 the hours are the same and the lathe and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons said princess mary gleefully as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life 
 when the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up tikhon came to call the young prince to his father the old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his arrival he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner the old prince always dressed in style wearing an antique coat and powdered hair and when prince andrew entered his dressing room not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms but with the animated face with which he talked to pierre the old man was sitting on a large chair wrapped in a powdering mantle entrusting his head to tikhon 
 ah the warrior wants to vanquish buonaparte said the old man shaking his powdered head as much as the tail which tikhon was holding fast to plait would allow 
 you at least must tackle him properly or else if he goes on like this soon have us too for his subjects how are you and he held out his cheek 
 the old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner he used to say that a nap after dinner was silver before dinner golden he cast happy sidelong glances at his son from under his thick bushy eyebrows prince andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him he made no reply on his favorite topic making fun of the military men of the day and more particularly of bonaparte 
 yes father i have come come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant said prince andrew following every movement of his face with an eager and respectful look how is your health 
 only fools and rakes fall ill my boy you know me i am busy from morning till night and abstemious so of course i am well 
 thank god said his son smiling 
 god has nothing to do with it well go on he continued returning to his hobby tell me how the germans have taught you to fight bonaparte by this new science you call strategy 
 prince andrew smiled 
 give me time to collect my wits father said he with a smile that showed that his foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him why i have not yet had time to settle down 
 nonsense nonsense cried the old man shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited and grasping his by the hand the house for your wife is ready princess mary will take her there and show her over and talk nineteen to the dozen their way i am glad to have her sit down and talk about army i understand too a simultaneous expedition but the southern army to do prussia is neutral i know that what about austria said he rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by tikhon who ran after him handing him different articles of clothing what of sweden how will they cross pomerania 
 prince andrew seeing that his father insisted began at first reluctantly but gradually with more and more animation and from habit changing unconsciously from russian to french as he went on to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign he explained how an army ninety thousand strong was to threaten prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war how part of that army was to join some swedish forces at stralsund how two hundred and twenty thousand austrians with a hundred thousand russians were to operate in italy and on the rhine how fifty thousand russians and as many english were to land at naples and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the french from different sides the old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about and three times unexpectedly interrupted once he stopped it by shouting the white one the white one 
 this meant that tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted another time he interrupted saying 
 and will she soon be confined and shaking his head reproachfully said bad go on go on 
 the third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing his description the old man began to sing in the cracked voice of old age malbrook guerre dieu sait quand reviendra 
 marlborough is going to the wars god knows when return 
 his son only smiled 
 i say a plan i approve of said the son i am only telling you what it is napoleon has also formed his plan by now not worse than this one 
 well told me nothing new and the old man repeated meditatively and rapidly 
 dieu sait quand reviendra go to the dining room

 chapter 
 
 summer was already past its prime when edgar reluctantly yielded his assent to their entreaties and catherine and i set out on our first ride to join her cousin it was a close sultry day devoid of sunshine but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain and our place of meeting had been fixed at the by the crossroads on arriving there however a little dispatched as a messenger told us that 
 maister linton wer just ut this side th heights and be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit farther 
 then master linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle i observed he bid us keep on the grange land and here we are off at once 
 well turn our horses heads round when we reach him answered my companion our excursion shall lie towards home 
 but when we reached him and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from his own door we found he had no horse and we were forced to dismount and leave ours to graze he lay on the heath awaiting our approach and did not rise till we came within a few yards then he walked so feebly and looked so pale that i immediately exclaimed 
 why master heathcliff you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning how ill you do look 
 catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment and changed the ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm and the congratulation on their meeting to an anxious inquiry whether he were worse than usual 
 he panted trembling and retaining her hand as if he needed its support while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over her the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the languid expression they once possessed 
 but you have been worse persisted his cousin worse than when i saw you last you are thinner and 
 tired he interrupted hurriedly it is too hot for walking let us rest here and in the morning i often feel says i grow so fast 
 badly satisfied cathy sat down and he reclined beside her 
 this is something like your paradise said she making an effort at cheerfulness you recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the place and way each thought pleasantest this is surely yours only there are clouds but then they are so soft and mellow it is nicer than sunshine next week if you can ride down to the grange park and try mine 
 linton did not appear to remember what she talked of and he had evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation his lack of interest in the subjects she started and his equal incapacity to contribute to her entertainment were so obvious that she could not conceal her disappointment an indefinite alteration had come over his whole person and manner the pettishness that might be caressed into fondness had yielded to a listless apathy there was less of the peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed and more of the moroseness of a confirmed invalid repelling consolation and ready to regard the mirth of others as an insult catherine perceived as well as i did that he held it rather a punishment than a gratification to endure our company and she made no scruple of proposing presently to depart that proposal unexpectedly roused linton from his lethargy and threw him into a strange state of agitation he glanced fearfully towards the heights begging she would remain another at least 
 but i think said cathy be more comfortable at home than sitting here and i cannot amuse you today i see by my tales and songs and chatter you have grown wiser than i in these six months you have little taste for my diversions now or else if i could amuse you willingly stay 
 stay to rest yourself he replied and catherine think or say that very unwell it is the heavy weather and heat that make me dull and i walked about before you came a great deal for me tell uncle in tolerable health will you 
 tell him that you say so linton i affirm that you are observed my young lady wondering at his pertinacious assertion of what was evidently an untruth 
 and be here again next thursday continued he shunning her puzzled gaze and give him my thanks for permitting you to best thanks catherine if you did meet my father and he asked you about me lead him to suppose that been extremely silent and stupid look sad and downcast as you are be angry 
 i care nothing for his anger exclaimed cathy imagining she would be its object 
 but i do said her cousin shuddering provoke him against me catherine for he is very hard 
 is he severe to you master heathcliff i inquired has he grown weary of indulgence and passed from passive to active hatred 
 linton looked at me but did not answer and after keeping her seat by his side another ten minutes during which his head fell drowsily on his breast and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or pain cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries and sharing the produce of her researches with me she did not offer them to him for she saw further notice would only weary and annoy 
 is it half an hour now ellen she whispered in my ear at last i tell why we should stay asleep and papa will be wanting us back 
 well we must not leave him asleep i answered wait till he wakes and be patient you were mighty eager to set off but your longing to see poor linton has soon evaporated 
 why did he wish to see me returned catherine in his crossest humours formerly i liked him better than i do in his present curious mood just as if it were a task he was compelled to fear his father should scold him but hardly going to come to give mr heathcliff pleasure whatever reason he may have for ordering linton to undergo this penance and though glad better in health sorry so much less pleasant and so much less affectionate to me 
 you think he is better in health then i said 
 yes she answered because he always made such a great deal of his sufferings you know he is not tolerably well as he told me to tell papa but better very likely 
 there you differ with me miss cathy i remarked i should conjecture him to be far worse 
 linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror and asked if anyone had called his name 
 no said catherine unless in dreams i cannot conceive how you manage to doze out of doors in the morning 
 i thought i heard my father he gasped glancing up to the frowning nab above us you are sure nobody spoke 
 quite sure replied his cousin only ellen and i were disputing concerning your health are you truly stronger linton than when we separated in winter if you be certain one thing is not regard for me you 
 the tears gushed from eyes as he answered yes yes i am and still under the spell of the imaginary voice his gaze wandered up and down to detect its owner cathy rose for today we must part she said and i conceal that i have been sadly disappointed with our meeting though mention it to nobody but you not that i stand in awe of mr heathcliff 
 hush murmured linton for sake hush coming and he clung to arm striving to detain her but at that announcement she hastily disengaged herself and whistled to minny who obeyed her like a dog 
 be here next thursday she cried springing to the saddle goodbye quick ellen 
 and so we left him scarcely conscious of our departure so absorbed was he in anticipating his approach 
 before we reached home displeasure softened into a perplexed sensation of pity and regret largely blended with vague uneasy doubts about actual circumstances physical and social in which i partook though i counselled her not to say much for a second journey would make us better judges my master requested an account of our ongoings his offering of thanks was duly delivered miss cathy gently touching on the rest i also threw little light on his inquiries for i hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal

 chapter 
 
 it takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and genius especially ambitious young men and women amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation for mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity for a long time there was a lull in the business and she devoted herself to the finest drawing in which she showed such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable but eyes caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold attempt at poker sketching 
 while this attack lasted the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration for the odor of burning wood pervaded the house at all hours smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency pokers lay about promiscuously and hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at her door in case of fire face was found boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board and bacchus on the head of a beer barrel a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugar bucket and attempts to portray romeo and juliet supplied kindling for some time 
 from fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers and amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor an artist friend fitted her out with his castoff palettes brushes and colors and she daubed away producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on land or sea her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken prizes at an agricultural fair and the perilous pitching of her vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance swarthy boys and madonnas staring at you from one corner of the studio suggested murillo oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place meant rembrandt buxom ladies and dropiscal infants rubens and turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder orange lightning brown rain and purple clouds with a splash in the middle which might be the sun or a bouy a shirt or a robe as the spectator pleased 
 charcoal portraits came next and the entire family hung in a row looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin softened into crayon sketches they did better for the likenesses were good and hair nose mouth and eyes were pronounced wonderfully fine a return to clay and plaster followed and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house or tumbled off closet shelves onto heads children were enticed in as models till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused miss amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress her efforts in this line however were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident which quenched her ardor other models failing her for a time she undertook to cast her own pretty foot and the family were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the rescue found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster which had hardened with unexpected rapidity with much difficulty and some danger she was dug out for jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that her knife went too far cut the poor foot and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt at least 
 after this amy subsided till a mania for sketching from nature set her to haunting river field and wood for picturesque studies and sighing for ruins to copy she caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to book delicious bit composed of a stone a stump one mushroom and a broken mullein stalk or a heavenly mass of clouds that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done she sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to study light and shade and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after points of sight or whatever the performance is called 
 if genius is eternal patience as michelangelo affirms amy had some claim to the divine attribute for she persevered in spite of all obstacles failures and discouragements firmly believing that in time she should do something worthy to be called high art 
 she was learning doing and enjoying other things meanwhile for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman even if she never became a great artist here she succeeded better for she was one of those happily created beings who please without effort make friends everywhere and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star everybody liked her for among her good gifts was tact she had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper always said the right thing to the right person did just what suited the time and place and was so that her sisters used to say if amy went to court without any rehearsal beforehand know exactly what to do 
 one of her weaknesses was a desire to move in our best society without being quite sure what the best really was money position fashionable accomplishments and elegant manners were most desirable things in her eyes and she liked to associate with those who possessed them often mistaking the false for the true and admiring what was not admirable never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings so that when the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty now excluded her 
 my lady as her friends called her sincerely desired to be a genuine lady and was so at heart but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature that rank does not always confer nobility and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks 
 i want to ask a favor of you mamma amy said coming in with an important air one day 
 well little girl what is it replied her mother in whose eyes the stately young lady still remained the baby 
 our drawing class breaks up next week and before the girls separate for the summer i want to ask them out here for a day they are wild to see the river sketch the broken bridge and copy some of the things they admire in my book they have been very kind to me in many ways and i am grateful for they are all rich and i know i am poor yet they never made any difference 
 why should they and mrs march put the question with what the girls called her maria theresa air 
 you know as well as i that it does make a difference with nearly everyone so ruffle up like a dear motherly hen when your chickens get pecked by smarter birds the ugly duckling turned out a swan you know and amy smiled without bitterness for she possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit 
 mrs march laughed and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked well my swan what is your plan 
 i should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week to take them for a drive to the places they want to see a row on the river perhaps and make a little artistic fete for them 
 that looks feasible what do you want for lunch cake sandwiches fruit and coffee will be all that is necessary i suppose 
 oh dear no we must have cold tongue and chicken french chocolate and ice cream besides the girls are used to such things and i want my lunch to be proper and elegant though i do work for my living 
 how many young ladies are there asked her mother beginning to look sober 
 twelve or fourteen in the class but i dare say they all come 
 bless me child you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them about 
 why mother how can you think of such a thing not more than six or eight will probably come so i shall hire a beach wagon and borrow mr pronunciation of charabanc 
 all of this will be expensive amy 
 not very calculated the cost and pay for it myself 
 you think dear that as these girls are used to such things and the best we can do will be nothing new that some simpler plan would be pleasanter to them as a change if nothing more and much better for us than buying or borrowing what we need and attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances 
 if i have it as i like i care to have it at all i know that i can carry it out perfectly well if you and the girls will help a little and i see why i if willing to pay for it said amy with the decision which opposition was apt to change into obstinacy 
 mrs march knew that experience was an excellent teacher and when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she would gladly have made easier if they had not objected to taking advice as much as they did salts and senna 
 very well amy if your heart is set upon it and you see your way through without too great an outlay of money time and temper say no more talk it over with the girls and whichever way you decide do my best to help you 
 thanks mother you are always so kind and away went amy to lay her plan before her sisters meg agreed at once and promised to her aid gladly offering anything she possessed from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons but jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with it at first 
 why in the world should you spend your money worry your family and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who care a sixpence for you i thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears french boots and rides in a coupe said jo who being called from the tragic climax of her novel was not in the best mood for social enterprises 
 i truckle and i hate being patronized as much as you do returned amy indignantly for the two still jangled when such questions arose the girls do care for me and i for them and a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense you care to make people like you to go into good society and cultivate your manners and tastes i do and i mean to make the most of every chance that comes you can go through the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air and call it independence if you like not my way 
 when amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the best of it for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side while jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an argument definition of idea of independence was such a good hit that both burst out laughing and the discussion took a more amiable turn much against her will jo at length consented to sacrifice a day to mrs grundy and help her sister through what she regarded as a nonsensical business 
 the invitations were sent nearly all accepted and the following monday was set apart for the grand event hannah was out of humor because her work was deranged and prophesied that ef the washin and ironin done nothin would go well anywheres this hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the whole concern but motto was nil desperandum and having made up her mind what to do she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles to begin with cooking turn out well the chicken was tough the tongue too salt and the chocolate froth properly then the cake and ice cost more than amy expected so did the wagon and various other expenses which seemed trifling at the outset counted up rather alarmingly afterward beth got a cold and took to her bed meg had an unusual number of callers to keep her at home and jo was in such a divided state of mind that her breakages accidents and mistakes were uncommonly numerous serious and trying 
 it it was not fair on monday the young ladies were to come on tuesday and arrangement which aggravated jo and hannah to the last degree on monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more exasperating than a steady pour it drizzled a little shone a little blew a little and make up its mind till it was too late for anyone else to make up theirs amy was up at dawn hustling people out of their beds and through their breakfasts that the house might be got in order the parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby but without stopping to sigh for what she had not she skillfully made the best of what she had arranging chairs over the worn places in the carpet covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary which gave an artistic air to the room as did the lovely vases of flowers jo scattered about 
 the lunch looked charming and as she surveyed it she sincerely hoped it would taste well and that the borrowed glass china and silver would get safely home again the carriages were promised meg and mother were all ready to do the honors beth was able to help hannah behind the scenes jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind and aching head and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything would allow and as she wearily dressed amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when lunch safely over she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights for the cherry bounce and the broken bridge were her strong points 
 then came the hours of suspense during which she vibrated from parlor to porch while public opinion varied like the weathercock a smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young ladies who were to arrive at twelve for nobody came and at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the perishable portions of the feast that nothing might be lost 
 no doubt about the weather today they will certainly come so we must fly round and be ready for them said amy as the sun woke her next morning she spoke briskly but in her secret soul she wished she had said nothing about tuesday for her interest like her cake was getting a little stale 
 i get any lobsters so you will have to do without salad today said mr march coming in half an hour later with an expression of placid despair 
 use the chicken then the toughness matter in a salad advised his wife 
 hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute and the kittens got at it very sorry amy added beth who was still a patroness of cats 
 then i must have a lobster for tongue alone do said amy decidedly 
 shall i rush into town and demand one asked jo with the magnanimity of a martyr 
 come bringing it home under your arm without any paper just to try me go myself answered amy whose temper was beginning to fail 
 shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket she departed feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and fit her for the labors of the day after some delay the object of her desire was procured likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further loss of time at home and off she drove again well pleased with her own forethought 
 as the omnibus contained only one other passenger a sleepy old lady amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to find out where all her money had gone to so busy was she with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer who entered without stopping the vehicle till a masculine voice said good morning miss march and looking up she beheld one of most elegant college friends fervently hoping that he would get out before she did amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet and congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress returned the young greeting with her usual suavity and spirit 
 they got on excellently for chief care was soon set at rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first and she was chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain when the old lady got out in stumbling to the door she upset the basket lobster in all its vulgar size and brilliancy was revealed to the highborn eyes of a tudor 
 by jove forgotten her dinner cried the unconscious youth poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane and preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady 
 please mine murmured amy with a face nearly as red as her fish 
 oh really i beg pardon an uncommonly fine one it said tudor with great presence of mind and an air of sober interest that did credit to his breeding 
 amy recovered herself in a breath set her basket boldly on the seat and said laughing you wish you were to have some of the salad going to make and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat it 
 now that was tact for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind were touched the lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of pleasing reminiscences and curiosity about the charming young ladies diverted his mind from the comical mishap 
 i suppose laugh and joke over it with laurie but i see them a comfort thought amy as tudor bowed and departed 
 she did not mention this meeting at home though she discovered that thanks to the upset her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt but went through with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before and at twelve all was ready again feeling that the neighbors were interested in her movements she wished to efface the memory of failure by a grand success today so she ordered the cherry bounce and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet 
 the rumble coming go onto the porch and meet them it looks hospitable and i want the poor child to have a good time after all her trouble said mrs march suiting the action to the word but after one glance she retired with an indescribable expression for looking quite lost in the big carriage sat amy and one young lady 
 run beth and help hannah clear half the things off the table it will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl cried jo hurrying away to the lower regions too excited to stop even for a laugh 
 in came amy quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who had kept her promise the rest of the family being of a dramatic turn played their parts equally well and miss eliott found them a most hilarious set for it was impossible to control entirely the merriment which possessed them the remodeled lunch being gaily partaken of the studio and garden visited and art discussed with enthusiasm amy ordered a buggy alas for the elegant and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset when the party went out 
 as she came walking in looking very tired but as composed as ever she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared except a suspicious pucker about the corners of mouth 
 had a loverly afternoon for your drive dear said her mother as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come 
 miss eliott is a very sweet girl and seemed to enjoy herself i thought observed beth with unusual warmth 
 could you spare me some of your cake i really need some i have so much company and i make such delicious stuff as yours asked meg soberly 
 take it all the only one here who likes sweet things and it will mold before i can dispose of it answered amy thinking with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this 
 a pity laurie here to help us began jo as they sat down to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days 
 a warning look from her mother checked any further remarks and the whole family ate in heroic silence till mr march mildly observed salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients and evelyn here a general explosion of laughter cut short the history of salads to the great surprise of the learned gentleman 
 bundle everything into a basket and send it to the hummels germans like messes sick of the sight of this and no reason you should all die of a surfeit because been a fool cried amy wiping her eyes i thought i should have died when i saw you two girls rattling about in the like two little kernels in a very big nutshell and mother waiting in state to receive the throng sighed jo quite spent with laughter 
 very sorry you were disappointed dear but we all did our best to satisfy you said mrs march in a tone full of motherly regret 
 i am satisfied done what i undertook and not my fault that it failed i comfort myself with that said amy with a little quiver in her voice i thank you all very much for helping me and thank you still more if you allude to it for a month at least 
 no one did for several months but the word fete always produced a general smile and birthday gift to amy was a tiny coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard

lionfish nov chapter the second taskcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 you said already worked out that egg clue said hermione indignantly 
 
 keep your voice down said harry crossly i just need to sort of it all right 
 
 he ron and hermione were sitting at the very back of the charms class with a table to themselves they were supposed to be practicing the opposite of the summoning charm today the banishing charm owing to the potential for nasty accidents when objects kept flying across the room professor flitwick had given each student a stack of cushions on which to practice the theory being that these hurt anyone if they went off target it was a good theory but it working very well aim was so poor that he kept accidentally sending much heavier things flying across the room professor flitwick for instance 
 
 just forget the egg for a minute all right harry hissed as professor flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them landing on top of a large cabinet trying to tell you about snape and moody 
 
 this class was an ideal cover for a private conversation as everyone was having far too much fun to pay them any attention harry had been recounting his adventures of the previous night in whispered installments for the last half hour 
 
 snape said searched his office as well ron whispered his eyes alight with interest as he banished a cushion with a sweep of his wand it soared into the air and knocked hat off reckon here to keep an eye on snape as well as karkaroff 
 
 well i dunno if what dumbledore asked him to do but definitely doing it said harry waving his wand without paying much attention so that his cushion did an odd sort of belly flop off the desk moody said dumbledore only lets snape stay here because giving him a second chance or something 
 
 what said ron his eyes widening his next cushion spinning high into the air ricocheting off the chandelier and dropping heavily onto desk harrymaybe moody thinks snape put your name in the goblet of fire 
 
 oh ron said hermione shaking her head sceptically we thought snape was trying to kill harry before and it turned out he was saving life remember 
 
 she banished a cushion and it flew across the room and landed in the box they were all supposed to be aiming at harry looked at hermione thinkingit was true that snape had saved his life once but the odd thing was snape definitely loathed him just as loathed father when they had been at school together snape loved taking points from harry and had certainly never missed an opportunity to give him punishments or even to suggest that he should be suspended from the school 
 
 i care what moody says hermione went on not stupid he was right to trust hagrid and professor lupin even though loads of people have given them jobs so why he be right about snape even if snape is a bit 
 
 evil said ron promptly come on hermione why are all these dark wizard catchers searching his office then 
 
 why has mr crouch been pretending to be ill said hermione ignoring ron its a bit funny it that he cant manage to come to the yule ball but he can get up here in the middle of the night when he wants to 
 
 you just like crouch because of that elf winky said ron sending a cushion soaring into the window 
 
 you just want to think up to something said hermione sending her cushion zooming neatly into the box 
 
 i just want to know what snape did with his first chance if on his second one said harry grimly and his cushion to his very great surprise flew straight across the room and landed neatly on top of 
 
 
 
 obedient to wish of hearing about anything odd at hogwarts harry sent him a letter by brown owl that night explaining all about mr crouch breaking into office and moody and conversation then harry turned his attention in earnest to the most urgent problem facing him how to survive underwater for an hour on the of february 
 
 ron quite liked the idea of using the summoning charm again harry had explained about and ron see why harry summon one from the nearest muggle town hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that in the unlikely event that harry managed to learn how to operate an within the set limit of an hour he was sure to be disqualified for breaking the international code of wizarding secrecy it was too much to hope that no muggles would spot an zooming across the countryside to hogwarts 
 
 of course the ideal solution would be for you to transfigure yourself into a submarine or something hermione said if only done human transfiguration already but i think we start that until sixth year and it can go badly wrong if you know what doing 
 
 yeah i fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head said harry i i could always attack someone in front of moody he might do it for me 
 
 i think let you choose what you wanted to be turned into though said hermione seriously no i think your best chance is some sort of charm 
 
 so harry thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime buried himself once more among the dusty volumes looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen however though he ron and hermione searched through their lunchtimes evenings and whole weekends though harry asked professor mcgonagall for a note of permission to use the restricted section and even asked the irritable librarian madam pince for help they found nothing whatsoever that would enable harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale 
 
 familiar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb harry now and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again the lake which harry had always taken for granted as just another feature of the grounds drew his eyes whenever he was near a classroom window a great mass of chilly water whose dark and icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon 
 
 just as it had before he faced the horntail time was slipping away as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go there was a week to go before february the there was still were five days to go he was bound to find something days to go please let me find somethingplease 
 
 with two days left harry started to go off food again the only good thing about breakfast on monday was the return of the brown owl he had sent to sirius he pulled off the parchment unrolled it and saw the shortest letter sirius had ever written to him 
 
 send date of next hogsmeade weekend by return owl 
 harry turned the parchment over and looked at the back hoping to see something else but it was blank 
 
 weekend after next whispered hermione who had read the note over shoulder here take my quill and send this owl back straight away 
 
 harry scribbled the dates down on the back of letter tied it onto the brown leg and watched it take flight again what had he expected advice on how to survive underwater he had been so intent on telling sirius all about snape and moody he had completely forgotten to mention the clue 
 
 he want to know about the next hogsmeade weekend for said ron 
 
 dunno said harry dully the momentary happiness that had flared inside him at the sight of the owl had died come oncare of magical creatures 
 
 whether hagrid was trying to make up for the skrewts or because there were now only two skrewts left or because he was trying to prove he could do anything that professor could harry didnt know but hagrid had been continuing her lessons on unicorns ever since returned to work it turned out that hagrid knew quite as much about unicorns as he did about monsters though it was clear that he found their lack of poisonous fangs disappointing 
 
 today he had managed to capture two unicorn foals unlike unicorns they were pure gold parvati and lavender went into transports of delight at the sight of them and even pansy parkinson had to work hard to conceal how much she liked them 
 
 easier ter spot than the adults hagrid told the class they turn silver when abou two years old an they grow horns at aroun four don go pure white till full grown round about seven a bit more trustin when babiesdon mind boys so move in a bit yeh can pat em if yeh wantgive em a few o these sugar lumps 
 
 you okay harry hagrid muttered moving aside slightly while most of the others swarmed around the baby unicorns 
 
 yeah said harry jus nervous eh said hagrid 
 
 bit said harry 
 
 harry said hagrid clapping a massive hand on his shoulder so that knees buckled under its weight bin worried before i saw yeh take on tha horntail but i know now yeh can do anythin yeh set yer mind ter not worried at all goin ter be fine got yer clue worked out haven yeh 
 
 harry nodded but even as he did so an insane urge to confess that he have any idea how to survive at the bottom of the lake for an hour came over him he looked up at hagrid perhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes to deal with the creatures in it he looked after everything else on the grounds after all 
 
 goin ter win hagrid growled patting shoulder again so that harry actually felt himself sink a couple of inches into the soft ground i know it i can feel it goin ter win harry 
 
 harry just bring himself to wipe the happy confident smile off face pretending he was interested in the young unicorns he forced a smile in return and moved forward to pat them with the others 
 
 
 
 by the evening before the second task harry felt as though he were trapped in a nightmare he was fully aware that even if by some miracle he managed to find a suitable spell have a real job mastering it overnight how could he have let this happen why he got to work on the clue sooner why had he ever let his mind wander in class what if a teacher had once mentioned how to breathe underwater 
 
 he sat with hermione and ron in the library as the sun set outside tearing feverishly through page after page of spells hidden from one another by the massive piles of books on the desk in front of each of them heart gave a huge leap every time he saw the word water on a page but more often than not it was merely take two pints of water half a pound of shredded mandrake leaves and a newt 
 
 i reckon it can be done said voice flatly from the other side of the table nothing nothing closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds that drought charm but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake 
 
 there must be something hermione muttered moving a candle closer to her her eyes were so tired she was poring over the tiny print of olde and forgotten bewitchments and charmes with her nose about an inch from the page never have set a task that was undoable 
 
 they have said ron harry just go down to the lake tomorrow right stick your head in yell at the merpeople to give back whatever nicked and see if they chuck it out best you can do mate 
 
 a way of doing it hermione said crossly there just has to be 
 
 she seemed to be taking the lack of useful information on the subject as a personal insult it had never failed her before 
 
 i know what i should have done said harry resting on saucy tricks for tricky sorts i learned to be an animagus like sirius 
 
 an animagus was a wizard who could transform into an animal 
 
 yeah you turned into a goldfish any time you wanted said ron 
 
 or a frog yawned harry he was exhausted it takes years to become an animagus and then you have to register yourself and everything said hermione vaguely now squinting down the index of weird wizarding dilemmas and their solutions professor mcgonagall told us got to register yourself with the improper use of magic officewhat animal you become and your markings so you abuse it 
 
 hermione i was joking said harry wearily i know i got a chance of turning into a frog by tomorrow morning 
 
 oh this is no use hermione said snapping shut weird wizarding dilemmas who on earth wants to make their nose hair grow into ringlets 
 
 i mind said fred voice be a talking point it 
 
 harry ron and hermione looked up fred and george had just emerged from behind some bookshelves 
 
 you two doing here ron asked 
 
 looking for you said george mcgonagall wants you ron and you hermione 
 
 why said hermione looking surprised 
 
 dunnoshe was looking a bit grim though said fred 
 
 supposed to take you down to her office said george 
 
 ron and hermione stared at harry who felt his stomach drop was professor mcgonagall about to tell ron and hermione off perhaps noticed how much they were helping him when he ought to be working out how to do the task alone 
 
 meet you back in the common room hermione told harry as she got up to go with ron both of them looked very anxious bring as many of these books as you can okay 
 
 right said harry uneasily 
 
 by eight madam pince had extinguished all the lamps and came to chivvy harry out of the library staggering under the weight of as many books as he could carry harry returned to the gryffindor common room pulled a table into a corner and continued to search there was nothing in madcap magic for wacky warlocksnothing in a guide to medieval sorcerynot one mention of underwater exploits in an anthology of charms or in dreadful denizens of the deep or powers you never knew you had and what to do with them now wised up 
 
 crookshanks crawled into lap and curled up purring deeply the common room emptied slowly around harry people kept wishing him luck for the next morning in cheery confident voices like all of them apparently convinced that he was about to pull off another stunning performance like the one he had managed in the first task harry answer them he just nodded feeling as though there were a golfball stuck in his throat by ten to midnight he was alone in the room with crookshanks he had searched all the remaining books and ron and hermione had not come back 
 
 over he told himself you do it just have to go down to the lake in the morning and tell the judges 
 
 he imagined himself explaining that he do the task he pictured look of surprise karkaroffs satisfied smile he could almost hear fleur delacour saying i knew is too young e is only a little boy he saw malfoy flashing his potter stinks badge at the front of the crowd saw crestfallen disbelieving face 
 
 forgetting that crookshanks was on his lap harry stood up very suddenly crookshanks hissed angrily as he landed on the floor gave harry a disgusted look and stalked away with his bottlebrush tail in the air but harry was already hurrying up the spiral staircase to his would grab the invisibility cloak and go back to the library stay there all night if he had to 
 
 lumos harry whispered fifteen minutes later as he opened the library door 
 
 wand tip alight he crept along the bookshelves pulling down more books books of hexes and charms books on merpeople and water monsters books on famous witches and wizards on magical inventions on anything at all that might include one passing reference to underwater survival he carried them over to a table then set to work searching them by the narrow beam of his wand occasionally checking his watch 
 
 one in the morningtwo in the morningthe only way he could keep going was to tell himself over and over again next bookin the next onethe next one 
 
 
 
 the mermaid in the painting in the prefects bathroom was laughing harry was bobbing like a cork in bubbly water next to her rock while she held his firebolt over his head 
 
 come and get it she giggled maliciously come on jump 
 
 i harry panted snatching at the firebolt and struggling not to sink give it to me 
 
 but she just poked him painfully in the side with the end of the broomstick laughing at him 
 
 that hurts get off ouch 
 
 harry potter must wake up sir 
 
 stop poking me 
 
 dobby must poke harry potter sir he must wake up 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was still in the library the invisibility cloak had slipped off his head as slept and the side of his face was stuck to the pages of where a wand a way he sat up straightening his glasses blinking in the bright daylight 
 
 harry potter needs to hurry squeaked dobby the second task starts in ten minutes and harry potter 
 
 ten minutes harry croaked ten ten minutes 
 
 he looked down at his watch dobby was right it was twenty past nine a large dead weight seemed to fall through chest into his stomach 
 
 hurry harry potter squeaked dobby plucking at sleeve you is supposed to be down by the lake with the other champions sir 
 
 too late dobby harry said hopelessly not doing the task i know how 
 
 harry potter will do the task squeaked the elf dobby knew harry had not found the right book so dobby did it for him 
 
 what said harry but you know what the second task is 
 
 dobby knows sir harry potter has to go into the lake and find his wheezy 
 
 find my what 
 
 and take his wheezy back from the merpeople 
 
 a wheezy 
 
 your wheezy sir your who is giving dobby his sweater 
 
 dobby plucked at the shrunken maroon sweater he was now wearing over his shorts 
 
 what harry gasped got ron 
 
 the thing harry potter will miss most sir squeaked dobby but past an hour 
 
 the black harry recited staring at the elf too late gone it come back dobby i got to do 
 
 you has to eat this sir squeaked the elf and he put his hand in the pocket of his shorts and drew out a ball of what looked like slimy rat tails right before you go into the lake sir gillyweed 
 
 it do said harry staring at the gillyweed 
 
 it will make harry potter breathe underwater sir 
 
 dobby said harry frantically listen are you sure about this 
 
 he quite forget that the last time dobby had tried to help him he had ended up with no bones in his right arm 
 
 dobby is quite sure sir said the elf earnestly dobby hears things sir he is a he goes all over the castle as he lights the fires and mops the floors dobby heard professor mcgonagall and professor moody in the staffroom talking about the next cannot let harry potter lose his wheezy 
 
 doubts vanished jumping to his feet he pulled off the invisibility cloak stuffed it into his bag grabbed the gillyweed and put it into his pocket then tore out of the library with dobby at his heels 
 
 dobby is supposed to be in the kitchens sir dobby squealed as they burst into the corridor dobby will be missed good luck harry potter sir good luck 
 
 see you later dobby harry shouted and he sprinted along the corridor and down the stairs three at a time 
 
 the entrance hall contained a few stragglers all leaving the great hall after breakfast and heading through the double oak doors to watch the second task they stared as harry flashed past sending colin and dennis creevey flying as he leapt down the stone steps and out onto the bright chilly grounds 
 
 as he pounded down the lawn he saw that the seats that had encircled the dragons enclosure in november were now ranged along the opposite bank rising in stands that were packed to the bursting point and reflected in the lake below the excited babble of the crowd echoed strangely across the water as harry ran around the other side of the lake toward the judges who were sitting at another table at the edge cedric fleur and krum were beside the judges table watching harry sprint toward them 
 
 harry panted skidding to a halt in the mud and accidentally splattering robes 
 
 where have you been said a bossy disapproving voice the about to start 
 
 harry looked around percy weasley was sitting at the judges table mr crouch had failed to turn up again 
 
 now now percy said ludo bagman who was looking intensely relieved to see harry let him catch his breath 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry but karkaroff and madame maxime look at all pleased to see was obvious from the looks on their faces that they had thought he going to turn up 
 
 harry bent over hands on his knees gasping for breath he had a stitch in his side that felt as though he had a knife between his ribs but there was no time to get rid of it ludo bagman was now moving among the champions spacing them along the bank at intervals of ten feet harry was on the very end of the line next to krum who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready 
 
 all right harry bagman whispered as he moved harry a few feet farther away from krum know what going to do 
 
 yeah harry panted massaging his ribs 
 
 bagman gave shoulder a quick squeeze and returned to the judges table he pointed his wand at his throat as he had done at the world cup said sonorus and his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands 
 
 well all our champions are ready for the second task which will start on my whistle they have precisely an hour to recover what has been taken from them on the count of three then onetwothree 
 
 the whistle echoed shrilly in the cold still air the stands erupted with cheers and applause without looking to see what the other champions were doing harry pulled off his shoes and socks pulled the handful of gillyweed out of his pocket stuffed it into his mouth and waded out into the lake 
 
 it was so cold he felt the skin on his legs searing as though this were fire not icy water his sodden robes weighed him down as he walked in deeper now the water was over his knees and his rapidly numbing feet were slipping over silt and flat slimy stones he was chewing the gillyweed as hard and fast as he could it felt unpleasantly slimy and rubbery like octopus tentacles in the freezing water he stopped swallowed and waited for something to happen 
 
 he could hear laughter in the crowd and knew he must look stupid walking into the lake without showing any sign of magical power the part of him that was still dry was covered in goose pimples half immersed in the icy water a cruel breeze lifting his hair harry started to shiver violently he avoided looking at the stands the laughter was becoming louder and there were catcalls and jeering from the slytherins 
 
 then quite suddenly harry felt as though an invisible pillow had been pressed over his mouth and nose he tried to draw breath but it made his head spin his lungs were empty and he suddenly felt a piercing pain on either side of his neck 
 
 harry clapped his hands around his throat and felt two large slits just below his ears flapping in the cold had gills without pausing to think he did the only thing that made sense he flung himself forward into the water 
 
 the first gulp of icy lake water felt like the breath of life his head had stopped spinning he took another great gulp of water and felt it pass smoothly through his gills sending oxygen back to his brain he stretched out his hands in front of him and stared at them they looked green and ghostly under the water and they had become webbed he twisted around and looked at his bare feet they had become elongated and the toes were webbed too it looked as though he had sprouted flippers 
 
 the water feel icy anymore eitheron the contrary he felt pleasantly cool and very struck out once more marveling at how far and fast his feet propelled him through the vater and noticing how clearly he could see and how he no longer seemed to need to blink he had soon swum so far into the lake that he could no longer see the bottom he flipped over and dived into its depths 
 
 silence pressed upon his ears as he soared over a strange dark foggy landscape he could only see ten feet around him so that as he sped throuugh the water new scenes seemed to loom suddenly out of the incoming darkness forests of rippling tangled black weed wide plains of mud littered with dull glimmering stones he swam deeper and deeper out toward the middle of the lake his eyes wide staring through the eerily water around him to the shadow beyond where the water became opaque 
 
 small fish flickered past him like silver darts once or twice he thought he saw something larger moving ahead of him but when he got nearer he discovered it to be nothing but a large blackened log or a dense clump of weed there was no sign of any of the other champions merpeople ron nor thankfully the giant squid 
 
 light green weed stretched ahead of him as far as he could see two feet deep like a meadow of very overgrown grass harry was staring unblinkingly ahead of him trying to discern shapes through the gloomand then without warning something grabbed hold of his ankle 
 
 harry twisted his body around and saw a grindylow a small horned water demon poking out of the weed its long fingers clutched tightly around leg its pointed fangs bared harry stuck his webbed hand quickly inside his robes and fumbled for his wand by the time he had grasped it two more grindylows had risen out of the weed had seized handfuls of robes and were attempting to drag him down 
 
 relashio harry shouted except that no sound came large bubble issued from his mouth and his wand instead of sending sparks at the grindylows pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water for where it struck them angry red patches appeared on their green skin harry pulled his ankle out of the grindylows grip and swam as fast as he could occasionally sending more jets of hot water over his shoulder at random every now and then he felt one of the grindylows snatch at his foot again and he kicked out hard finally he felt his foot connect with a horned skull and looking back saw the dazed grindylow floating away while its fellows shook their fists at harry and sank back into the weed 
 
 harry slowed down a little slipped his wand back inside his robes and looked around listening again he turned full circle in the water the silence pressing harder than ever against his eardrums he knew he must be even deeper in the lake now but nothing was moving but the rippling weed 
 
 how are you getting on 
 
 harry thought he was having a heart attack he whipped around and saw moaning myrtle floating hazily in front of him gazing at him through her thick pearly glasses 
 
 myrtle harry tried to shout but once again nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble moaning myrtle actually giggled 
 
 you want to try over there she said pointing i come with like them much they always chase me when i get too close 
 
 harry gave her the to show his thanks and set off once more careful to swim a bit higher over the weed to avoid any more grindylows that might be lurking there 
 
 he swam on for what felt like at least twenty minutes he was passing over vast expanses of black mud now which swirled murkily as he disturbed the water then at long last he heard a snatch of haunting mersong 
 
 an hour long have to look 
 and to recover what we took 
 harry swam faster and soon saw a large rock emerge out of the muddy water ahead it had paintings of merpeople on it they were carrying spears and chasing what looked like the giant squid harry swam on past the rock following the mersong 
 
 your half gone so tarry not 
 lest what you seek stays here to rot 
 a cluster of crude stone dwellings stained with algae loomed suddenly out of the gloom on all sides here and there at the dark windows harry saw facesfaces that bore no resemblance at all to the painting of the mermaid in the prefects bathroom 
 
 the merpeople had grayish skin and long wild dark green hair their eyes were yellow as were their broken teeth and they wore thick ropes of pebbles around their necks they leered at harry as he swam past one or two of them emerged from their caves to watch him better their powerful silver fish tails beating the water spears clutched in their hands 
 
 harry sped on staring around and soon the dwellings became more numerous there were gardens of weed around some of them and he even saw a pet grindylow tied to a stake outside one door merpeople were emerging on all sides now watching him eagerly pointing at his webbed hands and gills talking behind their hands to one another harry sped around a corner and a very strange sight met his eyes 
 
 a whole crowd of merpeople was floating in front of the houses that lined what looked like a of a village square a choir of merpeople was singing in the middle calling the champions toward them and behind them rose a crude sort of statue a gigantic merperson hewn from a boulder four people were bound tightly to the tail of the stone merperson 
 
 ron was tied between hermione and cho chang there was also a girl who looked no older than eight whose clouds of silvery hair made harry feel sure that she was fleur sister all four of them appeared to be in a very deep sleep their heads were lolling onto their shoulders and fine streams of bubbles kept issuing from their mouths 
 
 harry sped toward the hostages half expecting the merpeople to lower their spears and charge at him but they did nothing the ropes of weed tying the hostages to the statue were thick slimy and very strong for a fleeting second he thought of the knife sirius had bought him for christmas locked in his trunk in the castle a quarter of a mile away no use to him whatsoever 
 
 he looked around many of the merpeople surrounding them were carrying spears he swam swiftly toward a merman with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs and tried to mime a request to borrow the spear the merman laughed and shook his head 
 
 we do not help he said in a harsh croaky voice 
 
 come on harry said fiercely but only bubbles issued from his mouth and he tried to pull the spear away from the merman but the merman yanked it back still shaking his head and laughing 
 
 harry swirled around staring about something sharpanything 
 
 there were rocks littering the lake bottom he dived and snatched up a particularly jagged one and returned to the statue he began to hack at the ropes binding ron and after several minutes hard work they broke apart ron floated unconscious a few inches above the lake bottom drifting a little in the ebb of the water 
 
 harry looked around there was no sign of any of the other champions what were they playing at why they hurry up he turned back to hermione raised the jagged rock and began to hack at her bindings too 
 
 at once several pairs of strong gray hands seized him half a dozen mermen were pulling him away from hermione shaking their heads and laughing 
 
 you take your own hostage one of them said to him leave the others 
 
 no way said harry furiously but only two large bubbles came out 
 
 your task is to retrieve your own friendleave the others 
 
 my friend too harry yelled gesturing toward hermione an enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly from his lips and i want them to die either 
 
 head was on shoulder the small girl was ghostly green and pale harry struggled to fight off the mermen but they laughed harder than ever holding him back harry looked wildly around where were the other champions would he have time to take ron to the surface and come back down for hermione and the others would he be able to find them again he looked down at his watch to see how much time was left it had stopped working 
 
 but then the merpeople around him pointed excitedly over his head harry looked up and saw cedric swimming toward them there was an enormous bubble around his head which made his features look oddly wide and stretched 
 
 got lost he mouthed looking fleur and coming now 
 
 feeling enormously relieved harry watched cedric pull a knife out of his pocket and cut cho free he pulled her upward and out of sight 
 
 harry looked around waiting where were fleur and krum time was getting short and according to the song the hostages would be lost after an hour 
 
 the merpeople started screeching animatedly those holding harry loosened their grip staring behind them harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a was krum he appeared to have transfigured himself but badly 
 
 the swam straight to hermione and began snapping and biting at her ropes the trouble was that new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin and harry was quite sure that if krum careful he was going to rip hermione in half darting forward harry hit krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone krum seized it and began to cut hermione free within seconds he had done it he grabbed hermione around the waist and without a backward glance began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface 
 
 now what harry thought desperately if he could be sure that fleur was still no sign there was nothing to be done except 
 
 he snatched up the stone which krum had dropped but the mermen now closed in around ron and the little girl shaking their heads at him harry pulled out his wand 
 
 get out of the way 
 
 only bubbles flew out of his mouth but he had the distinct impression that the mermen had understood him because they suddenly stopped laughing their yellowish eyes were fixed upon wand and they looked scared there might be a lot more of them than there were of him but harry could tell by the looks on their faces that they knew no more magic than the giant squid did 
 
 got until three harry shouted a great stream of bubbles burst from him but he held up three fingers to make sure they got the message one he put down a finger put down a second one 
 
 they scattered harry darted forward and began to hack at the ropes binding the small girl to the statue and at last she was free he seized the little girl around the waist grabbed the neck of robes and kicked off from the bottom 
 
 it was very slow work he could no longer use his webbed hands to propel himself forward he worked his flippers furiously but ron and sister were like sacks dragging him back fixed his eyes skyward though he knew he must still be very deep the water above him was so dark 
 
 merpeople were rising with him he could see them swirling around him with ease watching him struggle through the they pull him back down to the depths when the time was up did they perhaps eat humans legs were seizing up with the effort to keep swimming his shoulders were aching horribly with the effort of dragging ron and the girl 
 
 he was drawing breath with extreme difficulty he could feel pain on the sides of his neck againhe was becoming very aware of how wet the water was in his mouthyet the darkness was definitely thinning nowhe could see daylight above him 
 
 he kicked hard with his flippers and discovered that they were nothing more than feetwater was flooding through his mouth into his lungshe was starting to feel dizzy but he knew light and air were only ten feet above himhe had to get therehe had to 
 
 harry kicked his legs so hard and fast it felt as though his muscles were screaming in protest his very brain felt waterlogged he breathe he needed oxygen he had to keep going he could not stop 
 
 and then he felt his head break the surface of the lake wonderful cold clear air was making his wet face sting he gulped it down feeling as though he had never breathed properly before and panting pulled ron and the little girl up with him all around him wild heads were emerging out of the water with him but they were smiling at him 
 
 the crowd in the stands was making a great deal of noise shouting and screaming they all seemed to be on their feet harry had the impression they thought that ron and the little girl might be dead but they were wrongboth of them had opened their eyes the girl looked scared and confused but ron merely expelled a great spout of water blinked in the bright light turned to harry and said wet this it then he spotted sister what did you bring her for 
 
 fleur turn up i leave her harry panted 
 
 harry you prat said ron you take that song thing seriously did you dumbledore have let any of us drown 
 
 the song said 
 
 it was only to make sure you got back inside the time limit said ron i hope you waste time down there acting the hero 
 
 harry felt both stupid and annoyed it was all very well for ron been asleep he felt how eerie it was down in the lake surrounded by merpeople looked more than capable of murder 
 
 harry said shortly help me with her i think she can swim very well 
 
 they pulled sister through the water back toward the bank where the judges stood watching twenty merpeople accompanying them like a guard of honor singing their horrible screechy songs 
 
 harry could see madam pomfrey fussing over hermione krum cedric and cho all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets 
 
 dumbledore and ludo bagman stood beaming at harry and ron from the bank as they swam nearer but percy who looked very white and somehow much younger than usual came splashing out to meet them meanwhile madame maxime was trying to restrain fleur delacour who was quite hysterical fighting tooth and nail to return to the water 
 
 gabrielle gabrielle is she alive is she urt 
 
 fine harry tried to tell her but he was so exhausted he could hardly talk let alone shout 
 
 percy seized ron and was dragging him back to the bank gerroff percy all right dumbledore and bagman were pulling harry upright fleur had broken free of madame maxime and was hugging her sister 
 
 it was ze grindylowszey attacked meoh gabrielle i thoughti thought 
 
 come here you said madam pomfrey she seized harry and pulled him over to hermione and the others wrapped him so tightly in a blanket that he felt as though he were in a straitjacket and forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat steam gushed out of his ears 
 
 harry well done hermione cried you did it you found out how all by yourself 
 
 well said harry he would have told her about dobby but he had just noticed karkaroff watching him he was the only judge who had not left the table the only judge not showing signs of pleasure and relief that harry ron and sister had got back safely yeah right said harry raising his voice slightly so that karkaroff could hear him 
 
 you haff a water beetle in your hair said krum harry had the impression that krum was drawing her attention back onto himself perhaps to remind her that he had just rescued her from the lake but hermione brushed away the beetle impatiently and said well outside the time limit though it take you ages to find us 
 
 noi found you okay 
 
 feeling of stupidity was growing now he was out of the water it seemed perfectly clear that dumbledores safety precautions have permitted the death of a hostage just because their champion turned up why he just grabbed ron and gone he would have been first and krum wasted time worrying about anyone else they taken the mersong seriously 
 
 dumbledore was crouching at the edge deep in conversation with what seemed to be the chief merperson a particularly wild and female he was making the same sort of screechy noises that the merpeople made when they were above water clearly dumbledore could speak mermish finally he straightened up turned to his fellow judges and said a conference before we give the marks i think 
 
 the judges went into a huddle madam pomfrey had gone to rescue ron from clutches she led him over to harry and the others gave him a blanket and some pepperup potion then went to fetch fleur and her sister fleur had many cuts on her face and arms and her robes were torn but she seem to care nor would she allow madam pomfrey to clean them 
 
 look after gabrielle she told her and then she turned to harry you saved er she said breathlessly even though she was not your ostage 
 
 yeah said harry who was now heartily wishing left all three girls tied to the statue 
 
 fleur bent down kissed harry twice on each cheek he felt his face burn and have been surprised if steam was coming out of his ears again then said to ron and you elped 
 
 yeah said ron looking extremely hopeful yeah a bit 
 
 fleur swooped down on him too and kissed him hermione looked simply furious but just then ludo magically magnified voice boomed out beside them making them all jump and causing the crowd in the stands to go very quiet 
 
 ladies and gentlemen we have reached our decision merchieftainess murcus has told us exactly what happened at the bottom of the lake and we have therefore decided to award marks out of fifty for each of the champions as follows 
 
 fleur delacour though she demonstrated excellent use of the charm was attacked by grindylows as she approached her goal and failed to retrieve her hostage we award her points 
 
 applause from the stands 
 
 i deserved zero said fleur throatily shaking her magnificent head 
 
 cedric diggory who also used the charm was first to return with his hostage though he returned one minute outside the time limit of an hour enormous cheers from the hufflepuffs in the crowd harry saw cho give cedric a glowing look we therefore award him points 
 
 heart sank if cedric had been outside the time limit he most certainly had been 
 
 viktor krum used an incomplete form of transfiguration which was nevertheless effective and was second to return with his hostage we award him forty points 
 
 karkaroff clapped particularly hard looking very superior 
 
 harry potter used gillyweed to great effect bagman continued he returned last and well outside the time limit of an hour however the merchieftainess informs us that mr potter was first to reach the hostages and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety not merely his own 
 
 ron and hermione both gave harry looks 
 
 most of the judges and here bagman gave karkaroff a very nasty look feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks howevermr score is points 
 
 stomach leapt he was now tying for first place with cedric ron and hermione caught by surprise stared at harry then laughed and started applauding hard with the rest of the crowd 
 
 there you go harry ron shouted over the noise you being thick after all you were showing moral fiber 
 
 fleur was clapping very hard too but krum look happy at all he attempted to engage hermione in conversation again but she was too busy cheering harry to listen 
 
 the third and final task will take place at dusk on the of june continued bagman the champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand thank you all for your support of the champions 
 
 it was over harry thought dazedly as madam pomfrey began herding the champions and hostages back to the castle to get into dry clothesit was over he had got throughhe have to worry about anything now until june the 
 
 next time he was in hogsmeade harry decided as he walked back up the stone steps into the castle he was going to buy dobby a pair of socks for every day of the year

lionfish nov chapter seen and unforseencontents prev chapter next chapter 
 luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon interview with harry would appear in the quibbler that her father was expecting a lovely long article on recent sightings of snorkacks and of course be a very important story so might have to wait for the following issue said luna 
 
 harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when voldemort had returned rita had pressed him for every little detail and he had given her everything he could remember knowing that this was his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth he wondered how people would react to the story he guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he was completely insane not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about snorkacks but the breakout of bellatrix lestrange and her fellow death eaters had given harry a burning desire to do something whether or not it worked 
 
 wait to see what umbridge thinks of you going public said dean sounding awestruck at dinner on monday night seamus was shovelling down large amounts of chicken and ham pie on other side but harry knew he was listening 
 
 the right thing to do harry said neville who was sitting opposite him he was rather pale but went on in a low voice it must have been tough talking about it was it 
 
 yeah mumbled harry but people have got to know what capable of they 
 
 right said neville nodding and his death eaters too people should know 
 
 neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato seamus looked up but when he caught eye he looked quickly back at his plate again after a while dean seamus and neville departed for the common room leaving harry and hermione at the table waiting for ron who had not yet had dinner because of quidditch practice 
 
 cho chang walked into the hall with her friend marietta stomach gave an unpleasant lurch but she did not look over at the gryffindor table and sat down with her back to him 
 
 oh i forgot to ask you said hermione brightly glancing over at the ravenclaw table what happened on your date with cho how come you were back so early 
 
 er well it was said harry pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble towards him and helping himself to seconds a complete fiasco now you mention it 
 
 and he told her what had happened in madam teashop 
 
 so then he finished several minutes later as the final bit of crumble disappeared she jumps up right and says see you around harry and runs out of the place he put down his spoon and looked at hermione i mean what was all that about what was going on 
 
 hermione glanced over at the back of head and sighed 
 
 oh harry she said sadly well sorry but you were a bit tactless 
 
 me tactless said harry outraged one minute we were getting on fine next minute she was telling me that roger davies asked her out and how she used to go and snog cedric in that stupid teashophow was i supposed to feel about that 
 
 well you see said hermione with the patient air of someone explaining that one plus one equals two to an toddler you have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date 
 
 but but spluttered harry butyou told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along how was i supposed to do that without telling her 
 
 you should have told her differently said hermione still with that maddeningly patient air you should have said it was really annoying but made you promise to come along to the three broomsticks and you really want to go much rather spend the whole day with her but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please please come along with you and hopefully be able to get away more quickly and it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think i am too hermione added as an afterthought 
 
 but i think ugly said harry bemused 
 
 hermione laughed 
 
 harry worse than ron well no not she sighed as ron himself came stumping into the hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy lookyou upset cho when you said you were going to meet me so she tried to make you jealous it was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her 
 
 is that what she was doing said harry as ron dropped onto the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach towards him well it have been easier if just asked me whether i liked her better than you 
 
 girls often ask questions like that said hermione 
 
 well they should said harry forcefully then i just told her i fancy her and she have had to get herself all worked up again about cedric dying 
 
 not saying what she did was sensible said hermione as ginny joined them just as muddy as ron and looking equally disgruntled just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time 
 
 you should write a book ron told hermione as he cut up his potatoes translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them 
 
 yeah said harry fervently looking over at the ravenclaw table cho had just got up and still not looking at him she left the great hall feeling rather depressed he looked back at ron and ginny so how was quidditch practice 
 
 it was a nightmare said ron in a surly voice 
 
 oh come on said hermione looking at ginny sure it that 
 
 yes it was said ginny it was appalling angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it 
 
 ron and ginny went off for baths after dinner harry and hermione returned to the busy gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework harry had been struggling with a new for astronomy for half an hour when fred and george turned up 
 
 ron and ginny not here asked fred looking around as he pulled up a chair and when harry shook his head he said good we were watching their practice going to be slaughtered complete rubbish without us 
 
 come on not bad said george fairly sitting down next to fred actually i dunno how she got so good seeing how we never let her play with us 
 
 been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you looking said hermione from behind her tottering pile of ancient rune books 
 
 oh said george looking mildly impressed explain it 
 
 has ron saved a goal yet asked hermione peering over the top of magical hieroglyphs and logograms 
 
 well he can do it if he think watching him said fred rolling his eyes so all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the quaffle goes up his end on saturday 
 
 he got up again and moved restlessly to the window staring out across the dark grounds 
 
 you know quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for 
 
 hermione cast him a stern look 
 
 got exams coming 
 
 told you already not fussed about newts said fred the snackboxes are ready to roll we found out how to get rid of those boils just a couple of drops of murtlap essence sorts them lee put us on to it 
 
 george yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky 
 
 i dunno if i even want to watch this match if zacharias smith beats us i might have to kill myself 
 
 kill him more like said fred firmly 
 
 the trouble with quidditch said hermione once again bent over her runes translation it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the houses 
 
 she looked up to find her copy of syllabary and caught fred george and harry all staring at her with expressions of mingled disgust and incredulity on their faces 
 
 well it does she said impatiently only a game it 
 
 hermione said harry shaking his head good on feelings and stuff but you just understand about quidditch 
 
 maybe not she said darkly returning to her translation but at least my happiness depend on goalkeeping ability 
 
 and though harry would rather have jumped off the astronomy tower than admit it to her by the time he had watched the game the following saturday he would have given any number of galleons not to care about quidditch either 
 
 the very best thing you could say about the match was that it was short the gryffindor spectators had to endure only minutes of agony it was hard to say what the worst thing was harry thought it was a contest between fourteenth failed save sloper missing the bludger but hitting angelina in the mouth with his bat and kirke shrieking and falling backwards off his broom when zacharias smith zoomed at him carrying the quaffle the miracle was that gryffindor only lost by ten points ginny managed to snatch the snitch from right under hufflepuff seeker nose so that the final score was two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty 
 
 good catch harry told ginny back in the common room where the atmosphere resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral 
 
 i was lucky she shrugged it a very fast snitch and got a cold he sneezed and closed his eyes at exactly the wrong moment anyway once back on the team 
 
 ginny got a lifelong ban 
 
 banned as long as umbridge is in the school ginny corrected him a difference anyway once back i think try out for chaser angelina and alicia are both leaving next year and i prefer to seeking anyway 
 
 harry looked over at ron who was hunched in a corner staring at his knees a bottle of butlerbeer clutched in his hand 
 
 angelina still let him resign ginny said as though reading mind she says she knows got it in him 
 
 harry liked angelina for the faith she was showing in ron but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of weasley is our king sung with great gusto by the slytherins who were now favourites to win the quidditch cup 
 
 fred and george wandered over 
 
 i even got the heart to take the mickey out of him said fred looking over at crumpled figure mind you when he missed the fourteenth 
 
 he made wild motions with his arms as though doing an upright 
 
 well save it for parties eh 
 
 ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this out of respect for his feelings harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself so that ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to sure enough when harry finally entered the room ron was snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible 
 
 harry got into bed thinking about the match it had been immensely frustrating watching from the sidelines he was quite impressed by performance but he knew if he had been playing he could have caught the snitch sooner there had been a moment when it had been fluttering near ankle if ginny hesitated she might have been able to scrape a win for gryffindor 
 
 umbridge had been sitting a few rows below harry and hermione once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him her wide mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating smile the memory of it made him feel hot with anger as he lay there in the dark after a few minutes however he remembered that he was supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept as snape kept instructing him at the end of every occlumency lesson 
 
 he tried for a moment or two but the thought of snape on top of memories of umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them slowly snores died away to be replaced by the sound of deep slow breathing it took harry much longer to get to sleep his body was tired but it took his brain a long time to close down 
 
 he dreamed that neville and professor sprout were waltzing around the room of requirement while professor mcgonagall played the bagpipes he watched them happily for a while then decided to go and find the other members of the da 
 
 but when he left the room he found himself facing not the tapestry of barnabas the barmy but a torch burning in its bracket on a stone wall he turned his head slowly to the left there at the far end of the windowless passage was a plain black door 
 
 he walked towards it with a sense of mounting excitement he had the strangest feeling that this time he was going to get lucky at last and find the way to open it he was feet from it and saw with a leap of excitement that there was a glowing strip of faint blue light down the side the door was ajar he stretched out his hand to push it wide and 
 
 ron gave a loud rasping genuine snore and harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness to open a door that was hundreds of miles away he let it fall with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt he knew he should not have seen the door but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what was behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with ron if only he could have saved his snore for just another minute 
 
 they entered the great hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment as the post owls on monday morning hermione was not the only person eagerly awaiting her daily prophet nearly everyone was eager for more news about the escaped death eaters who despite many reported sightings had still not been caught she gave the delivery owl a knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while harry helped himself to orange juice as he had only received one note during the entire year he was sure when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him that it had made a mistake 
 
 you after he asked it languidly removing his orange juice from underneath its beak and leaning forwards to see the name and address 
 
 harry potter 
 
 great hall 
 
 hogwarts school 
 
 frowning he made to take the letter from the owl but before he could do so three four five more owls had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position treading in the butter and knocking over the salt as each one attempted to give him their letter first 
 
 going on ron asked in amazement as the whole of gryffindor table leaned forwards to watch and another seven owls landed amongst the first ones screeching hooting and flapping their wings 
 
 harry said hermione breathlessly plunging her hands into the feathery mass and pulling out a screech owl bearing a long cylindrical package i think i know what this meansopen this one first 
 
 harry ripped off the brown packaging out rolled a tightly furled copy of the march edition of the unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover in large red letters across this picture were the words 
 
 harry potter speaks out at last 
 
 the truth about he who must not be named 
 
 and the night i saw him return 
 
 good it said luna who had drifted over to the gryffindor table and now squeezed herself on to the bench between fred and ron it came out yesterday i asked dad to send you a free copy i expect all these she waved a hand at the assembled owls still scrabbling around on the table in front of harry are letters from readers 
 
 what i thought said hermione eagerly harry mind if we 
 
 help yourself said harry feeling slightly bemused 
 
 ron and hermione both started ripping open envelopes 
 
 this from a bloke who thinks off your rocker said ron glancing down his letter ah well 
 
 this woman recommends you try a good course of shock spells at st said hermione looking disappointed and crumpling up a second 
 
 this one looks ok though said harry slowly scanning a long letter from a witch in paisley hey she says she believes me 
 
 this in two minds said fred who had joined in the with enthusiasm says you come across as a mad person but he really want to believe back so he know what to think now blimey what a waste of parchment 
 
 another one convinced harry said hermione excitedly having read your side of the story i am forced to the conclusion that the daily prophet has treated you very unfairly little though i want to think that he who must not be named has returned i am forced to accept that you are telling the truth oh this is wonderful 
 
 another one who thinks barking said ron throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder but this one says got her converted and she now thinks a real put in a photograph toowow 
 
 what is going on here said a falsely sweet girlish voice 
 
 harry looked up with his hands full of envelopes professor umbridge was standing behind fred and luna her bulging eyes scanning the mess of owls and letters on the table in front of harry behind her he saw many of the students watching them avidly 
 
 why have you got all these letters mr potter she asked slowly 
 
 is that a crime now said fred loudly getting mail 
 
 be careful mr weasley or i shall have to put you in detention said umbridge well mr potter 
 
 harry hesitated but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet it was surely only a matter of time before a copy of the quibbler came to attention 
 
 people have written to me because i gave an interview said harry about what happened to me last june 
 
 for some reason he glanced up at the staff table as he said this harry had the strangest feeling that dumbledore had been watching him a second before but when he looked towards the headmaster he seemed to be absorbed in conversation with professor flitwick 
 
 an interview repeated umbridge her voice thinner and higher than ever what do you mean 
 
 i mean a reporter asked me questions and i answered them said harry here 
 
 and he threw the copy of the quibbler to her she caught it and stared down at the cover her pale doughy face turned an ugly patchy violet 
 
 when did you do this she asked her voice trembling slightly 
 
 last hogsmeade weekend said harry 
 
 she looked up at him incandescent with rage the magazine shaking in her stubby fingers 
 
 there will be no more hogsmeade trips for you mr potter she whispered how you dare how you could she took a deep breath i have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies the message apparently has still not sunk in fifty points from gryffindor and another worth of detentions 
 
 she stalked away clutching the quibbler to her chest the eyes of many students following her 
 
 by enormous signs had been put up all over the school not just on house noticeboards but in the corridors and classrooms too 
 
 by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts 
 
 
 
 any student found in possession of the magazine 
 
 the quibblerwill be expelled 
 
 
 
 the above is in accordance with educational decree number 
 
 
 
 signed dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor 
 
 for some reason every time hermione caught sight of one of these signs she beamed with pleasure 
 
 what exactly are you so happy about harry asked her 
 
 oh harry you see hermione breathed if she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview it was banning it 
 
 and it seemed that hermione was quite right by the end of the day though harry had not seen so much as a corner of the quibbler anywhere in the school the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview to each other harry heard them whispering about it as they queued up outside classes discussing it over lunch and in the back of lessons while hermione even reported that every occupant of the cubicles in the girls toilets had been talking about it when she nipped in there before ancient runes 
 
 then they spotted me and obviously they know i know you so they bombarded me with questions hermione told harry her eyes shining and harry i think they believe you i really do i think finally got them convinced 
 
 meanwhile professor umbridge was stalking the school stopping students at random and demanding that they turn out their books and pockets harry knew she was looking for copies of the quibbler but the students were several steps ahead of her the pages carrying interview had been bewitched to resemble extracts from textbooks if anyone but themselves read it or else wiped magically blank until they wanted to peruse it again soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it 
 
 the teachers were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by educational decree number but they found ways to express their feelings about it all the same professor sprout awarded gryffindor twenty points when harry passed her a watering can a beaming professor flitwick pressed a box of squeaking sugar mice on him at the end of charms said shh and hurried away and professor trelawney broke into hysterical sobs during divination and announced to the startled class and a very disapproving umbridge that harry was not going to suffer an early death after all but would live to a ripe old age become minister for magic and have twelve children 
 
 but what made harry happiest was cho catching up with him as he was hurrying along to transfiguration the next day before he knew what had happened her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear really really sorry that interview was so brave it made me cry 
 
 he was sorry to hear she had shed even more tears over it but very glad they were on speaking terms again and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again and unbelievably no sooner had he arrived outside transfiguration than something just as good happened seamus stepped out of the queue to face him 
 
 i just wanted to say he mumbled squinting at left knee i believe you and sent a copy of that magazine to me mam 
 
 if anything more was needed to complete happiness it was the reaction he got from malfoy crabbe and goyle he saw them with their heads together later that afternoon in the library they were with a boy hermione whispered was called theodore nott they looked round at harry as he browsed the shelves for the book he needed on partial vanishment goyle cracked his knuckles threateningly and malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to crabbe harry knew perfectly well why they were acting like this he had named all of their fathers as death eaters 
 
 and the best bit whispered hermione gleefully as they left the library is they contradict you because they admit read the article 
 
 to cap it all luna told him over dinner that no issue of the quibbler had ever sold out faster 
 
 reprinting she told harry her eyes popping excitedly he believe it he says people seem even more interested in this than the snorkacks 
 
 harry was a hero in the gryffindor common room that night daringly fred and george had put an enlargement charm on the front cover of the quibbler and hung it on the wall so that giant head gazed down upon the proceedings occasionally saying things like the ministry are morons and eat dung umbridge in a booming voice hermione did not find this very amusing she said it interfered with her concentration and she ended up going to bed early out of irritation harry had to admit that the poster was not quite as funny after an hour or two especially when the talking spell had started to wear off so that it merely shouted disconnected words like dung and umbridge at more and more frequent intervals in a progressively higher voice in fact it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again to disappointed moans from the many people who were sitting around him asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time he announced that he too needed an early night 
 
 the dormitory was empty when he reached it he rested his forehead for a moment against the cool glass of the window beside his bed it felt soothing against his scar then he undressed and got into bed wishing his headache would go away he also felt slightly sick he rolled over on to his side closed his eyes and fell asleep almost at once 
 
 he was standing in a dark curtained room lit by a single branch of candles his hands were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him they were and white as though they had not seen sunlight for years and looked like large pale spiders agairst the dark velvet of the chair 
 
 beyond the chair in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candles knelt a man in black robes 
 
 i have been badly advised it seems said harry in a high cold voice that pulsed with anger 
 
 master i crave your pardon croaked the man kneeling on the floor the back of his head glimmered in the candlelight he seemed to be trembling 
 
 i do not blame you rookwood said harry in that cold cruel voice 
 
 he relinquished his grip on the chair and walked around it closer to the man cowering on the floor until he stood directly over him in the darkness looking down from a far greater height than usual 
 
 you are sure of your facts rookwood asked harry 
 
 yes my lord yes i used to work in the department aftetafter all 
 
 avery told me bode would be able to remove it 
 
 bode could never have taken it master bode would have known he could not undoubtedly that is why he fought so hard against imperius curse 
 
 stand up rookwood whispered harry 
 
 the kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey his face was pockmarked the scars were thrown into relief by the candlelight he remained a little stooped when standing as though halfway through a bow and he darted terrified looks up at face 
 
 you have done well to tell me this said harry very well i have wasted months on fruitless schemes it seems but no matter we begin again from now you have lord gratitude rookwood 
 
 my lord yes my lord gasped rookwood his voice hoarse with relief 
 
 i shall need your help i shall need all the information you can give me 
 
 of course my lord of course anything 
 
 very well you may go send avery to me 
 
 rookwood scurried backwards bowing and disappeared through a door 
 
 left alone in the dark room harry turned towards the wall a cracked mirror hung on the wall in the shadows harry moved towards it his reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness a face whiter than a skull red eyes with slits for pupils 
 
 nooooooooo 
 
 what yelled a voice nearby 
 
 harry hailed around madly became entangled in the hangings and fell out of his bed for a few seconds he did not know where he was he was convinced he was about to see the white lace looming at him out of the dark again then very near to him voice spoke 
 
 will you stop acting like a maniac so i can get you out of here 
 
 ron wrenched the hangings apart and harry stared up at him in the moonlight flat on his back his scar searing with pain ron looked as though he had just been getting ready for bed one arm was out of his robes 
 
 has someone been attacked again asked ron pulling harry roughly to his feet is it dad is it that snake 
 
 fine gasped harry whose forehead felt as though it were on fire well avery in trouble he gave him the wrong information really angry 
 
 harry groaned and sank shaking on to his bed rubbing his scar 
 
 but going to help him now on the right track again 
 
 what are you talking about said ron sounding scared mean did you just see 
 
 i was said harry and he stretched out his hands in the darkness and held them up to his face to check that they were no longer deathly white and he was with rookwood one of the death eaters who escaped from azkaban remember just told him bode have done it 
 
 done what 
 
 remove something he said bode would have known he have done it bode was under the imperius curse i think he said dad put it on him 
 
 bode was bewitched to remove something ron said butharry got to be 
 
 the weapon harry finished the sentence for him i know 
 
 the dormitory door opened dean and seamus came in harry swung his legs back into bed he did not want to look as though anything odd had just happened seeing as seamus had only just stopped thinking harry was a nutter 
 
 did you say murmured ron putting his head close to on the pretence of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table that you were 
 
 yeah said harry quietly 
 
 ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water harry saw it spill over his chin on to his chest 
 
 harry he said as dean and seamus clattered around noisily pulling off their robes and talking got to tell 
 
 i got to tell anyone said harry shortly i have seen it at all if i could do occlumency supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out what they want 
 
 by they he meant dumbledore he got back into bed and rolled over on to his side with his back to ron and after a while he heard mattress creak as he too lay back down scar began to burn he bit hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise somewhere he knew avery was being punished 
 
 harry and ron waited until break next morning to tell hermione exactly what had happened they wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember when he had finished she said nothing at all for a few moments but stared with a kind of painful intensity at fred and george who were both headless and selling their magical hats from under their cloaks on the other side of the yard 
 
 so why they killed him she said quietly withdrawing her gaze from fred and george at last when bode tried to steal this weapon something funny happened to him i think there must be defensive spells on it or around it to stop people touching it why he was in st mungos his brain had gone all funny and he talk but remember what the healer told us he was recovering and they risk him getting better could they i mean the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the imperius curse lift once got his voice back explain what been doing he they would have known been sent to steal the weapon of course it would have been easy for lucius malfoy to put the curse on him never out of the ministry is he 
 
 he was even hanging around that day i had my hearing said harry in thehang on he said slowly he was in the department of mysteries corridor that day your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing but what if 
 
 sturgis gasped hermione looking thunderstruck 
 
 sorry said ron looking bewildered 
 
 sturgis podmore said hermione breathlessly arrested for trying to get through a door lucius malfoy must have got him too i bet he did it the day you saw him there harry sturgis had invisibility cloak right so what if he was standing guard by the door invisible and malfoy heard him moveor guessed someone was thereor just did the imperius curse on the be a guard there so when sturgis next had an opportunityprobably when it was his turn on guard duty againhe tried to get into the department to steal the weapon for voldemortron be quietbut he got caught and sent to azkaban 
 
 she gazed at harry 
 
 and now told voldemort how to get the weapon 
 
 i hear all the conversation but what it sounded like said harry rookwood used to work there maybe send rookwood to do it 
 
 hermione nodded apparently still lost in thought then quite abruptly she said but you have seen this at all harry 
 
 what he said taken aback 
 
 supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing said hermione suddenly stern 
 
 i know i am said harry but 
 
 well i think we should just try and forget what you saw said hermione firmly and you ought to put in a bit more effort on your occlumency from now on 
 
 harry was so angry with her he did not talk to her for the rest of the day which proved to be another bad one when people were not discussing the escaped death eaters in the corridors they were laughing at abysmal performance in their match against hufflepuff the slytherins were singing weasley is our king so loudly and frequently that by sundown filch had banned it from the corridors out of sheer irritation 
 
 the week did not improve as it progressed harry received two more ds in potions he was still on tenterhooks that hagrid might get the sack and he stop himself dwelling on the dream in which he had been voldemortthough he bring it up with ron and hermione again he want another from hermione he wished very much that he could have talked to sirius about it but that was out of the question so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind 
 
 unfortunately the back of his mind was no longer the secure place it had once been 
 
 get up potter 
 
 a couple of weeks after his dream of rookwood harry was to be found yet again kneeling on the floor of office trying to clear his head he had just been forced yet again to relive a stream of very early memories he had not even realised he still had most of them concerning humiliations dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school 
 
 that last memory said snape what was it 
 
 i know said harry getting wearily to his feet he was finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memories from the rush of images and sound that snape kept calling forth you mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet 
 
 no said snape softly i mean the one with a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room 
 
 nothing said harry 
 
 dark eyes bored into remembering what snape had said about eye contact being crucial to legilimency harry blinked and looked away 
 
 how do that man and that room come to be inside your head potter said snape 
 
 it said harry looking everywhere but at snape it wasjust a dream i had 
 
 a dream repeated snape 
 
 there was a pause during which harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a jar of purple liquid 
 
 you do know why we are here you potter said snape in a low dangerous voice you do know why i am giving up my evenings to this tedious job 
 
 yes said harry stiffly 
 
 remind me why we are here potter 
 
 so i can learn occlumency said harry now glaring at a dead eel 
 
 correct potter and dim though you may be harry looked back at snape hating him i would have thought that after over two months of lessons you might have made some progress how many other dreams about the dark lord have you had 
 
 just that one lied harry 
 
 perhaps said snape his dark cold eyes narrowing slightly perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams potter maybe they make you feel special important 
 
 no they said harry his jaw set and his fingers clenched tightly around the handle of his wand 
 
 that is just as well potter said snape coldly because you are neither special nor important and it is not up to you to find out what the dark lord is saying to his death eaters 
 
 your job it harry shot at him 
 
 he had not meant to say it it had burst out of him in temper for a long moment they stared at each other harry convinced he had gone too far but there was a curious almost satisfied expression on face when he answered 
 
 yes potter he said his eyes glinting that is my job now if you are ready we will start again 
 
 he raised his wand onetwothreelegilimens 
 
 a hundred dementors were swooping towards harry across the lake in the grounds he screwed up his face in concentration they were coming closer he could see the dark holes beneath their hoods yet he could also see snape standing in front of him his eyes fixed on face muttering under his breath and somehow snape was growing clearer and the dementors were growing fainter 
 
 harry raised his own wand 
 
 protego 
 
 snape staggered his wand flew upwards away from harryand suddenly mind was teeming with memories that were not his a man was shouting at a cowering woman while a small boy cried in a corner a teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom pointing his wand at the ceiling shooting down flies a girl was laughing as a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick 
 
 enough 
 
 harry felt as though he had been pushed hard in the chest he staggered several steps backwards hit some of the shelves covering walls and heard something crack snape was shaking slightly and was very white in the face 
 
 the back of robes was damp one of the jars behind him had broken when he fell against it the pickled slimy thing within was swirling in its draining potion 
 
 reparo hissed snape and the jar sealed itself at once well potter that was certainly an improvement panting slightly snape straightened the pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thoughts before starting the lesson almost as though he was checking they were still there i remember telling you to use a shield charm but there is no doubt that it was effective 
 
 harry did not speak he felt that to say anything might be dangerous he was sure he had just broken into memories that he had just seen scenes from childhood it was unnerving to think that the little boy who had been crying as he watched his parents shouting was actually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eyes 
 
 try again shall we said snape 
 
 harry felt a thrill of dread he was about to pay for what had just happened he was sure of it they moved back into position with the desk between them harry feeling he was going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time 
 
 on the count of three then said snape raising his wand once more onetwo 
 
 harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind before snape cried legilimens 
 
 he was hurtling along the corridor towards the department of masteries past the blank stone walls past the torchesthe plain black door was growing ever larger he was moving so fast he was going to collide with it he was feet from it and again he could see that chink of faint blue light 
 
 the door had flown open he was through it at last inside a circular room lit with candles and there were more doors all around himhe needed to go onbut which door ought he to take 
 
 p otter 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was flat on his back again with no memory of having got there he was also panting as though his really had run the length of the department of mysteries corridor really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room 
 
 explain yourself said snape who was standing over him looking furious 
 
 i dunno what happened said harry truthfully standing up there was a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish never seen that before i mean i told you dreamed about the door but never opened before 
 
 you are not working hard enough 
 
 for some reason snape seemed even angrier than he had done two minutes before when harry had seen into his memories 
 
 you are lazy and sloppy potter it is small wonder that the dark lord 
 
 can you tell me something sir said harry firing up again why do you call voldemort the dark lord only ever heard death eaters call him that 
 
 snape opened his mouth in a snarland a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room 
 
 head jerked upwards he was gazing at the ceiling 
 
 what the he muttered 
 
 harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he thought might be the entrance hall snape looked round at him frowning 
 
 did you see anything unusual on your way down here potter 
 
 harry shook his head somewhere above them the woman screamed again snape strode to his office door his wand still held at the ready and swept out of sight harry hesitated for a moment then followed 
 
 the screams were indeed coming from the entrance hall they grew louder as harry ran towards the stone steps leading up from the dungeons when he reached the top he found the entrance hall packed students had come flooding out of the great hall where dinner was still in progress to see what was going on others had crammed themselves on to the marble staircase harry pushed forwards through a knot of tall slytherins and saw that the onlookers had formed a great ring some of them looking shocked others even frightened professor mcgonagall was directly opposite harry en the other side of the hall she looked as though what she was watching made her feel faintly sick 
 
 professor trelawney was standing in the middle of the entrance hall with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other looking utterly mad her hair was sticking up on end her glasses were lopsided so that one eye was magnified more than the other her innumerable shawls and scarves were trailing haphazardly from her shoulders giving the impression that she was falling apart at the seams two large trunks lay on the floor beside her one of them it looked very much as though it had been thrown down the stairs after her professor trelawney was staring apparently terrified at something harry could not see but which seemed to be standing at the foot of the stairs 
 
 no she shrieked no this cannot be happening it cannot i retuse to accept it 
 
 you realise this was coming said a high girlish voice sounding callously amused and harry moving slightly to his right saw that terrifying vision was nothing other than professor umbridge incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrows weather you must surely have realised that your pitiful performance during my inspections and lack of any improvement would make it inevitable that you would be sacked 
 
 you howled professor trelawney tears streaming down her face from behind her enormous lenses you sack me bbeen here sixteen years h hogwarts is mmy hhome 
 
 it was your home said professor umbridge and harry was revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face as she watched professor trelawney sink sobbing uncontrollably on to one of her trunks until an hour ago when the minister for magic countersigned your order of dismissal now kindly remove yourself from this hall you are embarrassing us 
 
 but she stood and watched with an expression of gloating enjoyment as professor trelawney shuddered and moaned rocking backwards and forwards on her trunk in paroxysms of grief harry heard a muffled sob to his left and looked around lavender and parvati were both crying quietly their arms round each other then he heard footsteps professor mcgonagall had broken away from the spectators marched straight up to professor trelawney and was patting her firmly on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robes 
 
 there there sybill calm down blow your nose on this not as bad as you think now you are not going to have to leave hogwarts 
 
 oh really professor mcgonagall said umbridge in a deadly voice taking a few steps forward and your authority for that statement is 
 
 that would be mine said a deep voice 
 
 the oaken front doors had swung open students beside them scuttled out of the way as dumbledore appeared in the entrance what he had been doing out in the grounds harry could not imagine but there was something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night leaving the doors wide open behind him he strode forwards through the circle of onlookers towards professor trelawney and trembling on her trunk professor mcgonagall alongside her 
 
 yours professor dumbledore said umbridge with a singularly unpleasant little laugh afraid you do not understand the position i have here she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robes an order of dismissal signed by myself and the minister for magic under the terms of educational decree number the high inquisitor of hogwarts has the power to inspect place upon probation and sack any teacher shethat is to say ifeel is not performing to the standards required by the ministry of magic i have decided that professor trelawney is not up to scratch i have dismissed her 
 
 to very great surprise dumbledore continued to smile he looked down at professor trelawney who was still sobbing and choking on her trunk and said you are quite right of course professor umbridge as high inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teachers you do not however have the authority to send them away from the castle i am afraid he went on with a courteous little bow that the power to do that still resides with the headmaster and it is my wish that professor trelawney continue to live at hogwarts 
 
 at this professor trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccough was barely hidden 
 
 nono g go dumbledore i shshallleave hogwarts and sseek my fortune elsewhere 
 
 no said dumbledore sharply it is my wish that you remain sybill 
 
 he turned to professor mcgonagall 
 
 might i ask you to escort sybill back upstairs professor mcgonagall 
 
 of course said mcgonagall up you get sybill 
 
 professor sprout came hurrying forwards out of the crowd and grabbed professor other arm together they guided her past umbridge and up the marble stairs professor flitwick went scurrying after them his wand held out before him he squeaked locomotor trunks and professor luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her professor flitwick bringing up the rear 
 
 professor umbridge was standing stock still staring at dumbledore who continued to smile benignly 
 
 and what she said in a whisper that carried all around the eintrance hall are you going to do with her once i appoint a new divination teacher who needs her lodgings 
 
 oh that be a problem said dumbledore pleasantly you see i have already found us a new divination teacher and he will prefer lodgings on the ground floor 
 
 found said umbridge shrilly found might i remind you dumbledore that under educational decree number 
 
 the ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate ifand only ifthe headmaster is unable to find one said dumbledore and i am happy to say that on this occasion i have succeeded may i introduce you 
 
 he turned to face the open front doors through which night mist was now drifting harry heard hooves there was a shocked murmur around the hall and those nearest the doors hastily moved even further backwards some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer 
 
 through the mist came a face harry had seen once before on a dark dangerous night in the forbidden forest hair and astonishingly blue eyes the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse 
 
 this is firenze said dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck umbridge i think find him suitable 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the cavecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves a light chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and sky he was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock water foaming and churning below him he glanced over his shoulder a towering cliff stood behind them a sheer drop black and faceless a few large chunks of rock such as the one upon which harry and dumbledore were standing looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past it was a bleak harsh view the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand 
 
 what do you think asked dumbledore he might have been asking opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic 
 
 they brought the kids from the orphanage here asked harry who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip 
 
 not here precisely said dumbledore there is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us i believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves no i think it was only ever tom riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot no muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers and boats cannot approach the cliffs the waters around them are too dangerous i imagine that riddle climbed down magic would have served better than ropes and he brought two small children with him probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them i think the journey alone would have done it you 
 
 harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps 
 
 but his final destinationand ourslies a little farther on come 
 
 dumbledore beckoned harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders that lay in water and closer to the cliff it was a treacherous descent and dumbledore hampered slightly by his withered hand moved slowly the lower rocks were slippery with seawater harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face 
 
 lumos said dumbledore as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face a thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too 
 
 you see said dumbledore quietly holding his wand a little higher harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling 
 
 you will not object to getting a little wet 
 
 no said harry 
 
 then take off your invisibility cloakthere is no need for it nowand let us take the plunge 
 
 and with the sudden agility of a much younger man dumbledore slid from the boulder landed in the sea and began to swim with a perfect breaststroke toward the dark slit in the rock face his lit wand held in his teeth harry pulled off his cloak stuffed it into his pocket and followed 
 
 the water was icy waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed he struck out for the shimmering shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff the fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide the slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of wand a little way in the passageway curved to the left and harry saw that it extended far into the cliff he continued to swim in wake the tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the rough wet rock 
 
 then he saw dumbledore rising out of the water ahead his silver hair and dark robes gleaming when harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a large cave he clambered up them water streaming from his soaking clothes and emerged shivering uncontrollably into the still and freezing air 
 
 dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot examining the walls and ceiling 
 
 yes this is the place said dumbledore 
 
 how can you tell harry spoke in a whisper 
 
 it has known magic said dumbledore simply harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his coldness or to the same awareness of enchantments he watched as dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot evidently concentrating on things harry could not see 
 
 this is merely the antechamber the entrance hall said dumbledore after a moment or two we need to penetrate the inner place now it is lord obstacles that stand in our way rather than those nature made 
 
 dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips murmuring words in a strange tongue that harry did not understand twice dumbledore walked right around the cave touching as much of the rough rock as he could occasionally pausing running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot until finally he stopped his hand pressed flat against the wall 
 
 here he said we go on through here the entrance is concealed 
 
 harry did not ask how dumbledore knew he had never seen a wizard work things out like this simply by looking and touching but harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise 
 
 dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock for a moment an arched outline appeared there blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack 
 
 it said harry through chattering teeth but before the words had left his lips the outline had gone leaving the rock as bare and solid as ever dumbledore looked around 
 
 harry so sorry i forgot he said he now pointed his wand at harry and at once clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire 
 
 thank you said harry gratefully but dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall he did not try any more magic but simply stood there staring at it intently as though something extremely interesting was written on it harry stayed quite still he did not want to break concentration 
 
 then after two solid minutes dumbledore said quietly oh surely not so crude 
 
 what is it professor 
 
 i rather think said dumbledore putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind harry used to chop potion ingredients that we are required to make payment to pass 
 
 payment said harry got to give the door something 
 
 yes said dumbledore blood if i am not much mistaken 
 
 blood 
 
 i said it was crude said dumbledore who sounded disdainful even disappointed as though voldemort had fallen short of higher standards dumbledore expected the idea as i am sure you will have gathered is that your enemy must weaken him or herself to enter once again lord voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury 
 
 yeah but still if you can avoid it said harry who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more 
 
 sometimes however it is unavoidable said dumbledore shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his injured hand 
 
 professor protested harry hurrying forward as dumbledore raised his knife do it 
 
 he did not know what he was going to sayyounger fitter but dumbledore merely smiled there was a flash of silver and a spurt of scarlet the rock face was peppered with dark glistening drops 
 
 you are very kind harry said dumbledore now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm so that it healed instantly just as snape had healed wound but your blood is worth more than mine ah that seems to have done the trick it 
 
 the blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more and this time it did not fade away the rock within it simply vanished leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness 
 
 after me i think said dumbledore and he walked through the archway with harry on his heels lighting his own wand hastily as he went 
 
 an eerie sight met their eyes they were standing on the edge of a great black lake so vast that harry could not make out the distant banks in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight a misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake it was reflected in the completely still water below the greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness though their rays did not penetrate as far as harry would have expected the darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness 
 
 let us walk said dumbledore quietly be very careful not to step into the water stay close to me 
 
 he set off around the edge of the lake and harry followed close behind him their footsteps made echoing slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water on and on they walked but the view did not vary on one side of them the rough cavern wall on the other the boundless expanse of smooth glassy blackness in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish glow harry found the place and the silence oppressive unnerving 
 
 professor he said finally do you think the horcrux is here 
 
 oh yes said dumbledore yes sure it is the question is how do we get to it 
 
 we we just try a summoning charm harry said sure that it was a stupid suggestion but he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible 
 
 certainly we could said dumbledore stopping so suddenly that harry almost walked into him why you do it 
 
 me oh okay harry had not expected this but cleared his throat and said loudly wand aloft accio horcrux 
 
 with a noise like an explosion something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away before harry could see what it was it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great deep ripples on the mirrored surface harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall his heart was still thundering as he turned to dumbledore 
 
 what was that 
 
 something i think that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the horcrux 
 
 harry looked back at the water the surface of the lake was once more shining black glass the ripples had vanished unnaturally fast heart however was still pounding 
 
 did you think that would happen sir 
 
 i thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the horcrux that was a very good idea harry much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing 
 
 but we know what the thing was said harry looking at the sinisterly smooth water 
 
 what the things are you mean said dumbledore i doubt very much that there is only one of them shall we walk on 
 
 professor 
 
 yes harry 
 
 do you think going to have to go into the lake 
 
 into it only if we are very unfortunate 
 
 you think the horcrux is at the bottom 
 
 oh no i think the horcrux is in the middle 
 
 and dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake 
 
 so going to have to cross the lake to get to it 
 
 yes i think so 
 
 harry did not say anything his thoughts were all of water monsters of giant serpents of demons kelpies and sprites 
 
 aha said dumbledore and he stopped again this time harry really did walk into him for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water and uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm pulling him back so sorry harry i should have given warning stand back against the wall please i think i have found the place 
 
 harry had no idea what dumbledore meant this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell but dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it this time he was running his hand not over the rocky wall but through the thin air as though expecting to find and grip something invisible 
 
 oho said dumbledore happily seconds later his hand had closed in midair upon something harry could not see dumbledore moved closer to the water harry watched nervously as the tips of buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the rock rim keeping his hand clenched in midair dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point 
 
 immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air extending from the depths of the water into clenched hand dumbledore tapped the chain which began to slide through his fist like a snake coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls pulling something from the depths of the black water harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface glowing as green as the chain and floated with barely a ripple toward the place on the bank where harry and dumbledore stood 
 
 how did you know that was there harry asked in astonishment 
 
 magic always leaves traces said dumbledore as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump sometimes very distinctive traces i taught tom riddle i know his style 
 
 is is this boat safe 
 
 oh yes i think so voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his horcrux 
 
 so the things in the water do anything to us if we cross in boat 
 
 i think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will at some point realize we are not lord voldemort thus far however we have done well they have allowed us to raise the boat 
 
 but why have they let us asked harry who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank 
 
 voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat said dumbledore i think he would have been prepared to risk what was to his mind the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate we shall see whether he was right 
 
 harry looked down into the boat it really was very small 
 
 it look like it was built for two people will it hold both of us will we be too heavy together 
 
 dumbledore chuckled 
 
 voldemort will not have cared about the weight but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake i rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it 
 
 but then 
 
 i do not think you will count harry you are underage and unqualified voldemort would never have expected a to reach this place i think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine 
 
 these words did nothing to raise morale perhaps dumbledore knew it for he added mistake harry mistake age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth now you first this time and be careful not to touch the water 
 
 dumbledore stood aside and harry climbed carefully into the boat dumbledore stepped in too coiling the chain onto the floor they were crammed in together harry could not comfortably sit but crouched his knees jutting over the edge of the boat which began to move at once there was no sound other than the silken rustle of the prow cleaving the water it moved without their help as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center soon they could no longer see the walls of the cavern they might have been at sea except that there were no waves 
 
 harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed the boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface grooves in the dark mirror 
 
 and then harry saw it marble white floating inches below the surface 
 
 professor he said and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water 
 
 harry 
 
 i think i saw a hand in the watera human hand 
 
 yes i am sure you did said dumbledore calmly 
 
 harry stared down into the water looking for the vanished hand and a sick feeling rose in his throat 
 
 so that thing that jumped out of the water but harry had his answer before dumbledore could reply the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him this time a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface his open eyes misted as though with cobwebs his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke 
 
 there are bodies in here said harry and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own 
 
 yes said dumbledore placidly but we do not need to worry about them at the moment 
 
 at the moment harry repeated tearing his gaze from the water to look at dumbledore 
 
 not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us said dumbledore there is nothing to be feared from a body harry any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness lord voldemort who of course secretly fears both disagrees but once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom it is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness nothing more 
 
 harry said nothing he did not want to argue but he found the idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them horrible and what was more he did not believe that they were not dangerous 
 
 but one of them jumped he said trying to make his voice as level and calm as when i tried to summon the horcrux a body leapt out of the lake 
 
 yes said dumbledore i am sure that once we take the horcrux we shall find them less peaceable however like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness they fear light and warmth which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise fire harry dumbledore added with a smile in response to bewildered expression 
 
 oh right said harry quickly he turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably sailing he could not pretend now that he was not scared the great black lake teeming with the dead it seemed hours and hours ago that he had met professor trelawney that he had given ron and hermione felix felicis he suddenly wished he had said a better goodbye to the and he seen ginny at all 
 
 nearly there said dumbledore cheerfully 
 
 sure enough the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last and within minutes the boat had come to a halt bumping gently into something that harry could not see at first but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake 
 
 careful not to touch the water said dumbledore again as harry climbed out of the boat 
 
 the island was no larger than office an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light which looked much brighter when viewed close to harry squinted at it at first he thought it was a lamp of some kind but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin rather like the pensieve which was set on top of a pedestal 
 
 dumbledore approached the basin and harry followed side by side they looked down into it the basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that phosphorescent glow 
 
 what is it asked harry quietly 
 
 i am not sure said dumbledore something more worrisome than blood and bodies however dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion 
 
 sir no touch 
 
 i cannot touch said dumbledore smiling faintly see i cannot approach any nearer than this you try 
 
 staring harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion he met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it no matter how hard he pushed his fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and flexible air 
 
 out of the way please harry said dumbledore 
 
 he raised his wand and made complicated movements over the surface of murmuring soundlessly nothing happened except per haps that the potion glowed a little brighter harry remained silent while dumbledore worked but after a while dumbledore withdrew his wand and harry felt it was safe to talk again 
 
 you think the horcrux is in there sir 
 
 oh yes dumbledore peered more closely into the basin harry saw his face reflected upside down in the smooth surface of the green potion but how to reach it this potion cannot be penetrated by hand vanished parted scooped up or siphoned away nor can it be transfigured charmed or otherwise made to change its nature 
 
 almost dumbledore raised his wand again twirled it once in midair and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere 
 
 i can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk 
 
 what said harry no 
 
 yes i think so only by drinking it can i empty the basin and see what lies in its depths 
 
 but what if what if it kills you 
 
 oh i doubt that it would work like that said dumbledore easily lord voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island 
 
 harry believe it was this more of insane determination to see good in everyone 
 
 sir said harry trying to keep his voice reasonable sir this is voldemort 
 
 sorry harry i should have said he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island dumbledore corrected himself he would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and most importantly of all why they were so intent upon emptying the basin do not forget that lord voldemort believes that he alone knows about his horcruxes 
 
 harry made to speak again but this time dumbledore raised his hand for silence frowning slightly at the emerald liquid evidently thinking hard 
 
 undoubtedly he said finally this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the horcrux it might paralyze me cause me to forget what i am here for create so much pain i am distracted or render me incapable in some other way this being the case harry it will be your job to make sure i keep drinking even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth you understand 
 
 their eyes met over the basin each pale face lit with that strange green light harry did not speak was this why he had been invited alongso that he could dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain 
 
 you remember said dumbledore the condition on which i brought you with me 
 
 harry hesitated looking into the blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin 
 
 but what if 
 
 you swore did you not to follow any command i gave you 
 
 yes but 
 
 i warned you did i not that there might be danger 
 
 yes said harry but 
 
 well then said dumbledore shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet you have my orders 
 
 why i drink the potion instead asked harry desperately 
 
 because i am much older much cleverer and much less valuable said dumbledore once and for all harry do i have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking 
 
 
 
 do i have it 
 
 but 
 
 your word harry 
 
 i all right but 
 
 before harry could make any further protest dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion for a split second harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had when the glass was full to the brim dumbledore lifted it to his mouth 
 
 your good health harry 
 
 and he drained the goblet harry watched terrified his hands gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb 
 
 professor he said anxiously as dumbledore lowered the empty glass how do you feel 
 
 dumbledore shook his head his eyes closed harry wondered whether he was in pain dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin refilled it and drank once more 
 
 in silence dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion then halfway through the fourth goblet he staggered and fell forward against the basin his eyes were still closed his breathing heavy 
 
 professor dumbledore said harry his voice strained can you hear me 
 
 dumbledore did not answer his face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep but dreaming a horrible dream his grip on the goblet was slackening the potion was about to spill from it harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup holding it steady 
 
 professor can you hear me he repeated loudly his voice echoing around the cavern 
 
 dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice harry did not recognize for he had never heard dumbledore frightened like this 
 
 i want make me 
 
 harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well at the crooked nose and spectacles and did not know what to do 
 
 like want to stop moaned dumbledore 
 
 you you stop professor said harry got to keep drinking remember you told me you had to keep drinking here 
 
 hating himself repulsed by what he was doing harry forced the goblet back toward mouth and tipped it so that dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside 
 
 no he groaned as harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him i want to i want to let me go 
 
 all right professor said harry his hand shaking all right here 
 
 make it stop make it stop moaned dumbledore 
 
 yes yes make it stop lied harry he tipped the contents of the goblet into open mouth dumbledore screamed the noise echoed all around the vast chamber across the dead black water 
 
 no no no no i i make me i want to 
 
 all right professor all right said harry loudly his hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth gobletful of potion the basin was now half empty happening to you safe it real i swear it realtake this now take this 
 
 and obediently dumbledore drank as though it was an antidote harry offered him but upon draining the goblet he sank to his knees shaking uncontrollably 
 
 all my fault all my fault he sobbed please make it stop i know i did wrong oh please make it stop and never never again 
 
 this will make it stop professor harry said his voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into mouth 
 
 dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from trembling hands as he moaned hurt them hurt them please please my fault hurt me instead 
 
 here drink this drink this be all right said harry desperately and once again dumbledore obeyed him opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to foot 
 
 and now he fell forward screaming again hammering his fists upon the ground while harry filled the ninth goblet 
 
 please please please no not that not that do anything 
 
 just drink professor just drink 
 
 dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst but when he had finished he yelled again as though his insides were on fire 
 
 no more please no more 
 
 harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin 
 
 nearly there professor drink this drink it 
 
 he supported shoulders and again dumbledore drained the glass then harry was on his feet once more refilling the goblet as dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever i want to die i want to die make it stop make it stop i want to die 
 
 drink this professor drink this 
 
 dumbledore drank and no sooner had he finished than he yelled kill me 
 
 thisthis one will gasped harry just drink this be over all over 
 
 dumbledore gulped at the goblet drained every last drop and then with a great rattling gasp rolled over onto his face 
 
 no shouted harry who had stood to refill the goblet again instead he dropped the cup into the basin flung himself down beside dumbledore and heaved him over onto his back glasses were askew his mouth agape his eyes closed no said harry shaking dumbledore no not dead you said it poison wake up wake uprennervate he cried his wand pointing at chest there was a flash of red light but nothing happened rennervatesirplease 
 
 eyelids flickered heart leapt 
 
 sir are you 
 
 water croaked dumbledore 
 
 water panted harry yes 
 
 he leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it 
 
 aguamenti he shouted jabbing the goblet with his wand 
 
 the goblet filled with clear water harry dropped to his knees beside dumbledore raised his head and brought the glass to his lipsbut it was empty dumbledore groaned and began to pant 
 
 but i had somewaitaguamenti said harry again pointing his wand at the goblet once more for a second clear water gleamed within it but as he approached mouth the water vanished again 
 
 sir trying trying said harry desperately but he did not think that dumbledore could hear him he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great rattling breaths that sounded agonizing aguamentiaguamentiaguamenti 
 
 the goblet filled and emptied once more and now breathing was fading his brain whirling in panic harry knew instinctively the only way left to get water because voldemort had planned it so 
 
 he flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish sirhere harry yelled and lunging forward he tipped the water clumsily over face 
 
 it was the best he could do for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water a slimy white hand had gripped his wrist and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him slowly backward across the rock the surface of the lake was no longer it was churning and everywhere harry looked white heads and hands were emerging from the dark water men and women and children with sunken sightless eyes were moving toward the rock an army of the dead rising from the black water 
 
 petrificus totalus yelled harry struggling to cling to the smooth soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at the inferius that had his arm it released him falling backward into the water with a splash he scrambled to his feet but many more inferi were already climbing onto the rock their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface their blank frosted eyes upon him trailing waterlogged rags sunken faces leering 
 
 petrificus totalus harry bellowed again backing away as he swiped his wand through the air six or seven of them crumpled but more were coming toward him impedimenta incarcerous 
 
 a few of them stumbled one or two of them bound in ropes but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies still slashing at the air with his wand harry yelled sectumsempra sectumsempra 
 
 but though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin they had no blood to spill they walked on unfeeling their shrunken hands outstretched toward him and as he backed away still farther he felt arms enclose him from behind thin fleshless arms cold as death and his feet left the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him slowly and surely back to the water and he knew there would be no release that he would be drowned and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of shattered soul 
 
 but then through the darkness fire erupted crimson and gold a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the inferi holding harry so tightly stumbled and faltered they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water they dropped harry he hit the ground slipped on the rock and fell grazing his arms then scrambled back up raising his wand and staring around 
 
 dumbledore was on his feet again pale as any of the surrounding inferi but taller than any too the fire dancing in his eyes his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames like a vast lasso encircling them all with warmth 
 
 the inferi bumped into each other attempting blindly to escape the fire in which they were enclosed 
 
 dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robes wordlessly he gestured to harry to come to his side distracted by the flames the inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as dumbledore led harry back to the boat the ring of fire moving with them around them the bewildered inferi accompanying them to the waters edge where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters 
 
 harry who was shaking all over thought for a moment that dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat he staggered a little as he attempted it all his efforts seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them harry seized him and helped him back to his seat once they were both safely jammed inside again the boat began to move back across the black water away from the rock still encircled by that ring of fire and it seemed that the inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface 
 
 sir panted harry sir i forgotabout firethey were coming at me and i panicked 
 
 quite understandable murmured dumbledore harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was 
 
 they reached the bank with a little bump and harry leapt out then turned quickly to help dumbledore the moment that dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall the ring of fire vanished but the inferi did not emerge again from the water the little boat sank into the water once more clanking and tinkling its chain slithered back into the lake too dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall 
 
 i am weak he said 
 
 worry sir said harry at once anxious about extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion worry get us back lean on me sir 
 
 and pulling uninjured arm around his shoulders harry guided his headmaster back around the lake bearing most of his weight 
 
 the protection was after all said dumbledore faintly one alone could not have done it you did well very well harry 
 
 talk now said harry fearing how slurred voice had become how much his feet dragged save your energy sir soon be out of here 
 
 the archway will have sealed again my knife 
 
 no need i got cut on the rock said harry firmly just tell me where 
 
 here 
 
 harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone having received its tribute of blood the archway reopened instantly they crossed the outer cave and harry helped dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff 
 
 going to be all right sir harry said over and over again more worried by silence than he had been by his weakened voice nearly there i can apparate us both back worry 
 
 i am not worried harry said dumbledore his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water i am with you 
 
 rowling

 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter gringottscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 their plans were made their preparations complete in the smallest bedroom a single long coarse black hair plucked from the sweater hermione had been wearing at malfoy manor lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece 
 
 and youll be using her actual wand said harry nodding toward the walnut wand so i reckon youll be pretty convincing 
 
 hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bit her as she picked it up 
 
 i hate that thing she said in a low voice i really hate it it feels all wrong it doesnt work properly for me its like a bit of her 
 
 harry could not help but remember how hermione has dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn wand insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own telling him to simply practice he chose not to repeat her own advice back to her however the eve of their attempted assault on gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her 
 
 itll probably help you get in character though said ron think what that wands done 
 
 but thats my point said hermione this is the wand that tortured nevilles mum and dad and who knows how many other people this is the wand that killed sirius 
 
 harry had not thought of that he looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to snap it to slice it in half with gryffindors sword which was propped against the wall beside him 
 
 i miss my wand hermione said miserably i wish mr ollivander could have made me another one too 
 
 mr ollivander had sent luna a new wand that morning she was out on the back lawn at that moment testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun dean who had lost his wand to the snatchers was watching rather gloomily 
 
 harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to draco malfoy he had been surprised but pleased to discover that it worked for him at least as well as hermiones had done remembering what ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands harry thought he knew what hermiones problem was she had not won the walnut wands allegiance by taking it personally from bellatrix 
 
 the door of the bedroom opened and griphook entered harry reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to him but regretted his action at once he could tell that the goblin had noticed seeking to gloss over the sticky moment he said weve just been checking the stuff griphook weve told bill and fleur were leaving tomorrow and weve told them not to get up to see us off 
 
 they had been firm on this point because hermione would need to transform in bellatrix before they left and the less that bill and fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do the better they had also explained that they would not be returning as they had lost perkins old tent on the night that the snatchers caught them bill had lent them another one it was now packed inside the beaded bag which harry was impressed to learn hermione had protected from the snatchers by the simple expedient of stuffing it down her sock 
 
 though he would miss bill fleur luna and dean not to mention the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of shell cottage he was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard tired of being shut in the tiny dark bedroom most of all he longed to be rid of griphook however precisely how and when they were to part from the goblin without handing over gryffindors sword remained a question to which harry had no answer it had been impossible to decide how they were going to do it because the goblin rarely left harry ron and hermione alone together for more than five minutes at a time he could give my mother lessons growled ron as the goblins long fingers kept appearing around the edges of doors with bills warning in mind harry could not help suspecting that griphook was on the watch for possible skullduggery hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned that harry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it ron on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch a few moments had come up with nothing better than well just have to wing it mate 
 
 harry slept badly that night lying away in the early hours he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had infiltrated the ministry of magic and remembered a determination almost an excitement now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety nagging doubts he could not shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong he kept telling himself that their plan was good that griphook knew what they were facing that they were for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter yet still he felt uneasy once or twice he heard ron stir and was sure that he too was awake but they were sharing the sitting room with dean so harry did not speak 
 
 it was a relief when six arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags dress in the semidarkness then creep out into the garden where they were to meet hermione and griphook the dawn was chilly but there was little wind now that it was may harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the cliff he was going to miss the sound 
 
 small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of dobbys grave now in a years time the mound would be covered in flowers the white stone that bore the elfs name had already acquired a weathered look he realized now that they could hardly have laid dobby to rest in a more beautiful place but harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind looking down on the grave he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them his fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck thorough which he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen dumbledores eye then the sound of a door opening made him look around 
 
 bellatrix lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them accompanied by griphook as she walked she was tucking the small beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old robes they had taken from grimmauld place though harry knew perfectly well that it was really hermione he could not suppress a shiver of loathing she was taller than he was her long black hair rippling down her back her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him but then she spoke and he heard hermione through bellatrixs low voice 
 
 she tasted disgusting worse than gurdyroots okay ron come here so i can do you 
 
 right but remember i dont like the beard too long 
 
 oh for heavens sake this isnt about looking handsome 
 
 its not that it gets in the way but i liked my nose a bit shorter try and do it the way you did last time 
 
 hermione sighed and set to work muttering under her breath as she transformed various aspects of rons appearance he was to be given a completely fake identity and they were trusting to the malevolent aura cast by bellatrix to protect him meanwhile harry and griphook were to be concealed under the invisibility cloak 
 
 there said hermione how does he look harry 
 
 it was just not possible to discern ron under his disguise but only harry thought because he knew him so well rons hair was now long and wavy he had a thick brown beard and mustache no freckles a short broad nose and heavy eyebrows 
 
 well hes not my type but hell do said harry shall we go then 
 
 all three of them glanced back at shell cottage lying dark and silent under the fading stars then turned and began to walk toward the point just beyond the boundary wall where the fidelius chard stopped working and they would be able to disapparate once past the gate griphook spoke 
 
 i should climb up now harry potter i think 
 
 harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back his hands linked on front of harrys throat he was not heavy but harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with which he clung on hermione pulled the invisibility cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it over them both 
 
 perfect she said bending down to check harrys feet i cant see a thing lets go 
 
 harry turned on the spot with griphook on his shoulders concentrating with all his might on the leaky cauldron the inn that was the entrance to diagon alley the goblin clung even tighter as they moved into the compressing darkness and seconds later harrys feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on charing cross road muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions of early morning quite unconscious of the little inns existence 
 
 the bar of the leaky cauldron was nearly deserted ton the stooped and toothless landlord was polishing glasses behind the bar counter a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation in the far corner glanced at hermione and drew back into the shadows 
 
 madam lestrange murmured tom and as hermione paused he inclined his head subserviently 
 
 good morning said hermione and as harry crept past still carrying griphook piggyback under the cloak he saw tom look surprised 
 
 too polite harry whispered in hermiones ear as they passed out of the inn into the tiny backyard you need to treat people like theyre scum 
 
 okay okay 
 
 hermione drew out bellatrixs wand and rapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them at once the bricks began to whirl and spin a hole appeared in the middle of them which grew wider and wider finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was diagon alley 
 
 it was quiet barely time for the shops to open and there were hardly and shoppers abroad the crooked cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place harry had visited before his first team at hogwarts so many years before more shops than ever were boarded up though several new establishments dedicated to the dark arts had been created since his last visit harrys own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows always captioned with the words undesirable number one 
 
 a number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways he heard them moaning to the few passersby pleading for gold insisting that they were really wizards one man had a bloody bandage over his eye 
 
 as they set off along the street the beggars glimpsed hermione they seemed to melt away before her drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could hermione looked after them curiously until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path 
 
 my children he bellowed pointing at her his voice was cracked he sounded distraught where are my children what has he done with them you know you know 
 
 ici reallyc stammered hermione 
 
 the man lunged at her reaching for her throat then with a bang and a burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground unconscious ron stood there his wand still outstretched and a look of shock visible behind his beard faces appeared at the windows on either side of the street while a little knot of passerby gathered their robes about them and broke into gentle trots keen to vacate the scene their entrance into diagon alley could hardly have been more conspicuous for a moment harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan before they could move or consult one another however they heard a cry from behind them 
 
 why madam lestrange 
 
 harry whirled around and griphook tightened his hold around harrys neck a tall think wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long sharp nose was striding toward them 
 
 its travers hissed the goblin into harrys ear but at that moment harry could not think who travers was hermione had drawn herself up to full height and said with as much contempt as she could muster 
 
 and what do you want 
 
 travers stopped in his tracks clearly affronted 
 
 hes another death eater breathed griphook and harry sidled sideways to repeat the information into hermiones ear 
 
 i merely sought to greet you said travers coolly but if my presence is not welcome 
 
 harry recognized his voice now travers was one of the death eaters who had been summoned to xenophiliuss house 
 
 no no not at all travers said hermione quickly trying to cover up her mistake how are you 
 
 well i confess i am surprised to see you out and about bellatrix 
 
 really why asked hermione 
 
 well travers coughed i heard that the inhabitants of malfoy manor were confined to the house after the ah escape 
 
 harry willed hermione to keep her head if this was true and bellatrix was not supposed to be out in publicc the dark lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past said hermione in a magnificent imitation of bellatrixs most contemptuous manner perhaps your credit is not as good with him as mine is travers 
 
 though the death eater looked offended he also seemed less suspicious he glanced down at the man ron had just stunned 
 
 how did it offend you 
 
 it does not matter it will not do so again said hermione coolly 
 
 some of these wandless can be troublesome said travers while they do nothing but beg i have no objection but one of them actually asked me to plead her case in the ministry last week im a witch sir im a witch let me prove it to you he said in a squeaky impersonation as if i was going to give her my wandcbut whose wand said travers curiously are you using at the moment bellatrix i heard that your own wasc 
 
 i have my wand here said hermione coldly holding up bellatrixs wand i dont know what rumors you have been listening to travers but you seem sadly misinformed 
 
 travers seemed a little taken aback at that and he turned instead to ron 
 
 who is your friend i do not recognize him 
 
 this is dragomir despard said hermione they had decided that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover for ron to assume he speaks very little english but he is in sympathy with the dark lords aims he has traveled here from transylvania to see our new regime 
 
 indeed how do you do dragomir 
 
 ow you said ron holding out his hand 
 
 travers extended two fingers and shook rons hand as though frightened of dirtying himself 
 
 so what brings you and yourcahcsympathetic friend to diagon alley this early asked travers 
 
 i need to visit gringotts said hermione 
 
 alas i also said travers gold filthy gold we cannot live without it yet i confess i deplore the necessity of consorting with our friends 
 
 harry felt griphooks clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck 
 
 shall we said travers gesturing hermione forward 
 
 hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked cobbled street toward the place where the gringotts stood towering over the other little shops ron sloped along beside them and harry and griphook followed 
 
 a watchful death eater was the very last thing they needed and the worst of it was with travers matching at what he believed to be bellatrixs side there was no means for harry to communicate with hermione or ron all too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors as griphook had already warned them the liveried goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards both of whom were clutching long thin golden rods 
 
 ah probity probes signed travers theatrically so crudecbut so effective 
 
 and he set off up the steps nodding left and right to the wizards who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his body the probes harry knew detected spells of concealment and hidden magical objects knowing that he had only seconds harry pointed dracos wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured confundo twice unnoticed by travers who was looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall each of the guards gave a little start as the spells hit them 
 
 hermiones long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps 
 
 one moment madam said the guard raising his probe 
 
 but youve just done that said hermione in bellatrixs commanding arrogant voice travers looked around eyebrows raised the guard was confused he stared down at the thin golden probe and then at his companion who said in a slightly dazed voice yeah youve just checked them marius 
 
 hermione swept forward ron by her side harry and griphook trotting invisibly behind them harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold the wizards were both scratching their heads 
 
 two goblins stood before the inner doors which were made of silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves harry looked up at it and all of a sudden a memory came to him standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven the most wonderful birthday of his life and hagrid standing beside him saying like i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he possessed and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal but within seconds they were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank 
 
 the long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools serving the first customers of the day hermione ron and travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin through an eyeglass hermione allowed travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to ron 
 
 the goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside said to nobody in particular leprechaun and then greeted travers who passed over a tiny golden key which was examined and given back to him 
 
 hermione stepped forward 
 
 madam lestrange said the goblin evidently startled dear me howchow may i help you today 
 
 i wish to enter my vault said hermione 
 
 the old goblin seemed to recoil a little harry glanced around not only was travers hanging back watching but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at hermione 
 
 you have identification asked the goblin 
 
 identification ici have never been asked for identification before said hermione 
 
 they know whispered griphook in harrys ear they must have been warned there might be an imposter 
 
 your wand will do madam said the goblin he held out a slightly trembling hand and in a dreadful blast of realization harry knew that the goblins of gringotts were aware that bellatrixs wand had been stolen 
 
 act now act now whispered griphook in harrys ear the imperious curse 
 
 harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak pointed it at the old goblin and whispered for the first time in his life imperio 
 
 a curious sensation shot down harrys arm a feeling of tingling warmth that seemed to flow from his mind down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast the goblin took bellatrixs wand examined it closely and then said ah you have had a new wand made madam lestrange 
 
 what said hermione no no thats minec 
 
 a new wand said travers approaching the counter again still the goblins all around were watching but how could you have done which wandmaker did you use 
 
 harry acted without thinking pointing his wand at travers he muttered imperio once more 
 
 oh yes i see said travers looking down at bellatrixs wand yes very handsome and is it working well i always think wands require a little breaking in dont you 
 
 hermione looked utterly bewildered but to harrys enormous relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment 
 
 the old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached 
 
 i shall need the clankers he told the goblin who dashed away and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal which he handed to his senior good good s if you will follow me madam lestrange said the old goblin hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight i shall take you to your vault 
 
 he appeared around the end of the counter jogging happily toward them the contents of the leather bag still jingling travers was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding travers with confusion 
 
 wait c bogrod 
 
 another goblin came scurrying around the counter 
 
 we have instructions he said with a bow to hermione forgive me madam but there have been special orders regarding the vault of lestrange 
 
 he whispered urgently in bogrods ear but the imperiused goblin shook him off 
 
 i am aware of the instructions madam lestrange wishes to visit her vault very old family old clients this way please 
 
 and still clanking he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall harry looked back at travers who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant and made his decision with a flick of his wand he made travers come with them walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond which was lit with flaming torches 
 
 were in trouble they suspect said harry as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off the invisibility cloak griphook jumped down from his shoulders neither travers nor bogrod showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of harry potter in their midst theyre imperiused he added in response to hermione and rons confused queries about travers and bogrod who were both now standing there looking blank i dont think i did it strongly enough i dont know 
 
 and another memory darted through his mind of the real bellatrix lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an unforgivable curse you need to mean them potter 
 
 what do we do asked ron shall we get out now while we can 
 
 if we can said hermione looking back toward the door into the main hall beyond which who knew what was happening 
 
 weve got this far i say we go on said harry 
 
 good said griphook so we need bogrod to control the cart i no long have the authority but there will not be room for the wizard 
 
 harry pointed his wand at travers 
 
 imperio 
 
 the wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace 
 
 what are you making him do 
 
 hide said harry as he pointed his wand at bogrod who whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness harry was sure he could hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it bogrod in front of griphook harry ron and hermione crammed together in the back 
 
 with a jerk the cart moved off gathering speed they hurried past travers who was wriggling into a crack in the wall then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages sloping downward all the time harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the tracks his hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites flying ever deeper into the earth but he kept glancing back they might as well have left enormous footprints behind them the more he thought about it the more foolish it seemed to have disguised hermione as bellatrix to have brought along bellatrixs wand when the death eaters knew who had stolen it c 
 
 there were a deeper than harry had ever penetrated within gringotts they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them with seconds to spare a waterfall pounding over the track harry heard griphook shout no but there was no braking they zoomed through it water filled harrys eyes and mouth he could not see or breathe then with an awful lurch the cart flipped over and they were all thrown out of it harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage wall heard hermione shriek something and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor 
 
 charm hermione spluttered as ron pulled her to her feet but to harrys horror he saw that she was no longer bellatrix instead she stood there in overlarge robes sopping wet and completely herself ron was and beardless again they were realizing it as they looked at each other feeling their own faces 
 
 the thiefs downfall said griphook clambering to his feet and looking back the deluge onto the tracks which harry knew now had been more than water it washes away all enchantment all magical concealment they know there are imposers in gringotts they have set off defenses against us 
 
 harry saw hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag and hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the invisibility cloak then he turned to see bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment the thiefs downfall seemed to have lifted his imperius curse 
 
 we need him said griphook we cannot enter the vault without a gringotts goblin and we need the clankers 
 
 imperio harry said again his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand bogrod submitted once more to his will his befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference as ron hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools 
 
 harry i think i can hear people coming said hermione and she pointed bellatrixs wand at the waterfall and cried protego they saw the shield charm break the flow of enchanted water as it flew up the passageway 
 
 good thinking said harry lead the way griphook 
 
 how are we going to get out again ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after the goblin bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog 
 
 lets worry about that when we have to said harry he was trying to listen he thought he could hear something clanking and moving around nearby griphook how much farther 
 
 not far harry potter not far 
 
 and they turned a corner and saw the thing for which harry had been prepared but which still brought all of them to a halt 
 
 a gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place the beasts scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarceration under the ground its eyes were milkily pink both rear legs bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor its great spiked wings folded close to its body would have filled the chamber if it spread them and when it turned its ugly head toward them it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble opened its mouth and spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway 
 
 it is partially blind panted griphook but even more savage for that however we have the means to control it it has learned what to expect when the clankers come give them to me 
 
 ron passed the bag to griphook and the goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a long ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils griphook handed them out bogrod accepted his meekly 
 
 you know what to do griphook told harry ron and hermione it will expect pain when it hears the noise it will retreat and bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault 
 
 they advanced around the corner again shaking the clankers and the noise echoed off the rocky walls grossly magnified so that the inside of harrys skull seemed to vibrate with the den the dragon let out another hoarse roar then retreated harry could see it trembling and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face and guess that it had been taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the clankers 
 
 make him press his hand to the door griphook urged harry who turned his wand again upon bogrod the old goblin obeyed pressing his palm to the wood and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets silver armor the skins of strange creatures c some with long spines other with drooping wings c potions in jeweled flasks and a skull still wearing a crown search fast said harry as they all hurried inside the vault he had described hufflepuffs cap to ron and hermione but if it was the other unknown horcrux that resided in this vault he did not know what it looked like he barely had time to glance around however before there was a muffled clunk from behind them the door had reappeared sealing them inside the vault and they were plunged into total darkness 
 
 no matter bogrod will be able to release us said griphook as ron gave a shout of surprise light your wands cant you and hurry we have little time 
 
 lumos 
 
 harry shone his lit wand around the vault its beam fell upon glittering jewels he saw the fake sword of gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains ron and hermione had lit their wands too and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding them 
 
 harry could this be c aargh 
 
 hermione screamed in pain and harry turned his wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip but as it fell it split became a shower of goblets so that a second later with a great clatter the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction the original impossible to discern amongst them 
 
 it burned me moaned hermione sucking her blistered fingers 
 
 they have added germino and flagrante curses said griphook 
 
 everything you touch will burn and multiply but the copies are worthless c and if you continue to handle the treasure you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold 
 
 okay dont touch anything said harry desperately but even as he said it ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot and twenty more exploded into being while ron hopped on the spot part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal 
 
 stand still dont move said hermione clutching at ron 
 
 just look around said harry remember the cups small and gold its got a badger engraved on it two handles c otherwise see if you can spot ravenclaws symbol anywhere the eagle c 
 
 they directed their wands into every nook and crevice turning cautiously on the spot it was impossible not to brush up against anything harry sent a great cascade of fake galleons onto the ground where they joined the goblets and now there was scarcely room to place their feet and the glowing gold blazed with heat so that the vault felt like a furnace harrys wandlight passed over shields and helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling higher and higher he raised the beam until suddenly it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble 
 
 its there its up there 
 
 ron and hermione pointed there wands at it too so that the little golden cup sparkled in a spotlight the cup that had belonged to helga hufflepuff which had passed into the possession of hepzibah smith from whom it had been stolen by tom riddle 
 
 and how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything asked ron 
 
 accio cup cried hermione who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what griphook had told them during their planning sessions 
 
 no use no use snarled the goblin 
 
 then what do we do said harry glaring at the goblin if you want the sword griphook then youll have to help us more than c wait can i touch stuff with the sword hermione give it here 
 
 hermione fumbled insider her robes drew out a beaded bag rummaged for a few seconds then removed the shining sword harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a silver flagon nearby which did not multiply 
 
 if i can just poke the sword through a handle c but how am i going to get up there 
 
 the shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them even ron who was tallest the heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves and sweat ran down harrys face and back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup and then he heard the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder 
 
 they were truly trapped now there was no way out except through the door and a horde of goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side harry looked at ron and hermione and saw terror in their faces 
 
 hermione said harry as the clanking grew louder ive got to get up there weve got to get rid of it c 
 
 she raised her wand pointed it at harry and whispered levicorpus 
 
 hoisted into the air by his ankle harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like bodies filling the cramped space with screams of pain ron hermione and the two goblins were knocked aside into other objects which also began to replicate half buried in a rising tide of treasure they struggled and yelled has harry thrust the sword through the handle of hufflepuffs cup hooking it onto the blade 
 
 impervius screeched hermione in an attempt to protect herself ron and the goblins from the burning metal 
 
 then the worst scream yet made harry look down ron and hermione were waist deep in treasure struggling to keep bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide but griphook had sunk out of sight and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view 
 
 harry seized griphooks fingers and pulled the blistered goblin emerged by degrees howling 
 
 liberatocorpus yelled harry and with a crash he and griphook landed on the surface of the swelling treasure and the sword flew out of harrys hand 
 
 get it harry yelled fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin as griphook clambered onto his shoulders again determined to avoid the swelling mass of objects wheres the sword it had the cup on it 
 
 the clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening c it was too late c 
 
 there 
 
 it was griphook who had seen it and griphook who lunged and in that instant harry knew that the goblin had never expected them to keep their word one hand holding tightly to a fistful of harrys hair to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out of harrys reach the tiny golden cup skewered by the handle on the swords blade was flung into the air the goblin astride him harry dived and caught it and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it even while countless hufflepuff cups burst from his fist raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him ron hermione into the outer chamber 
 
 hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body and still borne along the swell of replicating treasure harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword but griphook was gone sliding from harrys shoulders the moment he could he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins brandishing the sword and crying thieves thieves help thieves he vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd all of whom were holding daggers and who accepted him without question 
 
 slipping on the hot metal harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was through 
 
 stupefy he bellowed and ron and hermione joined in jets of red light flew into the crowd of goblins and some toppled over but others advanced and harry saw several wizard guards running around the corner 
 
 the tethered dragon let out a roar and a gush of flame flew over the goblins the wizards fled back the way they had come and inspiration or madness came to harry pointing his wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor he yelled relashio 
 
 the cuffs broken open with loud bangs 
 
 this way harry yelled and still shooting stunning spells at the advancing goblins he sprinted toward the blind dragon 
 
 harry c harry c what are you doing cried hermione 
 
 get up climb up come on c 
 
 the dragon had not realized that it was free harrys foot found the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back the scales were hard as steel it did not even seem to feel him he stretched out an arm hermione hoisted herself up ron climbed on behind them and a second later the dragon became aware that it was untethered 
 
 with a roar it reared harry dug in his knees clutching as tightly as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles and it soared into the air harry ron and hermione flat on its back scraped against the ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks 
 
 well never get out its too big hermione screamed but the dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again blasting the tunnel whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled by sheer force the dragon clawed and fought its way through harrys eyes were shut tight against the heat and dust deafened by the crash of rock and the dragons roars he could only cling to its back expecting to be shaken off at any moment then he heard hermione yelling defodio 
 
 she was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway carving out the ceiling as it struggled upward toward the fresher air away from the shrieking and clanking goblins harry and ron copied her blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells they passed the underground lake and the great crawling snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it and behind them the passage was full of the dragons thrashing spiked tail of great lumps of rock gigantic fractured stalactites and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled while ahead the dragons fire kept their progress clear c 
 
 and then at last by the combined force of their spells and the dragons brute strength they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for cover and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings turning its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance it took off and with harry ron and hermione still clinging to its back it forced its way through the metal doors leaving them buckled and hanging from their hinges as it staggered into diagon alley and launched itself into the sky

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 our aunt 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 you ought to have known our aunt she was charming that is to 
 say she was not charming at all as the word is usually understood 
 but she was good and kind amusing in her way and was just as any one ought to be whom people are to talk about and to laugh at she might have been put into a play and wholly and solely on account of the fact that she only lived for the theatre and for what was done 
 there she was an honorable matron but agent fabs whom she used to call flabs declared that our aunt was 
 
 the theatre is my school said she the source of my knowledge 
 from thence i have resuscitated biblical history now moses and 
 joseph in egypt there are operas for you i get my universal 
 history from the theatre my geography and my knowledge of men out of the french pieces i get to know life in paris slippery but 
 exceedingly interesting how i have cried over la famille 
 roquebourg that the man must drink himself to death so that she may marry the young fellow yes how many tears i have wept in the fifty years i have subscribed to the theatre 
 
 our aunt knew every acting play every bit of scenery every 
 character every one who appeared or had appeared she seemed really only to live during the nine months the theatre was open summertime without a summer theatre seemed to be only a time that made her old while on the other hand a theatrical evening that lasted till midnight was a lengthening of her life she did not say as other 
 people do now we shall have spring the stork is here or 
 advertised the first strawberries in the papers she on the 
 contrary used to announce the coming of autumn with have you 
 heard selling boxes for the theatre now the performances will 
 begin 
 
 she used to value a lodging entirely according to its proximity to 
 the theatre it was a real sorrow to her when she had to leave the 
 little lane behind the playhouse and move into the great street 
 that lay a little farther off and live there in a house where she had 
 no opposite neighbors 
 
 at home said she my windows must be my one 
 cannot sit and look into self till tired one must see 
 people but now i live just as if go into the country if i want 
 to see human beings i must go into my kitchen and sit down on the 
 sink for there only i have opposite neighbors no when i lived in my 
 dear little lane i could look straight down into the 
 shop and had only three hundred paces to the theatre and now 
 three thousand paces to go military measurement 
 
 our aunt was sometimes ill but however unwell she might feel she 
 never missed the play the doctor prescribed one day that she should 
 put her feet in a bran bath and she followed his advice but she 
 drove to the theatre all the same and sat with her feet in bran 
 there if she had died there she would have been very glad 
 
 thorwaldsen died in the theatre and she called that a happy death 
 she could not imagine but that in heaven there must be a theatre 
 too it had not indeed been promised us but we might very well 
 imagine it the many distinguished actors and actresses who had passed away must surely have a field for their talent 
 
 our aunt had an electric wire from the theatre to her room a 
 telegram used to be dispatched to her at and it used to 
 consist of the words herr sivertsen is at the machinery for it was 
 he who gave the signal for drawing the curtain up and down and for 
 changing the scenes 
 
 from him she used to receive a short and concise description of 
 every piece his opinion of tempest was mad 
 nonsense so much to put up and the first scene begins with 
 water to the front of the wings that is to say the water had to 
 come forward so far but when on the other hand the same interior 
 scene remained through five acts he used to pronounce it a 
 sensible play a resting play which performed itself 
 without putting up scenes 
 
 in earlier times by which name our aunt used to designate 
 thirty years ago she and the herr sivertsen had been younger at that time he had already been connected with the 
 machinery and was as she said her benefactor it used to be the 
 custom in those days that in the evening performances in the only 
 theatre the town possessed spectators were admitted to the part 
 called the flies over the stage and every machinist had one or two 
 places to give away often the flies were quite full of good 
 company it was said that generals wives and privy councillors wives 
 had been up there it was quite interesting to look down behind the 
 scenes and to see how the people walked to and fro on the stage 
 when the curtain was down 
 
 our aunt had been there several times as well when there was a 
 tragedy as when there was a ballet for the pieces in which there were 
 the greatest number of characters on the stage were the most 
 interesting to see from the flies one sat pretty much in the dark 
 up there and most people took their supper up with them once three 
 apples and a great piece of bread and butter and sausage fell down 
 right into the dungeon of ugolino where that unhappy man was to be 
 starved to death and there was great laughter among the audience 
 the sausage was one of the weightiest reasons why the worthy management refused in future to have any spectators up in the flies 
 
 but i was there times said our aunt and i 
 shall always remember mr sivertsen for that 
 
 on the very last evening when the flies were still open to the 
 public the judgment of solomon was performed as our aunt 
 remembered very well she had through the influence of her 
 benefactor herr sivertsen procured a free admission for the agent 
 fabs although he did not deserve it in the least for he was always 
 cutting his jokes about the theatre and teasing our aunt but she 
 had procured him a free admission to the flies for all that he 
 wanted to look at this from the other side 
 
 those were his own words and they were just like him said 
 our aunt 
 
 he looked down from above on the judgment of solomon and fell 
 asleep over it one would have thought that he had come from a 
 dinner where many toasts had been given he went to sleep and was 
 locked in and there he sat through the dark night in the flies and 
 when he woke he told a story but our aunt would not believe it 
 the judgment of solomon was over he said and all the people 
 had gone away up stairs and down stairs but now the real play began the which was the best of all said the agent then life came into the affair it was not the judgment of solomon that was performed no a real court of judgment was held upon the 
 stage and agent fabs had the impudence to try and make our aunt 
 believe all this that was the thanks she got for having got him a 
 place in the flies 
 
 what did the agent say why it was curious enough to hear but 
 there was malice and satire in it 
 
 it looked dark enough up there said the agent but then the 
 magic business began a great performance the judgment in the 
 theatre the were at their posts and every spectator had to show his ghostly that it might be decided if he was to be admitted with hands loose or bound and with or without a muzzle 
 
 grand people who came too late when the performance had begun and young people who could not always watch the time were tied up 
 outside and had list slippers put on their feet with which they were 
 allowed to go in before the beginning of the next act and they had 
 muzzles too and then the judgment on the stage began 
 
 all malice and not a bit of truth in it said our aunt 
 
 the painter who wanted to get to paradise had to go up a 
 staircase which he had himself painted but which no man could 
 mount that was to expiate his sins against perspective all the 
 plants and buildings which the had placed with infinite 
 pains in countries to which they did not belong the poor fellow 
 was obliged to put in their right places before cockcrow if he wanted 
 to get into paradise let herr fabs see how he would get in himself 
 but what he said of the performers tragedians and comedians 
 singers and dancers that was the most rascally of all mr fabs 
 indeed flabs he did not deserve to be admitted at all and our aunt 
 would not soil her lips with what he said and he said did flabs 
 that the whole was written down and it should be printed when he 
 was dead and buried but not before for he would not risk having 
 his arms and legs broken 
 
 once our aunt had been in fear and trembling in her temple of 
 happiness the theatre it was on a winter day one of those days in 
 which one has a couple of hours of daylight with a gray sky it was 
 terribly cold and snowy but aunt must go to the theatre a little 
 opera and a great ballet were performed and a prologue and an 
 epilogue into the bargain and that would last till late at night our 
 aunt must needs go so she borrowed a pair of fur boots of her lodger boots with fur inside and out and which reached far up her legs 
 
 she got to the theatre and to her box the boots were warm and 
 she kept them on suddenly there was a cry of fire smoke was coming from one of the side scenes and streamed down from the flies and there was a terrible panic the people came rushing out and our aunt was the last in the box on the second tier side for from there the scenery looks best she used to say the scenes are always arranged that they look best from the side aunt wanted to come out but the people before her in their fright and 
 heedlessness slammed the door of the box and there sat our aunt and get out and get in that is to say she 
 get into the next box for the partition was too high for her she 
 called out and no one heard her she looked down into the tier of 
 boxes below her and it was empty and low and looked quite near and aunt in her terror felt quite young and light she thought of 
 jumping down and had got one leg over the partition the other 
 resting on the bench there she sat astride as if on horseback 
 well wrapped up in her flowered cloak with one leg hanging out a 
 leg in a tremendous fur boot that was a sight to behold and when 
 it was beheld our aunt was heard too and was saved from burning for the theatre was not burned down 
 
 that was the most memorable evening of her life and she was 
 glad that she could not see herself for she would have died with 
 confusion 
 
 her benefactor in the machinery department herr sivertsen 
 visited her every sunday but it was a long time from sunday to 
 sunday in the latter time therefore she used to have in a little 
 child for the scraps that is to say to eat up the remains of the 
 dinner it was a child employed in the ballet one that certainly 
 wanted feeding the little one used to appear sometimes as an elf 
 sometimes as a page the most difficult part she had to play was the 
 hind leg in the magic flute but as she grew larger she could 
 represent the of the lion she certainly only got half a 
 guilder for that whereas the hind legs were paid for with a whole 
 guilder but then she had to walk bent and to do without fresh air 
 
 that was all very interesting to hear said our aunt 
 she deserved to live as long as the theatre stood but she could 
 not last so long and she did not die in the theatre but respectably in her bed her last words were moreover not without meaning she asked 
 
 what will the play be 
 
 at her death she left about five hundred dollars we presume 
 this from the interest which came to twenty dollars this our aunt 
 had destined as a legacy for a worthy old spinster who had no friends it was to be devoted to a yearly subscription for a place in the 
 second tier on the left side for the saturday evening for on 
 that evening two pieces were always given it said in the will and 
 the only condition laid upon the person who enjoyed the legacy was 
 that she should think every saturday evening of our aunt who was 
 lying in her grave 
 
 this was our religion
