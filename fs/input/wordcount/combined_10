 chapter x 
 
 he who seeks to better himself may render his situation worse 
 madame thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way as was her wont 
 she had expected great results 
 when the man and cosette had taken their departure thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs 
 is that all said she 
 it was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had dared to criticise one of the acts 
 the blow told 
 you are right in sooth said he i am a fool 
 give me my hat 
 he folded up the three thrust them into his pocket and ran out in all haste but he made a mistake and turned to the right first some neighbors of whom he made inquiries put him on the track again the lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of livry he followed these hints walking with great strides and talking to himself the while 
 that man is evidently a million dressed in yellow and i am an animal first he gave twenty sous then five francs then fifty francs then fifteen hundred francs all with equal readiness 
 he would have given fifteen thousand francs 
 but i shall overtake him 
 and then that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child all that was singular many mysteries lay concealed under it one does not let mysteries out of hand when one has once grasped them 
 the secrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold one must know how to subject them to pressure 
 all these thoughts whirled through his brain 
 i am an animal said he 
 when one leaves montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes that runs to livry it can be seen stretching out before one to a great distance across the plateau 
 on arriving there he calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man and the child 
 he looked as far as his vision reached and saw nothing he made fresh inquiries but he had wasted time 
 some informed him that the man and child of whom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of gagny 
 he hastened in that direction 
 they were far in advance of him but a child walks slowly and he walked fast and then he was well acquainted with the country 
 all at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace his steps 
 i ought to have taken my gun said he to himself 
 thenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through our midst without our being aware of the fact and who disappear without our finding them out because destiny has only exhibited one side of them 
 it is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged 
 in a calm and even situation thenardier possessed all that is required to will not say to be what people have agreed to call an honest trader a good bourgeois at the same time certain circumstances being given certain shocks arriving to bring his to the surface he had all the requisites for a blackguard 
 he was a shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster 
 satan must have occasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which thenardier dwelt and have fallen in the presence of this hideous masterpiece 
 after a momentary hesitation 
 bah he thought they will have time to make their escape 
 and he pursued his road walking rapidly straight ahead and with almost an air of certainty with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of partridges 
 in truth when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the avenue de bellevue and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of the hill and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the abbey of chelles he caught sight over the top of the brushwood of the hat on which he had already erected so many conjectures it was that hat 
 the brushwood was not high 
 thenardier recognized the fact that the man and cosette were sitting there 
 the child could not be seen on account of her small size but the head of her doll was visible 
 thenardier was not mistaken 
 the man was sitting there and letting cosette get somewhat rested 
 the walked round the brushwood and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of 
 pardon excuse me sir he said quite breathless but here are your fifteen hundred francs 
 so saying he handed the stranger the three 
 the man raised his eyes 
 what is the meaning of this 
 thenardier replied respectfully 
 
 it means sir that i shall take back cosette 
 cosette shuddered and pressed close to the old man 
 he replied gazing to the very bottom of eyes the while and enunciating every syllable distinctly 
 you are to take back 
 yes sir i am 
 i will tell you i have considered the matter in fact i have not the right to give her to you 
 i am an honest man you see this child does not belong to me she belongs to her mother it was her mother who confided her to me i can only resign her to her mother 
 you will say to me but her mother is dead good in that case i can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing signed by her mother to the effect that i am to hand the child over to the person therein mentioned that is clear 
 the man without making any reply fumbled in his pocket and thenardier beheld the of make its appearance once more 
 the shivered with joy 
 good thought he let us hold firm he is going to bribe me 
 before opening the the traveller cast a glance about him the spot was absolutely deserted there was not a soul either in the woods or in the valley 
 the man opened his once more and drew from it not the handful of bills which thenardier expected but a simple little paper which he unfolded and presented fully open to the saying 
 you are right read 
 thenardier took the paper and read 
 m sur m march 
 monsieur thenardier 
 you will deliver cosette to this person 
 you will be paid for all the little things 
 i have the honor to salute you with respect 
 fantine 
 you know that signature resumed the man 
 it certainly was signature thenardier recognized it 
 there was no reply to make he experienced two violent vexations the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for and the vexation of being beaten the man added 
 you may keep this paper as your receipt 
 thenardier retreated in tolerably good order 
 this signature is fairly well imitated he growled between his teeth however let it go 
 then he essayed a desperate effort 
 it is well sir he said since you are the person but i must be paid for all those little things 
 a great deal is owing to me 
 the man rose to his feet filliping the dust from his sleeve 
 monsieur thenardier in january last the mother reckoned that she owed you one hundred and twenty francs 
 in february you sent her a bill of five hundred francs you received three hundred francs at the end of february and three hundred francs at the beginning of march since then nine months have elapsed at fifteen francs a month the price agreed upon which makes one hundred and francs you had received one hundred francs too much that makes still owing you 
 i have just given you fifteen hundred francs 
 sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap 
 who is this devil of a man he thought 
 he did what the wolf does 
 he shook himself 
 audacity had succeeded with him once 
 he said resolutely and this time casting aside all respectful ceremony i shall take back cosette if you do not give me a thousand crowns 
 the stranger said tranquilly 
 come cosette 
 he took cosette by his left hand and with his right he picked up his cudgel which was lying on the ground 
 thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the spot 
 the man plunged into the forest with the child leaving the motionless and speechless 
 while they were walking away thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders which were a little rounded and his great fists 
 then bringing his eyes back to his own person they fell upon his feeble arms and his thin hands 
 i really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun he said to himself since i was going hunting 
 however the did not give up 
 i want to know where he is going said he and he set out to follow them at a distance 
 two things were left on his hands an irony in the shape of the paper signed fantine and a consolation the fifteen hundred francs 
 the man led cosette off in the direction of livry and bondy he walked slowly with drooping head in an attitude of reflection and sadness 
 the winter had thinned out the forest so that thenardier did not lose them from sight although he kept at a good distance the man turned round from time to time and looked to see if he was being followed 
 all at once he caught sight of thenardier he plunged suddenly into the brushwood with cosette where they could both hide themselves 
 the deuce said thenardier and he redoubled his pace 
 the thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them when the man had reached the densest part of the thicket he wheeled round 
 it was in vain that thenardier sought to conceal himself in the branches he could not prevent the man seeing him the man cast upon him an uneasy glance then elevated his head and continued his course 
 the set out again in pursuit thus they continued for two or three hundred paces 
 all at once the man turned round once more he saw the this time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that thenardier decided that it was useless to proceed further 
 thenardier retraced his steps

 book five 
 chapter xx 
 
 rostov had come to tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on behalf he could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to tilsit without permission to do so and boris even had he wished to could not have done so on the following day on that day june the preliminaries of peace were signed the emperors exchanged decorations alexander received the cross of the legion of honor and napoleon the order of st andrew of the first degree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by a battalion of the french guards to the preobrazhensk battalion the emperors were to be present at that banquet 
 rostov felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with boris that when the latter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early next morning went away avoiding boris in his civilian clothes and a round hat he wandered about the town staring at the french and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the russian and french emperors were staying in a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner he saw the russian and french colors draped from side to side of the streets with hugh monograms a and n in the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed 
 boris want to help me and i want to ask him settled thought nicholas all is over between us but i leave here without having done all i can for denisov and certainly not without getting his letter to the emperor the emperor he is here thought rostov who had unconsciously returned to the house where alexander lodged 
 saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were assembling evidently preparing for the emperor to come out 
 i may see him at any moment thought rostov if only i were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes surely not he would understand on whose side justice lies he understands everything knows everything who can be more just more magnanimous than he and even if they did arrest me for being here what would it matter thought he looking at an officer who was entering the house the emperor occupied after all people do go in all nonsense go in and hand the letter to the emperor myself so much the worse for drubetskoy who drives me to it and suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect rostov felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house 
 no i miss my opportunity now as i did after austerlitz he thought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought i will fall at his feet and beseech him he will lift me up will listen and will even thank me i am happy when i can do good but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness rostov fancied the sovereign saying and passing people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of the house 
 a broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right he saw a closed door below under the staircase was a door leading to the lower floor 
 whom do you want someone inquired 
 to hand in a letter a petition to his majesty said nicholas with a tremor in his voice 
 a petition this way to the officer the officer on duty he was shown the door leading downstairs only it be accepted 
 on hearing this indifferent voice rostov grew frightened at what he was doing the thought of meeting the emperor at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away but the official who had questioned him opened the door and rostov entered 
 a short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots and a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in that room and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of handsome braces that for some reason attracted attention this man was was speaking to someone in the adjoining room 
 a good figure and in her first bloom he was saying but on seeing rostov he stopped short and frowned 
 what is it a petition 
 what is it asked the person in the other room 
 another petitioner answered the man with the braces 
 tell him to come later be coming out directly we must go 
 later later tomorrow too late 
 rostov turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stopped him 
 whom have you come from who are you 
 i come from major denisov answered rostov 
 are you an officer 
 lieutenant count rostov 
 what audacity hand it in through your commander and go along with you go and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him 
 rostov went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were many officers and generals in full parade uniform whom he had to pass 
 cursing his temerity his heart sinking at the thought of finding himself at any moment face to face with the emperor and being put to shame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the impropriety of his conduct and repenting of it rostov with downcast eyes was making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a familiar voice called him and a hand detained him 
 what are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep voice 
 it was a cavalry general who had obtained the special favor during this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division in which rostov was serving 
 rostov in dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindly jocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited voice told him the whole affair asking him to intercede for denisov whom the general knew having heard rostov to the end the general shook his head gravely 
 sorry sorry for that fine fellow give me the letter 
 hardly had rostov handed him the letter and finished explaining case when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs and the general leaving him went to the porch the gentlemen of the suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses hayne the same groom who had been at austerlitz led up the horse and the faint creak of a footstep rostov knew at once was heard on the stairs forgetting the danger of being recognized rostov went close to the porch together with some inquisitive civilians and again after two years saw those features he adored that same face and same look and step and the same union of majesty and mildness and the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in soul in all its old force in the uniform of the preobrazhensk regiment white breeches and high boots and wearing a star rostov did not know it was that of the legion the monarch came out into the porch putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm he stopped and looked about him brightening everything around by his glance he spoke a few words to some of the generals and recognizing the former commander of division smiled and beckoned to him 
 all the suite drew back and rostov saw the general talking for some time to the emperor 
 the emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers among whom was rostov moved nearer to the emperor stopping beside his horse with his hand on the saddle the emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice evidently wishing to be heard by all 
 i cannot do it general i cannot because the law is stronger than i and he raised his foot to the stirrup 
 the general bowed his head respectfully and the monarch mounted and rode down the street at a gallop beside himself with enthusiasm rostov ran after him with the crowd

 number reappears and cosette wins it in the lottery 
 jean valjean was not dead 
 when he fell into the sea or rather when he threw himself into it he was not ironed as we have seen 
 he swam under water until he reached a vessel at anchor to which a boat was moored he found means of hiding himself in this boat until night at night he swam off again and reached the shore a little way from cape brun 
 there as he did not lack money he procured clothing a small in the neighborhood of balaguier was at that time the of escaped lucrative specialty then jean valjean like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary 
 he found his first refuge at pradeaux near beausset 
 then he directed his course towards near briancon in the it was a fumbling and uneasy flight a track whose branchings are untraceable 
 later on some trace of his passage into ain in the territory of civrieux was discovered in the pyrenees at accons at the spot called near the market of chavailles and in the environs of perigueux at brunies canton of la he reached paris we have just seen him at montfermeil 
 his first care on arriving in paris had been to buy mourning clothes for a little girl of from seven to eight years of age then to procure a lodging 
 that done he had betaken himself to montfermeil it will be remembered that already during his preceding escape he had made a mysterious trip thither or somewhere in that neighborhood of which the law had gathered an inkling 
 however he was thought to be dead and this still further increased the obscurity which had gathered about him 
 at paris one of the journals which chronicled the fact fell into his hands he felt reassured and almost at peace as though he had really been dead 
 on the evening of the day when jean valjean rescued cosette from the claws of the thenardiers he returned to paris 
 he it at nightfall with the child by way of the barrier monceaux there he entered a cabriolet which took him to the esplanade of the observatoire 
 there he got out paid the coachman took cosette by the hand and together they directed their steps through the the deserted streets which adjoin the ourcine and the glaciere towards the boulevard de 
 the day had been strange and filled with emotions for cosette they had eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns behind hedges they had changed carriages frequently they had travelled short distances on foot 
 she made no complaint but she was weary and jean valjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand as she walked 
 he took her on his back cosette without letting go of catherine laid her head on jean shoulder and there fell asleep

 book five 
 chapter xxi 
 
 the emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion of the preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the french guards in their bearskin caps on the left 
 as the tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions which presented arms another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank and at the head of them rostov recognized napoleon it could be no one else he came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue uniform open over a white vest and the st andrew ribbon over his shoulder he was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray arab horse with a crimson saddlecloth on approaching alexander he raised his hat and as he did so rostov with his eye could not help noticing that napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle the battalions shouted hurrah and vive napoleon said something to alexander and both emperors dismounted and took each hands face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile alexander was saying something affable to him 
 in spite of the trampling of the french gendarmes horses which were pushing back the crowd rostov kept his eyes on every movement of alexander and bonaparte it struck him as a surprise that alexander treated bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the tsar as if such relations with an emperor were an everyday matter to him 
 alexander and napoleon with the long train of their suites approached the right flank of the preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there the crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the emperors that rostov standing in the front row was afraid he might be recognized 
 sire i ask your permission to present the legion of honor to the bravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise voice articulating every letter 
 this was said by the undersized napoleon looking up straight into eyes alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and bending his head smiled pleasantly 
 to him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war added napoleon accentuating each syllable as with a composure and assurance exasperating to rostov he ran his eyes over the russian ranks drawn up before him who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their emperor 
 will your majesty allow me to consult the colonel said alexander and took a few hasty steps toward prince kozlovski the commander of the battalion 
 bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand tore it in doing so and threw it away an behind him rushed forward and picked it up 
 to whom shall it be given the emperor alexander asked koslovski in russian in a low voice 
 to whomever your majesty commands 
 the emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and glancing back remarked 
 but we must give him an answer 
 kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included rostov in his scrutiny 
 can it be me thought rostov 
 lazarev the colonel called with a frown and lazarev the first soldier in the rank stepped briskly forward 
 where are you off to stop here voices whispered to lazarev who did not know where to go lazarev stopped casting a sidelong look at his colonel in alarm his face twitched as often happens to soldiers called before the ranks 
 napoleon slightly turned his head and put his plump little hand out behind him as if to take something the members of his suite guessing at once what he wanted moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another and a page the same one rostov had seen the previous evening at boris ran forward and bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment laid in it an order on a red ribbon napoleon without looking pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them then he approached lazarev who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch looked round at the emperor alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally and the small white hand holding the order touched one of buttons it was as if napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that breast for the soldier to be forever happy rewarded and distinguished from everyone else in the world napoleon merely laid the cross on breast and dropping his hand turned toward alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there and it really did 
 officious hands russian and french immediately seized the cross and fastened it to the uniform lazarev glanced morosely at the little man with white hands who was doing something to him and still standing motionless presenting arms looked again straight into eyes as if asking whether he should stand there or go away or do something else but receiving no orders he remained for some time in that rigid position 
 the emperors remounted and rode away the preobrazhensk battalion breaking rank mingled with the french guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them 
 lazarev sat in the place of honor russian and french officers embraced him congratulated him and pressed his hands crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him a rumble of russian and french voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square two officers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed by rostov 
 what think of the treat all on silver plate one of them was saying have you seen lazarev 
 i have 
 tomorrow i hear the preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner 
 yes but what luck for lazarev twelve hundred francs pension for life 
 a cap lads shouted a preobrazhensk soldier donning a shaggy french cap 
 a fine thing 
 have you heard the password asked one guards officer of another the day before yesterday it was napoleon france bravoure yesterday alexandre russie grandeur one day our emperor gives it and next day napoleon tomorrow our emperor will send a st cross to the bravest of the french guards it has to be done he must respond in kind 
 boris too with his friend zhilinski came to see the preobrazhensk banquet on his way back he noticed rostov standing by the corner of a house 
 rostov how do we missed one another he said and could not refrain from asking what was the matter so strangely dismal and troubled was face 
 nothing nothing replied rostov 
 call round 
 yes i will 
 rostov stood at that corner for a long time watching the feast from a distance a distance in his mind a painful process was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion terrible doubts rose in his soul now he remembered denisov with his changed expression his submission and the whole hospital with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease so vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round to see where the smell came from next he thought of that bonaparte with his small white hand who was now an emperor liked and respected by alexander then why those severed arms and legs and those dead men then again he thought of lazarev rewarded and denisov punished and unpardoned he caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened 
 the smell of the food the preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections he had to get something to eat before going away he went to a hotel he had noticed that morning there he found so many people among them officers who like himself had come in civilian clothes that he had difficulty in getting a dinner two officers of his own division joined him the conversation naturally turned on the peace the officers his comrades like most of the army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of friedland they said that had we held out a little longer napoleon would have been done for as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition nicholas ate and drank chiefly the latter in silence he finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself the process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion he feared to give way to his thoughts yet could not get rid of them suddenly on one of the officers saying that it was humiliating to look at the french rostov began shouting with wrath and therefore much to the surprise of the officers 
 how can you judge best he cried the blood suddenly rushing to his face how can you judge the actions what right have we to argue we cannot comprehend either the or his actions 
 but i never said a word about the emperor said the officer justifying himself and unable to understand outburst except on the supposition that he was drunk 
 but rostov did not listen to him 
 we are not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more he went on if we are ordered to die we must die if punished it means that we have deserved it not for us to judge if the emperor pleases to recognize bonaparte as emperor and to conclude an alliance with him it means that that is the right thing to do if once we begin judging and arguing about everything nothing sacred will be left that way we shall be saying there is no god nothing shouted nicholas banging the table very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts 
 our business is to do our duty to fight and not to think all said he 
 and to drink said one of the officers not wishing to quarrel 
 yes and to drink assented nicholas hullo there another bottle he shouted 
 in the emperor alexander went to erfurt for a fresh interview with the emperor napoleon and in the upper circles of petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting

 book gorbeau hovel 
 chapter i 
 
 master gorbeau 
 forty years ago a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of the salpetriere and who had mounted to the barriere by way of the boulevard reached a point where it might be said that paris disappeared 
 it was no longer solitude for there were it was not the country for there were houses and streets it was not the city for the streets had ruts like highways and the grass grew in them it was not a village the houses were too lofty 
 what was it then 
 it was an inhabited spot where there was no one it was a desert place where there was some one it was a boulevard of the great city a street of paris more wild at night than the forest more gloomy by day than a cemetery 
 it was the old quarter of the 
 the rambler if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this if he consented even to pass beyond the rue du after leaving on his right a garden protected by high walls then a field in which mills rose like gigantic beaver huts then an enclosure encumbered with timber with a heap of stumps sawdust and shavings on which stood a large dog barking then a long low utterly dilapidated wall with a little black door in mourning laden with mosses which were covered with flowers in the spring then in the most deserted spot a frightful and decrepit building on which ran the inscription in large letters 
 post no daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the rue des there near a factory and between two garden walls there could be seen at that epoch a mean building which at the first glance seemed as small as a thatched hovel and which was in reality as large as a cathedral it presented its side and gable to the public road hence its apparent diminutiveness 
 nearly the whole of the house was hidden only the door and one window could be seen 
 this hovel was only one story high 
 the first detail that struck the observer was that the door could never have been anything but the door of a hovel while the window if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion 
 the door was nothing but a collection of planks roughly bound together by which resembled roughly hewn logs it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps muddy chalky dusty steps of the same width as itself which could be seen from the street running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls 
 the top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed which served both as wicket and when the door was closed on the inside of the door the figures had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number so that one hesitated where was one 
 above the door it said number the inside replied no number 
 no one knows what figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening 
 the window was large sufficiently elevated garnished with venetian blinds and with a frame in large square panes only these large panes were suffering from various wounds which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage and the blinds dislocated and unpasted threatened rather than screened the occupants 
 the horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter 
 this door with an unclean and this window with an honest though dilapidated air thus beheld on the same house produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side with different miens beneath the same rags the one having always been a mendicant and the other having once been a gentleman 
 the staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house 
 this edifice had for its intestinal tube a long corridor on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances and rather more like stalls than cells these chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood 
 all this was dark disagreeable wan melancholy sepulchral traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door by cold rays or by icy winds 
 an interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders 
 to the left of the entrance door on the boulevard side at about the height of a man from the ground a small window which had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by 
 a portion of this building has recently been demolished from what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days 
 as a whole it was not over a hundred years old a hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house it seems as though lodging partook of his ephemeral character and house of his eternity 
 the postmen called the house number but it was known in the neighborhood as the gorbeau house 
 let us explain whence this appellation was derived 
 collectors of petty details who become herbalists of anecdotes and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin know that there was in paris during the last century about two attorneys at the chatelet named one corbeau raven the other renard fox the two names had been forestalled by la fontaine the opportunity was too fine for the lawyers they made the most of it a parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the in verses that limped a little 
 maitre corbeau sur un dossier perche 
 tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire 
 maitre renard par alleche 
 lui fit a peu pres cette histoire he bonjour 
 etc 
 lawyer corbeau perched on a docket held in his beak a writ of execution lawyer renard attracted by the smell addressed him nearly as follows etc 
 the two honest practitioners embarrassed by the jests and finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them resolved to get rid of their names and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king 
 their petition was presented to louis xv 
 on the same day when the papal nuncio on the one hand and the cardinal de la on the other both devoutly kneeling were each engaged in putting on in his presence a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry who had just got out of bed 
 the king who was laughing continued to laugh passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names or nearly so 
 by the kings command maitre corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself gorbeau maitre renard was less lucky all he obtained was leave to place a p in front of his r and to call himself prenard so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first 
 now according to local tradition this maitre gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered on the boulevard de he was even the author of the monumental window 
 hence the edifice bore the name of the gorbeau house 
 opposite this house among the trees of the boulevard rose a great elm which was dead almost directly facing it opens the rue de la barriere des gobelins a street then without houses unpaved planted with unhealthy trees which was green or muddy according to the season and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of paris 
 an odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory 
 the barrier was close at hand 
 in the city wall was still in existence

 nevertheless at nightfall at the moment when the daylight is vanishing especially in winter at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves when the darkness is deep and starless or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful 
 the black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades like morsels of the infinite the cannot refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet the solitude of this spot where so many crimes have been committed had something terrible about it

 in summer at twilight one saw here and there a few old women seated at the foot of the elm on benches mouldy with rain these good old women were fond of begging 
 however this quarter which had a superannuated rather than an antique air was tending even then to transformation 
 even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing for the last twenty years the station of the orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it as it does wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city it seems as though around these great centres of the movements of a people the earth full of germs trembled and yawned to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth at the rattle of these powerful machines at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire the old houses crumble and new ones rise 
 since the orleans railway has invaded the region of the salpetriere the ancient narrow streets which adjoin the moats and the jardin des plantes tremble as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which in a given time crowd back the houses to the right and the left for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets 
 the symptoms of a new life are evident in this old provincial quarter in the wildest nooks the pavement shows itself the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer even where there are as yet no pedestrians 
 one memorable morning in july black pots of bitumen were seen smoking there on that day it might be said that civilization had arrived in the rue de and that paris had entered the suburb of 
 master gorbeau 
 forty years ago a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of the salpetriere and who had mounted to the barriere by way of the boulevard reached a point where it might be said that paris disappeared 
 it was no longer solitude for there were it was not the country for there were houses and streets it was not the city for the streets had ruts like highways and the grass grew in them it was not a village the houses were too lofty 
 what was it then 
 it was an inhabited spot where there was no one it was a desert place where there was some one it was a boulevard of the great city a street of paris more wild at night than the forest more gloomy by day than a cemetery 
 it was the old quarter of the 
 the rambler if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this if he consented even to pass beyond the rue du after leaving on his right a garden protected by high walls then a field in which mills rose like gigantic beaver huts then an enclosure encumbered with timber with a heap of stumps sawdust and shavings on which stood a large dog barking then a long low utterly dilapidated wall with a little black door in mourning laden with mosses which were covered with flowers in the spring then in the most deserted spot a frightful and decrepit building on which ran the inscription in large letters 
 post no daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the rue des there near a factory and between two garden walls there could be seen at that epoch a mean building which at the first glance seemed as small as a thatched hovel and which was in reality as large as a cathedral it presented its side and gable to the public road hence its apparent diminutiveness 
 nearly the whole of the house was hidden only the door and one window could be seen 
 this hovel was only one story high 
 the first detail that struck the observer was that the door could never have been anything but the door of a hovel while the window if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion 
 the door was nothing but a collection of planks roughly bound together by which resembled roughly hewn logs it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps muddy chalky dusty steps of the same width as itself which could be seen from the street running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls 
 the top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed which served both as wicket and when the door was closed on the inside of the door the figures had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number so that one hesitated where was one 
 above the door it said number the inside replied no number 
 no one knows what figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening 
 the window was large sufficiently elevated garnished with venetian blinds and with a frame in large square panes only these large panes were suffering from various wounds which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage and the blinds dislocated and unpasted threatened rather than screened the occupants 
 the horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter 
 this door with an unclean and this window with an honest though dilapidated air thus beheld on the same house produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side with different miens beneath the same rags the one having always been a mendicant and the other having once been a gentleman 
 the staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house 
 this edifice had for its intestinal tube a long corridor on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances and rather more like stalls than cells these chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood 
 all this was dark disagreeable wan melancholy sepulchral traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door by cold rays or by icy winds 
 an interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders 
 to the left of the entrance door on the boulevard side at about the height of a man from the ground a small window which had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by 
 a portion of this building has recently been demolished from what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days 
 as a whole it was not over a hundred years old a hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house it seems as though lodging partook of his ephemeral character and house of his eternity 
 the postmen called the house number but it was known in the neighborhood as the gorbeau house 
 let us explain whence this appellation was derived 
 collectors of petty details who become herbalists of anecdotes and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin know that there was in paris during the last century about two attorneys at the chatelet named one corbeau raven the other renard fox the two names had been forestalled by la fontaine the opportunity was too fine for the lawyers they made the most of it a parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the in verses that limped a little 
 maitre corbeau sur un dossier perche 
 tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire 
 maitre renard par alleche 
 lui fit a peu pres cette histoire he bonjour 
 etc 
 lawyer corbeau perched on a docket held in his beak a writ of execution lawyer renard attracted by the smell addressed him nearly as follows etc 
 the two honest practitioners embarrassed by the jests and finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them resolved to get rid of their names and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king 
 their petition was presented to louis xv 
 on the same day when the papal nuncio on the one hand and the cardinal de la on the other both devoutly kneeling were each engaged in putting on in his presence a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry who had just got out of bed 
 the king who was laughing continued to laugh passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names or nearly so 
 by the kings command maitre corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself gorbeau maitre renard was less lucky all he obtained was leave to place a p in front of his r and to call himself prenard so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first 
 now according to local tradition this maitre gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered on the boulevard de he was even the author of the monumental window 
 hence the edifice bore the name of the gorbeau house 
 opposite this house among the trees of the boulevard rose a great elm which was dead almost directly facing it opens the rue de la barriere des gobelins a street then without houses unpaved planted with unhealthy trees which was green or muddy according to the season and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of paris 
 an odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory 
 the barrier was close at hand 
 in the city wall was still in existence 
 this barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind 
 it was the road to bicetre 
 it was through it that under the empire and the restoration prisoners condemned to death paris on the day of their execution 
 it was there that about was committed that mysterious assassination called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier whose authors justice was never able to discover a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled

 a nest for owl and a warbler 
 it was in front of this gorbeau house that jean valjean halted like wild birds he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest 
 he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket drew out a sort of a opened the door entered closed it again carefully and ascended the staircase still carrying cosette 
 at the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key with which he opened another door 
 the chamber which he entered and which he closed again instantly was a kind of moderately spacious attic furnished with a mattress laid on the floor a table and several chairs a stove in which a fire was burning and whose embers were visible stood in one corner 
 a lantern on the boulevard cast a vague light into this poor room at the extreme end there was a with a folding bed jean valjean carried the child to this bed and laid her down there without waking her 
 he struck a match and lighted a candle 
 all this was prepared beforehand on the table and as he had done on the previous evening he began to scrutinize face with a gaze full of ecstasy in which the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration 
 the little girl with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extreme strength and extreme weakness had fallen asleep without knowing with whom she was and continued to sleep without knowing where she was 
 jean valjean bent down and kissed that hand 
 nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother who had also just fallen asleep 
 the same sad piercing religious sentiment filled his heart 
 he knelt beside bed 
 lt was broad daylight and the child still slept 
 a wan ray of the december sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceiling in long threads of light and shade 
 all at once a heavily laden cart which was passing along the boulevard shook the frail bed like a clap of thunder and made it quiver from top to bottom 
 yes madame cried cosette waking with a start here i am here i am 
 and she sprang out of bed her eyes still half shut with the heaviness of sleep extending her arms towards the corner of the wall 
 ah mon dieu my broom said she 
 she opened her eyes wide now and beheld the smiling countenance of jean valjean 
 ah so it is true said the child 
 good morning monsieur 
 children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly being themselves by nature joy and happiness 
 cosette caught sight of catherine at the foot of her bed and took possession of her and as she played she put a hundred questions to jean valjean 
 where was she 
 was paris very large was madame thenardier very far away 
 was she to go back etc etc all at once she exclaimed how pretty it is here 
 it was a frightful hole but she felt free 
 must i sweep she resumed at last 
 play said jean valjean 
 the day passed thus 
 cosette without troubling herself to understand anything was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man

 prince andrew had spent two years continuously in the country 
 all the plans pierre had attempted on his estates and constantly changing from one thing to another had never accomplished were carried out by prince andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty 
 he had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which pierre lacked and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going 
 on one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became free agricultural laborers this being one of the first examples of the kind in russia on other estates the serfs compulsory labor was commuted for a quitrent a trained midwife was engaged for bogucharovo at his expense and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to the children of the peasants and household serfs 
 prince andrew spent half his time at bald hills with his father and his son who was still in the care of nurses the other half he spent in bogucharovo cloister as his father called prince estate despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to pierre he diligently followed all that went on received many books and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from petersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged behind himself who never left the country in knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs 
 besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of books prince andrew was at this time busy with a critical of survey our last two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations 
 in the spring of he went to visit the ryazan estates which had been inherited by his son whose guardian he was 
 warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the caleche looking at the new grass the first leaves on the birches and the first puffs of white spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky he was not thinking of anything but looked and cheerfully from side to side 
 they crossed the ferry where he had talked with pierre the year before they went through the muddy village past threshing floors and green fields of winter rye downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain past strips of stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there and into a birch forest growing on both sides of the road in the forest it was almost hot no wind could be felt the birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless and flowers and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last leaves the coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter on entering the forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly 
 peter the footman made some remark to the coachman the latter assented but apparently the sympathy was not enough for peter and he turned on the box toward his master 
 how pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful smile 
 what 
 pleasant your excellency 
 what is he talking about thought prince andrew oh the spring i suppose he thought as he turned round yes really everything is green already how early the birches and cherry and alders too are coming out but the oaks show no sign yet ah here is one oak 
 at the edge of the road stood an oak probably ten times the age of the birches that formed the forest it was ten times as thick and twice as tall as they it was an enormous tree its girth twice as great as a man could embrace and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken off and its bark scarred with its huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an aged stern and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees only the evergreen firs dotted about in the forest and this oak refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine 
 spring love happiness this oak seemed to say are you not weary of that stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud always the same and always a fraud there is no spring no sun no happiness look at those cramped dead firs ever the same and at me too sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown whether from my back or my sides as they have grown so i stand and i do not believe in your hopes and your lies 
 as he passed through the forest prince andrew turned several times to look at that oak as if expecting something from it under the oak too were flowers and grass but it stood among them scowling rigid misshapen and grim as ever 
 yes the oak is right a thousand times right thought prince andrew let others the young yield afresh to that fraud but we know life our life is finished 
 a whole sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant rose in his soul in connection with that tree during this journey he as it were considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion restful in its hopelessness that it was not for him to begin anything anew but that he must live out his life content to do no harm and not disturbing himself or desiring anything

 book gorbeau hovel 
 chapter iii 
 
 two misfortunes make one piece of good fortune 
 on the following morning at daybreak jean valjean was still by bedside he watched there motionless waiting for her to wake 
 some new thing had come into his soul 
 jean valjean had never loved anything for years he had been alone in the world 
 he had never been father lover husband friend in the prison he had been vicious gloomy chaste ignorant and shy 
 the heart of that was full of virginity his sister and his children had left him only a vague and memory which had finally almost completely vanished he had made every effort to find them and not having been able to find them he had forgotten them 
 human nature is made thus the other tender emotions of his youth if he had ever had any had fallen into an abyss 
 when he saw cosette when he had taken possession of her carried her off and delivered her he felt his heart moved within him 
 all the passion and affection within him awoke and rushed towards that child 
 he approached the bed where she lay sleeping and trembled with joy 
 he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing 
 poor old man with a perfectly new heart 
 only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light 
 it was the second white apparition which he had encountered the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon cosette caused the dawn of love to rise 
 the early days passed in this dazzled state 
 cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another being poor little thing 
 she was so little when her mother left her that she no longer remembered her 
 like all children who resemble young shoots of the vine which cling to everything she had tried to love she had not succeeded 
 all had repulsed her the thenardiers their children other children 
 she had loved the dog and he had died after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her 
 it is a sad thing to say and we have already intimated it that at eight years of age her heart was cold it was not her fault it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked alas it was the possibility 
 thus from the very first day all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man 
 she felt that which she had never felt sensation of expansion 
 the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the hovel pretty 
 these are the effects of the dawn of childhood of joy 
 the novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here 
 nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret we all have in our past a delightful garret 
 nature a difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences differing in age alike in sorrow one in fact completed the other 
 instinct sought a father as jean instinct sought a child 
 to meet was to find each other 
 at the mysterious moment when their hands touched they were welded together 
 when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as necessary to each other and embraced each other closely 
 taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense we may say that separated from every one by the walls of the tomb jean valjean was the widower and cosette was the orphan this situation caused jean valjean to become father after a celestial fashion 
 and in truth the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion but a reality the entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god 
 moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well 
 there he seemed perfectly secure 
 the chamber with a which he occupied with cosette was the one whose window opened on the boulevard 
 this being the only window in the house no neighbors glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side 
 the of number a sort of dilapidated penthouse served as a for and no communication existed between it and the first story 
 it was separated by the flooring which had neither traps nor stairs and which formed the diaphragm of the building as it were 
 the first story contained as we have said numerous chambers and several attics only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of jean housekeeping all the rest was uninhabited 
 it was this old woman ornamented with the name of the principal lodger and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress who had let him the lodging on christmas eve 
 he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds who was coming there to live with his little daughter he had paid her six months in advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and as we have seen it was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival 
 week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that hovel 
 cosette laughed chattered and sang from daybreak 
 children have their morning song as well as birds 
 it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand all cracked with chilblains and kissed it 
 the poor child who was used to being beaten did not know the meaning of this and ran away in confusion 
 at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown cosette was no longer in rags she was in mourning 
 she had emerged from misery and she was entering into life 
 jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read 
 sometimes as he made the child spell he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison 
 this idea had ended in teaching a child to read 
 then the smiled with the pensive smile of the angels 
 he felt in it a premeditation from on high the will of some one who was not man and he became absorbed in revery 
 good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones 
 to teach cosette to read and to let her play this constituted nearly the whole of jean existence 
 and then he talked of her mother and he made her pray 
 she called him father and knew no other name for him 
 he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in listening to her prattle 
 life henceforth appeared to him to be full of interest men seemed to him good and just he no longer reproached any one in thought he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man now that this child loved him he saw a whole future stretching out before him illuminated by cosette as by a charming light 
 the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts 
 at times he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly 
 this is only a personal opinion but to utter our whole thought at the point where jean valjean had arrived when he began to love cosette it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in he had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect incomplete aspects which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth the fate of woman as summed up in fantine and public authority as personified in javert 
 he had returned to prison this time for having done right he had quaffed fresh bitterness disgust and lassitude were overpowering him even the memory of the bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant but after all that sacred memory was growing dim 
 who knows whether jean valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more he loved and grew strong again 
 alas he walked with no less indecision than cosette 
 he protected her and she strengthened him thanks to him she could walk through life thanks to her he could continue in virtue 
 he was that stay and she was his prop 
 oh unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny

 chapter ii 
 
 prince andrew had to see the marshal of the nobility for the district in connection with the affairs of the ryazan estate of which he was trustee this marshal was count ilya rostov and in the middle of may prince andrew went to visit him 
 it was now hot spring weather the whole forest was already clothed in green it was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to bathe 
 prince andrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the marshal was driving up the avenue in the grounds of the rostovs house at otradnoe he heard merry girlish cries behind some trees on the right and saw group of girls running to cross the path of his caleche ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped the girl was shouting something but seeing that he was a stranger ran back laughing without looking at him 
 suddenly he did not know why he felt a pang the day was so beautiful the sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girl did not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented and cheerful in her own separate probably foolish but bright and happy life what is she so glad about what is she thinking of not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of the ryazan serfs quitrents of what is she thinking why is she so happy prince andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity 
 in count ilya rostov was living at otradnoe just as he had done in former years that is entertaining almost the whole province with hunts theatricals dinners and music he was glad to see prince andrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his staying the night 
 during the dull day in the course of which he was entertained by his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old house was crowded on account of an approaching name day prince andrew repeatedly glanced at natasha gay and laughing among the younger members of the company and asked himself each time what is she thinking about why is she so glad 
 that night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep he read awhile and then put out his candle but relit it it was hot in the room the inside shutters of which were closed he was cross with the stupid old man as he called rostov who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town and he was vexed with himself for having stayed 
 he got up and went to the window to open it as soon as he opened the shutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this burst into the room he opened the casement the night was fresh bright and very still just before the window was a row of pollard trees looking black on one side and with a silvery light on the other beneath the trees grewsome kind of lush wet bushy vegetation with leaves and stems here and there farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches and above it shone the moon nearly at its full in a pale almost starless spring sky prince andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky 
 his room was on the first floor those in the rooms above were also awake he heard female voices overhead 
 just once more said a girlish voice above him which prince andrew recognized at once 
 but when are you coming to bed replied another voice 
 i i sleep the use come now for the last time 
 two girlish voices sang a musical passage the end of some song 
 oh how lovely now go to sleep and an end of it 
 you go to sleep but i said the first voice coming nearer to the window she was evidently leaning right out for the rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard everything was like the moon and its light and the shadows prince andrew too dared not stir for fear of betraying his unintentional presence 
 sonya sonya he again heard the first speaker oh how can you sleep only look how glorious it is ah how glorious do wake up sonya she said almost with tears in her voice there never never was such a lovely night before 
 sonya made some reluctant reply 
 do just come and see what a moon oh how lovely come here darling sweetheart come here there you see i feel like sitting down on my heels putting my arms round my knees like this straining tight as tight as possible and flying away like this 
 take care fall out 
 he heard the sound of a scuffle and disapproving voice past one 
 oh you only spoil things for me all right go go 
 again all was silent but prince andrew knew she was still sitting there from time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh 
 o god o god what does it mean she suddenly exclaimed to bed then if it must be and she slammed the casement 
 for her i might as well not exist thought prince andrew while he listened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that she might say something about him there she is again as if it were on purpose thought he 
 in his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful thoughts and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his life that unable to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once

 chapter iv 
 
 the remarks of the principal tenant 
 jean valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day every evening at twilight he walked for an hour or two sometimes alone often with cosette seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard and entering churches at nightfall he liked to go to which is the nearest church when he did not take cosette with him she remained with the old woman but the delight was to go out with the good man 
 she preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous with catherine he held her hand as they walked and said sweet things to her 
 it turned out that cosette was a very gay little person 
 the old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market 
 they lived soberly always having a little fire but like people in very moderate circumstances 
 jean valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day he had merely had the glass door leading to replaced by a solid door 
 he still wore his yellow coat his black breeches and his old hat in the street he was taken for a poor man 
 it sometimes happened that women turned back to bestow a sou on him jean valjean accepted the sou with a deep bow 
 it also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him stealthily approached the unfortunate man put a piece of money into his hand often a silver coin and walked rapidly away this had its disadvantages 
 he began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives alms 
 the old principal lodger a creature who was thoroughly permeated so far as her neighbors were concerned with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons scrutinized jean valjean a great deal without his suspecting the fact 
 she was a little deaf which rendered her talkative 
 there remained to her from her past two above the other she was continually knocking against each other 
 she had questioned cosette who had not been able to tell her anything since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from montfermeil 
 one morning this spy saw jean valjean with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel she followed him with the step of an old cat and was able to observe him without being seen through a crack in the door which was directly opposite him 
 jean valjean had his back turned towards this door by way of greater security no doubt 
 the old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case scissors and thread then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper which he unfolded the old woman recognized with terror the fact that it was a for a thousand francs 
 it was the second or third only that she had seen in the course of her existence 
 she fled in alarm 
 a moment later jean valjean accosted her and asked her to go and get this bill changed for him adding that it was his quarterly income which he had received the day before where thought the old woman 
 he did not go out until six in the evening and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour 
 the old woman went to get the bill changed and mentioned her surmises 
 that note commented on and multiplied produced a vast amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the rue des vignes 
 a few days later it chanced that jean valjean was sawing some wood in his in the corridor 
 the old woman was in the chamber putting things in order 
 she was alone 
 cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed 
 the old woman caught sight of the coat hanging on a nail and examined it 
 the lining had been sewed up again 
 the good woman felt of it carefully and thought she observed in the skirts and revers thicknesses of paper more no doubt 
 she also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets not only the needles thread and scissors which she had seen but a big a very large knife suspicious circumstance several wigs of various colors 
 each pocket of this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents 
 thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter

 book six 
 chapter iii 
 
 next morning having taken leave of no one but the count and not waiting for the ladies to appear prince andrew set off for home 
 it was already the beginning of june when on his return journey he drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and memorable an impression on him in the forest the harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now all was thick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the mood around were delicately green with fluffy young shoots 
 the whole day had been hot somewhere a storm was gathering but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves the left side of the forest was dark in the shade the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze everything was in blossom the nightingales trilled and their voices reverberated now near now far away 
 yes here in this forest was that oak with which i agreed thought prince andrew but where is it he again wondered gazing at the left side of the road and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought the old oak quite transfigured spreading out a canopy of sappy foliage stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now through the hard bark even where there were no twigs leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced 
 yes it is the same oak thought prince andrew and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal all the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory austerlitz with the lofty heavens his dead reproachful face pierre at the ferry that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that night itself and the moon and all this rushed suddenly to his mind 
 no life is not over at prince andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively it is not enough for me to know what i have in me everyone must know it pierre and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the sky everyone must know me so that my life may not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so that it may be reflected in them all and they and i may live in harmony 
 on reaching home prince andrew decided to go to petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision a whole serics of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to petersburg and even to the service kept springing up in his mind he could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head it now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life he did not even remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or love now reason suggested quite the opposite after that journey to ryazan he found the country dull his former pursuits no longer interested him and often when sitting alone in his study he got up went to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead lise who with hair curled a la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame she did not now say those former terrible words to him but looked simply merrily and inquisitively at him and prince andrew crossing his arms behind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as he reflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as a crime which altered his whole life and were connected with pierre with fame with the girl at the window the oak and beauty and love and if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold stern and above all unpleasantly logical 
 my dear princess mary entering at such a moment would say little nicholas go out today very cold 
 if it were hot prince andrew would reply at such times very dryly to his sister he could go out in his smock but as it is cold he must wear warm clothes which were designed for that purpose that is what follows from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who needs fresh air should remain at home he would add with extreme logic as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him 
 at such moments princess mary would think how intellectual work dries men up

 of love 
 the stage is more beholding to love than the life of man for as to the stage love is ever matter of comedies and now and then of tragedies but in life it doth much mischief sometimes like a siren sometimes like a fury you may observe that amongst all the great and worthy persons whereof the memory remaineth either ancient or recent there is not one that hath been transported to the mad degree of love which shows that great spirits and great business do keep out this weak passion 
 you must except nevertheless marcus antonius the half partner of the empire of rome and appius claudius the decemvir and lawgiver whereof the former was indeed a voluptuous man and inordinate but the latter was an austere and wise man and therefore it seems though rarely that love can find entrance not only into an open heart but also into a heart well fortified if watch be not well kept it is a poor saying of epicurus satis magnum alter alteri theatrum sumus as if man made for the contemplation of heaven and all noble objects should do nothing but kneel before a little idol and make himself subject though not of the mouth as beasts are yet of the eye which was given him for higher purposes it is a strange thing to note the excess of this passion and how it braves the nature and value of things by this that the speaking in a perpetual hyperbole is comely in nothing but in love neither is it merely in the phrase for whereas it hath been well said that the with whom all the petty flatterers have intelligence is a self certainly the lover is more for there was never proud man thought so absurdly well of himself as the lover doth of me person loved and therefore it was well said mat it is impossible to love and to be wise neither doth his weakness appear to others only and not to the party loved but to the loved most of all except the love be reciproque 
 
 for it is a true rule that love is ever rewarded either with the reciproque or 
 with an inward and secret contempt by how much the more men ought to beware of this passion which loseth not only other things but itself as for the other losses the relation doth well figure them that he that preferred helena quitted the gifts of juno and pallas for whosoever esteemeth too much of amorous affection quitteth both riches and wisdom this passion hath his floods in the very times of weakness which are great prosperity and great adversity though this latter hath been less observed both which times kindle love and make it more fervent and therefore show it to be the child of folly they do best who if they cannot but admit love yet make it keep quarter 
 and sever it wholly from their serious affairs and actions of life for if it check 
 once with business it troubleth men s fortunes and maketh men that they can no ways be true to their own ends i know not how but martial men are given to love i think it is but as they are given to wine for perils commonly ask to be paid in pleasures there is in nature a secret inclination and motion towards love of others which if it be not spent upon some one or a few doth naturally spread itself towards many and maketh men become humane and charitable as it is seen sometime in friars nuptial love maketh mankind friendly love perfecteth it but wanton love corrupteth and embaseth it

 book just man 
 chapter ix 
 
 the brother as depicted by the sister 
 in order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the bishop of d and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions their thoughts their feminine instincts even which are easily alarmed to the habits and purposes of the bishop without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from mademoiselle baptistine to madame the vicomtess de boischevron the friend of her childhood 
 this letter is in our possession 
 d dec my good madam 
 not a day passes without our speaking of you it is our established custom but there is another reason besides just imagine while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls madam magloire has made some discoveries now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours 
 madam magloire has pulled off all the paper there were things beneath 
 my which contains no furniture and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing is fifteen feet in height eighteen square with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded and with beams as in yours this was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital and the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers 
 but my room is the one you ought to see 
 madam magloire has discovered under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top some paintings which without being good are very tolerable 
 the subject is telemachus being knighted by minerva in some gardens the name of which escapes me 
 in short where the roman ladies repaired on one single night 
 what shall i say to you 
 i have romans and roman ladies here occurs an illegible word and the whole train madam magloire has cleaned it all off this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired and the whole revarnished and my chamber will be a regular museum 
 she has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden of ancient fashion they asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them but it is much better to give the money to the poor and they are very ugly besides and i should much prefer a round table of mahogany 
 i am always very happy 
 my brother is so good 
 he gives all he has to the poor and sick 
 we are very much cramped 
 the country is trying in the winter and we really must do something for those who are in need 
 we are almost comfortably lighted and warmed you see that these are great treats 
 my brother has ways of his own 
 when he talks he says that a bishop ought to be so 
 just imagine the door of our house is never fastened whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my room he fears nothing even at night 
 that is his sort of bravery he says 
 he does not wish me or madame magloire feel any fear for him he exposes himself to all sorts of dangers and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it 
 one must know how to understand him 
 he goes out in the rain he walks in the water he travels in winter he fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters nor night 
 last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers 
 he would not take us 
 he was absent for a fortnight 
 on his return nothing had happened to him he was thought to be dead but was perfectly well and said this is the way i have been robbed 
 and then he opened a trunk full of jewels all the jewels of the cathedral of embrun which the thieves had given him 
 when he returned on that occasion i could not refrain from scolding him a little taking care however not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise so that no one might hear me 
 at first i used to say to myself there are no dangers which will stop him he is terrible 
 now i have ended by getting used to it i make a sign to madam magloire that she is not to oppose him he risks himself as he sees fit 
 i carry off madam magloire i enter my chamber i pray for him and fall asleep 
 i am at ease because i know that if anything were to happen to him it would be the end of me 
 i should go to the good god with my brother and my bishop 
 it has cost madam magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences 
 but now the habit has been acquired 
 we pray together we tremble together and we fall asleep 
 if the devil were to enter this house he would be allowed to do so 
 after all what is there for us to fear in this house 
 there is always some one with us who is stronger than we 
 the devil may pass through it but the good god dwells here 
 this suffices me 
 my brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me 
 i understand him without his speaking and we abandon ourselves to the care of providence 
 that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul 
 i have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the faux family 
 you are aware that he knows everything and that he has memories because he is still a very good royalist 
 they really are a very ancient norman family of the generalship of caen 
 five hundred years ago there was a raoul de faux a jean de faux and a thomas de faux who were gentlemen and one of whom was a seigneur de rochefort the last was and was commander of a regiment and something in the light horse of bretagne 
 his daughter married de gramont son of the duke louis de gramont peer of france colonel of the french guards and of the army 
 it is written faux fauq and faoucq 
 good madame recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative monsieur the cardinal 
 as for your dear sylvanie she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me 
 she is well works as you would wish and loves me 
 that is all that i desire 
 the souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely and it makes me very happy 
 my health is not so very bad and yet i grow thinner every day 
 farewell my paper is at an end and this forces me to leave you 
 a thousand good wishes 
 baptistine 
 your grand nephew is charming 
 do you know that he will soon be five years old 
 yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who had on and he said what has he got on his knees he is a charming child 
 his little brother is dragging an old broom about the room like a carriage and saying hu 
 as will be perceived from this letter these two women understood how to mould themselves to the ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself the bishop of d in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him sometimes did things that were grand bold and magnificent without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact they trembled but they let him alone 
 sometimes madame magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance but never at the time nor afterwards they never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign in any action once entered upon 
 at certain moments without his having occasion to mention it when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability so perfect was his simplicity they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house 
 they served him passively and if obedience consisted in disappearing they disappeared they understood with an admirable delicacy of instinct that certain cares may be put under constraint 
 thus even when believing him to be in peril they understood i will not say his thought but his nature to such a degree that they no longer watched over him they confided him to god 
 moreover baptistine said as we have just read that her end would prove her own 
 madame magloire did not say this but she knew it

 a new hope 
 ix 
 
 as they traveled father and deeper into the bowels of the gigantic station they foundit increasingly difficult to maintain an air of casual indifference fortunately thosewho might have sensed some nervousness on the part of the two armored trooperswould regard it as only natural considering their huge dangerous wookie also made it impossible for the two young men to be as inconspicuous asthey would have liked 
 the farther they traveled the heavier the traffic became other technicians and mechanicals bustled around them intent on their ownassignments they ignored the trio completely only a few of the humans sparing thewookie a curious glance morose expression and the seemingconfidence of his captors reassured the inquisitive 
 eventually they reached a wide bank of elevators luke breathed a sigh ofrelief the transport ought to be capable of taking them justabout anywhere on the station in response to a verbal command 
 there was a nervous second when a minor official raced to get aboard sologestured sharply and the other without voicing a protest shifted to the next elevatortube in line 
 luke studied the operating panel then tried to sound at once knowledgeable andimportant as he spoke into the pickup grid instead he sounded nervous and the elevator was a mechanism not programmed to differentiate theappropriateness of emotions conveyed vocally so the door slid shut and they wereon their way after what felt like hours but was in reality only minutes the dooropened and they stepped out into the security area 
 it had been hope they would discover something like the cells of the kind used on tatooine in towns like mos eisley instead they sawonly narrow ramps bordering a bottomless ventilation shaft these levels of them ran parallel to smooth curving walls which held facelessdetention cells guards and energy gates seemed to be everywherethey looked 
 uncomfortably aware that the longer they stood frozen in place the soonersomeone was bound to come over and ask unanswerable questions luke searchedfrantically for a course of action 
 this going to work solo whispered leaning toward him 
 why you say so before a frustrated frightened luke shot back 
 i think i did i 
 shssh 
 solo shuts up worst fears were realized a tall officerapproached them he frowned as he examined the silent chewbacca 
 where are you two going with 
 chewbacca snarled at the remark and solo quieted him with a hasty jab in theribs a panicky luke found himself replying almost instinctively prisonertransfer from block ts 
 the officer looked puzzled i notified have to clear it 
 turning the man walked to a small console nearby and began entering hisrequest luke and han hurriedly surveyed the situation their gaze traveling fromalarms energy gates and remote photosensors to the three other guards station in thearea 
 solo nodded to luke as he unfastened cuffs then he whisperedsomething to the wookie an howl shook the corridor as chewbaccathrew up both hands grabbing rifle from him 
 look out a seemingly terrified solo shouted loose rip us allapart 
 both he and luke had darted clear of the rampaging wookie pulled out theirpistols and were blasting away at him their reaction was excellent theirenthusiasm undeniable and their aim execrable not a single shot came close to thedodging wookie instead they blasted automatic cameras controls andthe three dumbfounded guards 
 at this point it occurred to the officer in charge that the abominable aim of thetwo soldiers was a bit too selectively efficient he was preparing to jab the generalalarm when a burst from pistol caught him in the midsection and he fellwithout a word to the gray deck 
 solo rushed to the open comlink speaker which was screeching anxiousquestions about what was going on apparently there were audio as well as visuallinks between this detention station and elsewhere 
 ignoring the barrage of alternate threats and queries he checked the readout setin the panel nearby got to find out which cell this princess of yours is must a dozen levels it is cell go and them here 
 luke nodded once and was racing down the narrow walkway 
 after gesturing for the wookie to take up a position where he could cover theelevators solo took a deep breath and responded to the unceasing calls from thecomlink 
 under control he said into the pickup sounding reasonablyofficial situation normal 
 it sound like that a voice snapped back in a tone whathappened 
 uh well one of the guards experienced a weapon malfunction solostammered his temporary officialese lapsing into nervousness no problem all fine thanks how about you 
 sending a squad up the voice announced suddenly 
 han could almost smell the suspicion at the other end what to say hespoke more eloquently with the business end of a pistol 
 we have an energy dangerous 
 weapon malfunction energy leakwho is this your operating 
 pointing his pistol at the panels solo blew the instrumentation to silent was a dumb conversation anyway he murmured turning he shouted down thecorridor hurry it up luke going to have company 
 luke heard but he was absorbed in running from one cell to the next andstudying the numbers glowing above each doorway the cell it appeared didnot exist but it did and he found it just as he was about to give up and try the nextlevel down 
 for a long moment he examined the featureless convex metal wall turning hispistol to maximum and hoping it melt in his hand before it broke through heopened fire on the door when the weapon became too hot to hold he tossed it fromhand to hand as he did so the smoke had time to clear and he saw with somesurprise that the door had been blown away 
 peering through the smoke with an uncomprehending look on her face was theyoung woman whose portrait artoo detoo had projected in a garage on tatooineseveral centuries ago or it seemed 
 she was even more beautiful than her image luke decided staring dazedly ather i 
 her look of confusion and uncertainty was replaced by first puzzlement and thenimpatience you a littler short for a storm trooper she finally commented 
 what uniform he removed the helmet regaining a littlecomposure at the same time come to rescue you luke skywalker 
 i beg your pardon she said politely 
 i said come to rescue you ben kenobi is with me got yourtwo droids 
 the uncertainty was instantly replaced by hope at the mention of the ben kenobi she looked around luke ignoring him as she searched forthe jedi where is he 
 governor tarkin watched as darth vader paced rapidly back and forth in theotherwise empty conference room finally the dark lord paused glancing aroundas though a great bell only he could hear had rung somewhere close by 
 he is here vader stated unemotionally 
 tarkin looked startled kenobi impossible what makesyou think so 
 a stirring in the force of a kind felt only in the presence of my old is unmistakable 
 he must be dead by now 
 vader hesitated his assurance suddenly gone perhapsit is gone now itwas only a brief sensation 
 the jedi are extinct declared tarkin positively their fire was quencheddecades ago you my friend are all left of their ways 
 a comlink buzzed softly for attention yes tarkin acknowledged 
 we have an emergency alert in detention block aa 
 the princess tarkin yelped jumping to his feet vader whirled trying tostare through the walls 
 i know is here i knew i could not mistake a stirring in the forceof such power 
 put all sections on alert tarkin ordered through the comlink then he turnedto stare at vader if right he must not be allowed to escape 
 escape may not be intention vader replied struggling tocontrol his emotions he is the last of the the greatest the danger hepresents to us must not be only i can deal with him his headsnapped around to stare fixedly at tarkin alone 
 luke and leia had started back up the corridor when a series of blindingexplosion ripped the walkway ahead of them several troopers had tried comingthrough the elevator only to be crisped one after another by chewbacca disdainingthe elevators they had blasted a gaping hole through a wall the opening was toolarge for solo and the wookie to cover completely in twos and threes the imperialswere working their way into the detention block 
 retreating down the walkway han and chewbacca encountered luke and theprincess we go back that way solo told them his face flushed withexcitement and worry 
 no it looks like managed to cut off our only escape route leia agreedreadily this is a detention area you know they build them with multipleexits 
 breathing heavily solo turned to look her up and down begging yourforgiveness your highness he said sarcastically but maybe prefer it back inyour cell she looked away her face impassive 
 got to be another way out luke muttered pulling a small transmitterunit from his belt and carefully adjusting the frequency see threepioseethreepio 
 a familiar voice responded with gratifying speed yes sir 
 been cut off here are there any other ways out of the detention at all 
 static crackled over the tiny grid as solo and chewbacca kept the imperial troopsbottled up at the other end of the walkway 
 what was that i copy 
 back in the gentry office artoo detoo beeped and whistled frantically asthreepio adjusted controls fighting to clear the awkward transmission i said allsystems have been alerted to your presence sir the main entry seems to be the onlyway in or out of the cell block he pressed instruments and the view on the nearbyreadouts changed steadily all other information on your section is restricted 
 someone began banging on the locked door to the at first andthen when no response was forthcoming from within more insistently 
 oh no threepio groaned 
 the smoke in the cell corridor was now so intense that it was difficult for soloand chewbacca to pick their targets that was fortunate inasmuch as they were nowbadly outnumbered and the smoke confused the imperials fire with equalthoroughness 
 every so often one of the soldiers would attempt to move closer only to standexposed as he penetrated the smoke under the accurate fire of the two would rapidly join the accumulating mass of motionless figures on the rampwayflooring 
 energy bolts continued to ricochet wildly through the block as luke moved closeto solo 
 there other way out he yelled over the deafening roar of concentratedfire 
 well closing in on us what do we do now 
 this is some rescue an irritated voice complained from behind them bothmen turned to see a thoroughly disgusted princess eyeing them with regal you came in here you have a plan of getting out 
 solo nodded toward luke the brains sweetheart 
 luke managed an embarrassed grin and shrugged helplessly he turned to helpreturn fire but before he could do so the princess had snatched the pistol from hishand 
 hey 
 luke stared as she moved along the wall finally locating a small grate pointed the pistol at it and fired 
 solo gazed at her in disbelief what do you think doing 
 it looks like up to me to save our skins get into the garbage 
 while the others looked on in amazement she jumped feet first into the openingand disappeared chewbacca rumbled threateningly but solo slowly shook his head 
 no chewie i want you to rip her apart not sure about her beginning to like her or going to kill her myself the wookiesnorted something else and solo yelled back at him go on in you furry oaf care what you smell this is no time to go dainty on me 
 shoving the reluctant wookie toward the tiny opening solo helped jam themassive bulk through as soon as he disappeared the corellian followed him fired off the last series of blasts more in the hope of creating a covering smokethan hitting anything slid into the chute and was gone 
 not wanting to incur further losses in such a confined space the pursuingsoldiers had momentarily halted to await the arrival of reinforcements and heavierweapons besides they had their quarry trapped and despite their dedication noneof them were anxious to die needlessly 
 the chamber luke tumbled into was dimly lit not that the light was needed todiscern its contents he smelled the decay long before he was dumped into except for the concealed illuminants the garbage room was at least aquarter full of slimy muck much of which had already achieved a state ofdecomposition sufficient to wrinkle nose 
 solo was stumbling around the edge of the room slipping and sinking up to hisknees in the uncertain footing in an attempt to locate an exit al he found was asmall thick hatchway which he grunted and heaved to pry open the hatchcoverrefused to budge 
 the garbage chute was a wonderful idea he told the princess the sweat from his forehead what an incredible smell we ride out here on a drifting odor and there seem to beany other exit unless i can get this hatch open 
 stepping back he pulled his pistol and fired at the cover the bolt promptlywent howling around the room as everyone sought cover in the garbage a lastglance and the bolt detonated almost on top of them 
 looking less dignified by the moment leia was the first to emerge from thepungent cover put that thing away she told solo grimly or going to getus all killed 
 yes your worship solo muttered in snide supplication he made no moveto reholster his weapon as he glanced back up toward the open chute above take long for them to figure out what happened to us we had things wellunder you led us down here 
 sure you did she shot back brushing refuse from her hair and well it could be worse 
 as if in reply a piercing horrible moaning filled the room it seemed to comefrom somewhere beneath them chewbacca let out a terrified yowl of his own andtried to flatten himself against a wall luke drew his own pistol and peered hard atvarious clumps of debris but saw nothing 
 what was that solo asked 
 not too sure luke suddenly jumped looking down and behind just moved past me i think watch out 
 with shocking suddenness luke disappeared straight down into the garbage 
 got luke the princess shouted it took him under solo lookedaround frantically for something to shoot at 
 as abruptly as he had vanished luke so did part of somethingelse a thick whitish tentacle was wrapped tight around his throat 
 shoot it kill it luke screamed 
 shoot it i even see it solo protested 
 once again luke was sucked under by whatever that gruesome appendage wasattached to solo stared helplessly around the multicolored surface 
 there was a distant rumble of heavy machinery and two opposing walls of thechamber moved inward several centimeters the rumble ceased and then it wasquiet again luke appeared unexpectedly close to solo scrabbling his way clear ofthe suffocating mess and rubbing at the welt on his neck 
 what happened to it leia wondered eyeing the quiescent garbage warily 
 luke looked genuinely puzzled i know it had then i wasfree it just let me go and disappeared maybe i smell bad enough for it 
 got a very bad feeling about this solo murmured 
 again the distant rumble filled the room again the walls began their inwardmarch only this time neither sound nor movement showed any sign of stopping 
 just stand there gaping at each other the princess urged them try tobrace them with something 
 even with the thick poles and old metal beams chewbacca could handle theywere unable to find anything capable of slowing the walls advance it seemed as ifthe stronger the object was that they placed against the walls the easier it wassnapped luke pulled out his comlink simultaneously trying to talk and will thewalls to retreat threepiocome in threepio a decent paused produced noresponse causing luke to look worriedly at his companions 
 i know why he answer he tried again see threepio comein do you read 
 see threepio the muted voice continued to call come in see threepio itwas voice and it issued softly in between buzzings from the small handcomlink resting on the deserted computer console save for the intermittent gantry office was silent 
 a tremendous explosion drowned out the muffled pleadings it blew the officedoor clean across the room sending metal fragments flying in all directions severalof them struck the comlink sending it flying to the floor and cutting off voicein midtransmission 
 in the wake of the minor cataclysm four armed and ready troopers enteredthrough the blown portal initial study indicated the office was adim frightened voice was heard coming from one of the tall supply cabinets near theback of the room 
 help help let us out 
 several of the troopers bent to inspect the immobile bodies of the gantry officerand his aide while others opened the noisy cabinet two robots one tall andhumanoid the other purely mechanical and stepped out into the taller one gave the impression of being half unbalanced with fear 
 madmen i tell you madmen he gestured urgently toward thedoorway i think they said something about heading for the prison level theyjust left if you hurry you might catch them that way that way 
 two of the troopers inside joined those waiting in the hallway in hustling offdown the corridor that left two guards to watch over the office they totallyignored the robots as they discussed what might have taken place 
 all the excitement has overloaded the circuitry in my companion explained carefully if you mind like to take him down tomaintenance 
 hmmm one of the guards looked up indifferently and nodded to the and artoo hurried out the door without looking back as they departed itoccurred to the guard that the taller of the two droids was of a type he had never seenbefore he shrugged that was not surprising on a station of this size 
 that was too close threepio muttered as they scurried down an emptycorridor now have to find another console and plug youback in or everything is lost 
 the garbage chamber grew remorselessly smaller the smoothly fitting metalwalls moving toward one another with stolid precision larger pieces of refuseperformed a concerto of snapping and popping that was rising toward a finalshuddering crescendo 
 chewbacca whined pitifully as he fought with all his incredible strength andweight to hold back one of the walls looking like a hirsute tantalus approaching hisfinal summit 
 one for sure solo noted unhappily all going to be muchthinner this could prove popular for slimming the only trouble is itspermanence 
 luke paused for breath shaking the innocent comlink angrily what couldhave happened to threepio 
 try the hatch again advised leia our only hope 
 solo shielded his eyes and did so the ineffectual blast echoed mockinglythrough the narrowing chamber 
 the service bay was unoccupied everyone apparently having been drawn awayby the commotion elsewhere after a cautious survey of the room threepiobeckoned for artoo to follow together they commenced a hurried search of themany service panels artoo let out a beep and threepio rushed to him he waitedimpatiently as the smaller unit plugged the receptive arm carefully into the opensocket 
 a superfast flurry of electronics spewed in undisciplined fashion from the grid ofthe little droid threepio made cautioning motions 
 wait a minute slow down the sounds dropped to a crawl where they what oh no only come out of there as liquid 
 less than a meter of life was left to the trapped occupants of the garbage and solo had been forced to turn sideways had ended up facing each other forthe first time the haughtiness was gone from the face reaching out shetook hand clutching it convulsively as she felt the first touch of the closingwalls 
 luke had fallen and was lying on his side fighting to keep his head above therising ooze he nearly choked on a mouthful of compressed sludge when hiscomlink began buzzing for attention 
 threepio 
 are you there sir the droid replied had some minor would not believe 
 shut up threepio luke screamed into the unit and shut down all therefuse units on the detention level or immediately below it do you copy shutdown the refuse 
 moments later threepio grabbed at his head in pain as a terrific screeching andyelling sounded over the comlink 
 no shut them all down he implored artoo hurry oh listen to dying artoo i curse this metal body of mine i was not fast enough itwas my fault my poor of themno no no 
 the screaming and yelling however continued far beyond what seemed like areasonable interval in fact they were shouts of relief the chamber walls hadreversed direction automatically with shutdown and were moving apart again 
 artoo threepio luke hollered into the comlink all right all you read me did just fine 
 brushing distastefully at the clinging slime he made his way as rapidly aspossible toward the hatchcover bending he scraped accumulated detritus the number thus revealing 
 open the hatch on unit 
 yes sir came acknowledgment 
 they may have been the happiest words luke had ever heard

 chapter x 
 
 prince vasili kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son boris on the evening of anna soiree the matter was mentioned to the emperor an exception made and boris transferred into the regiment of semenov guards with the rank of cornet he received however no appointment to staff despite all anna endeavors and entreaties soon after anna reception anna mikhaylovna returned to moscow and went straight to her rich relations the rostovs with whom she stayed when in the town and where and where her darling bory who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the guards as a cornet had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time the guards had already left petersburg on the tenth of august and her son who had remained in moscow for his equipment was to join them on the march to radzivilov 
 it was st day and the name day of two of the rostovs the mother and the youngest daughter both named nataly ever since the morning carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually bringing visitors to the countess big house on the povarskaya so well known to all moscow the countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the with the visitors who came to congratulate and who constantly succeeded one another in relays 
 the countess was a woman of about with a thin oriental type of face evidently worn out with childbearing she had had twelve a languor of motion and speech resulting from weakness gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room helped to receive and entertain the visitors the young people were in one of the inner rooms not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors the count met the guests and saw them off inviting them all to dinner 
 i am very very grateful to you mon cher or ma chere he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone my dear whether they were above or below him in rank i thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping but mind you come to dinner or i shall be offended ma chere on behalf of the whole family i beg you to come mon cher these words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation and with the same expression on his full cheerful face the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick repeated bows as soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room drew a chair toward him or her and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live he swayed to and fro with dignity offered surmises about the weather or touched on questions of health sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but french then again like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty he rose to see some visitors off and stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch also asked them to dinner sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall where tables were being set out for eighty people and looking at the footmen who were bringing in silver and china moving tables and unfolding damask table linen he would call dmitri vasilevich a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say well dmitri see that things are all as they should be right the great thing is the serving it and with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room 
 marya lvovna karagina and her daughter announced the countess gigantic footman in his bass voice entering the drawing room the countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her portrait on it 
 quite worn out by these callers however see her and no more she is so affected ask her in she said to the footman in a sad voice as if saying very well finish me off 
 a tall stout and woman with a smiling daughter entered the drawing room their dresses rustling 
 dear countess what an age she has been laid up poor child at the ball and countess apraksina i was so delighted came the sounds of animated feminine voices interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs then one of those conversations began which last out until at the first pause the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say i am so delighted health and countess apraksina and then again rustling pass into the anteroom put on cloaks or mantles and drive away the conversation was on the chief topic of the day the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of day count bezukhov and about his illegitimate son pierre the one who had behaved so improperly at anna reception 
 i am so sorry for the poor count said the visitor he is in such bad health and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him 
 what is that asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to though she had already heard about the cause of count distress some fifteen times 
 what comes of a modern education exclaimed the visitor it seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked now in petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police 
 you say so replied the countess 
 he chose his friends badly interposed anna mikhaylovna prince son he and a certain dolokhov have it is said been up to heaven only knows what and they have had to suffer for it dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and son sent back to moscow anatole father managed somehow to get his affair hushed up but even he was ordered out of petersburg 
 but what have they been up to asked the countess 
 they are regular brigands especially dolokhov replied the visitor he is a son of marya ivanovna dolokhova such a worthy woman but there just fancy those three got hold of a bear somewhere put it in a carriage and set off with it to visit some actresses the police tried to interfere and what did the young men do they tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the moyka canal and there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back 
 what a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear shouted the count dying with laughter 
 oh how dreadful how can you laugh at it count 
 yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing 
 it was all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the visitor and to think it is cyril vladimirovich son who amuses himself in this sensible manner and he was said to be so well educated and clever this is all that his foreign education has done for him i hope that here in moscow no one will receive him in spite of his money they wanted to introduce him to me but i quite declined i have my daughters to consider 
 why do you say this young man is so rich asked the countess turning away from the girls who at once assumed an air of inattention his children are all illegitimate i think pierre also is illegitimate 
 the visitor made a gesture with her hand 
 i should think he has a score of them 
 princess anna mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society 
 the fact of the matter is said she significantly and also in a half whisper everyone knows count reputation he has lost count of his children but this pierre was his favorite 
 how handsome the old man still was only a year ago remarked the countess i have never seen a handsomer man 
 he is very much altered now said anna mikhaylovna well as i was saying prince vasili is the next heir through his wife but the count is very fond of pierre looked after his education and wrote to the emperor about him so that in the case of his death and he is so ill that he may die at any moment and dr lorrain has come from petersburg no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune pierre or prince vasili forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles i know it all very well for prince vasili told me himself besides cyril vladimirovich is my second cousin also my godfather she added as if she attached no importance at all to the fact 
 prince vasili arrived in moscow yesterday i hear he has come on some inspection business remarked the visitor 
 yes but between ourselves said the princess that is a pretext the fact is he has come to see count cyril vladimirovich hearing how ill he is 
 but do you know my dear that was a capital joke said the count and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to the young ladies i can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut 
 and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats well and in particular drinks well so do come and dine with us he said

 chapter 
 
 a charming introduction to a life four weeks torture tossing and sickness oh these bleak winds and bitter northern skies and impassable roads and dilatory country surgeons and oh this dearth of the human physiognomy and worse than all the terrible intimation of kenneth that i need not expect to be out of doors till spring 
 mr heathcliff has just honoured me with a calls about seven days ago he sent me a brace of last of the season scoundrel he is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine and that i had a great mind to tell him but alas how could i offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts blisters and leeches this is quite an easy interval i am too weak to read yet i feel as if i could enjoy something interesting why not have up mrs dean to finish her tale i can recollect its chief incidents as far as she had gone yes i remember her hero had run off and never been heard of for three years and the heroine was married ring be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully mrs dean came 
 it wants twenty minutes sir to taking the medicine she commenced 
 away away with it i replied i desire to have 
 the doctor says you must drop the powders 
 with all my heart interrupt me come and take your seat here keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials draw your knitting out of your will continue the history of mr heathcliff from where you left off to the present day did he finish his education on the continent and come back a gentleman or did he get a place at college or escape to america and earn honours by drawing blood from his or make a fortune more promptly on the english highways 
 he may have done a little in all these vocations mr lockwood but i give my word for any i stated before that i know how he gained his money neither am i aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk but with your leave proceed in my own fashion if you think it will amuse and not weary you are you feeling better this morning 
 much 
 good news i got miss catherine and myself to thrushcross grange and to my agreeable disappointment she behaved infinitely better than i dared expect she seemed almost over fond of mr linton and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection they were both very attentive to her comfort certainly it was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn there were no mutual concessions one stood erect and the others yielded and who can be and when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference i observed that mr edgar had a deeprooted fear of ruffling her humour he concealed it from her but if ever he heard me answer sharply or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account he many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed not to grieve a kind master i learned to be less touchy and for the space of half a year the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand because no fire came near to explode it catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then they were respected with sympathizing silence by her husband who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution produced by her perilous illness as she was never subject to depression of spirits before the return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him i believe i may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness 
 it ended well we must be for ourselves in the long run the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the ones interest was not the chief consideration in the thoughts on a mellow evening in september i was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which i had been gathering it had got dusk and the moon looked over the high wall of the court causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building i set my burden on the house steps by the kitchen door and lingered to rest and drew in a few more breaths of the soft sweet air my eyes were on the moon and my back to the entrance when i heard a voice behind me say 
 nelly is that you 
 it was a deep voice and foreign in tone yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar i turned about to discover who spoke fearfully for the doors were shut and i had seen nobody on approaching the steps something stirred in the porch and moving nearer i distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes with dark face and hair he leant against the side and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself who can it be i thought mr earnshaw oh no the voice has no resemblance to his 
 i have waited here an hour he resumed while i continued staring and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death i dared not enter you do not know me look not a stranger 
 a ray fell on his features the cheeks were sallow and half covered with black whiskers the brows lowering the eyes deep set and singular i remembered the eyes 
 what i cried uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor and i raised my hands in amazement what you come back is it really you is it 
 yes heathcliff he replied glancing from me up to the windows which reflected a score of glittering moons but showed no lights from within are they at home where is she nelly you are not glad you be so disturbed is she here speak i want to have one word with mistress go and say some person from gimmerton desires to see her 
 how will she take it i exclaimed what will she do the surprise bewilders will put her out of her head and you are heathcliff but altered nay no comprehending it have you been for a soldier 
 go and carry my message he interrupted impatiently in hell till you do 
 he lifted the latch and i entered but when i got to the parlour where mr and mrs linton were i could not persuade myself to proceed at length i resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted and i opened the door 
 they sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall and displayed beyond the garden trees and the wild green park the valley of gimmerton with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top for very soon after you pass the chapel as you may have noticed the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen wuthering heights rose above this silvery vapour but our old house was invisible it rather dips down on the other side both the room and its occupants and the scene they gazed on looked wondrously peaceful i shrank reluctantly from performing my errand and was actually going away leaving it unsaid after having put my question about the candles when a sense of my folly compelled me to return and person from gimmerton wishes to see you 
 what does he want asked mrs linton 
 i did not question him i answered 
 well close the curtains nelly she said and bring up tea be back again directly 
 she quitted the apartment mr edgar inquired carelessly who it was 
 someone mistress does not expect i replied that recollect him used to live at mr 
 what the ploughboy he cried why did you not say so to catherine 
 hush you must not call him by those names master i said be sadly grieved to hear you she was nearly heartbroken when he ran off i guess his return will make a jubilee to her 
 mr linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court he unfastened it and leant out i suppose they were below for he exclaimed stand there love bring the person in if it be anyone particular ere long i heard the click of the latch and catherine flew upstairs breathless and wild too excited to show gladness indeed by her face you would rather have surmised an awful calamity 
 oh edgar edgar she panted flinging her arms round his neck oh edgar darling come is and she tightened her embrace to a squeeze 
 well well cried her husband crossly strangle me for that he never struck me as such a marvellous treasure there is no need to be frantic 
 i know you like him she answered repressing a little the intensity of her delight yet for my sake you must be friends now shall i tell him to come up 
 here he said into the parlour 
 where else she asked 
 he looked vexed and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him mrs linton eyed him with a droll angry half laughing at his fastidiousness 
 no she added after a while i cannot sit in the kitchen set two tables here ellen one for your master and miss isabella being gentry the other for heathcliff and myself being of the lower orders will that please you dear or must i have a fire lighted elsewhere if so give directions run down and secure my guest afraid the joy is too great to be real 
 she was about to dart off again but edgar arrested her 
 you bid him step up he said addressing me and catherine try to be glad without being absurd the whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother 
 i descended and found heathcliff waiting under the porch evidently anticipating an invitation to enter he followed my guidance without waste of words and i ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking but the glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door she sprang forward took both his hands and led him to linton and then she seized reluctant fingers and crushed them into his now fully revealed by the fire and candlelight i was amazed more than ever to behold the transformation of heathcliff he had grown a tall athletic man beside whom my master seemed quite slender and his upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army his countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than mr it looked intelligent and retained no marks of former degradation a ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire but it was subdued and his manner was even dignified quite divested of roughness though too stern for grace my surprise equalled or exceeded mine he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy as he had called him heathcliff dropped his slight hand and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak 
 sit down sir he said at length mrs linton recalling old times would have me give you a cordial reception and of course i am gratified when anything occurs to please her 
 and i also answered heathcliff especially if it be anything in which i have a part i shall stay an hour or two willingly 
 he took a seat opposite catherine who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it he did not raise his to her often a quick glance now and then sufficed but it flashed back each time more confidently the undisguised delight he drank from hers they were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment not so mr edgar he grew pale with pure annoyance a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose and stepping across the rug seized hands again and laughed like one beside herself 
 i shall think it a dream tomorrow she cried i shall not be able to believe that i have seen and touched and spoken to you once more and yet cruel heathcliff you deserve this welcome to be absent and silent for three years and never to think of me 
 a little more than you have thought of me he murmured i heard of your marriage cathy not long since and while waiting in the yard below i meditated this to have one glimpse of your face a stare of surprise perhaps and pretended pleasure afterwards settle my score with hindley and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time nay not drive me off again you were really sorry for me were you well there was cause fought through a bitter life since i last heard your voice and you must forgive me for i struggled only for you 
 catherine unless we are to have cold tea please to come to the table interrupted linton striving to preserve his ordinary tone and a due measure of politeness mr heathcliff will have a long walk wherever he may lodge tonight and thirsty 
 she took her post before the urn and miss isabella came summoned by the bell then having handed their chairs forward i left the room the meal hardly endured ten minutes cup was never filled she could neither eat nor drink edgar had made a slop in his saucer and scarcely swallowed a mouthful their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer i asked as he departed if he went to gimmerton 
 no to wuthering heights he answered mr earnshaw invited me when i called this morning 
 mr earnshaw invited him and he called on mr earnshaw i pondered this sentence painfully after he was gone is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak i mused i had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away 
 about the middle of the night i was wakened from my first nap by mrs linton gliding into my chamber taking a seat on my bedside and pulling me by the hair to rouse me 
 i cannot rest ellen she said by way of apology and i want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness edgar is sulky because glad of a thing that does not interest him he refuses to open his mouth except to utter pettish silly speeches and he affirmed i was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy he always contrives to be sick at the least cross i gave a few sentences of commendation to heathcliff and he either for a headache or a pang of envy began to cry so i got up and left him 
 what use is it praising heathcliff to him i answered as lads they had an aversion to each other and heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised human nature let mr linton alone about him unless you would like an open quarrel between them 
 but does it not show great weakness pursued she not envious i never feel hurt at the brightness of yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin at her dainty elegance and the fondness all the family exhibit for her even you nelly if we have a dispute sometimes you back isabella at once and i yield like a foolish mother i call her a darling and flatter her into a good temper it pleases her brother to see us cordial and that pleases me but they are very much alike they are spoiled children and fancy the world was made for their accommodation and though i humour both i think a smart chastisement might improve them all the same 
 mistaken mrs linton said i they humour you i know what there would be to do if they did not you can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires you may however fall out at last over something of equal consequence to both sides and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you 
 and then we shall fight to the death we nelly she returned laughing no i tell you i have such faith in love that i believe i might kill him and he wish to retaliate 
 i advised her to value him the more for his affection 
 i do she answered but he resort to whining for trifles it is childish and instead of melting into tears because i said that heathcliff was now worthy of regard and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend he ought to have said it for me and been delighted from sympathy he must get accustomed to him and he may as well like him considering how heathcliff has reason to object to him sure he behaved excellently 
 what do you think of his going to wuthering heights i inquired he is reformed in every respect apparently quite a christian offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around 
 he explained it she replied i wondered as much as you he said he called to gather information concerning me from you supposing you resided there still and joseph told hindley who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing and how he had been living and finally desired him to walk in there were some persons sitting at cards heathcliff joined them my brother lost some money to him and finding him plentifully supplied he requested that he would come again in the evening to which he consented hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently he trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured but heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the grange and an attachment to the house where we lived together and likewise a hope that i shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than i could have if he settled in gimmerton he means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the heights and doubtless my covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms he was always greedy though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other 
 a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in said i have you no fear of the consequences mrs linton 
 none for my friend she replied his strong head will keep him from danger a little for hindley but he be made morally worse than he is and i stand between him and bodily harm the event of this evening has reconciled me to god and humanity i had risen in angry rebellion against providence oh endured very very bitter misery nelly if that creature knew how bitter be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance it was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone had i expressed the agony i frequently felt he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as l however over and take no revenge on his folly i can afford to suffer anything hereafter should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek not only turn the other but ask pardon for provoking it and as a proof go make my peace with edgar instantly good night an angel 
 in this conviction she departed and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow mr linton had not only abjured his peevishness though his spirits seemed still subdued by exuberance of vivacity but he ventured no objection to her taking isabella with her to wuthering heights in the afternoon and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as made the house a paradise for several days both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine 
 heathcliff i should say in the liberty of visiting at thrushcross grange cautiously at first he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion catherine also deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him and he gradually established his right to be expected he retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling my uneasiness experienced a lull and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space 
 his new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of isabella linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest she was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen infantile in manners though possessed of keen wit keen feelings and a keen temper too if irritated her brother who loved her tenderly was appalled at this fantastic preference leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man and the possible fact that his property in default of heirs male might pass into such a power he had sense to comprehend disposition to know that though his exterior was altered his mind was unchangeable and unchanged and he dreaded that mind it revolted him he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing isabella to his keeping he would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment for the minute he discovered its existence he laid the blame on deliberate designing 
 we had all remarked during some time that miss linton fretted and pined over something she grew cross and wearisome snapping at and teasing catherine continually at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience we excused her to a certain extent on the plea of she was dwindling and fading before our eyes but one day when she had been peculiarly wayward rejecting her breakfast complaining that the servants did not do what she told them that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house and edgar neglected her that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations mrs linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed and having scolded her heartily threatened to send for the doctor mention of kenneth caused her to exclaim instantly that her health was perfect and it was only harshness which made her unhappy 
 how can you say i am harsh you naughty fondling cried the mistress amazed at the unreasonable assertion you are surely losing your reason when have i been harsh tell me 
 yesterday sobbed isabella and now 
 yesterday said her on what occasion 
 in our walk along the moor you told me to ramble where i pleased while you sauntered on with mr heathcliff 
 and your notion of harshness said catherine laughing it was no hint that your company was superfluous we care whether you kept with us or not i merely thought heathcliffs talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears 
 oh no wept the young lady you wished me away because you knew i liked to be there 
 is she sane asked mrs linton appealing to me repeat our conversation word for word isabella and you point out any charm it could have had for you 
 i mind the conversation she answered i wanted to be with 
 well said catherine perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence 
 with him and i be always sent off she continued kindling up you are a dog in the manger cathy and desire no one to be loved but yourself 
 you are an impertinent little monkey exclaimed mrs linton in surprise but not believe this idiocy it is impossible that you can covet the admiration of you consider him an agreeable person i hope i have misunderstood you isabella 
 no you have not said the infatuated girl i love him more than ever you loved edgar and he might love me if you would let him 
 i be you for a kingdom then catherine declared emphatically and she seemed to speak sincerely nelly help me to convince her of her madness tell her what heathcliff is an unreclaimed creature without refinement without cultivation an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone as soon put that little canary into the park on a day as recommend you to bestow your heart on him it is deplorable ignorance of his character child and nothing else which makes that dream enter your head pray imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior not a rough oyster of a rustic a fierce pitiless wolfish man i never say to him let this or that enemy alone because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them i say let them alone because i should hate them to be wronged and crush you like a egg isabella if he found you a troublesome charge i know he love a linton and yet be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations avarice is growing with him a besetting sin my picture and his much so that had he thought seriously to catch you i should perhaps have held my tongue and let you fall into his trap 
 miss linton regarded her with indignation 
 for shame for shame she repeated angrily you are worse than twenty foes you poisonous friend 
 ah you believe me then said catherine you think i speak from wicked selfishness 
 certain you do retorted isabella and i shudder at you 
 good cried the other try for yourself if that be your spirit i have done and yield the argument to your saucy insolence 
 and i must suffer for her egotism she sobbed as mrs linton left the room all all is against me she has blighted my single consolation but she uttered falsehoods she mr heathcliff is not a fiend he has an honourable soul and a true one or how could he remember her 
 banish him from your thoughts miss i said a bird of bad omen no mate for you mrs linton spoke strongly and yet i contradict her she is better acquainted with his heart than i or anyone besides and she would never represent him as worse than he is honest people hide their deeds how has he been living how has he got rich why is he staying at wuthering heights the house of a man whom he abhors they say mr earnshaw is worse and worse since he came they sit up all night together continually and hindley has been borrowing money on his land and does nothing but play and drink i heard only a week was joseph who told met him at gimmerton nelly he said hae a quest enah at ahr folks one on getten his finger cut off wi hauding froo sticking hisseln loike a cawlf maister yah knaw soa up uh going tuh t grand sizes noan feard uh t bench uh judges norther paul nur peter nur john nur matthew nor noan on em nut he he fair langs to set his brazened face agean em and yon bonny lad heathcliff yah mind a rare un he can girn a laugh as onybody at a raight jest does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us when he goas tuh t grange this is t way at sundahn dice brandy cloised shutters und till next day at nooin then t fooil gangs banning un raving to his makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i thur lugs fur varry shaume un the knave wah he carn cahnt his brass un ate un sleep un off to his tuh gossip wi t wife i course he tells dame catherine hah hor goold runs intuh his pocket and her son gallops dahn t broad road while he flees afore to oppen t pikes now miss linton joseph is an old rascal but no liar and if his account of conduct be true you would never think of desiring such a husband would you 
 you are leagued with the rest ellen she replied not listen to your slanders what malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world 
 whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself or persevered in nursing it perpetually i cannot say she had little time to reflect the day after there was a at the next town my master was obliged to attend and mr heathcliff aware of his absence called rather earlier than usual catherine and isabella were sitting in the library on hostile terms but silent the latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion the former on mature consideration really offended with her companion and if she laughed again at her pertness inclined to make it no laughing matter to her she did laugh as she saw heathcliff pass the window i was sweeping the hearth and i noticed a mischievous smile on her lips isabella absorbed in her meditations or a book remained till the door opened and it was too late to attempt an escape which she would gladly have done had it been practicable 
 come in right exclaimed the mistress gaily pulling a chair to the fire here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them and you are the very one we should both of us choose heathcliff proud to show you at last somebody that dotes on you more than myself i expect you to feel flattered nay not nelly look at her my poor little is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty it lies in your own power to be brother no no isabella you run off she continued arresting with feigned playfulness the confounded girl who had risen indignantly we were quarrelling like cats about you heathcliff and i was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration and moreover i was informed that if i would but have the manners to stand aside my rival as she will herself to be would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever and send my image into eternal oblivion 
 catherine said isabella calling up her dignity and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me even in joke mr heathcliff be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me she forgets that you and i are not intimate acquaintances and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression 
 as the guest answered nothing but took his seat and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor 
 by no means cried mrs linton in answer i be named a dog in the manger again you shall stay now then heathcliff why you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news isabella swears that the love edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you sure she made some speech of the kind did she not ellen and she has fasted ever since the day before walk from sorrow and rage that i dispatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable 
 i think you belie her said heathcliff twisting his chair to face them she wishes to be out of my society now at any rate and he stared hard at the object of discourse as one might do at a strange repulsive animal a centipede from the indies for instance which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises the poor thing bear that she grew white and red in rapid succession and while tears beaded her lashes bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of catherine and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down and she could not remove the whole together she began to make use of her nails and their sharpness presently ornamented the with crescents of red 
 a tigress exclaimed mrs linton setting her free and shaking her hand with pain begone for sake and hide your vixen face how foolish to reveal those talons to him you fancy the conclusions draw look heathcliff they are instruments that will do must beware of your eyes 
 wrench them off her fingers if they ever menaced me he answered brutally when the door had closed after her but what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner cathy you were not speaking the truth were you 
 i assure you i was she returned she has been pining for your sake several weeks and raving about you this morning and pouring forth a deluge of abuse because i represented your failings in a plain light for the purpose of mitigating her adoration but notice it further i wished to punish her sauciness all i like her too well my dear heathcliff to let you absolutely seize and devour her up 
 and i like her too ill to attempt it said he except in a very ghoulish fashion hear of odd things if i lived alone with that mawkish waxen face the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow and turning the blue eyes black every day or two they detestably resemble 
 delectably observed catherine they are 
 her heir is she not he asked after a brief silence 
 i should be sorry to think so returned his companion half a dozen nephews shall erase her title please heaven abstract your mind from the subject at present you are too prone to covet your goods remember this goods are mine 
 if they were mine they would be none the less that said heathcliff but though isabella linton may be silly she is scarcely mad and in short dismiss the matter as you advise 
 from their tongues they did dismiss it and catherine probably from her thoughts the other i felt certain recalled it often in the course of the evening i saw him smile to lapse into ominous musing whenever mrs linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment 
 i determined to watch his movements my heart invariably cleaved to the in preference to side with reason i imagined for he was kind and trustful and honourable and could not be called the opposite yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude that i had little faith in her principles and still less sympathy for her feelings i wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both wuthering heights and the grange of mr heathcliff quietly leaving us as we had been prior to his advent his visits were a continual nightmare to me and i suspected to my master also his abode at the heights was an oppression past explaining i felt that god had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold waiting his time to spring and destroy

 chapter ten 
 
 as spring came on a new set of amusements became the fashion and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for work and play of all sorts the garden had to be put in order and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she liked with hannah used to say know which each of them gardings belonged to ef i see em in chiny and so she might for the girls tastes differed as much as their characters had roses and heliotrope myrtle and a little orange tree in it bed was never alike two seasons for she was always trying experiments this year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers the seeds of which cheerful land aspiring plant were to feed aunt and her family of chicks beth had fragrant flowers in her garden sweet peas and mignonette larkspur pinks pansies and southernwood with chickweed for the birds and catnip for the pussies amy had a bower in hers rather small and earwiggy but very pretty to look at with honeysuckle and hanging their colored horns and bells in graceful wreaths all over it tall white lilies delicate ferns and as many brilliant picturesque plants as would consent to blossom there 
 gardening walks rows on the river and flower hunts employed the fine days and for rainy ones they had house diversions some old some new all more or less original one of these was the for as secret societies were the was thought proper to have one and as all of the girls admired dickens they called themselves the pickwick club with a few interruptions they had kept this up for a year and met every saturday evening in the big garret on which occasions the ceremonies were as follows three chairs were arranged in a row before a table on which was a lamp also four white badges with a big in different colors on each and the weekly newspaper called the pickwick portfolio to which all contributed something while jo who reveled in pens and ink was the editor at seven the four members ascended to the clubroom tied their badges round their heads and took their seats with great solemnity meg as the eldest was samuel pickwick jo being of a literary turn augustus snodgrass beth because she was round and rosy tracy tupman and amy who was always trying to do what she was nathaniel winkle pickwick the president read the paper which was filled with original tales poetry local news funny advertisements and hints in which they reminded each other of their faults and short comings on one occasion mr pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass rapped upon the table hemmed and having stared hard at mr snodgrass who was tilting back in his chair till he arranged himself properly began to read

 anniversary ode 
 again we meet to celebrate 
 with badge and solemn rite 
 our anniversary 
 in pickwick hall tonight 
 we all are here in perfect health 
 none gone from our small band 
 again we see each face 
 and press each friendly hand 
 our pickwick always at his post 
 with reverence we greet 
 as spectacles on nose he reads 
 our weekly sheet 
 although he suffers from a cold 
 we joy to hear him speak 
 for words of wisdom from him fall 
 in spite of croak or squeak 
 old snodgrass looms on high 
 with elephantine grace 
 and beams upon the company 
 with brown and jovial face 
 poetic fire lights up his eye 
 he struggles gainst his lot 
 behold ambition on his brow 
 and on his nose a blot 
 next our peaceful tupman comes 
 so rosy plump and sweet 
 who chokes with laughter at the puns 
 and tumbles off his seat 
 prim little winkle too is here 
 with every hair in place 
 a model of propriety 
 though he hates to wash his face 
 the year is gone we still unite 
 to joke and laugh and read 
 and tread the path of literature 
 that doth to glory lead 
 long may our paper prosper well 
 our club unbroken be 
 and coming years their blessings pour 
 on the useful gay p c

 the masked marriage 
 a tale of venice 
 gondola after gondola swept up to the marble steps and left its lovely load to swell the brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of count adelon knights and ladies elves and pages monks and flower girls all mingled gaily in the dance 
 sweet voices and rich melody filled the air and so with mirth and music the masquerade went on has your highness seen the lady viola tonight asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm 
 yes is she not lovely though so sad her dress is well chosen too for in a week she weds count antonio whom she passionately hates 
 by my faith i envy him yonder he comes arrayed like a bridegroom except the black mask when that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win though her stern father bestows her hand returned the troubadour 
 tis whispered that she loves the young english artist who haunts her steps and is spurned by the old count said the lady as they joined the dance the revel was at its height when a priest appeared and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove hung with purple velvet he motioned them to kneel instant silence fell on the gay throng and not a sound but he dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight broke the hush as count de adelon spoke thus 
 my lords and ladies pardon the ruse by which i have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter father we wait your services all eyes turned toward the bridal party and a murmur of amazement went through the throng for neither bride nor groom removed their masks curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over then the eager spectators gathered round the count demanding an explanation 
 
 gladly would i give it if i could but i only know that it was the whim of my timid viola and i yielded to it now my children let the play end unmask and receive my blessing 
 but neither bent the knee for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell disclosing the noble face of ferdinand devereux the artist lover and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an english earl was the lovely viola radiant with joy and beauty 
 my lord you scornfully bade me claim your daughter when i could boast as high a name and vast a fortune as the count antonio i can do more for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the earl of devereux and de vere when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady now my wife 
 the count stood like one changed to stone and turning to the bewildered crowd ferdinand added with a gay smile of triumph to you my gallant friends i can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has done and that you may all win as fair a bride as i have by this masked marriage

 the history of a squash 
 
 
 once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed in his garden and after a while it sprouted and became a vine and bore many squashes one day in october when they were ripe he picked one and took it to market a gorcerman bought and put it in his shop that same morning a little girl in a brown hat and blue dress with a round face and snub nose went and bought it for her mother she lugged it home cut it up and boiled it in the big pot mashed some of it salt and butter for dinner and to the rest she added a pint of milk two eggs four spoons of sugar nutmeg and some crackers put it in a deep dish and baked it till it was brown and nice and next day it was eaten by a family named march

 the above is a manly and handsome aknowledgment of past misdemeanors if our young friend studied punctuation it would be well 
 
 
 a sad accident 
 
 on friday last we were startled by a violent shock in our basement followed by cries of distress on rushing in a body to the cellar we discovered our beloved president prostrate upon the floor having tripped and fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes a perfect scene of ruin met our eyes for in his fall mr pickwick had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form and torn his garments badly on being removed from this perilous situation it was discovered that he had suffered no injury but several bruises and we are happy to add is now doing well 
 ed 
 the public bereavement 
 it is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend mrs snowball pat paw this lovely and beloved cat was the pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends for her beauty attracted all eyes her graces and virtues endeared her to all hearts and her loss is deeply felt by the whole community 
 when last seen she was sitting at the gate watching the cart and it is feared that some villain tempted by her charms basely stole her weeks have passed but no trace of her has been discovered and we relinquish all hope tie a black ribbon to her basket set aside her dish and weep for her as one lost to us forever 
 
 a sympathizing friend sends the following gem 
 
 a lament 
 for s b pat paw 
 we mourn the loss of our little pet 
 and sigh her hapless fate 
 for never more by the fire sit 
 nor play by the old green gate 
 the little grave where her infant sleeps 
 is neath the chestnut tree 
 but her grave we may not weep 
 we know not where it may be 
 her empty bed her idle ball 
 will never see her more 
 no gentle tap no loving purr 
 is heard at the parlor door 
 another cat comes after her mice 
 a cat with a dirty face 
 but she does not hunt as our darling did 
 nor play with her airy grace 
 her stealthy paws tread the very hall 
 where snowball used to play 
 but she only spits at the dogs our pet 
 so gallantly drove away 
 she is useful and mild and does her best 
 but she is not fair to see 
 and we cannot give her your place dear 
 nor worship her as we worship thee

 as the president finished reading the paper which i beg leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written by bona fide girls once upon a time a round of applause followed and then mr snodgrass rose to make a proposition 
 mr president and gentlemen he began assuming a parliamentary attitude and tone i wish to propose the admission of a new who highly deserves the honor would be deeply grateful for it and would add immensely to the spirit of the club the literary value of the paper and be no end jolly and nice i propose mr theodore laurence as an honorary member of the p c come now do have him 
 sudden change of tone made the girls laugh but all looked rather anxious and no one said a word as snodgrass took his seat 
 put it to a vote said the president all in favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying aye 
 say no 
 meg and amy were and mr winkle rose to say with great elegance we wish any boys they only joke and bounce about this is a ladies club and we wish to be private and proper 
 afraid laugh at our paper and make fun of us afterward observed pickwick pulling the little curl on her forehead as she always did when doubtful 
 up rose snodgrass very much in earnest sir i give you my word as a gentleman laurie do anything of the sort he likes to write and give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being sentimental you see we can do so little for him and he does so much for us i think the least we can do is to offer him a place here and make him welcome if he comes 
 this artful allusion to benefits conferred brought tupman to his feet looking as if he had quite made up his mind 
 yes we ought to do it even if we are afraid i say he may come and his grandpa too if he likes 
 this spirited burst from beth electrified the club and jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly now then vote again everybody remember our laurie and say aye cried snodgrass excitedly 
 aye aye aye replied three voices at once 
 good bless you now as nothing like taking time by the fetlock as winkle characteristically observes allow me to present the new member and to the dismay of the rest of the club jo threw open the door of the closet and displayed laurie sitting on a rag bag flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter 
 you rogue you traitor jo how could you cried the three girls as snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth and producing both a chair and a badge installed him in a jiffy 
 the coolness of you two rascals is amazing began mr pickwick trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing an amiable smile but the new member was equal to the occasion and rising with a grateful salutation to the chair said in the most engaging manner mr president and beg pardon me to introduce myself as sam weller the very humble servant of the club 
 good good cried jo pounding with the handle of the old warming pan on which she leaned 
 my faithful friend and noble patron continued laurie with a wave of the hand who has so flatteringly presented me is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight i planned it and she only gave in after lots of teasing 
 come now lay it all on yourself you know i proposed the cupboard broke in snodgrass who was enjoying the joke amazingly 
 never mind what she says the wretch that did it sir said the new member with a welleresque nod to mr pickwick but on my honor i never will do so again and henceforth devote myself to the interest of this immortal club 
 hear hear cried jo clashing the lid of the warming pan like a cymbal 
 go on go on added winkle and tupman while the president bowed benignly 
 i merely wish to say that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations i have set up a post office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden a fine spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails also the females if i may be allowed the expression the old martin house but stopped up the door and made the roof open so it will hold all sorts of things and save our valuable time letters manuscripts books and bundles can be passed in there and as each nation has a key it will be uncommonly nice i fancy allow me to present the club key and with many thanks for your favor take my seat 
 great applause as mr weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided the warming pan clashed and waved wildly and it was some time before order could be restored a long discussion followed and everyone came out surprising for everyone did her best so it was an unusually lively meeting and did not adjourn till a late hour when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the new member no one ever regretted the admittance of sam weller for a more devoted and jovial member no club could have he certainly did add spirit to the meetings and a tone to the paper for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions were excellent being patriotic classical comical or dramatic but never sentimental jo regarded them as worthy of bacon milton or shakespeare and remodeled her own works with good effect she thought 
 the p o was a capital little institution and flourished wonderfully for nearly as many queer things passed through it as through the real post office tragedies and cravats poetry and pickles garden seeds and long letters music and gingerbread rubbers invitations scoldings and puppies the old gentleman liked the fun and amused himself by sending odd bundles mysterious messages and funny telegrams and his gardener who was smitten with charms actually sent a love letter to care how they laughed when the secret came out never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come

 imhotep ignores it and kisses evelyn his lips and mouth 
 instantly start to degenerate and decay right down to the 
 bone the door bursts open evelyn sees 
 rotted mouth kissing her she screams and shoves him away 
 putrid mouth grimaces in sadness

 sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces 
 imhotep licks his fetid lips smirks

 imhotep starts to move for 
 
 i figured you might be here 
 so i brought a friend 
 he throws the white cat at imhotep imhotep instinctively 
 catches it he shrieks drops the cat and stumbles back 
 towards the window which suddenly blows open imhotep 
 spins like a dervish and bursts into a whirlwind of sand 
 everybody covers their eyes the explodes 
 out the window and vanishes over the compound 
 jonathan aims his gun at the window his hand shaking badly 
 hugs evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust 
 daniels walks in looks at shriveled body on 
 the floor and drops the martini glasses 
 int convertible dussenberg night 
 jonathan races his big convertible through the streets 
 honking constantly evelyn sits between him and 
 looking scared and nervous then she gives a look 
 evelyn 
 you called me your girl 
 
 what oh yeah that was just 
 um you know figure a speech 
 evelyn 
 i think you were jealous 
 
 jealous you kiddin me did 
 you see that face 
 daniels leans forward from the back seat filled with fear 
 daniels 
 just we gotta 
 do somethin we gotta do somethin 
 now before too late 
 they race into the driveway of the museum of antiquities 
 ext cairo bazaar night 
 a full moon now shines down on the bazaar still bustling 
 with activity suddenly a breeze green mist begins 
 to swirl down the street and through the stalls the people 
 begin to choke and cough and retch as if being hit by a 
 severe sickness already too late 
 imhotep strolls through the sickened mob his face half 
 rotted off his deformed mouth grinning happily beni is 
 at his side looking very nervous and then 
 the people silently begin to follow imhotep their skin 
 now covered in disgustingly hideous boils and sores 
 int museum of antiquities night 
 jonathan daniels the curator and ardeth bay 
 evelyn as she strides through the museum 
 evelyn 
 last month i came across an 
 inscription that mentioned 
 the book of the dead 
 daniels 
 that book we found at hamunaptra 
 evelyn 
 yes i dismissed it because it 
 talked about bringing people 
 back from the dead a notion 
 i was unwilling to believe 
 
 believe it sister what 
 brought our buddy back to life 
 jonathan 
 and now going to use it 
 to bring his girlfriend back 
 ardeth bay 
 and if he succeeds the two of 
 them together will bring about 
 the apocalypse 
 the curator joins evelyn at her side as she heads up the 
 stairs everyone else in hot pursuit 
 the curator 
 the plagues we have seen so far 
 are merely imhotep flexing his 
 muscles only at the moment of 
 resurrection 
 will he be truly invincible 
 they reach the display cases evelyn quickly opens them 
 evelyn 
 thinking that if the black 
 book of the dead can bring people 
 back to life 
 curator 
 then perhaps the golden book 
 of the living can return them 
 to the underworld 
 evelyn 
 exactly 
 
 so your sayin if we find the 
 book made outta gold 
 curator 
 and read the sacred incantations 
 contained inside it 
 
 you think send this guy 
 back to hell 
 curator 
 correct 
 and when loud chanting is heard coming from outside 
 they all rush over to the upper windows and look down 
 outside a large crazed mob covered in hideous boils and sores 
 comes chanting up the driveway 
 ardeth bay 
 it has begun the beginning of 
 the end 
 evelyn 
 not quite yet it 
 evelyn dashes back to the display cases everyone follows 
 ext museum night 
 the crazed mob crashes into the huge front doors which are 
 locked they pound furiously throwing themselves at it while 
 chanting constantly imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway 
 int museum of antiquities upper balcony night 
 the banging on the doors can be heard as evelyn and the 
 curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets 
 the others watch evelyn pulls out a large piece 
 evelyn 
 got it 
 
 got what 
 the banging gets louder multiple windows shatter evelyn 
 talks while quickly translating the tablet 
 evelyn 
 since the black book of the dead 
 was found inside the statue of 
 anubis then according to this 
 the golden book of the living 
 should be inside 
 evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles 
 
 what 
 jonathan 
 what 
 daniels 
 what 
 evelyn 
 the golden book of the living 
 is inside the statue of 
 curator 
 which would be located not far to 
 the east of the anubis statue 
 
 tell me we gotta go back 
 out there 
 curator 
 if we want to kill the creature yes 
 two hideous boil men charge out of a doorway 
 screaming and ardeth bay grab them and chuck them 
 over the railing the men fly through the air and crash into 
 the lower display cases the front doors suddenly burst open 
 the crazed mob pours into the museum our heroes 
 across the balcony and down the staircase 
 ext museum of antiquity night 
 jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his 
 convertible suddenly a splinter group of the diseased mob 
 comes around the side of the museum jonathan instantly bugs 
 his eyes out starts drooling and begins chanting 
 jonathan 
 
 the crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors 
 of the museum jonathan leaps into the convertible fires it 
 up and s it back over to the bushes 
 evelyn daniels ardeth bay and the curator jump 
 inside the car beni steps out of the museum and sees them 
 beni 
 imhotep imhotep 
 imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper 
 windows just as the convertible peels out points a 
 finger at beni as they race past him 
 
 gonna get yours pal 
 imhotep unhinges his jaw his mouth stretches to an inhuman 
 size he lets out one of his horrific primordial shrieks 
 his disciples immediately begin pouring out 
 of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car 
 ext bazaar night 
 the convertible down the narrow bazaar street 
 crazies start jumping out of stalls and leaping onto the 
 car and the others fight them off throwing them 
 overboard more people jump on jonathan swerves the car 
 crashes through some stalls knocking them off but not 
 before they manage to open the back door and yank daniels 
 out he tumbles across the pavement gets up shooting backs 
 into a corner firing his pistol into the hideous rabble 
 killing several keeping them at bay his gun goes empty 
 click click click but the mob stays back looking at him 
 like rabid vultures daniels eyes them filled with fear 
 the mob parts like the red sea as imhotep walks through them 
 and up to daniels daniels whimpers in fear tears pour down 
 his cheeks then he gets an idea reaches into his pocket 
 and pulls out his jewel encrusted sacred canopic jar he 
 holds it out for imhotep imhotep takes it and grins through 
 his tears daniels grins back hopeful that be spared 
 we cut wide somewhere in the middle of the crazed diseased 
 mob we hear daniels give out a blood curdling scream 
 convertible streets night 
 the convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys we 
 dolly across the hood of the car from jonathan to evelyn to 
 ardeth bay and the curator are still in the back 
 all of them staring out the front windshield 
 then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls crashes through the 
 windshield everybody screams jonathan hits the gas loses 
 control the car slams into a wall grabs evelyn 
 
 go go 
 
 they all leap out of the car but the angry festering mob 
 quickly surrounds them quickly reaches into his 
 pulls out a stick of dynamite then reaches into 
 his pocket and pulls out a match he looks around for a way 
 to light it then reaches over and strikes it across ardeth 
 stubbly face ardeth bay yelps holds the lit 
 match near the fuse 
 the crazed chanting mob gives a wide berth 
 staring at him and the others with insane bloodshot eyes 
 and then imhotep steps through having fully regenerated 
 he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did the 
 day he was buried alive evelyn stares at him 
 evelyn 
 gorgeous 
 gives her a look the match burns his fingers he 
 yelps and throws it down grabs another match and strikes it 
 across ardeth face again ardeth bay yelps and gives 
 a look to kill the curator shakes his head 
 the curator 
 he has consummated the curse 
 now all he need do is raise 
 from the dead 
 then it will be the end of us 
 and the beginning for them 
 imhotep moves forward heading right for them 
 lights the fuse imhotep steps up to and stops 
 watching the fuse burn down a game of chicken the 
 tension mounts the lit fuse is about to vanish inside the 
 stick of dynamite blowing it up when evelyn leans forward 
 and blows it out exhales but keeps his eyes on 
 imhotep who extends his hand to evelyn 
 imhotep 
 koontash dai na 
 beni steps through the swarming mass translating 
 beni 
 take his hand and he will 
 spare the others 
 evelyn hesitates looks around at the huge bloodthirsty 
 crowd surrounding them holding axes picks and scimitars 
 waiting to pounce then she looks at imhotep confident 
 powerful invincible then she looks at 
 evelyn 
 any bright ideas 
 
 talks through angry grit teeth 
 
 sorry fresh out 
 evelyn looks back at imhotep then starts to reach out to 
 take his hand both and jonathan move to stop her 
 but ardeth bay grabs them both and holds them tight

 evelyn

 trembling hand touches his hand closes 
 around hers nothing happens imhotep smiles 
 imhotep 
 keetah mi pharos aja nilo isirlan 
 beni

 time to make you mine forever 
 evelyn gives beni a nasty look correcting him 
 evelyn 
 all eternity idiot 
 then she looks at and puts on her best face 
 evelyn

 because if he turns me into a 
 mummy your the first one 
 coming after

 imhotep suddenly notices something he reaches forward and 
 rips the out of upper jacket pocket

 ardeth grip 
 
 evelyn

 int fitts house bedroom continuous 
 we hear atomic soda 
 on video outside in a wooded area looking up at the sun through tree branches then we pan down to see a path through the trees in front of us something out of focus crosses by in front us obscuring our view we slowly zoom back and see that jane or rather just a corner of her face as she looks at us her eyes shining her hand brushes the hair off her face and we stay on her hand it swings back and forth gracefully she walks ahead in front of us we jump cut to 
 on video close on naked calves her jeans rolled up as she dangles her feet in a pond the water ripples in concentric circles every time she dips her toes in not unlike the water in the jail cell sink at the beginning we jump cut to 
 on video moving in a circle as jane runs around us in the opposite direction so that we see only flashes of her running by laughing jump cut to 
 on video jane in profile looking toward the sky her yesshut enjoying the sun on her face 
 ricky beautiful 
 she looks at us and smiles her guard down her face empty ofits usual vaguely contemptuous expression and indeed she is beautiful young happy hopeful we linger on her face for a moment she brings her hand up to caress her cheek and then still smiling she slowly flips us the bird we jump cut to 
 on video looking at shadow clearly delineated by the bright sun against a textured carpet of fallen leaves on the forest floor we hear her giggle as she makes shadow puppets with her hand then we move around so that looking up at her silhouetted against the bun even though we make out her features this image seems transcendent almost religious 
 on video jane in bed naked she quickly pulls a sheet up over her breasts 
 t 
 pulling back we see been watching the tv in room 
 a cord leads from the tv to video camera ricky holds the camera sitting naked in his desk chair been almost a month since he was beaten up by his father and there are a couple of slight scars on his face focusing his camera on jane lying in his bed we see her image on the tv atomic soda plays on the stereo

 int room 
 neo wakes up from a deep sleep feeling better he is 
 wearing a black tank top and shorts 
 he begins to examine himself there is a futuristic iv 
 plugged into the jack in his forearm he pulls it out 
 staring at the grafted outlet 
 he feels his bald head his fingers find and explore the 
 large outlet in the base of his skull 
 just as he starts to come unglued morpheus opens the 
 door 
 neo 
 morpheus happened to me 
 what is this place 
 morpheus 
 more important than what is when 
 neo 
 when 
 morpheus 
 you believe the year is when in fact it is much closer to 
 i say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not 
 know 
 the wind is knocked from chest 
 neo 
 not possible 
 morpheus 
 i promised you the truth neo and the truth is that the world you 
 were living in was a lie 
 neo 
 how 
 morpheus 
 show you 
 
 int hovercraft 
 like a sleepwalker neo follows morpheus through the ship 
 morpheus 
 this is my ship the nebuchadnezzar a hovercraft small like a 
 submarine dark cramped and cold but home 
 they climb a ladder up to the main deck 
 
 int main deck 
 everyone is there 
 morpheus 
 this is the main deck you know most of my crew 
 trinity smiles and nods 
 morpheus 
 the ones you know mouse and switch the two big 
 guys are tank and dozer 
 the names and faces wash meaninglessly over neo 
 morpheus 
 and this this is the core this is where we broadcast our pirate 
 signal and hack into the matrix 
 it is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment vines of 
 coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic 
 battery slabs a black portable satellite dish and banks 
 of little systems and computer monitors 
 at the center of the web there are six ectoskeleton 
 chairs made of a frame and suspension harness 
 near the circle of chairs is the control console and 
 station where the network is monitored 
 morpheus 
 help him trinity 
 neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs 
 morpheus 
 do you remember when i asked you about an apparatus that could turn a virtual reality into reality 
 neo nods 
 morpheus 
 right here 
 he touches head 
 morpheus 
 and accessed here 
 neo feels morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack 
 at the back of his neck the cable has the same kind of 
 cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant 
 morpheus 
 this will feel a little weird 
 there are several disturbing noises as he works the 
 needle in 
 we move in as shoulders bunch and his face tightens 
 into a grimace until a loud click fires and his ears pop 
 like when you equalize them underwater 
 he relaxes opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling 
 of weightlessness inside another place 
 
 int construct 
 neo is standing in an empty space 
 morpheus 
 this is the construct 
 startled neo whips around and finds morpheus now in the 
 room with him 
 morpheus 
 it is our loading program we can load anything from clothes to 
 weapons to training simulations anything we need 
 morpheus walks past neo and when neo turns he sees the 
 two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a 
 television 
 morpheus 
 sit down 
 neo stands at the back of the chair as morpheus sits 
 neo 
 right now inside a computer program 
 morpheus 
 wild it 
 hands run over the cracked leather 
 neo 
 this real 
 morpheus 
 what is real how do you define real if talking about 
 your senses what you feel taste smell or see then all 
 talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain 
 he picks up a remote control and clicks on the 
 television we drift through the windy city circa 
 morpheus 
 this is the chicago you know chicago as it was at the end of 
 the twentieth century this chicago exists only as part of a 
 simulation that we call the matrix 
 we glide at the television as he changes the channel 
 morpheus 
 you have been living inside vision inside the 
 map not the territory this is chicago as it exists today 
 the sky is an endless sea of black and green bile the 
 earth scorched and split like burnt flesh spreads out 
 beneath us as we enter the television 
 morpheus 
 the desert of the real 
 in the distance we see the ruins of a future chicago 
 protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of 
 a corpse 
 morpheus 
 we are right now miles below the surface the only place 
 humans can survive outside the matrix is underground 
 still moving we turn and find neo and morpheus the 
 chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert 
 dizzy neo holds onto the chair 
 neo 
 what happened 
 morpheus 
 it started early in the twenty first century with the birth of 
 artificial intelligence a singular consciousness that 
 spawned an entire race of machines 
 in his sunglasses we see storm clouds gather 
 morpheus 
 at first all they wanted was to be treated as equals entitled to the 
 same human inalienable rights whatever they were given it was not enough 
 in the circular window of the glasses explosions light 
 up a bloody battle field 
 morpheus 
 we know who struck first us or them but sometime at the 
 end of the century the battle was joined 
 we move into his glasses and the war surrounds us 
 morpheus 
 the war raged for generations and turned the face of our planet from green and blue to black and red 
 at last we see the sentinels killing machines that are 
 at once terrifying and beautiful they have an organic 
 architecture like a microbiotic organism that is 
 perpetually in motion 
 the sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier 
 splitting open the soft stearing meat inside 
 morpheus 
 it scorched and burned the sky without the sun the machines 
 sought out a new energy source to survive 
 the sentinel locks up as heat lightning of black ink 
 bursts against the sky spreading into a permanent cloud 
 of stain 
 morpheus 
 they discovered a new form of fusion all that was required to 
 initiate the reaction was a small electric charge throughout human 
 history we have been dependent on machines to survive fate it 
 seems is not without a sense of irony 
 we return to the power plant that neo escaped from where 
 we see human beings looking almost blissful in their 
 gelatin cocoons 
 morpheus 
 the human body generates more bio electricity than a volt 
 battery and over of body heat 
 outside spreading all around the power plant beneath a 
 breathing greenhouse are the growing fields 
 morpheus 
 we are as an energy source easily renewable and completely 
 recyclable the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living 
 huge reapers are harvesting the crop 
 morpheus 
 all they needed to control this new battery was something to 
 occupy our mind 
 we see inside a clear tubular husk floating in viscous 
 fluid there is a human fetus its soft skull already 
 growing around the 
 morpheus 
 and so they built a prison out of our past wired it to our brains 
 and turned us into slaves 
 we pull back to find the image is now on the television 
 and we are again inside the white space of the construct 
 neo 
 no i believe it not possible 
 morpheus 
 i say that it would be easy neo i just said that it 
 would be the truth 
 the room without walls begins to spin 
 neo 
 stop let me out i want out

lionfish nov chapter ten the rogue bludgercontents prev chapter next chapter 
 since the disastrous episode of the pixies professor lockhart had not brought live creatures to class instead he read passages from his books to them and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits he usually picked harry to help him with these reconstructions so far harry had been forced to play a simple transylvanian villager whom lockhart had cured of a babbling curse a yeti with a head cold and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since lockhart had dealt with him 
 
 harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next defense against the dark arts lesson this time acting a werewolf if he had a very good reason for keeping lockhart in a good mood he would have refused to do it 
 
 nice loud howl harry exactly and then if believe it i pounced like this slammed him to the floor thus with one hand i managed to hold him down with my other i put my wand to his throat i then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex homorphus charm he let out a piteous moan go on harry higher than that good the fur vanished the fangs shrank and he turned back into a man simple yet effective and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks 
 
 the bell rang and lockhart got to his feet 
 
 homework compose a poem about my defeat of the wagga wagga werewolf signed copies of magical me to the author of the best one 
 
 the class began to leave harry returned to the back of the room where ron and hermione were waiting 
 
 ready harry muttered 
 
 wait till gone said hermione nervously all right 
 
 she approached desk a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand harry and ron right behind her 
 
 er professor lockhart hermione stammered i wanted to to get this book out of the library just for background reading she held out the piece of paper her hand shaking slightly but the thing is in the restricted section of the library so i need a teacher to sign for it sure it would help me understand what you say in gadding with ghouls about venoms 
 
 ah gadding with ghouls said lockhart taking the note from hermione and smiling widely at her possibly my very favorite book you enjoyed it 
 
 oh yes said hermione eagerly so clever the way you trapped that last one with the 
 
 well sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help said lockhart warmly and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill yes nice it he said misreading the revolted look on face i usually save it for 
 
 he scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to hermione 
 
 so harry said lockhart while hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag the first quidditch match of the season i believe gryffindor against slytherin is it not i hear a useful player i was a seeker too i was asked to try for the national squad but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the dark forces still if ever you feel the need for a little private training hesitate to ask always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players 
 
 harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after ron and hermione 
 
 i believe it he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note he even look at the book we wanted 
 
 because a brainless git said ron but who cares got what we needed 
 
 he is not a brainless git said hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library 
 
 just because he said you were the best student of the year 
 
 they dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library madam pince the librarian was a thin irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture 
 
 moste potente potions she repeated suspiciously trying to take the note from hermione but hermione let go 
 
 i was wondering if i could keep it she said breathlessly 
 
 oh come on said ron wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at madam pince get you another autograph sign anything if it stands still long enough 
 
 madam pince held the note up to the light as though determined to detect a forgery but it passed the test she stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and book hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty 
 
 five minutes later they were barricaded in moaning bathroom once again hermione had overridden objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go so they were guaranteed some privacy moaning myrtle was crying noisily in her stall but they were ignoring her and she them 
 
 hermione opened moste potente potions carefully and the three of them bent over the pages it was clear from a glance why it belonged in the restricted section some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about and there were some very unpleasant illustrations which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head 
 
 here it is said hermione excitedly as she found the page headed the polyjuice potion it was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces 
 
 this is the most complicated potion ever seen said hermione as they scanned the recipe lacewing flies leeches fluxweed and knotgrass she murmured running her finger down the list of ingredients well easy enough in the student we can help ourselves oooh look powdered horn of a bicorn know where going to get that shredded skin of a boomslang be tricky too and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into 
 
 excuse me said ron sharply what mean a bit of whoever changing into drinking nothing with toenails in it 
 
 hermione continued as though she heard him 
 
 we have to worry about that yet though because we add those bits last 
 
 ron turned speechless to harry who had another worry 
 
 realize how much going to have to steal hermione shredded skin of a boomslang definitely not in the we going to do break into private stores i know if this is a good idea 
 
 hermione shut the book with a snap 
 
 well if you two are going to chicken out fine she said there were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual i want to break rules you know i think threatening is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion but if you want to find out if malfoy go straight to madam pince now and hand the book back in 
 
 
 i never thought id see the day when be persuading us to break rules said ron all right do it but not toenails okay 
 
 how long will it take to make anyway said harry as hermione looking happier opened the book again 
 
 well since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for days say be ready in about a month if we can get all the ingredients 
 
 a month said ron malfoy could have attacked half the in the school by then but eyes narrowed dangerously again and he added swiftly but the best plan got so full steam ahead i say 
 
 however while hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom ron muttered to harry be a lot less hassle if you can just knock malfoy off his broom tomorrow 
 
 harry woke early on saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming quidditch match he was nervous mainly at the thought of what wood would say if gryffindor lost but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy he had never wanted to beat slytherin so badly after half an hour of lying there with his insides churning he got up dressed and went down to breakfast early where he found the rest of the gryffindor team huddled at the long empty table all looking uptight and not speaking much 
 
 as eleven approached the whole school started to make its way down to the quidditch stadium it was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air ron and hermione came hurrying over to wish harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms the team pulled on their scarlet gryffindor robes then sat down to listen to usual pep talk 
 
 slytherin has better brooms than us he began no point denying it but got better people on our brooms trained harder than they have been flying in all weathers too true muttered george weasley i been properly dry since august and going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime malfoy buy his way onto their team 
 
 chest heaving with emotion wood turned to harry 
 
 be down to you harry to show them that a seeker has to have something more than a rich father get to that snitch before malfoy or die trying harry because got to win today got to 
 
 so no pressure harry said fred winking at him 
 
 as they walked out onto the pitch a roar of noise greeted them mainly cheers because ravenclaw and hufflepuff were anxious to see slytherin beaten but the slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard too madam hooch the quidditch teacher asked flint and wood to shake hands which they did giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary 
 
 on my whistle said madam hooch three two one 
 
 with a roar from the crowd to speed them upward the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky harry flew higher than any of them squinting around for the snitch 
 
 all right there scarhead yelled malfoy shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom 
 
 harry had no time to reply at that very moment a heavy black bludger came pelting toward him he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed 
 
 close one harry said george streaking past him with his club in his hand ready to knock the bludger back toward a slytherin harry saw george give the bludger a powerful whack in the direction of adrian pucey but the bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for harry again 
 
 harry dropped quickly to avoid it and george managed to hit it hard toward malfoy once again the bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at head 
 
 harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch he could hear the bludger whistling along behind him what was going on bludgers never concentrated on one player like this it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible 
 
 fred weasley was waiting for the bludger at the other end harry ducked as fred swung at the bludger with all his might the bludger was knocked off course 
 
 gotcha fred yelled happily but he was wrong as though it was magnetically attracted to harry the bludger pelted after him once more and harry was forced to fly off at full speed 
 
 it had started to rain harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face splattering onto his glasses he have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard lee jordan who was commentating say slytherin lead sixty points to zero 
 
 
 the brooms were clearly doing their jobs and meanwhile the mad bludger was doing all it could to knock harry out of the air fred and george were now flying so close to him on either side that harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the snitch let alone catch it 
 
 tampered with this bludger fred grunted swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on harry 
 
 we need time out said george trying to signal to wood and stop the bludger breaking nose at the same time 
 
 wood had obviously got the message madam whistle rang out and harry fred and george dived for the ground still trying to avoid the mad bludger 
 
 going on said wood as the gryffindor team huddled together while slytherins in the crowd jeered being flattened fred george where were you when that bludger stopped angelina scoring 
 
 we were twenty feet above her stopping the other bludger from murdering harry oliver said george angrily fixed it it leave harry alone it gone for anyone else all game the slytherins must have done something to it 
 
 but the bludgers have been locked in madam office since our last practice and there was nothing wrong with them then said wood anxiously madam hooch was walking toward them over her shoulder harry could see the slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction 
 
 listen said harry as she came nearer and nearer with you two flying around me all the time the only way going to catch the snitch is if it flies up my sleeve go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one 
 
 be thick said fred take your head off 
 
 wood was looking from harry to the weasleys 
 
 oliver this is insane said alicia spinner angrily you let harry deal with that thing on his own ask for an inquiry 
 
 if we stop now have to forfeit the match said harry and not losing to slytherin just because of a crazy bludger come on oliver tell them to leave me alone 
 
 this is all your fault george said angrily to wood get the snitch or die a stupid thing to tell him 
 
 madam hooch had joined them 
 
 ready to resume play she asked wood 
 
 wood looked at the determined look on face 
 
 all right he said fred george you heard harry leave him alone and let him deal with the bludger on his own 
 
 the rain was falling more heavily now on madam whistle harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the bludger behind him higher and higher harry climbed he looped and swooped spiraled zigzagged and rolled slightly dizzy he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down avoiding another fierce dive from the bludger he could hear laughter from the crowd he knew he must look very stupid but the rogue bludger was heavy and change direction as quickly as harry could he began a kind of ride around the edges of the stadium squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the gryffindor goal posts where adrian pucey was trying to get past wood 
 
 a whistling in ear told him the bludger had just missed him again he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction 
 
 training for the ballet potter yelled malfoy as harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the bludger and he fled the bludger trailing a few feet behind him and then glaring back at malfoy in hatred he saw it the golden snitch it was hovering inches above left ear and malfoy busy laughing at harry seen it 
 
 for an agonizing moment harry hung in midair not daring to speed toward malfoy in case he looked up and saw the snitch 
 
 wham 
 
 he had stayed still a second too long the bludger had hit him at last smashed into his elbow and harry felt his arm break dimly dazed by the searing pain in his arm he slid sideways on his broom one knee still crooked over it his right arm dangling useless at his side the bludger came pelting back for a second attack this time zooming at his face harry swerved out of the way one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain get to malfoy 
 
 through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear malfoy thought harry was attacking him 
 
 what the he gasped careening out of way 
 
 harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch he felt his fingers close on the cold snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground trying hard not to pass out 
 
 with a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom his arm was hanging at a very strange angle riddled with pain he heard as though from a distance a good deal of whistling and shouting he focused on the snitch clutched in his good hand 
 
 aha he said vaguely won 
 
 and he fainted 
 
 he came around rain falling on his face still lying on the field with someone leaning over him he saw a glitter of teeth 
 
 oh no not you he moaned 
 
 know what saying said lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of gryffindors pressing around them not to worry harry about to fix your arm 
 
 no said harry keep it like this thanks 
 
 he tried to sit up but the pain was terrible he heard a familiar clicking noise nearby 
 
 i want a photo of this colin he said loudly 
 
 lie back harry said lockhart soothingly a simple charm used countless times 
 
 why i just go to the hospital wing said harry through clenched teeth 
 
 he should really professor said a muddy wood who help grinning even though his seeker was injured great capture harry really spectacular your best yet say 
 
 through the thicket of legs around him harry spotted fred and george weasley wrestling the rogue bludger into a box it was still putting up a terrific fight 
 
 stand back said lockhart who was rolling up his sleeves 
 
 no said harry weakly but lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at arm 
 
 a strange and unpleasant sensation started at shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips it felt as though his arm was being deflated he dare look at what was happening he had shut his eyes his face turned away from his arm but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and colin creevey began clicking away madly his arm hurt anymore nor did it feel remotely like an arm 
 
 ah said lockhart yes well that can sometimes happen but the point is the bones are no longer broken the thing to bear in mind so harry just toddle up to the hospital wing ah mr weasley miss granger would you escort him and madam pomfrey will be able to er tidy you up a bit 
 
 as harry got to his feet he felt strangely lopsided taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side what he saw nearly made him pass out again 
 
 poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick rubber glove he tried to move his fingers nothing happened 
 
 lockhart mended bones he had removed them 
 
 madam pomfrey at all pleased 
 
 you should have come straight to me she raged holding up the sad limp remainder of what half an hour before had been a working arm i can mend bones in a second but growing them back 
 
 you will be able to you said harry desperately 
 
 be able to certainly but it will be painful said madam pomfrey grimly throwing harry a pair of pajamas have to stay the night 
 
 hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around bed while ron helped him into his pajamas it took a while to stuff the rubbery boneless arm into a sleeve 
 
 how can you stick up for lockhart now hermione eh ron called through the curtain as he pulled limp fingers through the cuff if harry had wanted deboning he would have asked 
 
 anyone can make a mistake said hermione and it hurt anymore does it harry 
 
 no said harry getting into bed but it do anything else either 
 
 as he swung himself onto the bed his arm flapped pointlessly 
 
 hermione and madam pomfrey came around the curtain madam pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled 
 
 in for a rough night she said pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him regrowing bones is a nasty business 
 
 so was taking the it burned mouth and throat as it went down making him cough and splutter still about dangerous sports and inept teachers madam pomfrey retreated leaving ron and hermione to help harry gulp down some water we won though said ron a grin breaking across his face that was some catch you made face he looked ready to kill 
 
 i want to know how he fixed that bludger said hermione darkly we can add that to the list of questions ask him when taken the polyjuice potion said harry sinking back onto his pillows i hope it tastes better than this stuff 
 
 if got bits of slytherins in it got to be joking said ron 
 
 the door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment filthy and soaking wet the rest of the gryffindor team had arrived to see harry unbelievable flying harry said george just seen marcus flint yelling at malfoy something about having the snitch on top of his head and not noticing malfoy seem too happy they had brought cakes sweets and bottles of pumpkin juice they gathered around bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when madam pomfrey came storming over shouting this boy needs rest got bones to regrow out out and harry was left alone with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm 
 
 hours and hours later harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain his arm now felt full of large splinters for a second he thought that was what had woken him then with a thrill of horror he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark 
 
 get off he said loudly and then dobby 
 
 the goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at harry through the darkness a single tear was running down his long pointed nose 
 
 harry potter came back to school he whispered miserably dobby warned and warned harry potter ah sir why you heed dobby why harry potter go back home when he missed the train 
 
 harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed sponge away 
 
 you doing here he said and how did you know i missed the train 
 
 lip trembled and harry was seized by a sudden suspicion 
 
 it was you he said slowly you stopped the barrier from letting us through 
 
 indeed yes sir said dobby nodding his head vigorously ears flapping dobby hid and watched for harry potter and sealed the gateway and dobby had to iron his hands afterward he showed harry ten long bandaged fingers but dobby care sir for he thought harry potter was safe and never did dobby dream that harry potter would get to school another way 
 
 he was rocking backward and forward shaking his ugly head 
 
 dobby was so shocked when he heard harry potter was back at hogwarts he let his dinner burn such a flogging dobby never had sir 
 
 harry slumped back onto his pillows 
 
 you nearly got ron and me expelled he said fiercely better get lost before my bones come back dobby or i might strangle you 
 
 dobby smiled weakly 
 
 dobby is used to death threats sir dobby gets them five times a day at home 
 
 he blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore looking so pathetic that harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself 
 
 why wear that thing dobby he asked curiously 
 
 this sir said dobby plucking at the pillowcase tis a mark of the enslavement sir dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes sir the family is careful not to pass dobby even a sock sir for then he would be free to leave their house forever 
 
 dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly harry potter must go home dobby thought his bludger would be enough to make 
 
 your bludger said harry anger rising once more what mean your bludger you made that bludger try and kill me 
 
 not kill you sir never kill you said dobby shocked dobby wants to save harry life better sent home grievously injured than remain here sir dobby only wanted harry potter hurt enough to be sent home 
 
 oh is that all said harry angrily i suppose going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces 
 
 ah if harry potter only knew dobby groaned more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase if he knew what he means to us to the lowly the enslaved we dregs of the magical world dobby remembers how it was when was at the height of his powers sir we were treated like vermin sir of course dobby is still treated like that sir he admitted drying his face on the pillowcase but mostly sir life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over harry potter survived and the dark power was broken and it was a new dawn sir and harry potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the dark days would never end sit and now at hogwarts terrible things are to happen are perhaps happening already and dobby cannot let harry potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself now that the chamber of secrets is open once more 
 
 dobby froze horrorstruck then grabbed water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head toppling out of sight a second later he crawled back onto the bed muttering bad dobby very bad dobby 
 
 so there is a chamber of secrets harry whispered and did you say been opened before tell me dobby 
 
 he seized the bony wrist as hand inched toward the water jug but not how can i be in danger from the chamber 
 
 ah sir ask no more ask no more of poor dobby stammered the elf his eyes huge in the dark dark deeds are planned in this place but harry potter must not be here when they happen go home harry potter go home harry potter must not meddle in this sir tis too dangerous 
 
 who is it dobby harry said keeping a firm hold on wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again opened it who opened it last time 
 
 dobby sir dobby dobby tell squealed the elf go home harry potter go home 
 
 not going anywhere said harry fiercely one of my best friends is be first in line if the chamber really has been opened 
 
 harry potter risks his own life for his friends moaned dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy so noble so valiant but he must save himself he must harry potter must not 
 
 dobby suddenly froze his bat ears quivering harry heard it too there were footsteps coming down the passageway outside 
 
 dobby must go breathed the elf terrified there was a loud crack and fist was suddenly clenched on thin air he slumped back into bed his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer 
 
 next moment dumbledore was backing into the dormitory wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap he was carrying one end of what looked like a statue professor mcgonagall appeared a second later carrying its feet together they heaved it onto a bed 
 
 get madam pomfrey whispered dumbledore and professor mcgonagall hurried past the end of bed out of sight harry lay quite still pretending to be asleep he heard urgent voices and then professor mcgonagall swept back into view closely followed by madam pomfrey who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress he heard a sharp intake of breath 
 
 what happened madam pomfrey whispered to dumbledore bending over the statue on the bed 
 
 another attack said dumbledore minerva found him on the stairs 
 
 there was a bunch of grapes next to him said professor mcgonagall we think he was trying to sneak up here to visit potter 
 
 stomach gave a horrible lurch slowly and carefully he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed a ray of moonlight lay across its staring face 
 
 it was colin creevey his eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him holding his camera 
 
 petrified whispered madam pomfrey 
 
 yes said professor mcgonagall but i shudder to think if albus been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate who knows what might have 
 
 the three of them stared down at colin then dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of rigid grip 
 
 you think he managed to get a picture of his attacker said professor mcgonagall eagerly 
 
 dumbledore answer he opened the back of the camera 
 
 good gracious said madam pomfrey 
 
 a jet of steam had hissed out of the camera harry three beds away caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic 
 
 melted said madam pomfrey wonderingly all melted 
 
 what does this mean albus professor mcgonagall asked urgently 
 
 it means said dumbledore that the chamber of secrets is indeed open again 
 
 madam pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth professor mcgonagall stared at dumbledore 
 
 but albus surely who 
 
 the question is not who said dumbledore his eyes on colin the question is how and from what harry could see of professor shadowy face she understand this any better than he did 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten the mapcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 madam pomfrey insisted on keeping harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend he argue or complain but he let her throw away the shattered remnants of his nimbus two thousand he knew he was being stupid knew that the nimbus was beyond repair but harry help it he felt as though lost one of his best friends 
 
 he had a stream of visitors all intent on cheering him up hagrid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow cabbages and ginny weasley blushing furiously turned up with a card she had made herself which sang shrilly unless harry kept it shut under his bowl of fruit the gryffindor team visited again on sunday morning this time accompanied by wood who told harry in a hollow dead sort of voice that he blame him in the slightest ron and hermione left bedside only at night but nothing anyone said or did could make harry feel any better because they knew only half of what was troubling him 
 
 he told anyone about the grim not even ron and hermione because he knew ron would panic and hermione would scoff the fact remained however that it had now appeared twice and both appearances had been followed by accidents the first time he had nearly been run over by the knight bus the second fallen fifty feet from his broomstick was the grim going to haunt him until he actually died was he going to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast 
 
 and then there were the dementors harry felt sick and humiliated every time he thought of them everyone said the dementors were horrible but no one else collapsed every time they went near one no one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents 
 
 because harry knew who that screaming voice belonged to now he had heard her words heard them over and over again during the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake staring at the strips of moonlight on the ceiling when the dementors approached him he heard the last moments of his life her attempts to protect him harry from lord voldemort and laughter before he murdered herharry dozed fitfully sinking into dreams full of clammy rotted hands and petrified pleading jerking awake to dwell again on his voice 
 
 
 
 it was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school on monday where he was forced to think about other things even if he had to endure draco taunting malfoy was almost beside himself with glee at defeat he had finally taken off his bandages and celebrated having the full use of both arms again by doing spirited imitations of harry falling off his broom malfoy spent much of their next potions class doing dementor imitations across the dungeon ron finally cracked and flung a large slippery crocodile heart at malfoy which hit him in the face and caused snape to take fifty points from gryffindor 
 
 if teaching defense against the dark arts again skiving off said ron as they headed toward classroom after lunch check in there hermione 
 
 hermione peered around the classroom door 
 
 okay 
 
 professor lupin was back at work it certainly looked as though he had been ill his old robes were hanging more loosely on him and there were dark shadows beneath his eyes nevertheless he smiled at the class as they took their seats and they burst at once into an explosion of complaints about behavior while lupin had been ill 
 
 not fair he was only filling in why should he give us homework 
 
 we know anything about werewolves 
 
 two rolls of parchment 
 
 did you tell professor snape we covered them yet lupin asked frowning slightly 
 
 the babble broke out again 
 
 yes but he said we were really behind 
 
 he listen 
 
 two rolls of parchment 
 
 professor lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face 
 
 worry speak to professor snape you have to do the essay 
 
 oh no said hermione looking very disappointed already finished it 
 
 they had a very enjoyable lesson professor lupin had brought along a glass box containing a hinkypunk a little creature who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke rather frail and harmless looking 
 
 lures travelers into bogs said professor lupin as they took notes you notice the lantern dangling from his hand hops ahead people follow the light then 
 
 the hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the glass 
 
 when the bell rang everyone gathered up their things and headed for the door harry among them but 
 
 wait a moment harry lupin called like a word 
 
 harry doubled back and watched professor lupin covering the box with a cloth 
 
 i heard about the match said lupin turning back to his desk and starting to pile books into his briefcase and sorry about your broomstick is there any chance of fixing it 
 
 no said harry the tree smashed it to bits 
 
 lupin sighed 
 
 they planted the whomping willow the same year that i arrived at hogwarts people used to play a game trying to get near enough to touch the trunk in the end a boy called davey gudgeon nearly lost an eye and we were forbidden to go near it no broomstick would have a chance 
 
 did you hear about the dementors too said harry with difficulty 
 
 lupin looked at him quickly 
 
 yes i did i think any of us have seen professor dumbledore that angry they have been growing restless for some timefurious at his refusal to let them inside the groundsi suppose they were the reason you fell 
 
 yes said harry he hesitated and then the question he had to ask burst from him before he could stop himself why why do they affect me like that am i just 
 
 it has nothing to do with weakness said professor lupin sharply as though he had read mind the dementors affect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the others have 
 
 a ray of wintry sunlight fell across the classroom illuminating gray hairs and the lines on his young face 
 
 dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth they infest the darkest filthiest places they glory in decay and despair they drain peace hope and happiness out of the air around them even muggles feel their presence though they see them get too near a dementor and every good feeling every happy memory will be sucked out of you if it can the dementor will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself and evil be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life and the worst that happened to you harry is enough to make anyone fall off their broom you have nothing to feel ashamed of 
 
 when they get near me harry stared at desk his throat tight i can hear voldemort murdering my mum 
 
 lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip shoulder but thought better of it there was a silence then 
 
 why did they have to come to the match said harry bitterly 
 
 getting hungry said lupin coolly shutting his briefcase with a snap dumbledore let them into the school so their supply of human prey has dried upi think they could resist the large crowd around the quidditch field all that excitementemotions running highit was their idea of a feast 
 
 azkaban must be terrible harry muttered lupin nodded grimly 
 
 the fortress is set on a tiny island way out to sea but they need walls and water to keep the prisoners in not when all trapped inside their own heads incapable of a single cheery thought most of them go mad within weeks 
 
 but sirius black escaped from them harry said slowly he got away 
 
 briefcase slipped from the desk he had to stoop quickly to catch it 
 
 yes he said straightening up black must have found a way to fight them i have believed it possibledementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long 
 
 you made that dementor on the train back off said harry suddenly 
 
 there are certain defenses one can use said lupin but there was only one dementor on the train the more there are the more difficult it becomes to resist 
 
 what defenses said harry at once can you teach me 
 
 i pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors harry quite the contrary 
 
 but if the dementors come to another quidditch match i need to be able to fight them 
 
 lupin looked into determined face hesitated then said wellall right try and help but have to wait until next term afraid i have a lot to do before the holidays i chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill 
 
 
 
 what with the promise of lessons from lupin the thought that he might never have to hear his death again and the fact that ravenclaw flattened hufflepuff in their quidditch match at the end of november mood took a definite upturn gryffindor were not out of the running after all although they could not afford to lose another match wood became repossessed of his manic energy and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into december harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances 
 
 two weeks before the end of the term the sky lightened suddenly to a dazzling opaline white and the muddy grounds were revealed one morning covered in glittering frost inside the castle there was a buzz of christmas in the air professor flitwick the charms teacher had already decorated his classroom with shimmering lights that turned out to be real fluttering fairies the students were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays both ron and hermione had decided to remain at hogwarts and though ron said it was because he stand two weeks with percy and hermione insisted she needed to use the library harry fooled they were doing it to keep him company and he was very grateful 
 
 to delight except there was to be another hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term 
 
 we can do all our christmas shopping there said hermione mum and dad would really love those toothflossing stringmints from honeydukes 
 
 resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying behind again harry borrowed a copy of which broomstick from wood and decided to spend the day reading up on the different makes he had been riding one of the school brooms at team practice an ancient shooting star which was very slow and jerky he definitely needed a new broom of his own 
 
 on the saturday morning of the hogsmeade trip harry bid to ron and hermione who were wrapped in cloaks and scarves then turned up the marble staircase alone and headed back toward gryffindor tower snow had started to fall outside the windows and the castle was very still and quiet 
 
 psst harry 
 
 he turned halfway along the corridor to see fred and george peering out at him from behind a statue of a humpbacked witch 
 
 what are you doing said harry curiously how come not going to hogsmeade 
 
 come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go said fred with a mysterious wink come in here 
 
 he nodded toward an empty classroom to the left of the statue harry followed fred and george inside george closed the door quietly and then turned beaming to look at harry 
 
 early christmas present for you harry he said 
 
 fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and laid it on one of the desks it was a large square very worn piece of parchment with nothing written on it harry suspecting one of fred and jokes stared at it 
 
 that supposed to be 
 
 this harry is the secret of our success said george patting the parchment fondly 
 
 a wrench giving it to you said fred but we decided last night your greater than ours 
 
 anyway we know it by heart said george we bequeath it to you we really need it anymore 
 
 and what do i need with a bit of old parchment said harry 
 
 a bit of old parchment said fred closing his eyes with a grimace as though harry had mortally offended him explain george 
 
 wellwhen we were in our first year harry young carefree and innocent 
 
 harry snorted he doubted whether fred and george had ever been innocent 
 
 c well more innocent than we are now we got into a spot of bother with filch 
 
 we let off a dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason 
 
 so he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual 
 
 detention 
 
 disembowelment 
 
 and we help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked confiscated and highly dangerous 
 
 tell me said harry starting to grin 
 
 well what would done said fred george caused a diversion by dropping another dungbomb i whipped the drawer open and grabbed this 
 
 not as bad as it sounds you know said george we reckon filch ever found out how to work it he probably suspected what it was though or he have confiscated it 
 
 and you know how to work it 
 
 oh yes said fred smirking this little taught us more than all the teachers in this school 
 
 winding me up said harry looking at the ragged old bit of parchment 
 
 oh are we said george 
 
 he took out his wand touched the parchment lightly and said i solemnly swear that i am up to no good 
 
 and at once thin ink lines began to spread like a web from the point that wand had touched they joined each other they crisscrossed they fanned into every corner of the parchment then words began to blossom across the top great curly green words that proclaimed 
 
 messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs 
 purveyors of aids to magical 
 are proud to present 
 the map 
 it was a map showing every detail of the hogwarts castle and grounds but the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots moving around it each labeled with a name in minuscule writing astounded harry bent over it a labeled dot in the top left corner showed that professor dumbledore was pacing his study the cat mrs norris was prowling the second floor and peeves the poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room and as eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors he noticed something else 
 
 this map showed a set of passages he had never entered and many of them seemed to lead 
 
 right into hogsmeade said fred tracing one of them with his finger there are seven in all now filch knows about these four he pointed them out but sure the only ones who know about these bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor we used it until last winter but caved in completely blocked and we reckon ever used this one because the whomping planted right over the entrance but this one here this one leads right into the cellar of honeydukes used it loads of times and as you noticed the entrance is right outside this room through that old hump 
 
 moony wormtail padfoot and prongs sighed george patting the heading of the map we owe them so much 
 
 noble men working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers said fred solemnly 
 
 right said george briskly forget to wipe it after used it 
 
 or anyone can read it fred said warningly 
 
 just tap it again and say mischief managed and go blank 
 
 so young harry said fred in an uncanny impersonation of percy mind you behave yourself 
 
 see you in honeydukes said george winking 
 
 they left the room both smirking in a satisfied sort of way 
 
 harry stood there gazing at the miraculous map he watched the tiny ink mrs norris turn left and pause to sniff at something on the floor if filch really knowhe have to pass the dementors at all 
 
 but even as he stood there flooded with excitement something harry had once heard mr weasley say came floating out of his memory 
 
 never trust anything that can think for itself if you see where it keeps its brain 
 
 this map was one of those dangerous magical objects mr weasley had been warning againstaids for magical mischief makersbut then harry reasoned he only wanted to use it to get into hogsmeade it as though he wanted to steal anything or attack anyoneand fred and george had been using it for years without anything horrible happening 
 
 harry traced the secret passage to honeydukes with his finger 
 
 then quite suddenly as though following orders he rolled up the map stuffed it inside his robes and hurried to the door of the classroom he opened it a couple of inches there was no one outside very carefully he edged out of the room and behind the statue of the witch 
 
 what did he have to do he pulled out the map again and saw to his astonishment that a new ink figure had appeared upon it labeled harry potter this figure was standing exactly where the real harry was standing about halfway down the corridor harry watched carefully his little ink self appeared to be tapping the witch with his minute wand harry quickly took out his real wand and tapped the statue nothing happened he looked back at the map the tiniest speech bubble had appeared next to his figure the word inside said dissendium 
 
 dissendium harry whispered tapping the stone witch again 
 
 at once the hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly thin person harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor then tucked the map away again hoisted himself into the hole headfirst and pushed himself forward 
 
 he slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone slide then landed on cold damp earth he stood up looking around it was pitch dark he held up his wand muttered lumos and saw that he was in a very narrow low earthy passageway he raised the map tapped it with the tip of his wand and muttered mischief managed the map went blank at once he folded it carefully tucked it inside his robes then heart beating fast both excited and apprehensive he set off 
 
 the passage twisted and turned more like the burrow of a giant rabbit than anything else harry hurried along it stumbling now and then on the uneven floor holding his wand out in front of him 
 
 it took ages but harry had the thought of honeydukes to sustain him after what felt like an hour the passage began to rise panting harry sped up his face hot his feet very cold 
 
 ten minutes later he came to the foot of some worn stone steps which rose out of sight above him careful not to make any noise harry began to climb a hundred steps two hundred steps he lost count as he climbed watching his feetthen without warning his head hit something hard 
 
 it seemed to be a trapdoor harry stood there massaging the top of his head listening he hear any sounds above him very slowly he pushed the trapdoor open and peered over the edge 
 
 he was in a cellar which was full of wooden crates and boxes harry climbed out of the trapdoor and replaced it it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was there harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led upstairs now he could definitely hear voices not to mention the tinkle of a bell and the opening and shutting of a door 
 
 wondering what he ought to do he suddenly heard a door open much closer at hand somebody was about to come downstairs 
 
 and get another box of jelly slugs dear nearly cleaned us out said a voice 
 
 a pair of feet was coming down the staircase harry leapt behind an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass he heard the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall he might not get another chance 
 
 quickly and silently harry dodged out from his hiding place and climbed the stairs looking back he saw an enormous backside and shiny bald head buried in a box harry reached the door at the top of the stairs slipped through it and found himself behind the counter of honeydukes he ducked crept sideways and then straightened up 
 
 honeydukes was so crowded with hogwarts students that no one looked twice at harry he edged among them looking around and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over piggy face if he could see where harry was now 
 
 there were shelves upon shelves of the most sweets imaginable creamy chunks of nougat shimmering pink squares of coconut ice fat toffees hundreds of different kinds of chocolate in neat rows there was a large barrel of every flavor beans and another of fizzing whizbees the levitating sherbet balls that ron had mentioned along yet another wall were special effects sweets droobles best blowing gum which filled a room with bubbles that refused to pop for days the strange splintery toothflossing stringmints tiny black pepper imps breathe fire for your friends ice mice hear your teeth chatter and squeak peppermint creams shaped like toads hop realistically in the stomach fragile quills and exploding bonbons 
 
 harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop unusual tastes ron and hermione were standing underneath it examining a tray of lollipops harry sneaked up behind them 
 
 ugh no harry want one of those for vampires i expect hermione was saying 
 
 how about these said ron shoving a jar of cockroach clusters under nose 
 
 definitely not said harry 
 
 ron nearly dropped the jar 
 
 harry squealed hermione what are you doing here how how did you 
 
 wow said ron looking very impressed learned to apparate 
 
 course i said harry he dropped his voice so that none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the map 
 
 how come fred and george never gave it to me said ron outraged their brother 
 
 but harry going to keep it said hermione as though the idea were ludicrous going to hand it in to professor mcgonagall you harry 
 
 no not said harry 
 
 are you mad said ron goggling at hermione hand in something that good 
 
 if i hand it in have to say where i got it filch would know fred and george had nicked it 
 
 but what about sirius black hermione hissed he could be using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle the teachers have got to know 
 
 he be getting in through a passage said harry quickly there are seven secret tunnels on the map right fred and george reckon filch already knows about four of them and of the other three one of caved in so no one can get through it one of got the whomping willow planted over the entrance so you get out of it and the one i just came through well really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar so unless he knew it was there 
 
 harry hesitated what if black did know the passage was there ron however cleared his throat significantly and pointed to a notice pasted on the inside of the sweetshop door 
 
 by order of the ministry of magic 
 customers are reminded that until further notice dementors will be patrolling the streets of hogsmeade every night after sundown this measure has been put in place for the safety of hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of sirius black it is therefore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall 
 merry christmas 
 see said ron quietly like to see black try and break into honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village anyway hermione the honeydukes owners would hear a they they live over the shop 
 
 yes but but heroine seemed to be struggling to find another problem look harry still be coming into hogsmeade he got a signed form if anyone finds out be in so much trouble and not nightfall yet what if sirius black turns up today now 
 
 have a job spotting harry in this said ron nodding through the mullioned windows at the thick swirling snow come on hermione christmas harry deserves a break 
 
 hermione bit her lip looking extremely worried 
 
 are you going to report me harry asked her grinning 
 
 oh of course not but honestly harry 
 
 seen the fizzing whizbees harry said ron grabbing him and leading him over to their barrel and the jelly slugs and the acid pops fred gave me one of those when i was seven it burnt a hole right through my tongue i remember mum walloping him with her broomstick ron stared broodingly into the acid pop box reckon take a bite of cockroach cluster if i told him they were peanuts 
 
 when ron and hermione had paid for all their sweets the three of them left honeydukes for the blizzard outside 
 
 hogsmeade looked like a christmas card the little thatched cottages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow there were holly wreaths on the doors and strings of enchanted candles hanging in the trees 
 
 harry shivered unlike the other two he have his cloak they headed up the street heads bowed against the wind ron and hermione shouting through their scarves 
 
 the post office 
 
 is up there 
 
 we could go up to the shrieking shack 
 
 tell you what said ron his teeth chattering shall we go for a butterbeer in the three broomsticks 
 
 harry was more than willing the wind was fierce and his hands were freezing so they crossed the road and in a few minutes were entering the tiny inn 
 
 it was extremely crowded noisy warm and smoky a curvy sort of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlocks up at the bar 
 
 madam rosmerta said ron get the drinks shall i he added going slightly red 
 
 harry and hermione made their way to the back of the room where there was a small vacant table between the window and a handsome christmas tree which stood next to the fireplace ron came back five minutes later carrying three foaming tankards of hot butterbeer 
 
 merry christmas he said happily raising his tankard 
 
 harry drank deeply it was the most delicious thing ever tasted and seemed to heat every bit of him from the inside 
 
 a sudden breeze ruffled his hair the door of the three broomsticks had opened again harry looked over the rim of his tankard and choked 
 
 professors mcgonagall and flitwick had just entered the pub with a flurry of snowflakes shortly followed by hagrid who was deep in conversation with a portly man in a bowler hat and a pinstriped cloak cornelius fudge minister of magic 
 
 in an instant ron and hermione had both placed hands on the top of head and forced him off his stool and under the table dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight harry clutched his empty tankard and watched the teachers and feet move toward the bar pause then turn and walk right toward him 
 
 somewhere above him hermione whispered mobiliarbus 
 
 the christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the ground drifted sideways and landed with a soft thump right in front of their table hiding them from view staring through the dense lower branches harry saw four sets of chair legs move back from the table right beside theirs then heard the grunts and sighs of the teachers and minister as they sat down 
 
 next he saw another pair of feet wearing sparkly turquoise high heels and heard a voice 
 
 a small gillywater 
 
 mine said professor voice 
 
 four pints of mulled mead 
 
 ta rosmerta said hagrid 
 
 a cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella 
 
 mmm said professor flitwick smacking his lips 
 
 so be the red currant rum minister 
 
 thank you rosmerta said voice lovely to see you again i must say have one yourself you come and join us 
 
 well thank you very much minister 
 
 harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again his heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat why it occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teachers too and how long were they going to sit there he needed time to sneak back into honeydukes if he wanted to return to school tonight leg gave a nervous twitch next to him 
 
 so what brings you to this neck of the woods minister came madam voice 
 
 harry saw the lower part of thick body twist in his chair as though he were checking for eavesdroppers then he said in a quiet voice what else but sirius black i daresay you heard what happened up at the school at halloween 
 
 i did hear a rumor admitted madam rosmerta 
 
 did you tell the whole pub hagrid said professor mcgonagall exasperatedly 
 
 do you think still in the area minister whispered madam rosmerta 
 
 sure of it said fudge shortly 
 
 you know that the dementors have searched the whole village twice said madam rosmerta a slight edge to her voice scared all my customers very bad for business minister 
 
 rosmerta dear i like them any more than you do said fudge uncomfortably necessary precaution unfortunate but there you just met some of them in a fury against dumbledore he let them inside the castle grounds 
 
 i should think not said professor mcgonagall sharply how are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around 
 
 hear hear squeaked tiny professor flitwick whose feet were dangling a foot from the ground 
 
 all the same demurred fudge they are here to protect you all from something much worsewe all know what capable of 
 
 do you know i still have trouble believing it said madam rosmerta thoughtfully of all the people to go over to the dark side sirius black was the last have thoughti mean i remember him when he was a boy at hogwarts if told me then what he was going to become have said had too much mead 
 
 you know the half of it rosmerta said fudge gruffly the worst he did widely known 
 
 the worst said madam rosmerta her voice alive with curiosity worse than murdering all those poor people you mean 
 
 i certainly do said fudge 
 
 i believe that what could possibly be worse 
 
 you say you remember him at hogwarts rosmerta murmured professor mcgonagall do you remember who his best friend was 
 
 naturally said madam rosmerta with a small laugh never saw one without the other did you the number of times i had them in here ooh they used to make me laugh quite the double act sirius black and james potter 
 
 harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk ron kicked him 
 
 precisely said professor mcgonagall black and potter ringleaders of their little gang both very bright of course exceptionally bright in fact but i think ever had such a pair of troublemakers 
 
 i dunno chuckled hagrid fred and george weasley could give em a run fer their money 
 
 have thought black and potter were brothers chimed in professor flitwick inseparable 
 
 of course they were said fudge potter trusted black beyond all his other friends nothing changed when they left school black was best man when james married lily then they named him godfather to harry harry has no idea of course you can imagine how the idea would torment him 
 
 because black turned out to be in league with whispered madam rosmerta 
 
 worse even than that fudge dropped his voice and proceeded in a sort of low rumble not many people are aware that the potters knew was after them dumbledore who was of course working tirelessly against had a number of useful spies one of them tipped him off and he alerted james and lily at once he advised them to go into hiding well of course an easy person to hide from dumbledore told them that their best chance was the fidelius charm 
 
 how does that work said madam rosmerta breathless with interest professor flitwick cleared his throat 
 
 an immensely complex spell he said squeakily involving the magical concealment of a secret inside a single living soul the information is hidden inside the chosen person or and is henceforth impossible to find unless of course the chooses to divulge it as long as the refused to speak could search the village where lily and james were staying for years and never find them not even if he had his nose pressed against their sitting room window 
 
 so black was the potters whispered madam rosmerta 
 
 naturally said professor mcgonagall james potter told dumbledore that black would die rather than tell where they were that black was planning to go into hiding himselfand yet dumbledore remained worried i remember him offering to be the potters himself 
 
 he suspected black gasped madam rosmerta 
 
 he was sure that somebody close to the potters had been keeping informed of their movements said professor mcgonagall darkly indeed he had suspected for some time that someone on our side had turned traitor and was passing a lot of information to 
 
 but james potter insisted on using black 
 
 he did said fudge heavily and then barely a week after the fidelius charm had been performed 
 
 black betrayed them breathed madam rosmerta 
 
 he did indeed black was tired of his role he was ready to declare his support openly for and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the potters death but as we all know met his downfall in little harry potter powers gone horribly weakened he fled and this left black in a very nasty position indeed his master had fallen at the very moment when he black had shown his true colors as a traitor he had no choice but to run for it 
 
 filthy stinkin turncoat hagrid said so loudly that half the bar went quiet 
 
 shh said professor mcgonagall 
 
 i met him growled hagrid i musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people it was me what rescued harry from lily an house after they was killed jus got him outta the ruins poor little thing with a great slash across his forehead an his parents deadan sirius black turns up on that flyin motorbike he used ter ride never occurred ter me what he was doin there i didn know bin lily an thought jus heard the news o attack an come ter see what he could do white an shakin he was an yeh know what i did i comforted the murderin traitor hagrid roared 
 
 hagrid please said professor mcgonagall keep your voice down 
 
 how was i ter know he wasn upset abou lily an james it was he cared abou an then he says give harry ter me hagrid his godfather look after him ha but had me orders from dumbledore an i told black no dumbledore said harry was ter go ter his aunt an black argued but in the end he gave in told me ter take his motorbike ter get harry there i need it anymore he says 
 
 i shoulda known there was somethin fishy goin on then he loved that motorbike what was he givin it ter me for why wouldn he need it anymore fact was it was too easy ter trace dumbledore knew bin the potters black knew he was goin ter have ter run fer it that night knew it was a matter o hours before the ministry was after him 
 
 but what if given harry to him eh i bet pitched him off the bike halfway out ter sea his bes friends son but when a wizard goes over ter the dark side nothin and no one that matters to em anymore 
 
 a long silence followed story then madam rosmerta said with some satisfaction but he manage to disappear did he the ministry of magic caught up with him next day 
 
 alas if only we had said fudge bitterly it was not we who found him it was little peter pettigrew another of the potters friends maddened by grief no doubt and knowing that black had been the potters he went after black himself 
 
 pettigrewthat fat little boy who was always tagging around after them at hogwarts said madam rosmerta 
 
 black and potter said professor mcgonagall never quite in their league i was often rather sharp with him you can imagine how i how i regret that now she sounded as though she had a sudden head cold 
 
 there now minerva said fudge kindly pettigrew died a death eyewitnesses muggles of course we wiped their memories later told us how pettigrew cornered black they say he was sobbing lily and james sirius how could you and then he went for his wand well of course black was quicker blew pettigrew to smithereens 
 
 professor mcgonagall blew her nose and said thickly stupid boyfoolish boyhe was always hopeless at duelingshould have left it to the ministry 
 
 i tell yeh if got ter black before little pettigrew did i messed around with wands ve ripped him limb from limb hagrid growled 
 
 you know what talking about hagrid said fudge sharply nobody but trained hit wizards from the magical law enforcement squad would have stood a chance against black once he was cornered i was junior minister in the department of magical catastrophes at the time and i was one of the first on the scene after black murdered all those people i i will never forget it i still dream about it sometimes a crater in the middle of the street so deep it had cracked the sewer below bodies everywhere muggles screaming and black standing there laughing with what was left of pettigrew in front of hima heap of bloodstained robes and a few a few fragments 
 
 voice stopped abruptly there was the sound of five noses being blown 
 
 well there you have it rosmerta said fudge thickly black was taken away by twenty members of the magical law enforcement squad and pettigrew received the order of merlin first class which i think was some comfort to his poor mother been in azkaban ever since 
 
 madam rosmerta let out a long sigh 
 
 is it true mad minister 
 
 i wish i could say that he was said fudge slowly i certainly believe his defeat unhinged him for a while the murder of pettigrew and all those muggles was the action of a cornered and desperate man cruel pointless yet i met black on my last inspection of azkaban you know most of the prisoners in there sit muttering to themselves in the dark no sense in thembut i was shocked at how normal black seemed he spoke quite rationally to me it was unnerving have thought he was merely bored asked if finished with my newspaper cool as you please said he missed doing the crossword yes i was astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having on him and he was one of the most heavily guarded in the place you know dementors outside his door day and night 
 
 but what do you think broken out to do said madam rosmerta good gracious minister he trying to rejoin is he 
 
 i daresay that is his er eventual plan said fudge evasively but we hope to catch black long before that i must say alone and friendless is one thingbut give him back his most devoted servant and i shudder to think how quickly rise again 
 
 there was a small chink of glass on wood someone had set down their glass 
 
 you know cornelius if dining with the headmaster better head back up to the castle said professor mcgonagall 
 
 one by one the pairs of feet in front of harry took the weight of their owners once more hems of cloaks swung into sight and madam glittering heels disappeared behind the bar the door of the three broomsticks opened again there was another flurry of snow and the teachers had disappeared 
 
 harry 
 
 and faces appeared under the table they were both staring at him lost for words 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten mayhem at the ministrycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 mr weasley woke them after only a few hours sleep he used magic to pack up the tents and they left the campsite as quickly as possible passing mr roberts at the door of his cottage mr roberts had a strange dazed look about him and he waved them off with a vague merry christmas 
 
 be all right said mr weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor sometimes when a modified it makes him a bit disorientated for a whileand that was a big thing they had to make him forget 
 
 they heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the portkeys lay and when they reached it they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around basil the keeper of the portkeys all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible mr weasley had a hurried discussion with basil they joined the queue and were able to take an old rubber tire back to stoatshead hill before the sun had really risen they walked back through ottery st catchpole and up the damp lane toward the burrow in the dawn light talking very little because they were so exhausted and thinking longingly of their breakfast as they rounded the corner and the burrow came into view a cry echoed along the lane 
 
 oh thank goodness thank goodness 
 
 mrs weasley who had evidently been waiting for them in the front yard came running toward them still wearing her bedroom slippers her face pale and strained a copy of the daily prophet clutched in her hand 
 
 arthur been so worried so worried 
 
 she flung her arms around mr neck and the daily prophet fell out of her limp hand onto the ground looking down harry saw the headline scenes of terror at the quidditch world cup complete with a twinkling photograph of the dark mark over the treetops 
 
 all right mrs weasley muttered distractedly releasing mr weasley and staring around at them all with red eyes boys 
 
 and to surprise she seized fred and george and pulled them both into such a tight hug that their heads banged together 
 
 ouch mum strangling us 
 
 i shouted at you before you left mrs weasley said starting to sob all been thinking about what if had got you and the last thing i ever said to you was that you get enough oh fredgeorge 
 
 come on now molly all perfectly okay said mr weasley soothingly prising her off the twins and leading her back toward the house bill he added in an undertone pick up that paper i want to see what it says 
 
 when they were all crammed into the tiny kitchen and hermione had made mrs weasley a cup of very strong tea into which mr weasley insisted on pouring a shot of ogdens old firewhiskey bill handed his father the newspaper mr weasley scanned the front page while percy looked over his shoulder 
 
 i knew it said mr weasley heavily ministry blundersculprits not apprehendedlax securitydark wizards running uncheckednational wrote this ahof courserita skeeter 
 
 that got it in for the ministry of magic said percy furiously last week she was saying wasting our time quibbling about cauldron thickness when we should be stamping out vampires as if it specifically stated in paragraph twelve of the guidelines for the treatment of 
 
 do us a favor perce said bill yawning and shut up 
 
 mentioned said mr weasley his eyes widening behind his glasses as he reached the bottom of the daily prophet article 
 
 where spluttered mrs weasley choking on her tea and whiskey if seen that have known you were alive 
 
 not by name said mr weasley listen to this if the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the ministry of magic they were sadly disappointed a ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the dark mark alleging that nobody had been hurt but refusing to give any more information whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later remains to be really said mr weasley in exasperation handing the paper to percy nobody was hurt what was i supposed to say rumors that several bodies were removed from the woodswell there certainly will be rumors now printed that 
 
 he heaved a deep sigh molly going to have to go into the office this is going to take some smoothing over 
 
 come with you father said percy importantly mr crouch will need all hands on deck and i can give him my cauldron report in person 
 
 he bustled out of the kitchen mrs weasley looked most upset 
 
 arthur supposed to be on holiday this got anything to do with your office surely they can handle this without you 
 
 got to go molly said mr weasley made things worse just change into my robes and be off 
 
 mrs weasley said harry suddenly unable to contain himself hedwig arrived with a letter for me has she 
 
 hedwig dear said mrs weasley distractedly nono there been any post at all 
 
 ron and hermione looked curiously at harry with a meaningful look at both of them he said all right if i go and dump my stuff in your room ron 
 
 yeahthink i will too said ron at once hermione 
 
 yes she said quickly and the three of them marched out of the kitchen and up the stairs 
 
 up harry said ron the moment they had closed the door of the attic room behind them 
 
 something i told you harry said on saturday morning i woke up with my scar hurting again 
 
 and reactions were almost exactly as harry had imagined them back in his bedroom on privet drive hermione gasped and started making suggestions at once mentioning a number of reference books and everybody from albus dumbledore to madam pomfrey the hogwarts nurse ron simply looked dumbstruck 
 
 but he there was he i mean last time your scar kept hurting he was at hogwarts he 
 
 sure he on privet drive said harry but i was dreaming about himhim and peter you know wormtail i remember all of it now but they were plotting to killsomeone 
 
 he had teetered for a moment on the verge of saying me but bring himself to make hermione look any more horrified than she already did 
 
 it was only a dream said ron bracingly just a nightmare 
 
 yeah but was it though said harry turning to look out of the window at the brightening sky weird scar hurts and three days later the death eaters are on the march and up in the sky again 
 
 say his name ron hissed through gritted teeth 
 
 and remember what professor trelawney said harry went on ignoring ron at the end of last year 
 
 professor trelawney was their divination teacher at hogwarts terrified look vanished as she let out a derisive snort 
 
 oh harry you going to pay attention to anything that old fraud says 
 
 you there said harry you hear her this time was different i told you she went into a trance a real one and she said the dark lord would rise againgreater and more terrible than ever beforeand manage it because his servant was going to go back to himand that night wormtail escaped 
 
 there was a silence in which ron fidgeted absentmindedly with a hole in his chudley cannons bedspread 
 
 why were you asking if hedwig had come harry hermione asked are you expecting a letter 
 
 i told sirius about my scar said harry shrugging waiting for his answer 
 
 good thinking said ron his expression clearing i bet know what to do 
 
 i hoped get back to me quickly said harry 
 
 but we know where sirius ishe could be in africa or somewhere he said hermione reasonably not going to manage that journey in a few days 
 
 yeah i know said harry but there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the sky 
 
 come and have a game of quidditch in the orchard harry said ron come on three on three bill and charlie and fred and george will can try out the wronski feint 
 
 ron said hermione in an sort of voice harry want to play quidditch right worried and all need to go to bed 
 
 yeah i want to play quidditch said harry suddenly hang on get my firebolt 
 
 hermione left the room muttering something that sounded very much like boys 
 
 
 
 neither mr weasley nor percy was at home much over the following week both left the house each morning before the rest of the family got up and returned well after dinner every night 
 
 been an absolute uproar percy told them importantly the sunday evening before they were due to return to hogwarts been putting out fires all week people keep sending howlers and of course if you open a howler straight away it explodes scorch marks all over my desk and my best quill reduced to cinders 
 
 why are they all sending howlers asked ginny who was mending her copy of one thousand magical herbs and fungi with spellotape on the rug in front of the living room fire 
 
 complaining about security at the world cup said percy they want compensation for their ruined property mundungus put in a claim for a tent with jacuzzi but got his number i know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks 
 
 mrs weasley glanced at the grandfather clock in the corner harry liked this clock it was completely useless if you wanted to know the time but otherwise very informative it had nine golden hands and each of them was engraved with one of the weasley names there were no numerals around the face but descriptions of where each family member might be home school and work were there but there was also traveling lost hospital prison and in the position where the number twelve would be on a normal clock mortal peril 
 
 eight of the hands were currently pointing to the home position but mr which was the longest was still pointing to work mrs weasley sighed 
 
 your father had to go into the office on weekends since the days of she said working him far too hard his going to be ruined if he come home soon 
 
 well father feels got to make up for his mistake at the match he said percy if truth be told he was a tad unwise to make a public statement without clearing it with his head of department first 
 
 you dare blame your father for what that wretched skeeter woman wrote said mrs weasley flaring up at once 
 
 if dad said anything old rita would just have said it was disgraceful that nobody from the ministry had commented said bill who was playing chess with ron rita skeeter never makes anyone look good remember she interviewed all the gringotts charm breakers once and called me a pillock 
 
 well it is a bit long dear said mrs weasley gently if just let me 
 
 no mum 
 
 rain lashed against the living room window hermione was immersed in the standard book of spells grade copies of which mrs weasley had bought for her harry and ron in diagon alley charlie was darning a fireproof balaclava harry was polishing his firebolt the broomstick servicing kit hermione had given him for his thirteenth birthday open at his feet fred and george were sitting in a far corner quills out talking in whispers their heads bent over a piece of parchment 
 
 what are you two up to said mrs weasley sharply her eyes on the twins 
 
 homework said fred vaguely 
 
 be ridiculous still on holiday said mrs weasley 
 
 yeah left it a bit late said george 
 
 not by any chance writing out a new order form are you said mrs weasley shrewdly you be thinking of restarting weasleys wizard wheezes by any chance 
 
 now mum said fred looking up at her a pained look on his face if the hogwarts express crashed tomorrow and george and i died how would you feel to know that the last thing we ever heard from you was an unfounded accusation 
 
 everyone laughed even mrs weasley 
 
 oh your coming she said suddenly looking up at the clock again 
 
 mr hand had suddenly spun from work to traveling a second later it had shuddered to a halt on home with the others and they heard him calling from the kitchen 
 
 coming arthur called mrs weasley hurrying out of the room 
 
 a few moments later mr weasley came into the warm living room carrying his dinner on a tray he looked completely exhausted 
 
 well the really in the fire now he told mrs weasley as he sat down in an armchair near the hearth and toyed unenthusiastically with his somewhat shriveled cauliflower rita been ferreting around all week looking for more ministry to report and now found out about poor old bertha going missing so be the headline in the prophet tomorrow i told bagman he should have sent someone to look for her ages ago 
 
 mr crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks said percy swiftly 
 
 crouch is very lucky rita found out about winky said mr weasley irritably be a worth of headlines in his being caught holding the wand that conjured the dark mark 
 
 i thought we were all agreed that that elf while irresponsible did not conjure the mark said percy hotly 
 
 if you ask me mr crouch is very lucky no one at the daily prophet knows how mean he is to elves said hermione angrily 
 
 now look here hermione said percy a ministry official like mr crouch deserves unswerving obedience from his servants 
 
 his slave you mean said hermione her voice rising passionately because he pay winky did he 
 
 i think all better go upstairs and check that packed properly said mrs weasley breaking up the argument come on now all of you 
 
 harry repacked his broomstick servicing kit put his firebolt over his shoulder and went back upstairs with ron the rain sounded even louder at the top of the house accompanied by loud whistlings and moans from the wind not to mention sporadic howls from the ghoul who lived in the attic pigwidgeon began twittering and zooming around his cage when they entered the sight of the trunks seemed to have sent him into a frenzy of excitement 
 
 bung him some owl treats said ron throwing a packet across to harry it might shut him up 
 
 harry poked a few owl treats through the bars of cage then turned to his trunk cage stood next to it still empty 
 
 been over a week harry said looking at deserted perch ron you reckon sirius has been caught do you 
 
 nah it been in the daily prophet said ron the ministry would want to show caught someone they 
 
 yeah i suppose 
 
 look the stuff mum got for you in diagon alley and got some gold out of your vault for youand washed all your socks 
 
 he heaved a pile of parcels onto camp bed and dropped the money bag and a load of socks next to it harry started unwrapping the shopping apart from the standard book of spells grade by miranda goshawk he had a handful of new quills a dozen rolls of parchment and refills for his kit he had been running low on spine of lionfish and essence of belladonna he was just piling underwear into his cauldron when ron made a loud noise of disgust behind him 
 
 what is that supposed to be 
 
 he was holding up something that looked to harry like a long maroon velvet dress it had a lace frill at the collar and matching lace cuffs 
 
 there was a knock on the door and mrs weasley entered carrying an armful of freshly laundered hogwarts robes 
 
 here you are she said sorting them into two piles now mind you pack them properly so they crease 
 
 mum given me new dress said ron handing it out to her 
 
 of course i said mrs weasley for you dress robes 
 
 what said ron looking 
 
 dress robes repeated mrs weasley it says on your school list that supposed to have dress robes this yearrobes for formal occasions 
 
 got to be kidding said ron in disbelief not wearing that no way 
 
 everyone wears them ron said mrs weasley crossly all like that your got some for smart parties 
 
 go starkers before i put that on said ron stubbornly 
 
 be so silly said mrs weasley got to have dress robes on your list i got some for harry tooshow him harry 
 
 in some trepidation harry opened the last parcel on his camp bed it as bad as he had expected however his dress robes have any lace on them at all in fact they were more or less the same as his school ones except that they were bottle green instead of black 
 
 i thought bring out the color of your eyes dear said mrs weasley fondly 
 
 well okay said ron angrily looking at robes why i have some like that 
 
 becausewell i had to get yours secondhand and there a lot of choice said mrs weasley flushing 
 
 harry looked away he would willingly have split all the money in his gringotts vault with the weasleys but he knew they would never take it 
 
 never wearing them ron was saying stubbornly never 
 
 fine snapped mrs weasley go naked and harry make sure you get a picture of him goodness knows i could do with a laugh 
 
 she left the room slamming the door behind her there was a funny spluttering noise from behind them pigwidgeon was choking on an overlarge owl treat 
 
 why is everything i own rubbish said ron furiously striding across the room to unstick beak 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten luna lovegoodcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry had a troubled sleep his parents wove in and out of his dreams never speaking mrs weasley sobbed over dead body watched by ron and hermione who were wearing crowns and yet again harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked door he awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find ron already dressed and talking to him 
 
 better hurry up mums going ballistic she says going to miss the train 
 
 there was a lot of commotion in the house from what he heard as he dressed at top speed harry gathered that fred and george had bewitched their trunks to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them with the result that they had hurtled straight into ginny and knocked her down two flights of stairs into the hall mrs black and mrs weasley were both screaming at the top of their voices 
 
 could have done her a serious injury you idiots 
 
 filthy besmirching the house of my fathers 
 
 hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered just as harry was putting on his trainers hedwig was swaying on her shoulder and she was carrying a squirming crookshanks in her arms 
 
 mum and dad just sent hedwig owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her you ready yet 
 
 nearlyginny all right harry asked shoving on his glasses 
 
 mrs patched her up said hermione but now complaining that we leave unless sturgis here otherwise the guard will be one short 
 
 guard said harry we have to go to cross with a guard 
 
 you have to go to cross with a guard hermione corrected him 
 
 why said harry irritably i thought voldemort was supposed to be lying low or are you telling me going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in 
 
 i know just what says said hermione distractedly looking at her watch but if we leave soon definitely going to miss the train 
 
 will you lot get down here now please mrs weasley bellowed and hermione jumped as though scalded and hurried out of the room harry seized hedwig stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage and set off downstairs after hermione dragging his trunk 
 
 mrs portrait was howling with rage but nobody was bothering to close the curtains over her all the noise in the hall was bound to rouse her again anyway 
 
 harry to come with me and tonks shouted mrs weasley over the repeated screeches of mudbloods scum creatures of dirt leave your trunk and your owl going to deal with the luggage oh for heavens sake sirius dumbledore said no 
 
 a bearlike black dog had appeared at side as he was clambering over the various trunks cluttering the hall to get to mrs weasley 
 
 oh honestly said mrs weasley despairingly well on your own head be it 
 
 she wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak september sunlight harry and the dog followed her the door slammed behind them and mrs screeches were cut off instantly 
 
 tonks harry said looking round as they went down the stone steps of number twelve which vanished the moment they reached the pavement 
 
 waiting for us just up here said mrs weasley stiffly averting her eyes from the lolloping black dog beside harry 
 
 an old woman greeted them on the corner she had tightly curled grey hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a pork pie 
 
 wotcher harry she said winking better hurry up we molly she added checking her watch 
 
 i know i know moaned mrs weasley lengthening her stride but wanted to wait for sturgis if only arthur could have got us cars from the ministry again but fudge let him borrow so much as an empty ink bottle these days how muggles can stand travelling without magic 
 
 but the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gambolled around them snapping at pigeons and chasing its own tail harry help laughing sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time mrs weasley pursed her lips in an almost aunt way 
 
 it took them twenty minutes to reach cross on foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than sirius scaring a couple of cats for entertainment once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platforms nine and ten until the coast was clear then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through on to platform nine and where the hogwarts express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing students and their families harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirits soar he was really going back 
 
 i hope the others make it in time said mrs weasley anxiously staring behind her at the arch spanning the platform through which new arrivals would come 
 
 nice dog harry called a tall boy with dreadlocks 
 
 thanks lee said harry grinning as sirius wagged his tail frantically 
 
 oh good said mrs weasley sounding relieved alastor with the luggage look 
 
 a cap pulled low over his mismatched eyes moody came limping through the archway pushing a trolley loaded with their trunks 
 
 all okay he muttered to mrs weasley and tonks think we were followed 
 
 seconds later mr weasley emerged on to the platform with ron and hermione they had almost unloaded luggage trolley when fred george and ginny turned up with lupin 
 
 no trouble growled moody 
 
 nothing said lupin 
 
 still be reporting sturgis to dumbledore said moody the second time not turned up in a week getting as unreliable as mundungus 
 
 well look after yourselves said lupin shaking hands all round he reached harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder you too harry be careful 
 
 yeah keep your head down and your eyes peeled said moody shaking hand too and forget all of youcareful what you put in writing if in doubt put it in a letter at all 
 
 been great meeting all of you said tonks hugging hermione and ginny see you soon i expect 
 
 a warning whistle sounded the students still on the platform started hurrying on to the train 
 
 quick quick said mrs weasley distractedly hugging them at random and catching harry twice write be good if forgotten anything send it on onto the train now hurry 
 
 for one brief moment the great black dog reared on to its hind legs and placed its front paws on shoulders but mrs weasley shoved harry away towards the train door hissing for sake act more like a dog sirius 
 
 see you harry called out of the open window as the train began to move while ron hermione and ginny waved beside him the figures of tonks lupin moody and mr and mrs weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog was bounding alongside the window wagging its tail blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train then they rounded a bend and sirius was gone 
 
 he have come with us said hermione in a worried voice 
 
 oh lighten up said ron he seen daylight for months poor bloke 
 
 well said fred clapping his hands together stand around chatting all day got business to discuss with lee see you later and he and george disappeared down the corridor to the right 
 
 the train was gathering still more speed so that the houses outside the window flashed past and they swayed where they stood 
 
 shall we go and find a compartment then harry asked 
 
 ron and hermione exchanged looks 
 
 er said ron 
 
 and i are supposed to go into the prefect carriage hermione said awkwardly 
 
 ron looking at harry he seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernails on his left hand 
 
 oh said harry right fine 
 
 i think have to stay there all journey said hermione quickly our letters said we just get instructions from the head boy and girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time 
 
 fine said harry again well ii might see you later then 
 
 yeah definitely said ron casting a shifty anxious look at harry a pain having to go down there ratherbut we have toi mean not enjoying it not percy he finished defiantly 
 
 i know not said harry and he grinned but as hermione and ron dragged their trunks crookshanks and a caged pigwidgeon off towards the engine end of the train harry felt an odd sense of loss he had never travelled on the hogwarts express without ron 
 
 come on ginny told him if we get a move on be able to save them places 
 
 right said harry picking up cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other they struggled off down the corridor peering through the doors into the compartments they passed which were already full harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbours and pointed him out after he had met this behaviour in five consecutive carriages he remembered that the daily prophet had been telling its readers all summer what a lying he was he wondered dully whether the people now staring and whispering believed the stories 
 
 in the very last carriage they met neville longbottom fellow gryffindor his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a grip on his struggling toad trevor 
 
 hi harry he panted hi ginny full i find a seat 
 
 what are you talking about said ginny who had squeezed past neville to peer into the compartment behind him room in this one only loony lovegood in here 
 
 neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone 
 
 be silly said ginny laughing all right 
 
 she slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside harry and neville followed 
 
 hi luna said ginny is it okay if we take these seats 
 
 the girl beside the window looked up she had straggly hair very pale eyebrows and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look harry knew at once why neville had chosen to pass this compartment by the girl gave off an aura of distinct dottiness perhaps it was the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of butterbeer corks or that she was reading a magazine her eyes ranged over neville and came to rest on harry she nodded 
 
 thanks said ginny smiling at her 
 
 harry and neville stowed the three trunks and cage in the luggage rack and sat down luna watched them over her magazine which was called the quibbler she did not seem to need to blink as much as normal humans she stared and stared at harry who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he 
 
 had a good summer luna ginny asked 
 
 yes said luna dreamily without taking her eyes off harry yes it was quite enjoyable you know harry potter she added 
 
 i know i am said harry 
 
 neville chuckled luna turned her pale eyes on him instead 
 
 and i know who you are 
 
 nobody said neville hurriedly 
 
 no not said ginny sharply neville longbottomluna lovegood in my year but in ravenclaw 
 
 wit beyond measure is greatest treasure said luna in a singsong voice 
 
 she raised her magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent harry and neville looked at each other with their eyebrows raised ginny suppressed a giggle 
 
 the train rattled onwards speeding them out into open country it was an odd unsettled sort of day one moment the carriage was full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously grey clouds 
 
 guess what i got for my birthday said neville 
 
 another remembrall said harry remembering the device grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory 
 
 no said neville i could do with one though i lost the old one ages ago no look at this 
 
 he dug the hand that was not keeping a firm grip on trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small grey cactus in a pot except that it was covered with what looked like boils rather than spines 
 
 mimbulus mimbletonia he said proudly 
 
 harry stared at the thing it was pulsating slightly giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ 
 
 really really rare said neville beaming i know if one in the greenhouse at hogwarts even i wait to show it to professor sprout my great uncle algie got it for me in assyria going to see if i can breed from it 
 
 harry knew that favourite subject was herbology but for the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant 
 
 does iterdo anything he asked 
 
 loads of stuff said neville proudly got an amazing defensive mechanism here hold trevor for me 
 
 he dumped the toad into lap and took a quill from his schoolbag luna popping eyes appeared over the top of her magazine again watching what neville was doing neville held the mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eyes his tongue between his teeth chose his spot and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill 
 
 liquid squirted from every boil on the plant thick stinking dark green jets of it they hit the ceiling the windows and spattered luna magazine ginny who had flung her arms up in front of her face just in time merely looked as though she was wearing a slimy green hat but harry whose hands had been busy preventing escape received a faceful it smelled like rancid manure 
 
 neville whose face and torso were also drenched shook his head to get the worst out of his eyes 
 
 sosorry he gasped i tried that before realise it would be quite so worry though not poisonous he added nervously as harry spat a mouthful on to the floor 
 
 at that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open 
 
 oh hello harry said a nervous voice um bad time 
 
 harry wiped the lenses of his glasses with his hand a very pretty girl with long shiny black hair was standing in the doorway smiling at him cho chang the seeker on the ravenclaw quidditch team 
 
 oh hi said harry blankly 
 
 um said cho well just thought say hello bye then 
 
 rather pink in the face she closed the door and departed harry slumped back in his seat and groaned he would have liked cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told he would not have chosen to be sitting with neville and loony lovegood clutching a toad and dripping in stinksap 
 
 never mind said ginny bracingly look we can easily get rid of all this she pulled out her wand scourgify 
 
 the stinksap vanished 
 
 sorry said neville again in a small voice 
 
 ron and hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour by which time the food trolley had already gone by harry ginny and neville had finished their pumpkin pasties and were busy swapping chocolate frog cards when the compartment door slid open and they walked in accompanied by crookshanks and a shrilly hooting pigwidgeon in his cage 
 
 starving said ron stowing pigwidgeon next to hedwig grabbing a chocolate frog from harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him he ripped open the wrapper bit off the head and leaned back with his eyes closed as though he had had a very exhausting morning 
 
 well there are two prefects from each house said hermione looking thoroughly disgruntled as she took her seat boy and girl from each 
 
 and guess a slytherin prefect said ron still with his eyes closed 
 
 malfoy replied harry at once certain his worst fear would be confirmed 
 
 course said ron bitterly stuffing the rest of the frog into his mouth and taking another 
 
 and that complete cow pansy parkinson said hermione viciously how she got to be a prefect when thicker than a concussed troll 
 
 who are harry asked 
 
 ernie macmillan and hannah abbott said ron thickly 
 
 and anthony goldstein and padma patil for ravenclaw said hermione 
 
 you went to the yule ball with padma patil said a vague voice 
 
 everyone turned to look at luna lovegood who was gazing unblinkingly at ron over the top of the quibbler he swallowed his mouthful of frog 
 
 yeah i know i did he said looking mildly surprised 
 
 she enjoy it very much luna informed him she think you treated her very well because you dance with her i think have minded she added thoughtfully i like dancing very much 
 
 she retreated behind the quibbler again ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few seconds then looked around at ginny for some kind of explanation but ginny had stuffed her knuckles in her mouth to stop herself giggling ron shook his head bemused then checked his watch 
 
 supposed to patrol the corridors every so often he told harry and neville and we can give out punishments if people are misbehaving i wait to get crabbe and goyle for something 
 
 not supposed to abuse your position ron said hermione sharply 
 
 yeah right because malfoy abuse it at all said ron sarcastically 
 
 so going to descend to his level 
 
 no just going to make sure i get his mates before he gets mine 
 
 for heavens sake ron 
 
 make goyle do lines kill him he hates writing said ron happily he lowered his voice to low grunt and screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration mimed writing in midair i must not look like a backside 
 
 everyone laughed but nobody laughed harder than luna lovegood she let out a scream of mirth that caused hedwig to wake up and flap her wings indignantly and crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack hissing luna laughed so hard her magazine slipped out of her grasp slid down her legs and onto the floor 
 
 that was funny 
 
 her prominent eyes swam with tears as she gasped for breath staring at ron utterly nonplussed he looked around at the others who were now laughing at the expression on face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of luna lovegood who was rocking backwards and forwards clutching her sides 
 
 are you taking the mickey said ron frowning at her 
 
 backside she choked holding her ribs 
 
 everyone else was watching luna laughing but harry glancing at the magazine on the floor noticed something that made him dive for it it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front was but harry now realised it was a fairly bad cartoon of cornelius fudge harry only recognised him because of the bowler hat one of fudges hands was clenched around a bag of gold the other hand was throttling a goblin the cartoon was captioned how far will fudge go to gain gringotts 
 
 beneath this were listed the titles of other articles inside the magazine 
 
 corruption in the quidditch the tornados are taking control 
 
 secrets of the ancient ruins revealed 
 
 sirius black villain or victim 
 
 can i have a look at this harry asked luna eagerly 
 
 she nodded still gazing at ron breathless with laughter 
 
 harry opened the magazine and scanned the index until this moment he had completely forgotten the magazine kingsley had handed mr weasley to give to sirius but it must have been this edition of the quibbler 
 
 he found the page and turned excitedly to the article 
 
 this too was illustrated by a rather bad cartoon in fact harry would not have known it was supposed to be sirius if it been captioned sirius was standing on a pile of human bones with his wand out the headline on the article said 
 
 siriusblack as painted notorious mass murderer or innocent singing sensation 
 
 harry had to read this first sentence several times before he was convinced that he had not misunderstood it since when had sirius been a singing sensation 
 
 for fourteen years sirius black has been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent muggles and one wizard audacious escape from azkaban two years ago has led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the ministry of magic none of us has ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementors 
 
 but does he 
 
 startling new evidence has recently come to light that sirius black may not have committed the crimes for which he was sent to azhaban in fact says doris purkiss of acanthia way little norton black may not even have been present at the killings 
 
 what people realise is that sirius black is a false name says mrs purkiss the man people believe to be sirius black is actually stubby boardman lead singer of popular singing group the hobgoblins who retired from public life after being struck on the ear by a turnip at a concert in little norton church hall nearly fifteen years ago i recognised him the moment i saw his picture in the paper now stubby possibly have committed those crimes because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me i have written to the minister for magic and am expecting him to give stubby alias sirius a full pardon any day now 
 
 harry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief perhaps it was a joke he thought perhaps the magazine often printed spoof items he flicked back a few pages and found the piece on fudge 
 
 cornelius fudge the minister for magic denied that he had any plans to take over the running of the wizarding bank gringotts when he was elected minister for magic jive years ago fudge has always insisted that he wants nothing more than to cooperate peacefully with the guardians of our gold 
 
 but does he 
 
 sources close to the minister have recently disclosed that dearest ambition is to seize control of the goblin gold supplies and that he will not hesitate to use force if need be 
 
 it be the first time either said a ministry insider cornelius fudge what his friends call him if you could hear him when he thinks no listening oh always talking about the goblins had done in had them drowned had them dropped off buildings had them poisoned had them cooked in pies 
 
 harry did not read any further fudge might have many faults but harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblins to be cooked in pies he flicked through the rest of the magazine pausing every few pages he read an accusation that the tutshill tornados were winning the quidditch league by a combination of blackmail illegal and torture an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a cleansweep six and brought back a bag of moon frogs to prove it and an article on ancient runes which at least explained why luna had been reading the quibbler according to the magazine if you turned the runes on their heads they revealed a spell to make your ears turn into kumquats in fact compared to the rest of the articles in the quibbler the suggestion that sirius might really be the lead singer of the hobgoblins was quite sensible 
 
 anything good in there asked ron as harry closed the magazine 
 
 of course not said hermione scathingly before harry could answer the rubbish everyone knows that 
 
 excuse me said luna her voice had suddenly lost its dreamy quality my the editor 
 
 ioh said hermione looking embarrassed well got some interesting i mean quite 
 
 have it back thank you said luna coldly and leaning forwards she snatched it out of hands riffling through it to page she turned it resolutely again and disappeared behind it just as the compartment door opened for the third time 
 
 harry looked around he had expected this but that did not make the sight of draco malfoy smirking at him from between his cronies crabbe and goyle any more enjoyable 
 
 what he said aggressively before malfoy could open his mouth 
 
 manners potter or have to give you a detention drawled malfoy whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his you see i unlike you have been made a prefect which means that i unlike you have the power to hand out punishments 
 
 yeah said harry but you unlike me are a git so get out and leave us alone 
 
 ron hermione ginny and neville laughed lip curled 
 
 tell me how does it feel being to weasley potter he asked 
 
 shut up malfoy said hermione sharply 
 
 i seem to have touched a nerve said malfoy smirking well just watch yourself potter because be dogging your footsteps in case you step out of line 
 
 get out said hermione standing up 
 
 sniggering malfoy gave harry a last malicious look and departed with crabbe and goyle lumbering along in his wake hermione slammed the compartment door behind them and turned to look at harry who knew at once that she like him had registered what malfoy had said and been just as unnerved by it 
 
 chuck us another frog said ron who had clearly noticed nothing 
 
 harry could not talk freely in front of neville and luna he exchanged another nervous look with hermione then stared out of the window 
 
 he had thought sirius coming with him to the station was a bit of a laugh but suddenly it seemed reckless if not downright dangerous hermione had been right sirius should not have come what if mr malfoy had noticed the black dog and told draco what if he had deduced that the weasleys lupin tonks and moody knew where sirius was hiding or had use of the word dogging been a coincidence 
 
 the weather remained undecided as they travelled farther and farther north rain spattered the windows in a way then the sun put in a feeble appearance before clouds drifted over it once more when darkness fell and lamps came on inside the carriages luna rolled up the quibbler put it carefully away in her bag and took to staring at everyone in the compartment instead 
 
 harry was sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window trying to get a first distant glimpse of hogwarts but it was a moonless night and the window was grimy 
 
 better change said hermione at last and all of them opened their trunks with difficulty and pulled on their school robes she and ron pinned their prefect badges carefully to their chests harry saw ron checking his reflection in the black window 
 
 at last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it as everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pets assembled ready for departure ron and hermione were supposed to supervise all this they disappeared from the carriage again leaving harry and the others to look after crookshanks and pigwidgeon 
 
 carry that owl if you like said luna to harry reaching out for pigwidgeon as neville stowed trevor carefully in an inside pocket 
 
 oherthanks said harry handing her the cage and hoisting more securely into his arms 
 
 they shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their faces as they joined the crowd in the corridor slowly they moved towards the doors harry could smell the pine trees that lined the path down to the lake he stepped down on to the platform and looked around listening for the familiar call of firs years over ere firs years 
 
 but it did not come instead a quite different voice a brisk female one was calling out first years line up over here please all first years to me 
 
 a lantern came swinging towards harry and by its light he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of professor the witch who had taken over care of magical creatures lessons for a while the previous year 
 
 hagrid he said out loud 
 
 i know said ginny but better get out of the way blocking the door 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 harry and ginny became separated as they moved off along the platform and out through the station jostled by the crowd harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of hagrid he had to be here harry had been relying on itseeing hagrid again was one of the things been looking forward to most but there was no sign of him 
 
 he have left harry told himself as he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway on to the road outside with the rest of the crowd just got a cold or something 
 
 he looked around for ron or hermione wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of professor but neither of them was anywhere near him so he allowed himself to be shunted forward onto the dark road outside hogsmeade station 
 
 here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoaches that always took the students above first year up to the castle harry glanced quickly at them turned away to keep a lookout for ron and hermione then did a 
 
 the coaches were no longer horseless there were creatures standing between the carriage shafts if he had had to give them a name he supposed he would have called them horses though there was something reptilian about them too they were completely fleshless their black coats clinging to their skeletons of which every bone was visible their heads were dragonish and their eyes white and staring wings sprouted from each withervast black leathery wings that looked as though they ought to belong to giant bats standing still and quiet in the gathering gloom the creatures looked eerie and sinister harry could not understand why the coaches were being pulled by these horrible horses when they were quite capable of moving along by themselves 
 
 pig said voice right behind harry 
 
 that luna girl was carrying him said harry turning quickly eager to consult ron about hagrid where reckon 
 
 hagrid is i dunno said ron sounding worried better be okay 
 
 a short distance away draco malfoy followed by a small gang of cronies including crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson was pushing some out of the way so that he and his friends could get a coach to themselves seconds later hermione emerged panting from the crowd 
 
 malfoy was being absolutely foul to a back there i swear going to report him only had his badge three minutes and using it to bully people worse than ever crookshanks 
 
 got him said harry there she is 
 
 ginny had just emerged from the crowd clutching a squirming crookshanks 
 
 thanks said hermione relieving ginny of the cat come on get a carriage together before they all fill up 
 
 i got pig yet ron said but hermione was already heading off towards the nearest unoccupied coach harry remained behind with ron 
 
 what are those things reckon he asked ron nodding at the horrible horses as the other students surged past them 
 
 what things 
 
 those horse 
 
 luna appeared holding cage in her arms the tiny owl was twittering excitedly as usual 
 
 here you are she said a sweet little owl he 
 
 er yeah all right said ron gruffly well come on then get in what were you saying harry 
 
 i was saying what are those horse things harry said as he ron and luna made for the carriage in which hermione and ginny were already sitting 
 
 what horse things 
 
 the horse things pulling the carriages said harry impatiently they were after all about three feet from the nearest one it was watching them with empty white eyes ron however gave harry a perplexed look 
 
 what are you talking about 
 
 talking aboutlook 
 
 harry grabbed arm and wheeled him about so that he was face to face with the winged horse ron stared straight at it for a second then looked back at harry 
 
 what am i supposed to be looking at 
 
 at thethere between the shafts harnessed to the coach right there in front 
 
 but as ron continued to look bemused a strange thought occurred to harry 
 
 you see them 
 
 see what 
 
 you see pulling the carriages 
 
 ron looked seriously alarmed now 
 
 are you feeling all right harry 
 
 i yeah 
 
 harry felt utterly bewildered the horse was there in front of him gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing from the station windows behind them vapour rising from its nostrils in the chilly night air yet unless ron was fakingand it was a very feeble joke if he wasron could not see it at all 
 
 shall we get in then said ron uncertainly looking at harry as though worried about him 
 
 yeah said harry yeah go on 
 
 all right said a dreamy voice from beside harry as ron vanished into the dark interior not going mad or anything i can see them too 
 
 can you said harry desperately turning to luna he could see the horses reflected in her wide silvery eyes 
 
 oh yes said luna been able to see them ever since my first day here always pulled the carriages worry just as sane as i am 
 
 smiling faintly she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after ron not altogether reassured harry followed her 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten the house of gauntcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 for or the rest of the potions lessons harry continued to follow the instructions wherever they deviated from libatius with the result that by their fourth lesson slughorn was raving about abilities saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented neither ron nor hermione was delighted by this although harry had offered to share his book with both of them ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than harry did and could not keep asking harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious hermione meanwhile was resolutely plowing on with what she called the official instructions but becoming increasingly as they yielded poorer results than the 
 
 harry wondered vaguely who the prince had been although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of advanced he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the prince had not made additional notes not all of them concerned with here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the prince had made up himself 
 
 or herself said hermione irritably overhearing harry pointing some of these out to ron in the common room on saturday evening it might have been a girl i think the handwriting looks more like a than a 
 
 the prince he was called harry said how many girls have been princes 
 
 hermione seemed to have no answer to this she merely scowled and twitched her essay on the principles of rematerialization away from ron who was trying to read it upside down 
 
 harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of advanced back into his bag 
 
 five to eight better go be late for dumbledore 
 
 ooooh gasped hermione looking up at once good luck wait up we want to hear what he teaches you 
 
 hope it goes okay said ron and the pair of them watched harry leave through the portrait hole 
 
 harry proceeded through deserted corridors though he had to step hastily behind a statue when professor trelawney appeared around a corner muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of playing cards reading them as she walked 
 
 two of spades conflict she murmured as she passed the place where harry crouched hidden seven of spades an ill omen ten of spades violence knave of spades a dark young man possibly troubled one who dislikes the questioner 
 
 she stopped dead right on the other side of statue 
 
 well that be right she said annoyed and harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall 
 
 acid pops said harry and the gargoyle leapt aside the wall behind it slid apart and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed onto which harry stepped so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to office 
 
 harry knocked 
 
 come in said dumbledore s voice 
 
 good evening sir said harry walking into the office 
 
 ah good evening harry sit down said dumbledore smiling i hope had an enjoyable first week back at school 
 
 yes thanks sir said harry 
 
 you must have been busy a detention under your belt already 
 
 er began harry awkwardly but dumbledore did not look too stern 
 
 i have arranged with professor snape that you will do your detention next saturday instead 
 
 right said harry who had more pressing matters on his mind than detention and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening the circular office looked just as it always did the delicate silver instruments stood on tables puffing smoke and whirring portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames and magnificent phoenix fawkes stood on his perch behind the door watching harry with bright interest it did not even look as though dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice 
 
 so harry said dumbledore in a businesslike voice you have been wondering i am sure what i have planned for you during thesefor want of a better word lessons 
 
 yes sir 
 
 well i have decided that it is time now that you know what prompted lord voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago for you to be given certain information there was a pause 
 
 you said at the end of last term you were going to tell me everything said harry it was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice sir he added 
 
 and so i did said dumbledore placidly i told you everything i know from this point forth we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork from here on in harry i may be as woefully wrong as humphrey belcher who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron 
 
 but you think right said harry 
 
 naturally i do but as i have already proven to you i make mistakes like the next man in fact being forgive merather cleverer than most men my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger 
 
 sir said harry tentatively does what going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy will it help me survive 
 
 it has a very great deal to do with the prophecy said dumbledore as casually as if harry had asked him about the next weather and i certainly hope that it will help you to survive 
 
 dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk past harry who turned eagerly in his seat to watch dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door when dumbledore straightened up he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim he placed the pensieve on the desk in front of harry 
 
 you look worried 
 
 harry had indeed been eyeing the pensieve with some apprehension his previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memories though highly instructive had also been uncomfortable the last time he had disturbed its contents he had seen much more than he would have wished but dumbledore was smiling 
 
 this time you enter the pensieve with me and even more unusually with permission 
 
 where are we going sir 
 
 for a trip down bob memory lane said dumbledore pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling substance 
 
 who was bob ogden 
 
 he was employed by the department of magical law enforcement said dumbledore he died some time ago but not before i had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me we are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties if you will stand harry 
 
 but dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle his injured hand seemed stiff and painful 
 
 shall shall i sir 
 
 no matter harry 
 
 dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out 
 
 sirhow did you injure your hand harry asked again looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity 
 
 now is not the moment for that story harry not yet we have an appointment with bob ogden 
 
 dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the pensieve where they swirled and shimmered neither liquid nor gas after you said dumbledore gesturing toward the bowl 
 
 harry bent forward took a deep breath and plunged his face into the silvery substance he felt his feet leave the office floor he was falling falling through whirling darkness and then quite suddenly he was blinking in dazzling sunlight before his eyes had adjusted dumbledore landed beside him 
 
 they were standing in a country lane bordered by high tangled hedgerows beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a some ten feet in front of them stood a short plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks he was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of the brambles on the side of the road harry knew this must be ogden he was the only person in sight and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like muggles in this case a frock coat and spats over a striped bathing costume before harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance however ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane 
 
 dumbledore and harry followed as they passed the wooden sign harry looked up at its two arms the one pointing back the way they had come read great hangleton miles the arm pointing after ogden said little hangleton mile 
 
 they walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing figure ahead then the lane curved to the left and fell away sloping steeply down a hillside so that they had a sudden unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them harry could see a village undoubtedly little hangleton nestled between two steep hills its church and graveyard clearly visible across the valley set on the opposite hillside was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn 
 
 ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope dumbledore lengthened his stride and harry hurried to keep up he thought little hangleton must be their final destination and wondered as he had done on the night they had found slughorn why they had to approach it from such a distance he soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village however the lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner it was to see the very edge of frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge 
 
 dumbledore and harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left behind the path was crooked rocky and potholed sloping downhill like the last one and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them sure enough the track soon opened up at the copse and dumbledore and harry came to a halt behind ogden who had stopped and drawn his wand 
 
 despite the cloudless sky the old trees ahead cast deep dark cool shadows and it was a few seconds before eyes discerned the building amongst the tangle of trunks it seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby blocking all light and the view of the valley below he wondered whether it was inhabited its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places nettles grew all around it their tips reaching the windows which were tiny and thick with grime just as he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there however one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it as though somebody was cooking 
 
 ogden moved forward quietly and it seemed to harry rather cautiously as the dark shadows of the trees slid over him he stopped again staring at the front door to which somebody had nailed a dead snake 
 
 then there was a rustle and a crack and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree landing on his feet right in front of ogden who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled 
 
 not welcome 
 
 the man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color several of his teeth were missing his eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions he might have looked comical but he did not the effect was frightening and harry could not blame ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke 
 
 ergood morning from the ministry of magic 
 
 not welcome 
 
 sorry i understand you said ogden nervously 
 
 harry thought ogden was being extremely dim the stranger was making himself very clear in opinion particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other 
 
 you understand him sure harry said dumbledore quietly 
 
 yes of course said harry slightly nonplussed why ogden 
 
 but as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again he suddenly understood 
 
 speaking parseltongue 
 
 very good said dumbledore nodding and smiling 
 
 the man in rags was now advancing on ogden knife in one hand wand in the other 
 
 now look ogden began but too late there was a bang and ogden was on the ground clutching his nose while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers 
 
 morfin said a loud voice 
 
 an elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically this man was shorter than the first and oddly proportioned his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong which with his bright brown eyes short scrubby hair and wrinkled face gave him the look of a powerful aged monkey he came to a halt beside the man with the knife who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of ogden on the ground 
 
 ministry is it said the older man looking down at ogden 
 
 correct said ogden angrily dabbing his face and you i take it are mr gaunt 
 
 s right said gaunt got you in the face did he 
 
 yes he did snapped ogden 
 
 made your presence known you said gaunt aggressively this is private property just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself 
 
 defend himself against what man said ogden clambering back to his feet 
 
 busybodies intruders muggles and filth 
 
 ogden pointed his wand at his own nose which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus and the flow stopped at once mr gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to morfin 
 
 get in the house argue 
 
 this time ready for it harry recognized parseltongue even while he could understand what was being said he distinguished the weird hissing noise that was all ogden could hear morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him so that the snake swung sadly again 
 
 your son here to see mr gaunt said ogden as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat that was morfin it 
 
 ar that was morfin said the old man indifferently are you he asked suddenly aggressive 
 
 neither here nor there said ogden coldly and harry felt his respect for ogden rise 
 
 apparently gaunt felt rather differently he squinted into face and muttered in what was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone now i come to think about it seen noses like yours down in the village 
 
 i doubt it if your been let loose on them said ogden perhaps we could continue this discussion inside 
 
 inside 
 
 yes mr gaunt already told you here about morfin we sent an owl 
 
 no use for owls said gaunt i open letters 
 
 then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors said ogden tartly i am here following a serious breach of wizarding law which occurred here in the early hours of this morning 
 
 all right all right all right bellowed gaunt come in the bleeding house then and much good do you 
 
 the house seemed to contain three tiny rooms two doors led off the main room which served as kitchen and living room combined morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in parseltongue 
 
 hissy hissy little snakey 
 
 slither on the floor 
 
 you be good to morfin 
 
 or nail you to the door 
 
 there was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window and harry realized that there was somebody else in the room a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her she was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove and was fiddling around with the shelf of pots and pans above it her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain pale rather heavy face her eyes like her stared in opposite directions she looked a little cleaner than the two men but harry thought he had never seen a more person 
 
 merope said gaunt grudgingly as ogden looked inquiringly toward her 
 
 good morning said ogden 
 
 she did not answer but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her 
 
 well mr gaunt said ogden to get straight to the point we have reason to believe that your son morfin performed magic in front of a muggle late last night 
 
 there was a deafening clang merope had dropped one of the pots 
 
 pick it up gaunt bellowed at her it grub on the floor like some filthy muggle your wand for you useless sack of muck 
 
 mr gaunt please said ogden in a shocked voice as merope who had already picked up the pot flushed blotchily scarlet lost her grip on the pot again drew her wand shakily from her pocket pointed it at the pot and muttered a hasty inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her hit the opposite wall and crack in two 
 
 morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter gaunt screamed mend it you pointless lump mend it 
 
 merope stumbled across the room but before she had time to raise her wand ogden had lifted his own and said firmly reparo the pot mended itself instantly 
 
 gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at ogden but seemed to think better of it instead he jeered at his daughter lucky the nice man from the here it perhaps take you off my hands perhaps he mind dirty squibs 
 
 without looking at anybody or thanking ogden merope picked up the pot and returned it hands trembling to its shelf she then stood quite still her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish 
 
 mr gaunt ogden began again as said the reason for my visit 
 
 i heard you the first time snapped gaunt and so what morfin gave a muggle a bit of what was coming to himwhat about it then 
 
 morfin has broken wizarding law said ogden sternly 
 
 morfin has broken wizarding law gaunt imitated voice making it pompous and singsong morfin cackled again he taught a filthy muggle a lesson illegal now is it 
 
 yes said ogden afraid it is 
 
 he pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it 
 
 that then his sentence said gaunt his voice rising angrily 
 
 it is a summons to the ministry for a hearing 
 
 summons summons who do you think you are summoning my son anywhere 
 
 head of the magical law enforcement squad said ogden 
 
 and you think scum do you screamed gaunt advancing on ogden now with a dirty finger pointing at his chest scum come running when the ministry tells em to do you know who talking to you filthy little mudblood do you 
 
 i was under the impression that i was speaking to mr gaunt said ogden looking wary but standing his ground 
 
 right roared gaunt for a moment harry thought gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture but then realized that he was showing ogden the ugly ring he was wearing on his middle finger waving it before eyes see this see this know what it is know where it came from centuries been in our family how far back we go and all the way know how much been offered for this with the peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone 
 
 really no idea said ogden blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose and quite beside the point mr gaunt your son has committed 
 
 with a howl of rage gaunt ran toward his daughter for a split second harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat next moment he was dragging her toward ogden by a gold chain around her neck 
 
 see this he bellowed at ogden shaking a heavy gold locket at him while merope spluttered and gasped for breath 
 
 i see it i see it said ogden hastily 
 
 slytherins yelled gaunt salazar his last living descendants what do you say to that eh 
 
 mr gaunt your daughter said ogden in alarm but gaunt had already released merope she staggered away from him back to her corner massaging her neck and gulping for air 
 
 so said gaunt triumphantly as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible dispute you go talking to us as if dirt on your shoes generations of wizards allmore than you can say i doubt 
 
 and he spat on the floor at feet morfin cackled again merope huddled beside the window her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair said nothing 
 
 mr gaunt said ogden doggedly i am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand i am here because of morfin morfin and the muggle he accosted late last night our glanced down at his scroll of that morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said muggle causing him to erupt in highly painful hives 
 
 morfin giggled 
 
 be quiet boy snarled gaunt in parseltongue and morfin fell silent again 
 
 and so what if he did then gaunt said defiantly to ogden i expect wiped the filthy face clean for him and his memory to boot 
 
 hardly the point is it mr gaunt said ogden this was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless 
 
 ar i had you marked out as a the moment i saw you sneered gaunt and he spat on the floor again 
 
 this discussion is getting us nowhere said ogden firmly it is clear from your attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions he glanced down at his scroll of parchment again morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of september to answer the charges of using magic in front of a muggle and causing harm and distress to that same mugg 
 
 ogden broke off the jingling clopping sounds of horses and loud laughing voices were drifting in through the open window apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood gaunt froze listening his eyes wide morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds his expression hungry merope raised her head her face harry saw was starkly white 
 
 my god what an eyesore rang out a voice as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them your father have that hovel cleared away tom 
 
 not ours said a young voice everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called gaunt and his children the quite mad you should hear some of the stories they tell in the village 
 
 the girl laughed the jingling clopping noises were growing louder and louder morfin made to get out of his armchair 
 
 keep your seat said his father warningly in parseltongue 
 
 tom said the voice again now so close they were clearly right beside the house i might be wrongbut has somebody nailed a snake to that door 
 
 good lord right said the voice be the son i told you not right in the head look at it cecilia darling 
 
 the jingling and clopping sounds were now growing fainter again 
 
 darling whispered morfin in parseltongue looking at his sister darling he called her so he have you anyway 
 
 merope was so white harry felt sure she was going to faint 
 
 that said gaunt sharply also in parseltongue looking from his son to his daughter what did you say morfin 
 
 she likes looking at that muggle said morfin a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister who now looked terrified always in the garden when he passes peering through the hedge at him she and last night 
 
 merope shook her head jerkily imploringly but morfin went on ruthlessly hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home she 
 
 hanging out of the window to look at a muggle said gaunt quietly 
 
 all three of the gaunts seemed to have forgotten ogden who was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping 
 
 is it true said gaunt in a deadly voice advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl my descendant of salazar slytherinhankering after a filthy muggle 
 
 merope shook her head frantically pressing herself into the wall apparently unable to speak 
 
 but i got him father cackled morfin i got him as he went by and he look so pretty with hives all over him did he merope 
 
 you disgusting little squib you filthy little blood traitor roared gaunt losing control and his hands closed around his throat 
 
 both harry and ogden yelled no at the same time ogden raised his wand and cried relaskio 
 
 gaunt was thrown backward away from his daughter he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back with a roar of rage morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at ogden brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand 
 
 ogden ran for his life dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and harry obeyed screams echoing in his ears 
 
 ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane his arms over his head where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome young man both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of ogden who bounced off the flank and set off again his frock coat flying covered from head to foot in dust running up the lane 
 
 i think that will do harry said dumbledore he took harry by the elbow and tugged next moment they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness until they landed squarely on their feet back in now twilit office 
 
 what happened to the girl in the cottage said harry at once as dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand merope or whatever her name was 
 
 oh she survived said dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that harry should sit down too ogden apparated back to the ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes morfin and his father attempted to fight but both were overpowered removed from the cottage and subsequently convicted by the wizengamot morfin who already had a record of muggle attacks was sentenced to three years in azkaban marvolo who had injured several ministry employees in addition to ogden received six months 
 
 marvolo harry repeated wonderingly 
 
 right said dumbledore smiling in approval i am glad to see keeping up 
 
 that old man was 
 
 grandfather yes said dumbledore marvolo his son morfin and his daughter merope were the last of the gaunts a very ancient wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before marvolo was born he as you saw was left in squalor and poverty with a very nasty temper a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son and rather more than his daughter 
 
 so merope said harry leaning forward in his chair and staring at dumbledore so merope was sir does that mean she was mother 
 
 it does said dumbledore and it so happens that we also had a glimpse of father i wonder whether you noticed 
 
 the muggle morfin attacked the man on the horse 
 
 very good indeed said dumbledore beaming yes that was tom riddle senior the handsome muggle who used to go riding past the gaunt cottage and for whom merope gaunt cherished a secret burning passion 
 
 and they ended up married harry said in disbelief unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love 
 
 i think you are forgetting said dumbledore that merope was a witch i do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father once marvolo and morfin were safely in azkaban once she was alone and free for the first time in her life then i am sure she was able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen years 
 
 can you not think of any measure merope could have taken to make tom riddle forget his muggle companion and fall in love with her instead 
 
 the imperius curse harry suggested or a love potion 
 
 very good personally i am inclined to think that she used a love potion i am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her and i do not think it would have been very difficult some hot day when riddle was riding alone to persuade him to take a drink of water in any case within a few months of the scene we have just witnessed the village of little hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal you can imagine the gossip it caused when the son ran off with the daughter merope 
 
 but the villagers shock was nothing to he returned from azkaban expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table instead he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell explaining what she had done 
 
 from all that i have been able to discover he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth the shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early deathor perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself azkaban had greatly weakened marvolo and he did not live to see morfin return to the cottage 
 
 and merope she she died she voldemort brought up in an orphanage 
 
 yes indeed said dumbledore we must do a certain amount of guessing here although i do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened you see within a few months of their runaway marriage tom riddle reappeared at the manor house in little hangleton without his wife the rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of being hoodwinked and taken in what he meant i am sure is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted though i daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane when they heard what he was saying however the villagers guessed that merope had lied to tom riddle pretending that she was going to have his baby and that he had married her for this reason 
 
 but she did have his baby 
 
 but not until a year after they were married tom riddle left her while she was still pregnant 
 
 what went wrong asked harry why did the love potion stop working 
 
 again this is guesswork said dumbledore but i believe that merope who was deeply in love with her husband could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means i believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion perhaps besotted as she was she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return perhaps she thought he would stay for the sake if so she was wrong on both counts he left her never saw her again and never troubled to discover what became of his son 
 
 the sky outside was inky black and the lamps in office seemed to glow more brightly than before 
 
 i think that will do for tonight harry said dumbledore after a moment or two 
 
 yes sir said harry 
 
 he got to his feet but did not leave 
 
 sir is it important to know all this about past 
 
 very important i think said dumbledore 
 
 and it got something to do with the prophecy 
 
 it has everything to do with the prophecy 
 
 right said harry a little confused but reassured all the same 
 
 he turned to go then another question occurred to him and he turned back again sir am i allowed to tell ron and hermione everything told me 
 
 dumbledore considered him for a moment then said yes i think mr weasley and miss granger have proved themselves trustworthy but harry i am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else it would not be a good idea if word got around how much i know or suspect about lord secrets 
 
 no sir make sure just ron and hermione good night 
 
 he turned away again and was almost at the door when he saw it sitting on one of the little tables that supported so many silver instruments was an ugly gold ring set with a large cracked black stone 
 
 sir said harry staring at it that ring 
 
 yes said dumbledore 
 
 you were wearing it when we visited professor slughorn that night 
 
 so i was dumbledore agreed 
 
 but it sir it the same ring marvolo gaunt showed ogden 
 
 dumbledore bowed his head the very same 
 
 but how come have you always had it 
 
 no i acquired it very recently said dumbledore a few days before i came to fetch you from your aunt and in fact 
 
 that would be around the time you injured your hand then sir 
 
 around that time yes harry 
 
 harry hesitated dumbledore was smiling 
 
 sir how exactly 
 
 too late harry you shall hear the story another time goodnight 
 
 goodnight sir 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter ten kreachers talecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry woke early next morning wrapped in a sleeping bag on the drawing room floor a chink of sky was visible between the heavy curtains it was the cool clear blue of watered ink somewhere between night and dawn and everything was quiet except for ron and hermiones slow deep breathing harry glanced over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him ron had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa so that her silhouette was raised above his her arm curved to the floor her fingers inches from rons harry wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands the idea made him feel strangely lonely 
 
 he looked up at the shadowy ceiling the cobwebbed chandelier less than house ago he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee waiting to show in wedding guests it seemed a lifetime away what was going to happen now he lay on the floor and he thought of the horcruxes of the daunting complex mission dumbledore had left him dumbledore 
 
 the grief that had possessed him since dumbledores death felt different now the accusations he had heard from muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized could dumbledore have let such things happen had he been like dudley content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden 
 
 harry thought of godrics hollow of graves dumbledore had never mentioned there he thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in dumbledores will and resentment swelled in the darkness why hadnt dumbledore told him why hadnt he explained had dumbledore actually cared about harry at all or had harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed but not trusted never confided in 
 
 harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company desperate for something to do for distraction he slipped out of his sleeping bad picked up his wand and crept out of the room on the landing he whispered lumos and started to climb the stairs by wandlight 
 
 on the second landing was the bedroom in which he and ron had slept last time they had been here he glanced into it the wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs somebody had searched the house since the order had left snape or perhaps mundungus who had pilfered plenty from this house both before and after sirius died harrys gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes contained phineas nigellus black siriuss grandfather but it was empty showing nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop phineas nigellus was evidently spending the night in the headmasters study at hogwarts 
 
 harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there were only two doors the one facing him bore a nameplate reading sirius harry had never entered his godfathers bedroom before he pushed open the door holding his wand high to cast light as widely as possible the room was spacious and must once have been handsome there was a large bed with a carved wooden headboard a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains and a chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle scrubs still resting in its sockets solid wax banging in frostlike drips a fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the beds headboard a spiders web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe and as harry moved deeper into the room he head a scurrying of disturbed mice 
 
 the teenage sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the walls silk was visible harry could only assume that siriuss parents had been unable to remove the permanent sticking charm that kept them on the wall because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest sons taste in decoration sirius seemed to have long gone out of his way to annoy his parents there were several large gryffindor banners faded scarlet and gold just to underline his difference from all the rest of the slytherin family there were many pictures of muggle motorcycles and also harry had to admire siriuss nerve several posters of muggle girls harry could tell that they were muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pictures faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper this was in contrast the only wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four hogwarts students standing arm in arm laughing at the camera 
 
 with a leap of pleasure harry recognized his father his untidy black hair stuck up at the back like harrys and he too wore glasses beside him was sirius carelessly handsome his slightly arrogant face so much younger and happier than harry had ever seen it alive to siriuss right stood pettigrew more than a head shorter plump and flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest of gangs with the rebels that james and sirius had been on jamess left was lupin even then a little but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked and included or was it simply because harry knew how it had been that he saw these things in the picture he tried to take it from the wall it was his now after all sirius had left him everything but it would not budge sirius had taken no chances in preventing his parents from redecorating his room 
 
 harry looked around at the floor the sky outside was growing brightest a shaft of light revealed bits of paper books and small objects scattered over the carpet evidently siriuss bedroom had been reached too although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly if not entirely worthless a few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with the covers and sundry pages littered the floor 
 
 harry bent down picked up a few of the pieces of paper and examined them he recognized one as a part of an old edition of a history of magic by bathilda bagshot and another as belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual the third was handwritten and crumpled he smoothed it out 
 
 
 
 
 dear padfoot 
 thank you thank you for harrys birthday present it was his favorite by far one year old and already zooming along on a toy broomstick he looked so pleased with himself im enclosing a picture so you can see you know it only rises about two feet off the ground but he nearly killed the cat and he smashed a horrible vase petunia sent me for christmas no complaints there of course james thought it was so funny says hes going to be a great quidditch player but weve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we dont take our eyes off him when he gets going 
 we had a very quiet birthday tea just us and old bathilda who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on harry we were so sorry you couldnt come but the orders got to come first and harrys not old enough to know its his birthday anyway james is getting a bit frustrated shut up here he tries not to show it but i can tell c also dumbledores still got his invisibility cloak so no chance of little excursions if you could visit it would cheer him up so much wormy was here last weekend i thought he seemed down but that was probably the next about the mckinnons i cried all evening when i heard 
 bathilda drops in most days shes a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about dumbledore im not sure hed be pleased if he knew i dont know how much to believe actually because it seems incredible that dumbledore 
 harrys extremities seemed to have gone numb he stood quite still holding the miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruptions sent joy and grief thundering its equal measure through his veins lurching to the bed he sat down 
 
 he read the letter again but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself she had made her gs the same way he did he searched through the letter for every one of them and each felt like a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil the letter was an incredible treasure proof that lily potter had lived really lived that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment tracing ink into these letters these words words about him harry her son 
 
 impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes he reread the letter this time concentrating on the meaning it was like listening to a voice 
 
 they had a cat perhaps it had perished like his parents at godrics hollow or else fled when there was nobody left to feed it sirius had bought him his first broomstick his parents had known bathilda bagshot had dumbledore introduced them dumbledores still got his invisibility cloak there was something funny there 
 
 harry paused pondering his mothers words why had dumbledore taken jamess invisibility cloak harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before i dont need a cloak to become invisible perhaps some less gifted order member had needed its assistance and dumbledore had acted as a carrier harry passed on 
 
 wormy was here pettigrew the traitor had seemed down had he was he aware that he was seeing james and lily alive for the last time 
 
 and finally bathilda again who told incredible stories about dumbledore it seems incredible that dumbledore c 
 
 that dumbledore what but there were any number of things that would seem incredible about dumbledore that he had once received bottom marks in a transfiguration test for instance or had taken up goat charming like aberforth 
 
 harry got to his feet and scanned the floor perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere he seized papers treating them in his eagerness with as little consideration as the original searcher he pulled open drawers shook out books stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of the wardrobe and crawled under the bed and armchair 
 
 at last lying facedown on the floor he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers when he pulled it out it proved to be most of the photograph that lily had described in her letter a baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom roaring with laughter and a pair of legs that must have belonged to james was chasing after him harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with lilys letter and continued to look for the second sheet 
 
 after another quarter of an hour however he was forced to conclude that the rest of his mothers letter was gone had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had been written or had it been taken by whoever had searched the room harry read the first sheet again this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable his toy broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the death eaters the only potentially useful thing he could see her was possible information on dumbledore it seems incredible that dumbledore c what 
 
 harry harry harry 
 
 im here he called whats happened 
 
 there was a clatter of footsteps outside the door and hermione burst inside 
 
 we woke up and didnt know where you were she said breathlessly she turned and shouted over her shoulder ron ive found him 
 
 rons annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below 
 
 good tell him from me hes a git 
 
 harry dont just disappear please we were terrified why did you come up here anyway she gazed around the ransacked room what have you been doing 
 
 look what ive just found 
 
 he held out his mothers letter hermione took it out and read it while harry watched her when she reached the end of the page she looked up at him 
 
 oh harry 
 
 and theres this too 
 
 he handed her the torn photograph and hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom 
 
 ive been looking for the rest of the letter harry said but its not here 
 
 hermione glanced around 
 
 did you make all this mess or was some of it done when you got here 
 
 someone had searched before me said harry 
 
 i thought so every room i looked into on the way up had been disturbed what were they after do you think 
 
 information on the order if it was snape 
 
 but youd think hed already have all he needed i mean was in the order wasnt he 
 
 well then said harry keen to discuss his theory what about information on dumbledore the second page of the letter for instance you know this bathilda my mum mentions you know who she is 
 
 who 
 
 bathilda bagshot the author of c 
 
 a history of magic said hermione looking interested so your parents knew her she was an incredible magic historian 
 
 and shes still alive said harry and she lives in godrics hollow rons auntie muriel was talking about her at the wedding she knew dumbledores family too be pretty interesting to talk to wouldnt she there was a little too much understanding in the smile hermione gave him for harrys liking he took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck so as not to have to look at her and give himself away i understand why youd love to talk to her about your mum and dad and dumbledore too said hermione but that wouldnt really help us in our search for the horcruxes would it harry did not answer and she rushed on harry i know you really want to go to godrics hollow but im scared im scared at how easily those death eaters found us yesterday it just makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried im sure theyd be expecting you to visit it 
 
 its not just that harry said still avoiding looking at her muriel said stuff about dumbledore at the wedding i want to know the truth 
 
 he told hermione everything that muriel had told him when he had finished hermione said of course i can see why thats upset you harry c 
 
 im not upset he lied id just like to know whether or not its true or c 
 
 harry do you really think youll get the truth from a malicious old woman like muriel or from rita skeeter how can you believe them you knew dumbledore 
 
 i thought i did he muttered 
 
 but you know how much truth there was in everything rita wrote about you doge is right how can you let these people tarnish your memories of dumbledore 
 
 he looked away trying not to betray the resentment he felt there it was again choose what to believe he wanted the truth why was everybody so determined that he should not get it 
 
 shall we go down to the kitchen hermione suggested after a little pause find something for breakfast 
 
 do not enter without the express permission of regulus arcturus black 
 excitement trickled through harry but he was not immediately sure why he read the sign again hermione was already a flight of stairs below him 
 
 hermione he said and he was surprised that his voice was so calm come back up here 
 
 whats the matter 
 
 i think ive found him 
 
 there was a gasp and then hermione ran back up the stairs 
 
 in your mums letter but i didnt see c 
 
 harry shook his head pointing at reguluss sign she read it then clutched harrys arm so tightly that he winced 
 
 siriuss brother she whispered 
 
 he was a death eater said harry sirius told me about him he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave c so they killed him 
 
 that fits gasped hermione if he was a death eater he had access to voldemort and if he became disenchanted then he would have wanted to bring voldemort down 
 
 she released harry leaned over the banister and screamed ron ron get up here quick 
 
 ron appeared panting a minute later his wand ready in his hand 
 
 whats up if its massive spiders again i want breakfast before i c 
 
 he frowned at the sign on reguluss door in which hermione was silently pointing 
 
 what that was siriuss brother wasnt it regulus arcturus regulus the locket c you dont reckon c 
 
 lets find out said harry he pushed the door it was locked hermione pointed her wand at the handle and said alohamora there was a click and the door swung open 
 
 they moved over the threshold together gazing around reguluss bedroom was slightly smaller than siriuss though it had the same sense of former grandeur whereas sirius had sought to advertise his diffidence from the rest of the family regulus had striven to emphasize the opposite the slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere draping the bed the walls and the windows the black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed along with its motto toujours pur beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings all stuck together to make a ragged collage hermione crossed the room to examine them 
 
 theyre all about voldemort she said regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the death eaters 
 
 a little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings harry meanwhile had noticed another photograph a hogwarts quidditch team was smiling and waving out of the frame he moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests slytherins regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row he had the same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother though he was smaller slighter and rather less handsome than sirius had been 
 
 he played seeker said harry 
 
 what said hermione vaguely she was still immersed in voldemorts press clippings 
 
 hes sitting in the middle of the front row thats where the seeker never mind said harry realizing that nobody was listening ron was on his hands and knees searching under the wardrobe harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk yet again somebody had searched before them the drawers contents had been turned over recently the dust disturbed but there was nothing of value there old quills textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled a recently smashed ink bottle its sticky residue covering the contents of the drawer 
 
 theres an easier way said hermione as harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans she raised her wand and said accio locket 
 
 nothing happened ron who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains looked disappointed 
 
 is that it then its not here 
 
 oh it could still be here but under said hermione charms to prevent it from being summoned magically you know 
 
 like voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave said harry remembering how he had been unable to summon the fake locket 
 
 how are we supposed to find it then asked ron 
 
 we search manually said hermione 
 
 thats a good idea said ron rolling his eyes and he resumed his examination of the curtains 
 
 they combed every inch of the room for more than an hour but were forced finally to conclude that the locket was not there 
 
 the sun had risen now its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows 
 
 it could be somewhere else in the house though said hermione in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs as harry and ron had become more discouraged she seemed to have become more determined whether hed manage to destroy it or not hed want to keep it hidden from voldemort wouldnt he remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last time that clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle ron regulus might have put them there to protect the lockets hiding place even though we didnt realize it at at 
 
 harry and ron looked at her she was standing with one foot in midair with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been obliviated her eyes had even drifted out of focus 
 
 at the time she finished in a whisper 
 
 something wrong asked ron 
 
 there was a locket 
 
 what said harry and ron together 
 
 in the cabinet in the drawing room nobody could open it and we we 
 
 harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach he remembered he had even handled the thing as they passed it around each trying in turn to pry it open it had been tossed into a sack of rubbish along with the snuffbox of wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy 
 
 kreacher nicked loads of things back from us said harry it was the only chance the only slender hope left to them and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go he had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen cmon 
 
 he ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time the other two thundering along in his wake they made so much noise that they woke the portrait of siriuss mother as they passed through the hall 
 
 filth mudbloods scum she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind them harry ran the length of the room skidded to a halt at the door of kreachers cupboard and wrenched it open there was the nest of dirty old blankets in which the had once slept but they were not longer glittering with the trinkets kreacher had salvaged the only thing there was an old copy of natures nobility a wizarding genealogy refusing to believe his eyes harry snatched up the blankets and shook them a dead mouse fell out and rolled dismally across the floor ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair hermione closed her eyes 
 
 its not over yet said harry and he raised his voice and called kreacher 
 
 there was a loud crack and the house elf that harry had so reluctantly inherited from sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace tiny half his pale skin hanging off him in folds white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears he was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him and the contemptuous look he bent upon harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outfit 
 
 master croaked kreacher in his bullfrogs voice and he bowed low muttering to his knees back in my mistresss old house with the weasley and the mudblood c 
 
 i forbid you to call anyone blood traitor or mudblood growled harry he would have found kreacher with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes a distinctively unlovable object even if the elf had not betrayed sirius to voldemort 
 
 ive got a question for you said harry his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the elf and i order you to answer it truthfully understand 
 
 yes master said kreacher bowing low again harry saw his lips moving soundlessly undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter 
 
 two years ago said harry his heart now hammering against his ribs there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs we threw it out did you steal it back 
 
 there was a moments silence during which kreacher straightened up to look harry full in the face then he said yes 
 
 where is it now asked harry jubilantly as ron and hermione looked gleeful 
 
 kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his next word 
 
 gone 
 
 gone echoed harry elation floating out of him what do you mean its gone 
 
 the elf shivered he swayed 
 
 kreacher said harry fiercely i order you c 
 
 mundungus fletcher croaked the elf his eyes still tight shut mundungus fletcher stole it all miss bellas and miss cissys pictures my mistresss gloves the order of merlin first class the goblets with the family crest and c and c 
 
 kreacher was gulping for air his hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream 
 
 c and the locket master reguluss locket kreacher did wrong kreacher failed in his orders 
 
 harry reacted instinctively as kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate he launched himself upon the elf flattening him hermiones scream mingled with kreachers but harry bellowed louder than both of them kreacher i order you to stay still 
 
 he felt the elf freeze and released him kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor tears gushing from his sagging eyes 
 
 harry let him up hermione whispered 
 
 so he can beat himself up with the poker snorted harry kneeling beside the elf i dont think so right kreacher i want the truth how do you know mundungus fletcher stole the locket 
 
 kreacher saw him gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of graying teeth kreacher saw him coming out of kreachers cupboard with his hands full of kreachers treasures kreacher told the sneak thief to stop but mundungus fletcher laughed and 
 
 you called the locket master reguluss said harry why where did it come from what did regulus have to do with it kreacher sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket and everything regulus had to do with it 
 
 the elf sat up curled into a ball placed his wet face between his knees and began to rock backward and forward when he spoke his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent echoing kitchen 
 
 master sirius ran away good riddance for he was a bad boy and broke my mistresss heart with his lawless ways but master regulus had proper order he knew what was due to the name of black and the dignity of his pure blood for years he talked of the dark lord who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the muggles and the and when he was sixteen years old master regulus joined the dark lord so proud so proud so happy to serve 
 
 and one day a year after he joined master regulus came down to the kitchen to see kreacher master regulus always liked kreacher and master regulus said he said 
 
 the old elf rocked faster than ever 
 
 he said that the dark lord required an elf 
 
 voldemort needed an elf harry repeated looking around at ron and hermione who looked just as puzzled as he did 
 
 oh yes moaned kreacher and master regulus had volunteered kreacher it was an honor said master regulus an honor for him and for kreacher who must be sure to do whatever the dark lord ordered him to do and then to home 
 
 kreacher rocked still faster his breath coming in sobs 
 
 so kreacher went to the dark lord the dark lord did not tell kreacher what they were to do but took kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea and beyond the cave was a cavern and in the cavern was a great black lake 
 
 the hairs on the back of harrys neck stood up kreachers croaking voice seemed to come to him from across the dark water he saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present 
 
 there was a boat 
 
 of course there had been a boat harry knew the boat ghostly green and tiny bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center this then was how voldemort had tested the defenses surrounding the horcrux by borrowing a disposable creature a 
 
 there was a full of potion on the island the lord made kreacher drink it 
 
 the elf quaked from head to foot 
 
 kreacher drank and as he drank he saw terrible thing kreachers insides burned kreacher cried for master regulus to save him he cried for his mistress black but the dark lord only laughed he made kreacher drink all the potion he dropped a locket into the empty basin he filled it with more potion 
 
 and then the dark lord sailed away leaving kreacher on the island 
 
 harry could see it happening he watched voldemorts white snakelike face vanishing into darkness those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning poison caused its victim but here harrys imagination could go no further for he could not see how kreacher had escaped 
 
 kreacher needed water he crawled to the islands edge and he drank from the black lake and hands dead hands came out of the water and dragged kreacher under the surface 
 
 how did you get away harry asked and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering 
 
 kreacher raised his ugly head and looked harry with his great bloodshot eyes 
 
 master regulus told kreacher to come back he said 
 
 i know c but how did you escape the inferi 
 
 kreacher did not seem to understand 
 
 master regulus told kreacher to come back he repeated 
 
 i know but c 
 
 well its obvious isnt it harry said ron he disapparated 
 
 but you couldnt apparate in and out of that cave said harry otherwise dumbledore c 
 
 elf magic isnt like wizards magic is it said ron i mean they can apparate and disapparate in and out of hogwarts when we cant 
 
 there was a silence as harry digested this how could voldemort have made such a mistake but even as he thought this hermione spoke and her voice was icy 
 
 of course voldemort would have considered the ways of far beneath his notice it would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didnt 
 
 the highest law is his masters bidding intoned kreacher kreacher was told to come home so kreacher came home 
 
 well then you did what you were told didnt you said hermione kindly you didnt disobey orders at all 
 
 kreacher shook his head rocking as fast as ever 
 
 so what happened when you got back harry asked what did regulus say when you told him what happened 
 
 master regulus was very worried very worried croaked kreacher master regulus told kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house and then it was a little while later master regulus came to find kreacher in his cupboard one night and master regulus was strange not as he usually was disturbed in his mind kreacher could tell and he asked kreacher to take him to the cave the cave where kreacher had gone with the dark lord 
 
 and so they had set off harry could visualize them quite clearly the frightened old elf and the thin dark seeker who had so resembled sirius kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance to the underground cavern knew how to raise the tiny boat this time it was his beloved regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison 
 
 and he made you drink the poison said harry disgusted 
 
 but kreacher shook his head and wept hermiones hands leapt to her mouth she seemed to have understood something 
 
 regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the dark lord had said kreacher tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose and he told kreacher to take it and when the basin was empty to switch the lockets 
 
 kreachers sobs came in great rasps now harry had to concentrate hard to understand him 
 
 and he order c kreacher to leave c without him and he told kreacher c to go home c and never to tell my mistress c what he had done c but to destroy c the first locket and he drank c all the potion c and kreacher swapped the lockets c and watched as master regulus was dragged beneath the water and 
 
 oh kreacher wailed hermione who was crying she dropped to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him at once he was on his feet cringing away from her quite obviously repulsed 
 
 the mudblood touched kreacher he will not allow it what would his mistress say 
 
 i told you not to call her mudblood snarled harry but the elf was already punishing himself he fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor 
 
 stop him c stop him hermione cried oh dont you see now how sick it is the way theyve got to obey 
 
 kreacher c stop stop shouted harry 
 
 the elf lay on the floor panting and shivering green mucus glistening around his snot a bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself his eyes swollen and bloodshot and swimming in tears harry had never seen anything so pitiful 
 
 so you brought the locket home he said relentlessly for he was determined to know the full story and you tried to destroy it 
 
 nothing kreacher did made any mark upon it moaned the elf kreacher tried everything everything he knew but nothing nothing would work so many powerful spells upon the casing kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it but it would not open kreacher punished himself he tried again he punished himself he tried again kreacher failed to obey orders kreacher could not destroy the locket and his mistress was mad with grief because master regulus had disappeared and kreacher could not tell her what had happened no because master regulus had him to tell any of the what happened in the 
 
 kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words tears flowed down hermiones cheeks as she watched kreacher but she did not dare touch him again even ron who was no fan of kreachers looked troubled harry sat back on his heels and shook his head trying to clear it 
 
 i dont understand you kreacher he said finally voldemort tried to kill you regulus died to bring voldemort down but you were still happy to betray sirius to voldemort you were happy to go to narcissa and bellatrix and pass information to voldemort through them 
 
 harry kreacher doesnt think like that said hermione wiping her eyes on the back of her hand hes a slave are used to bad even brutal treatment what voldemort did to kreacher wasnt that far out of the common way what do wizard wars mean to an elf like kreacher hes loyal to people who are kind to him and mrs black must have been and regulus certainly was so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs i know what youre going to say she went on as harry began to protest that regulus changed his mind but he doesnt seem to have explained that to kreacher does he and i think i know why kreacher and reguluss family were all safest if they kept to the old line regulus was trying to protect them all 
 
 sirius c 
 
 sirius was horrible to kreacher harry and its no good looking like that you know its true kreacher had been alone for such a long time when sirius came to live here and he was probably starving for a bit of affection im sure miss cissy and miss bella were perfectly lovely to kreacher when he turned up so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to know ive said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat well voldemort did and so did sirius 
 
 harry had no retort as he watched kreacher sobbing on the floor he remembered what dumbledore had said to him mere hours after siriuss death i do not think sirius ever saw kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a humans 
 
 kreacher said harry after a while when you feel up to it er please sit up 
 
 it was several minutes before kreacher hiccupped himself into silence then he pushed himself into a sitting position again rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child 
 
 kreacher i am going to ask you to do something said harry he glanced at hermione for assistance he wanted to give the order kindly but at the same time he could not pretend that it was not an order however the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval she smiled encouragingly 
 
 kreacher i want you please to go and find mundungus fletcher we need to find out where the locket c where master reguluss locket it its really important we want to finish the work master regulus started we want to c er c ensure that he didnt die in vain 
 
 kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at harry 
 
 find mundungus fletcher he croaked 
 
 and bring him here to grimmauld place said harry do you think you could do that for us 
 
 as kreacher nodded and got to his feet harry had a sudden inspiration he pulled out hagrids purse and took out the fake horcrux the substitute locket in which regulus had placed the note to voldemort 
 
 kreacher id er like you to have this he said pressing the locket into the elfs hand this belonged to regulus and im sure hed want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you c 
 
 overkill mate said ron as the elf took one look at the locket let out a howl of shock and misery and threw himself back onto the ground 
 
 it took them nearly half an hour to calm down kreacher who was so overcome to be presented with a black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly when finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard watched him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets and assured him that they would make its protection their first priority while he was away he then made two low bows to harry and ron and even gave a funny little spasm in hermiones direction that might have been an attempt at a respectful salute before disapparating with the usual loud crack

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 prattle 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 at a rich house there was a party and the 
 children of rich and great people were there the merchant was a 
 learned man for his father had sent him to college and he had passed 
 his examination his father had been at first only a cattle dealer 
 but always honest and industrious so that he had made money and 
 his son the merchant had managed to increase his store clever as he 
 was he had also a heart but there was less said of his heart than of 
 his money all descriptions of people visited at the house 
 well born as well as intellectual and some who possessed neither 
 of these recommendations 
 
 now it was a party and there was prattle 
 which always is spoken freely from the heart among them was a 
 beautiful little girl who was terribly proud but this had been 
 taught her by the servants and not by her parents who were far too 
 sensible people 
 
 her father was groom of the chambers which is a high office at 
 court and she knew it i am a child of the court she said now she 
 might just as well have been a child of the cellar for no one can 
 help his birth and then she told the other children that she was 
 and said that no one who was not could rise in 
 the world it was no use to read and be industrious for if a person 
 was not he could never achieve anything and those whose names end with sen said she can never be anything at all we must put our arms akimbo and make the elbow quite pointed so as to keep these sen people at a great distance and then she stuck out her pretty little arms and made the elbows quite pointed to show how it was to be done and her little arms were very pretty for she was a child 
 
 but the little daughter of the merchant became very angry at 
 this speech for her name was petersen and she knew that the 
 name ended in sen and therefore she said as proudly as she could 
 but my papa can buy a hundred dollars worth of bonbons and give 
 them away to children can your papa do that 
 
 yes and my papa said the little daughter of the editor of a 
 paper my papa can put your papa and papa into the 
 newspaper all sorts of people are afraid of him my mamma says for he can do as he likes with the paper and the little maiden looked 
 exceedingly proud as if she had been a real princess who may be 
 expected to look proud 
 
 but outside the door which stood ajar was a poor boy peeping 
 through the crack of the door he was of such a lowly station that 
 he had not been allowed even to enter the room he had been turning 
 the spit for the cook and she had given him permission to stand 
 behind the door and peep in at the children who were 
 having such a merry time within and for him that was a great deal 
 
 oh if i could be one of them thought he and then he heard what 
 was said about names which was quite enough to make him more unhappy 
 
 his parents at home had not even a penny to spare to buy a 
 newspaper much less could they write in one and worse than all 
 his name and of course his own ended in sen and 
 therefore he could never turn out well which was a very sad 
 thought but after all he had been born into the world and the 
 station of life had been chosen for him therefore he must be content 
 
 and this is what happened on that evening 
 many years passed and most of the children became 
 persons 
 
 there stood a splendid house in the town filled with all kinds of 
 beautiful and valuable objects everybody wished to see it and people even came in from the country round to be permitted to view the treasures it contained 
 
 which of the children whose prattle we have described could 
 call this house his own one would suppose it very easy to guess 
 no no it is not so very easy the house belonged to the poor 
 little boy who had stood on that night behind the door he had 
 really become something great although his name ended in sen 
 for it was thorwaldsen 
 
 and the three other children the children of good birth of 
 money and of intellectual pride well they were respected and 
 honored in the world for they had been well provided for by birth and position and they had no cause to reproach themselves with what they had thought and spoken on that evening long ago for after 
 all it was mere prattle

 marilyn face fills the screen slow pull back reveals 
 the new poster the famous shot from the seven year itch on the subway grate with skirt billowing up andy sits gazing at her as commences 
 int cell night 
 and we find red gazing blankly as darkness takes the cellblock adding up the months weeks days 
 he regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a martian artifact he considers trying it out even holds it briefly to his lips almost embarrassed but puts it back in its box untested and there the harmonica will stay 
 fade to black 
 we hold in blackness as thumping sounds grow louder 
 red 
 andy was as good as his word he kept writing to the state senate 
 two letters a week instead of one 
 and the blackness disintegrates as a wall tumbles before our eyes revealing a work crew with picks and sledgehammers 
 faces obscured with kerchiefs against the dust behind them are guards overseeing the work 
 andy yanks his kerchief down grinning in exhilaration red and the others follow suit they step through the hole in the wall exploring what used to be a storage room 
 red

 book gorbeau hovel 
 chapter v 
 
 a piece falls on the ground and produces a tumult 
 near church there was a poor man who was in the habit of crouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned and on whom jean valjean was fond of bestowing charity 
 he never passed this man without giving him a few sous 
 sometimes he spoke to him those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police he was an of who was constantly mumbling his prayers 
 one evening as jean valjean was passing by when he had not cosette with him he saw the beggar in his usual place beneath the lantern which had just been lighted 
 the man seemed engaged in prayer according to his custom and was much bent over 
 jean valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary alms in his hand the mendicant raised his eyes suddenly stared intently at jean valjean then dropped his head quickly 
 this movement was like a flash of lightning 
 jean valjean was seized with a shudder it seemed to him that he had just caught sight by the light of the street lantern not of the placid and beaming visage of the old beadle but of a and startling face he experienced the same impression that one would have on finding self all of a sudden face to face in the dark with a tiger he recoiled terrified petrified daring neither to breathe to speak to remain nor to flee staring at the beggar who had dropped his head which was enveloped in a rag and no longer appeared to know that he was there 
 at this strange moment an instinct possibly the mysterious instinct of jean valjean from uttering a word 
 the beggar had the same figure the same rags the same appearance as he had every day 
 bah said jean valjean i am mad 
 i am dreaming 
 impossible 
 and he returned profoundly troubled 
 he hardly dared to confess even to himself that the face which he thought he had seen was the face of javert 
 that night on thinking the matter over he regretted not having questioned the man in order to force him to raise his head a second time 
 on the following day at nightfall he went back 
 the beggar was at his post 
 good day my good man said jean valjean resolutely handing him a sou 
 the beggar raised his head and replied in a whining voice thanks my good sir 
 it was unmistakably the 
 jean valjean felt completely reassured 
 he began to laugh how the deuce could i have thought that i saw javert there he thought 
 am i going to lose my eyesight now 
 and he thought no more about it 
 a few days might have been at eight in the was in his room and engaged in making cosette spell aloud when he heard the house door open and then shut again this struck him as singular 
 the old woman who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself always went to bed at nightfall so that she might not burn out her candles 
 jean valjean made a sign to cosette to be quiet 
 he heard some one ascending the stairs it might possibly be the old woman who might have fallen ill and have been out to the jean valjean listened 
 the step was heavy and sounded like that of a man but the old woman wore stout shoes and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the step of a man as that of an old woman 
 nevertheless jean valjean blew out his candle 
 he had sent cosette to bed saying to her in a low voice get into bed very softly and as he kissed her brow the steps paused 
 jean valjean remained silent motionless with his back towards the door seated on the chair from which he had not stirred and holding his breath in the dark 
 after the expiration of a rather long interval he turned round as he heard nothing more and as he raised his eyes towards the door of his chamber he saw a light through the keyhole 
 this light formed a sort of sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall there was evidently some one there who was holding a candle in his hand and listening 
 several minutes elapsed thus and the light retreated 
 but he heard no sound of footsteps which seemed to indicate that the person who had been listening at the door had removed his shoes 
 jean valjean threw himself all dressed as he was on his bed and could not close his eyes all night 
 at daybreak just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the end of the corridor then he heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening the step was approaching 
 he sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole which was tolerably large hoping to see the person who had made his way by night into the house and had listened at his door as he passed 
 it was a man in fact who passed this time without pausing in front of jean chamber 
 the corridor was too dark to allow of the face being distinguished but when the man reached the staircase a ray of light from without made it stand out like a silhouette and jean valjean had a complete view of his back 
 the man was of lofty stature clad in a long with a cudgel under his arm 
 the formidable neck and shoulders belonged to javert 
 jean valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him through his window opening on the boulevard but he would have been obliged to open the window 
 he dared not 
 it was evident that this man had entered with a key and like himself who had given him that key 
 what was the meaning of this 
 when the old woman came to do the work at seven in the morning jean valjean cast a penetrating glance on her but he did not question her 
 the good woman appeared as usual 
 as she swept up she remarked to him 
 possibly monsieur may have heard some one come in last night 
 at that age and on that boulevard eight in the evening was the dead of the night 
 that is true by the way he replied in the most natural tone possible 
 who was it 
 it was a new lodger who has come into the house said the old woman 
 and what is his name 
 i know exactly dumont or daumont or some name of that sort 
 and who is this monsieur dumont 
 the old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes and answered 
 a gentleman of property like yourself 
 perhaps she had no ulterior meaning 
 jean valjean thought he perceived one 
 when the old woman had taken her departure he did up a hundred francs which he had in a cupboard into a roll and put it in his pocket in spite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he might not be heard rattling silver a piece escaped from his hands and rolled noisily on the floor 
 when darkness came on he descended and carefully scrutinized both sides of the boulevard 
 he saw no one 
 the boulevard appeared to be absolutely deserted 
 it is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees 
 he went up stairs again 
 come 
 he said to cosette 
 he took her by the hand and they both went out

 chapter iv 
 
 prince andrew arrived in petersburg in august it was the time when the youthful speranski was at the zenith of his fame and his reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy that same august the emperor was thrown from his caleche injured his leg and remained three weeks at peterhof receiving speranski every day and no one else at that time the two famous decrees were being prepared that so agitated society abolishing court ranks and introducing examinations to qualify for the grades of collegiate assessor and state councilor and not merely these but a whole state constitution intended to change the existing order of government in russia legal administrative and financial from the council of state down to the district tribunals now those vague liberal dreams with which the emperor alexander had ascended the throne and which he had tried to put into effect with the aid of his associates czartoryski novosiltsev kochubey and strogonov whom he himself in jest had called his comite de salut public were taking shape and being realized 
 now all these men were replaced by speranski on the civil side and arakcheev on the military soon after his arrival prince andrew as a gentleman of the chamber presented himself at court and at a levee the emperor though he met him twice did not favor him with a single word it had always seemed to prince andrew before that he was antipathetic to the emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality generally and in the cold repellent glance the emperor gave him he now found further confirmation of this surmise the courtiers explained the neglect of him by his displeasure at not having served since 
 i know myself that one cannot help sympathies and antipathies thought prince andrew so it will not do to present my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the emperor personally but the project will speak for itself 
 he mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal a friend of his the field marshal made an appointment to see him received him graciously and promised to inform the emperor a few days later prince andrew received notice that he was to go to see the minister of war count arakcheev 
 on the appointed day prince andrew entered count waiting room at nine in the morning 
 he did not know arakcheev personally had never seen him and all he had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man 
 he is minister of war a man trusted by the emperor and i need not concern myself about his personal qualities he has been commissioned to consider my project so he alone can get it adopted thought prince andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people in count waiting room 
 during his service chiefly as an adjutant prince andrew had seen the anterooms of many important men and the different types of such rooms were well known to him count anteroom had quite a special character the faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility the faces of those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves their situation and the person for whom they were waiting some walked thoughtfully up and down others whispered and laughed prince andrew heard the nickname sila andreevich and the words uncle will give it to us hot in reference to count arakcheev one general an important personage evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long sat crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself 
 but the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all faces that of fear prince andrew for the second time asked the adjutant on duty to take in his name but received an ironical look and was told that his turn would come in due course after some others had been shown in and out of the room by the adjutant on duty an officer who struck prince andrew by his humiliated and frightened air was admitted at that terrible door this audience lasted a long time then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from the other side of the door and the officer with pale face and trembling lips came out and passed through the waiting room clutching his head 
 after this prince andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on duty said in a whisper to the right at the window 
 prince andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of forty with a long waist a long closely cropped head deep wrinkles scowling brows above dull eyes and an overhanging red nose arakcheev turned his head toward him without looking at him 
 what is your petition asked arakcheev 
 i am not petitioning your excellency returned prince andrew quietly 
 eyes turned toward him 
 sit down said he prince bolkonski 
 i am not petitioning about anything his majesty the emperor has deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me 
 you see my dear sir i have read your project interrupted arakcheev uttering only the first words amiably and then again without looking at prince andrew relapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt you are proposing new military laws there are many laws but no one to carry out the old ones nowadays everybody designs laws it is easier writing than doing 
 i came at his majesty the wish to learn from your excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum i have presented said prince andrew politely 
 i have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the committee i do not approve of it said arakcheev rising and taking a paper from his writing table here and he handed it to prince andrew 
 across the paper was scrawled in pencil without capital letters misspelled and without punctuation unsoundly constructed because resembles an imitation of the french military code and from the articles of war needlessly deviating 
 to what committee has the memorandum been referred inquired prince andrew 
 to the committee on army regulations and i have recommended that your honor should be appointed a member but without a salary 
 prince andrew smiled 
 i want one 
 a member without salary repeated arakcheev i have the honor eh call the next one who else is there he shouted bowing to prince andrew

 book a black hunt a mute pack 
 chapter i 
 
 the zigzags of strategy 
 an observation here becomes necessary in view of the pages which the reader is about to peruse and of others which will be met with further on 
 the author of this book who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself has been absent from paris for many years 
 paris has been transformed since he quitted it 
 a new city has arisen which is after a fashion unknown to him 
 there is no need for him to say that he loves paris paris is his natal city 
 in consequence of demolitions and reconstructions the paris of his youth that paris which he bore away religiously in his memory is now a paris of days gone by he must be permitted to speak of that paris as though it still existed it is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says in such a street there stands such and such a house neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble for his own part he is unacquainted with the new paris and he writes with the old paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him 
 it is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country and that all has not vanished 
 so long as you go and come in your native land you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to you that those windows those roofs and those doors are nothing to you that those walls are strangers to you that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard that those houses which you do not enter are useless to you that the pavements which you tread are merely stones 
 later on when you are no longer there you perceive that the streets are dear to you that you miss those roofs those doors and that those walls are necessary to you those trees are well beloved by you that you entered those houses which you never entered every day and that you have left a part of your heart of your blood of your soul in those pavements 
 all those places which you no longer behold which you may never behold again perchance and whose memory you have cherished take on a melancholy charm recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition make the holy land visible to you and are so to speak the very form of france and you love them and you call them up as they are as they were and you persist in this and you will submit to no change for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother 
 may we then be permitted to speak of the past in the present that said we beg the reader to take note of it and we continue 
 jean valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets taking the most intricate lines which he could devise returning on his track at times to make sure that he was not being followed 
 this manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag 
 on soil where an imprint of the track may be left this manoeuvre possesses among other advantages that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs by throwing them on the wrong scent 
 in venery this is called false 
 the moon was full that night 
 jean valjean was not sorry for this the moon still very close to the horizon cast great masses of light and shadow in the streets 
 jean valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark side and yet keep watch on the light side he did not perhaps take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the dark side escaped him 
 still in the deserted lanes which lie near the rue poliveau he thought he felt certain that no one was following him 
 cosette walked on without asking any questions 
 the sufferings of the first six years of her life had instilled something passive into her nature 
 this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to had grown used without being herself aware of it to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of destiny 
 and then she was with him and she felt safe 
 jean valjean knew no more where he was going than did cosette he trusted in god as she trusted in him 
 it seemed as though he also were clinging to the hand of some one greater than himself he thought he felt a being leading him though invisible however he had no settled idea no plan no project 
 he was not even absolutely sure that it was javert and then it might have been javert without javert knowing that he was jean valjean 
 was not he disguised 
 was not he believed to be dead 
 still queer things had been going on for several days 
 he wanted no more of them he was determined not to return to the gorbeau house 
 like the wild animal chased from its lair he was seeking a hole in which he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell 
 jean valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the mouffetard quarter which was already asleep as though the discipline of the middle ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed he combined in various manners with cunning strategy the rue censier and the rue copeau the rue du and the rue du puits there are lodging houses in this locality but he did not even enter one finding nothing which suited him he had no doubt that if any one had chanced to be upon his track they would have lost it 
 as eleven struck from he was traversing the rue de pontoise in front of the office of the commissary of police situated at no 
 a few moments later the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round at that moment he saw distinctly thanks to the lantern which betrayed them three men who were following him closely pass one after the other under that lantern on the dark side of the street one of the three entered the alley leading to the house the one who marched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious 
 come child he said to cosette and he made haste to quit the rue pontoise 
 he took a circuit turned into the passage des patriarches which was closed on account of the hour strode along the rue de and the rue de and plunged into the rue des postes 
 at that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets where the college rollin stands and where the rue turns off 
 it is understood of course that the rue is an old street and that a does not pass through the rue des postes once in ten years 
 in the thirteenth century this rue des postes was inhabited by potters and its real name is rue des pots 
 the moon cast a livid light into this open space 
 jean valjean went into ambush in a doorway calculating that if the men were still following him he could not fail to get a good look at them as they traversed this illuminated space 
 in point of fact three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their appearance 
 there were four of them now 
 all were tall dressed in long brown coats with round hats and huge cudgels in their hands 
 their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness one would have pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois 
 they halted in the middle of the space and formed a group like men in consultation 
 they had an air of indecision 
 the one who appeared to be their leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the direction which jean valjean had taken another seemed to indicate the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy at the moment when the first man wheeled round the moon fell full in his face 
 jean valjean recognized javert perfectly

 book six 
 chapter v 
 
 while waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee prince andrew looked up his former acquaintances particularly those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need in petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling circles where the future on which the fate of millions depended was being shaped from the irritation of the older men the curiosity of the uninitiated the reserve of the initiated the hurry and preoccupation of everyone and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose existence he learned every day he felt that now in here in petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation the commander in chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know but who was supposed to be a man of genius speranski and this movement of reconstruction of which prince andrew had a vague idea and speranski its chief promoter began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness 
 prince andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the highest and most diverse petersburg circles of the day the reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him the first place because he was reputed to be clever and very well read and secondly because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal the party of the old and dissatisfied who censured the innovations turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms simply because he was the son of his father the feminine society world welcomed him gladly because he was rich distinguished a good match and almost a newcomer with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife besides this the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved during these last five years having softened and grown more manly lost his former affectation pride and contemptuous irony and acquired the serenity that comes with years people talked about him were interested in him and wanted to meet him 
 the day after his interview with count arakcheev prince andrew spent the evening at count he told the count of his interview with sila andreevich kochubey spoke of arakcheev by that nickname with the same vague irony prince andrew had noticed in the minister of anteroom 
 mon cher even in this case you do without michael mikhaylovich speranski he manages everything speak to him he has promised to come this evening 
 what has speranski to do with the army regulations asked prince andrew 
 kochubey shook his head smilingly as if surprised at simplicity 
 we were talking to him about you a few days ago kochubey continued and about your freed plowmen 
 oh is it you prince who have freed your serfs said an old man of day turning contemptuously toward bolkonski 
 it was a small estate that brought in no profit replied prince andrew trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man uselessly 
 afraid of being late said the old man looking at kochubey 
 one thing i understand he continued who will plow the land if they are set free it is easy to write laws but difficult to rule just the same as now i ask you count who will be heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations 
 those who pass the examinations i suppose replied kochubey crossing his legs and glancing round 
 well i have pryanichnikov serving under me a splendid man a priceless man but sixty is he to go up for examination 
 yes a difficulty as education is not at all general but 
 count kochubey did not finish he rose took prince andrew by the arm and went to meet a tall bald fair man of about forty with a large open forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness who was just entering the newcomer wore a blue coat with a cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast it was speranski prince andrew recognized him at once and felt a throb within him as happens at critical moments of life whether it was from respect envy or anticipation he did not know whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable in the society in which prince andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those rather humid eyes or so firm a smile that expressed nothing nor had he heard such a refined smooth soft voice above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands hands which were broad but very plump soft and white such whiteness and softness prince andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in hospital this was speranski secretary of state reporter to the emperor and his companion at erfurt where he had more than once met and talked with napoleon 
 speranski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to speak he spoke slowly with assurance that he would be listened to and he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing 
 prince andrew followed every word and movement with particular attention as happens to some people especially to men who judge those near to them severely he always on meeting anyone new especially anyone whom like speranski he knew by reputation expected to discover in him the perfection of human qualities 
 speranski told kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner as he had been detained at the palace he did not say that the emperor had kept him and prince andrew noticed this affectation of modesty when kochubey introduced prince andrew speranski slowly turned his eyes to bolkonski with his customary smile and looked at him in silence 
 i am very glad to make your acquaintance i had heard of you as everyone has he said after a pause 
 kochubey said a few words about the reception arakcheev had given bolkonski speranski smiled more markedly 
 the chairman of the committee on army regulations is my good friend monsieur magnitski he said fully articulating every word and syllable and if you like i can put you in touch with him he paused at the full stop i hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to in promoting all that is reasonable 
 a circle soon formed round speranski and the old man who had talked about his subordinate pryanichnikov addressed a question to him 
 prince andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement of this man not long since an insignificant divinity student who now bolkonski thought held in his hands those plump white hands the fate of russia prince andrew was struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which speranski answered the old man he appeared to address condescending words to him from an immeasurable height when the old man began to speak too loud speranski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign 
 having talked for a little while in the general circle speranski rose and coming up to prince andrew took him along to the other end of the room it was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in bolkonski 
 i had no chance to talk with you prince during the animated conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me he said with a mildly contemptuous smile as if intimating by that smile that he and prince andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking this flattered prince andrew i have known of you for a long time first from your action with regard to your serfs a first example of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers which is causing so much gossip and 
 no said prince andrew my father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege i began the service from the lower grade 
 your father a man of the last century evidently stands above our contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely reestablishes natural justice 
 i think however that these condemnations have some ground returned prince andrew trying to resist influence of which he began to be conscious he did not like to agree with him in everything and felt a wish to contradict though he usually spoke easily and well he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking with speranski he was too much absorbed in observing the famous personality 
 grounds of personal ambition maybe speranski put in quietly 
 and of state interest to some extent said prince andrew 
 what do you mean asked speranski quietly lowering his eyes 
 i am an admirer of montesquieu replied prince andrew and his idea that le principe des monarchies est me parait incontestable certains droits et privileges de la noblesse me paraissent etre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment 
 the principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable certain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a means of maintaining that sentiment 
 the smile vanished from white face which was much improved by the change probably prince thought interested him 
 si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue he began pronouncing french with evident difficulty and speaking even slower than in russian but quite calmly 
 if you regard the question from that point of view 
 speranski went on to say that honor cannot be upheld by privileges harmful to the service that honor is either a negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards which recognize it his arguments were concise simple and clear 
 an institution upholding honor the source of emulation is one similar to the legion of the great emperor napoleon not harmful but helpful to the success of the service but not a class or court privilege 
 i do not dispute that but it cannot be denied that court privileges have attained the same end returned prince andrew every courtier considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily 
 yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege prince said speranski indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an argument which was embarrassing for his companion if you will do me the honor of calling on me on wednesday he added i will after talking with magnitski let you know what may interest you and shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you 
 closing his eyes he bowed a la francaise without taking leave and trying to attract as little attention as possible he left the room

 book a black hunt a mute pack 
 chapter ii 
 
 it is lucky that the pont bears carriages 
 uncertainty was at an end for jean valjean 
 fortunately it still lasted for the men 
 he took advantage of their hesitation it was time lost for them but gained for him 
 he slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself and went down the rue des postes towards the region of the jardin des plantes 
 cosette was beginning to be tired 
 he took her in his arms and carried her there were no and the street lanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon 
 he redoubled his pace 
 in a few strides he had reached the goblet potteries on the front of which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient inscription 
 
 de goblet fils ici la fabrique 
 venez choisir des cruches et des broos 
 des pots a fleurs des tuyaux de la brique 
 a tout venant le coeur vend des carreaux 
 
 this is the factory of goblet junior 
 come choose your jugs and crocks 
 pipes bricks 
 the heart sells diamonds to every left behind him the rue de la clef then the fountain skirted the jardin des plantes by the lower streets and reached the quay 
 there he turned round 
 the quay was deserted 
 the streets were deserted 
 there was no one behind him 
 he drew a long breath 
 he gained the pont 
 tolls were still collected there at that epoch 
 he presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou 
 it is two sous said the old soldier in charge of the bridge you are carrying a child who can walk 
 pay for two 
 he paid vexed that his passage should have aroused remark every flight should be an imperceptible slipping away 
 a heavy cart was crossing the seine at the same time as himself and on its way like him to the right bank 
 this was of use to him he could traverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart 
 towards the middle of the bridge cosette whose feet were benumbed wanted to walk 
 he set her on the ground and took her hand again 
 the bridge once crossed he perceived some on his right he directed his course thither 
 in order to reach them it was necessary to risk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered and illuminated space 
 he did not hesitate 
 those who were on his track had evidently lost the scent and jean valjean believed himself to be out of danger 
 hunted yes followed no 
 a little street the rue du opened out between two enclosed in walls 
 this street was dark and narrow and seemed made expressly for him 
 before entering it he cast a glance behind him 
 from the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the pont 
 four shadows were just entering on the bridge 
 these shadows had their backs turned to the jardin des plantes and were on their way to the right bank 
 these four shadows were the four men 
 jean valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured 
 one hope remained to him it was that the men had not perhaps stepped on the bridge and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing the large illuminated space holding cosette by the hand 
 in that case by plunging into the little street before him he might escape if he could reach the the marshes the the uninhabited ground which was not built upon 
 it seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little street 
 he entered it

 book six 
 chapter vi 
 
 during the first weeks of his stay in petersburg prince andrew felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city 
 on returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours the mechanism of life the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere absorbed the greater part of his vital energy he did nothing did not even think or find time to think but only talked and talked successfully of what he had thought while in the country 
 he sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same remark on the same day in different circles but he was so busy for whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing 
 as he had done on their first meeting at speranski produced a strong impression on prince andrew on the wednesday when he received him at his own house and talked to him long and confidentially 
 to bolkonski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant creatures and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that perfection toward which he strove that he readily believed that in speranski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous man had speranski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed the same breeding and traditions bolkonski would soon have discovered his weak human unheroic sides but as it was strange and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he did not quite understand him moreover speranski either because he appreciated the capacity or because he considered it necessary to win him to his side showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness before prince andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which goes hand in hand with and consists in a tacit assumption that companion is the only man besides oneself capable of understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness and profundity of own ideas 
 during their long conversation on wednesday evening speranski more than once remarked we regard everything that is above the common level of rooted custom or with a smile but we want the wolves to be fed and the sheep to be safe or they cannot understand this and all in a way that seemed to say we you and i understand what they are and who we are 
 this first long conversation with speranski only strengthened in prince andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting he saw in him a remarkable man of vast intellect who by his energy and persistence had attained power which he was using solely for the welfare of russia in prince eyes speranski was the man he would himself have wished to be one who explained all the facts of life reasonably considered important only what was rational and was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything everything seemed so simple and clear in exposition that prince andrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything if he replied and argued it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and not submit to opinions entirely everything was right and everything was as it should be only one thing disconcerted prince andrew this was cold mirrorlike look which did not allow one to penetrate to his soul and his delicate white hands which prince andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those who possess power this mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritated prince andrew he knew not why he was unpleasantly struck too by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in speranski and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions he made use of every kind of mental device except analogy and passed too boldly it seemed to prince andrew from one to another now he would take up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers now that of a satirist and laugh ironically at his opponents now grow severely logical or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics this last resource was one he very frequently employed he would transfer a question to metaphysical heights pass on to definitions of space time and thought and having deduced the refutation he needed would again descend to the level of the original discussion 
 in general the trait of mentality which struck prince andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority of reason it was evident that the thought could never occur to him which to prince andrew seemed so natural namely that it is after all impossible to express all one thinks and that he had never felt the doubt is not all i think and believe nonsense and it was just this peculiarity of mind that particularly attracted prince andrew 
 during the first period of their acquaintance bolkonski felt a passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for bonaparte the fact that speranski was the son of a village priest and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his humble origin as in fact many did caused prince andrew to cherish his sentiment for him the more and unconsciously to strengthen it 
 on that first evening bolkonski spent with him having mentioned the commission for the revision of the code of laws speranski told him sarcastically that the commission had existed for a hundred and fifty years had cost millions and had done nothing except that rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes 
 and that is all the state has for the millions it has spent said he we want to give the senate new juridical powers but we have no laws that is why it is a sin for men like you prince not to serve in these times 
 prince andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was needed which he did not possess 
 but nobody possesses it so what would you have it is a vicious circle from which we must break a way out 
 a week later prince andrew was a member of the committee on army regulations and what he had not at all expected was chairman of a section of the committee for the revision of the laws at request he took the first part of the civil code that was being drawn up and with the aid of the code napoleon and the institutes of justinian he worked at formulating the section on personal rights

 to wit the plan of paris in 
 three hundred paces further on he arrived at a point where the street forked 
 it separated into two streets which ran in a slanting line one to the right and the other to the left 
 jean valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a y which should he choose 
 he did not hesitate but took the one on the right 
 why 
 because that to the left ran towards a suburb that is to say towards inhabited regions and the right branch towards the open country that is to say towards deserted regions 
 however they no longer walked very fast 
 pace retarded jean 
 he took her up and carried her again 
 cosette laid her head on the shoulder of the good man and said not a word 
 he turned round from time to time and looked behind him he took care to keep always on the dark side of the street the street was straight in his rear 
 the first two or three times that he turned round he saw nothing the silence was profound and he continued his march somewhat reassured 
 all at once on turning round he thought he perceived in the portion of the street which he had just passed through far off in the obscurity something which was moving 
 he rushed forward precipitately rather than walked hoping to find some to make his escape through it and thus to break his scent once more 
 he arrived at a wall 
 this wall however did not absolutely prevent further progress it was a wall which bordered a transverse street in which the one he had taken ended 
 here again he was obliged to come to a decision should he go to the right or to the left 
 he glanced to the right 
 the fragmentary lane was prolonged between buildings which were either sheds or barns then ended at a blind alley 
 the extremity of the was distinctly visible a lofty white wall 
 he glanced to the left 
 on that side the lane was open and about two hundred paces further on ran into a street of which it was the affluent 
 on that side lay safety 
 at the moment when jean valjean was meditating a turn to the left in an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane he perceived a sort of motionless black statue at the corner of the lane and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps 
 it was some one a man who had evidently just been posted there and who was barring the passage and waiting 
 jean valjean recoiled 
 the point of paris where jean valjean found himself situated between the faubourg and la rapee is one of those which recent improvements have transformed from top to bottom resulting in disfigurement according to some and in a transfiguration according to others 
 the the and the old buildings have been effaced 
 there are wide streets arenas circuses hippodromes railway stations and a prison mazas there progress as the reader sees with its antidote 
 half a century ago in that ordinary popular tongue which is all compounded of traditions which persists in calling the institut les and the feydeau the precise spot whither jean valjean had arrived was called le petit picpus the porte the porte paris the barriere des sergents the porcherons la galiote les celestins les capucins le mail la bourbe de cracovie la are the names of old paris which survive amid the new 
 the memory of the populace hovers over these relics of the past 
 le which moreover hardly ever had any existence and never was more than the outline of a quarter had nearly the monkish aspect of a spanish town 
 the roads were not much paved the streets were not much built up 
 with the exception of the two or three streets of which we shall presently speak all was wall and solitude there 
 not a shop not a vehicle hardly a candle lighted here and there in the windows all lights extinguished after ten gardens convents marshes occasional lowly dwellings and great walls as high as the houses 
 such was this quarter in the last century 
 the revolution snubbed it soundly 
 the republican government demolished and cut through it rubbish shoots were established there 
 thirty years ago this quarter was disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings it has been utterly blotted out 
 the of which no existing plan has preserved a trace is indicated with sufficient clearness in the plan of published at paris by denis thierry rue opposite the rue du platre and at lyons by jean girin rue merciere at the sign of prudence had as we have just mentioned a y of streets formed by the rue du which spread out in two branches taking on the left the name of little picpus street and on the right the name of the rue polonceau the two limbs of the y were connected at the apex as by a bar this bar was called rue the rue polonceau ended there rue passed on and ascended towards the lenoir market a person coming from the seine reached the extremity of the rue polonceau and had on his right the rue turning abruptly at a right angle in front of him the wall of that street and on his right a truncated prolongation of the rue which had no issue and was called the genrot 
 it was here that jean valjean stood 
 as we have just said on catching sight of that black silhouette standing on guard at the angle of the rue and the rue he recoiled 
 there could be no doubt of it that phantom was lying in wait for him 
 what was he to do 
 the time for retreating was passed 
 that which he had perceived in movement an instant before in the distant darkness was javert and his squad without a doubt 
 javert was probably already at the commencement of the street at whose end jean valjean stood javert to all appearances was acquainted with this little labyrinth and had taken his precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit 
 these surmises which so closely resembled proofs whirled suddenly like a handful of dust caught up by an unexpected gust of wind through jean mournful brain he examined the genrot there he was cut off he examined the rue there stood a sentinel 
 he saw that black form standing out in relief against the white pavement illuminated by the moon to advance was to fall into this hands to retreat was to fling himself into arms 
 jean valjean felt himself caught as in a net which was slowly contracting he gazed heavenward in despair

 chapter vii 
 
 nearly two years before this in pierre on returning to petersburg after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading position among the petersburg freemasons he arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings enrolled new members and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic charters he gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular he supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in petersburg 
 his life meanwhile continued as before with the same infatuations and dissipations he liked to dine and drink well and though he considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the bachelor circles in which he moved 
 amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions however pierre at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest upon it the more masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him at the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order when he had joined the freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently steps onto the smooth surface of a bog when he put his foot down it sank in to make quite sure of the firmness the ground he put his other foot down and sank deeper still became stuck in it and involuntarily waded in the bog 
 joseph alexeevich was not in petersburg he had of late stood aside from the affairs of the petersburg lodges and lived almost entirely in moscow all the members of the lodges were men pierre knew in ordinary life and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as brothers in freemasonry and not as prince b or ivan vasilevich d whom he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men under the masonic aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in ordinary life often after collecting alms and reckoning up twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozen members of whom half were as well able to pay as himself pierre remembered the masonic vow in which each brother promised to devote all his belongings to his neighbor and doubts on which he tried not to dwell arose in his soul 
 he divided the brothers he knew into four categories in the first he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges or in human affairs but were exclusively occupied with the mystical science of the order with questions of the threefold designation of god the three primordial elements sulphur mercury and salt or the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of solomon pierre respected this class of brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged including pierre thought joseph alexeevich himself but he did not share their interests his heart was not in the mystical aspect of freemasonry 
 in the second category pierre reckoned himself and others like him seeking and vacillating who had not yet found in freemasonry a straight and comprehensible path but hoped to do so 
 in the third category he included those brothers the majority who saw nothing in freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance such were willarski and even the grand master of the principal lodge 
 finally to the fourth category also a great many brothers belonged particularly those who had lately joined these according to observations were men who had no belief in anything nor desire for anything but joined the freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young brothers who were influential through their connections or rank and of whom there were very many in the lodge 
 pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing freemasonry at any rate as he saw it here sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals he did not think of doubting freemasonry itself but suspected that russian masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles and so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order 
 in the summer of pierre returned to petersburg our freemasons knew from correspondence with those abroad that bezukhov had obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons had been initiated into many mysteries had been raised to a higher grade and was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the advantage of the masonic cause in russia the petersburg freemasons all came to see him tried to ingratiate themselves with him and it seemed to them all that he was preparing something for them and concealing it 
 a solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened at which pierre promised to communicate to the petersburg brothers what he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order the meeting was a full one after the usual ceremonies pierre rose and began his address 
 dear brothers he began blushing and stammering with a written speech in his hand it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in the seclusion of our lodge we must act act we are drowsing but we must act pierre raised his notebook and began to read 
 for the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of virtue he read we must cleanse men from prejudice diffuse principles in harmony with the spirit of the times undertake the education of the young unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the wisest men boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions infidelity and folly and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity of purpose and possessed of authority and power 
 to attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may even in this world receive a lasting reward for his virtue but in these great endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today what is to be done in these circumstances to favor revolutions overthrow everything repel force by force no we are very far from that every violent reform deserves censure for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are and also because wisdom needs no violence 
 the whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of conviction aiming at the punishment of vice and folly and patronizing talent and virtue raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our brotherhood only then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to control them without their being aware of it in a word we must found a form of government holding universal sway which should be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship and beside which all other governments can continue in their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice this aim was that of christianity itself it taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest men 
 at that time when everything was plunged in darkness preaching alone was of course sufficient the novelty of truth endowed her with special strength but now we need much more powerful methods it is now necessary that man governed by his senses should find in virtue a charm palpable to those senses it is impossible to eradicate the passions but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim and it is therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions within the limits of virtue our order should provide means to that end 
 as soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state each of them again training two others and all being closely united everything will be possible for our order which has already in secret accomplished much for the welfare of mankind 
 this speech not only made a strong impression but created excitement in the lodge the majority of the brothers seeing in it dangerous designs of illuminism met it with a coldness that surprised pierre the grand master began answering him and pierre began developing his views with more and more warmth it was long since there had been so stormy a meeting parties were formed some accusing pierre of illuminism others supporting him at that meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of minds which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself identically to two persons even those members who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with limitations and alterations he could not agree to as what he always wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it 
 the illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical institutions 
 at the end of the meeting the grand master with irony and reproved bezukhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue alone but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would be accepted he was told that it would not and without waiting for the usual formalities he left the lodge and went home

 the gropings of flight 
 in order to understand what follows it is requisite to form an exact idea of the lane and in particular of the angle which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the rue polonceau into this lane 
 lane was almost entirely bordered on the right as far as the rue by houses of mean aspect on the left by a solitary building of severe outlines composed of numerous parts which grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the rue side so that this building which was very lofty on the rue side was tolerably low on the side adjoining the rue polonceau 
 there at the angle of which we have spoken it descended to such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall 
 this wall did not abut directly on the street it formed a deeply retreating niche concealed by its two corners 
 from two observers who might have been one in the rue polonceau the other in the rue 
 beginning with these angles of the niche the wall extended along the rue polonceau as far as a house which bore the number and along the rue where the fragment was much shorter as far as the gloomy building which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected thus forming another retreating angle in the street this gable was sombre of aspect only one window was visible or to speak more correctly two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed 
 the state of the places of which we are here giving a description is rigorously exact and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the mind of old inhabitants of the quarter 
 the niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and wretched door it was a vast formless assemblage of perpendicular planks the upper ones being broader than the lower bound together by long transverse strips of iron at one side there was a carriage gate of the ordinary dimensions and which had evidently not been cut more than fifty years previously 
 a showed its crest above the niche and the wall was covered with ivy on the side of the rue polonceau 
 in the imminent peril in which jean valjean found himself this sombre building had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him 
 he ran his eyes rapidly over it he said to himself that if he could contrive to get inside it he might save himself first he conceived an idea then a hope 
 in the central portion of the front of this building on the rue side there were at all the windows of the different stories ancient cistern pipes of lead 
 the various branches of the pipes which led from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort of tree on the front 
 these ramifications of pipes with their hundred elbows imitated those old leafless which writhe over the fronts of old 
 this odd espalier with its branches of lead and iron was the first thing that struck jean valjean 
 he seated cosette with her back against a stone post with an injunction to be silent and ran to the spot where the conduit touched the pavement perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it and entering the house but the pipe was dilapidated and past service and hardly hung to its fastenings 
 moreover all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars even the attic windows in the roof and then the moon fell full upon that facade and the man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen jean valjean in the act of climbing 
 and finally what was to be done with cosette how was she to be drawn up to the top of a house 
 he gave up all idea of climbing by means of the and crawled along the wall to get back into the rue polonceau 
 when he reached the slant of the wall where he had left cosette he noticed that no one could see him there 
 as we have just explained he was concealed from all eyes no matter from which direction they were approaching besides this he was in the shadow finally there were two doors perhaps they might be forced the wall above which he saw the and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could at least hide himself although there were as yet no leaves on the trees and spend the remainder of the night 
 time was passing he must act quickly 
 he felt over the carriage door and immediately recognized the fact that it was impracticable outside and in 
 he approached the other door with more hope it was frightfully decrepit its very immensity rendered it less solid the planks were rotten the iron were only three of rusted 
 it seemed as though it might be possible to pierce this barrier 
 on examining it he found that the door was not a door it had neither hinges lock nor fissure in the middle the iron bands traversed it from side to side without any break through the crevices in the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone roughly cemented together which might still have seen there ten years ago 
 he was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against which it was placed it was easy to tear off a plank but then one found self face to face with a wall

 chapter viii 
 
 again pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded for three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere 
 it was just then that he received a letter from his wife who implored him to see her telling him how grieved she was about him and how she wished to devote her whole life to him 
 at the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would return to petersburg from abroad 
 following this letter one of the masonic brothers whom pierre respected less than the others forced his way in to see him and turning the conversation upon matrimonial affairs by way of fraternal advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of freemasonry by not forgiving the penitent 
 at the same time his prince wife sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife and in the mood he then was this was not even unpleasant to him nothing mattered to him nothing in life seemed to him of much importance and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife 
 no one is right and no one is to blame so she too is not to blame he thought 
 if he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step had his wife come to him he would not have turned her away compared to what preoccupied him was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not 
 without replying either to his wife or his pierre late one night prepared for a journey and started for moscow to see joseph alexeevich this is what he noted in his diary 
 moscow th november 
 i have just returned from my benefactor and hasten to write down what i have experienced joseph alexeevich is living poorly and has for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder no one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint from morning till late at night except when he eats his very plain food he is working at science he received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay i made the sign of the knights of the east and of jerusalem and he responded in the same manner asking me with a mild smile what i had learned and gained in the prussian and scottish lodges i told him everything as best i could and told him what i had proposed to our petersburg lodge of the bad reception i had encountered and of my rupture with the brothers joseph alexeevich having remained silent and thoughtful for a good while told me his view of the matter which at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path i should follow he surprised me by asking whether i remembered the threefold aim of the order the preservation and study of the mystery the purification and reformation of oneself for its reception and the improvement of the human race by striving for such purification which is the principal aim of these three certainly and only to this aim can we always strive independently of circumstances but at the same time just this aim demands the greatest efforts of us and so led astray by pride losing sight of this aim we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our impurity we are unworthy to receive or seek the reformation of the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and profligacy illuminism is not a pure doctrine just because it is attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride on this ground joseph alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity and in the depth of my soul i agreed with him talking of my family affairs he said to me the chief duty of a true mason as i have told you lies in perfecting himself we often think that by removing all the difficulties of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim but on the contrary my dear sir it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain our three chief aims for man can only know himself by comparison which can only be attained by conflict and the attainment of the chief virtue love of death only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life these words are all the more remarkable because in spite of his great physical sufferings joseph alexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death for which in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man he does not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared my benefactor then explained to me fully the meaning of the great square of creation and pointed out to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything he advised me not to avoid intercourse with the petersburg brothers but to take up only posts in the lodge to try while diverting the brothers from pride to turn them toward the true path and besides this he advised me for myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself and to that end he gave me a notebook the one i am now writing in and in which i will in future note down all my actions 
 petersburg rd november 
 i am again living with my wife my came to me in tears and said that helene was here and that she implored me to hear her that she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion and much more i knew that if i once let myself see her i should not have strength to go on refusing what she wanted in my perplexity i did not know whose aid and advice to seek had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do i went to my room and reread joseph letters and recalled my conversations with him and deduced from it all that i ought not to refuse a suppliant and ought to reach a helping hand to everyone especially to one so closely bound to me and that i must bear my cross but if i forgive her for the sake of doing right then let union with her have only a spiritual aim that is what i decided and what i wrote to joseph alexeevich i told my wife that i begged her to forget the past to forgive me whatever wrong i may have done her and that i had nothing to forgive it gave me joy to tell her this she need not know how hard it was for me to see her again i have settled on the upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of regeneration

 which would be impossible with gas lanterns 
 at that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some distance 
 jean valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street 
 seven or eight soldiers drawn up in a platoon had just debouched into the rue polonceau 
 he saw the gleam of their bayonets 
 they were advancing towards him these soldiers at whose head he distinguished tall figure advanced slowly and cautiously 
 they halted frequently it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of the walls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys 
 this was some patrol that javert had could be no mistake as to this whose aid he had demanded 
 two acolytes were marching in their ranks 
 at the rate at which they were marching and in consideration of the halts which they were making it would take them about a quarter of an hour to reach the spot where jean valjean stood it was a frightful moment 
 a few minutes only separated jean valjean from that terrible precipice which yawned before him for the third time 
 and the galleys now meant not only the galleys but cosette lost to him forever that is to say a life resembling the interior of a tomb 
 there was but one thing which was possible 
 jean valjean had this peculiarity that he carried as one might say two pouches 
 in one he kept his saintly thoughts in the other the redoubtable talents of a convict 
 he rummaged in the one or the other according to circumstances 
 among his other resources thanks to his numerous escapes from the prison at toulon he was as it will be remembered a past master in the incredible art of crawling up without ladder or by sheer muscular force by leaning on the nape of his neck his shoulders his hips and his knees by helping himself on the rare projections of the stone in the right angle of a wall as high as the sixth story if need be an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of the wall of the conciergerie of paris by which battemolle condemned to death made his escape twenty years ago 
 jean valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the linden it was about eighteen feet in height 
 the angle which it formed with the gable of the large building was filled at its lower extremity by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape probably intended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the this practice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use in paris 
 this mass was about five feet in height the space above the summit of this mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen feet 
 the wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping 
 cosette was the difficulty for she did not know how to climb a wall should he abandon her 
 jean valjean did not once think of that it was impossible to carry her 
 a whole strength is required to successfully carry out these singular ascents 
 the least burden would disturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards 
 a rope would have been required jean valjean had none 
 where was he to get a rope at midnight in the rue polonceau 
 certainly if jean valjean had had a kingdom he would have given it for a rope at that moment 
 all extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes dazzle sometimes illuminate us 
 jean despairing glance fell on the street of the blind alley genrot 
 at that epoch there were no in the streets of paris at nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted they were ascended and descended by means of a rope which traversed the street from side to side and was adjusted in a groove of the post the pulley over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box the key to which was kept by the and the rope itself was protected by a metal case 
 jean valjean with the energy of a supreme struggle crossed the street at one bound entered the blind alley broke the latch of the little box with the point of his knife and an instant later he was beside cosette once more 
 he had a rope 
 these gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidly when they are fighting against fatality 
 we have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that night 
 the lantern in the genrot was thus naturally extinct like the rest and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was no longer in its place 
 nevertheless the hour the place the darkness jean absorption his singular gestures his goings and comings all had begun to render cosette uneasy 
 any other child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks long before 
 she contented herself with plucking jean valjean by the skirt of his coat 
 they could hear the sound of the approach ever more and more distinctly 
 father said she in a very low voice i am afraid 
 who is coming yonder 
 hush replied the unhappy man it is madame thenardier 
 cosette shuddered 
 he added 
 say nothing 
 interfere with me 
 if you cry out if you weep the thenardier is lying in wait for you 
 she is coming to take you back 
 then without haste but without making a useless movement with firm and curt precision the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and javert might come upon him at any moment he undid his cravat passed it round body under the armpits taking care that it should not hurt the child fastened this cravat to one end of the rope by means of that knot which seafaring men call a swallow knot took the other end of the rope in his teeth pulled off his shoes and stockings which he threw over the wall stepped upon the mass of masonry and began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as much solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his feet and elbows half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall 
 cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement without uttering a word jean injunction and the name of madame thenardier had chilled her blood 
 all at once she heard jean voice crying to her though in a very low tone 
 put your back against the wall 
 she obeyed 
 say a word and be alarmed went on jean valjean 
 and she felt herself lifted from the ground 
 before she had time to recover herself she was on the top of the wall 
 jean valjean grasped her put her on his back took her two tiny hands in his large left hand lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along on top of the wall as far as the cant 
 as he had guessed there stood a building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and descended to within a very short distance of the ground with a gentle slope which grazed the a lucky circumstance 
 for the wall was much higher on this side than on the street side jean valjean could only see the ground at a great depth below him 
 he had just reached the slope of the roof and had not yet left the crest of the wall when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the patrol 
 the thundering voice of javert was audible 
 search the blind alley 
 the rue is guarded so is the rue answer for it that he is in the blind alley 
 the soldiers rushed into the genrot alley 
 jean valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof still holding fast to cosette reached the and leaped to the ground whether from terror or courage cosette had not breathed a sound though her hands were a little abraded

 book six 
 chapter ix 
 
 at that time as always happens the highest society that met at court and at the grand balls was divided into several circles each with its own particular tone the largest of these was the french circle of the napoleonic alliance the circle of count rumyantsev and caulaincourt in this group helene as soon as she had settled in petersburg with her husband took a very prominent place she was visited by the members of the french embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for their intellect and polished manners 
 helene had been at erfurt during the famous meeting of the emperors and had brought from there these connections with the napoleonic notabilities at erfurt her success had been brilliant napoleon himself had noticed her in the theater and said of her un superbe animal her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise pierre for she had become even handsomer than before what did surprise him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded in gaining the reputation d une femme charmante aussi spirituelle que belle the distinguished prince de ligne wrote her letters bilibin saved up his epigrams to produce them in countess presence to be received in the countess salon was regarded as a diploma of intellect young men read books before attending evenings to have something to say in her salon and secretaries of the embassy and even ambassadors confided diplomatic secrets to her so that in a way helene was a power pierre who knew she was very stupid sometimes attended with a strange feeling of perplexity and fear her evenings and dinner parties where politics poetry and philosophy were discussed at these parties his feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick to be found out at any moment but whether because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a salon or because those who were deceived found pleasure in the deception at any rate it remained unexposed and helene reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception 
 a superb animal 
 of a charming woman as witty as she is lovely 
 pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman he was that crank a grand seigneur husband who was in no way and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the drawing room he served by the contrast he presented to her as an advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife pierre during the last two years as a result of his continual absorption in abstract interests and his sincere contempt for all else had acquired in his circle which did not interest him that air of unconcern indifference and benevolence toward all which cannot be acquired artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect he entered his drawing room as one enters a theater was acquainted with everybody equally pleased to see everyone and equally indifferent to them all sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him and regardless of whether any gentlemen of the embassy were present or not lispingly expressed his views which were sometimes not at all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment but the general opinion concerning the queer husband of the most distinguished woman in petersburg was so well established that no one took his freaks seriously 
 among the many young men who frequented her house every day boris drubetskoy who had already achieved great success in the service was the most intimate friend of the bezukhov household since return from erfurt helene spoke of him as mon page and treated him like a child her smile for him was the same as for everybody but sometimes that smile made pierre uncomfortable toward him boris behaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference this shade of deference also disturbed pierre he had suffered so painfully three years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition first by not being a husband to his wife and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect 
 no now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced her former infatuations he told himself there has never been an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the heart a statement which though gathered from an unknown source he believed implicitly yet strange to say boris presence in his drawing room and he was almost always there had a physical effect upon pierre it constricted his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom of his movements 
 what a strange antipathy thought pierre yet i used to like him very much 
 in the eyes of the world pierre was a great gentleman the rather blind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife a clever crank who did nothing but harmed nobody and was a fellow but a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place all this time in soul revealing much to him and causing him many spiritual doubts and joys

 book a black hunt a mute pack 
 chapter vi 
 
 the beginning of an enigma 
 jean valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and of singular aspect one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to be looked at in winter and at night 
 this garden was oblong in shape with an alley of large poplars at the further end tolerably tall forest trees in the corners and an unshaded space in the centre where could be seen a very large solitary tree then several gnarled and bristling like bushes beds of vegetables a melon patch whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight and an old well here and there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss the alleys were bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs the grass had half taken possession of them and a green mould covered the rest 
 jean valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a means of descent a pile of fagots and behind the fagots directly against the wall a stone statue whose mutilated face was no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the gloom 
 the building was a sort of ruin where dismantled chambers were distinguishable one of which much encumbered seemed to serve as a shed 
 the large building of the rue which had a wing on the rue turned two facades at right angles towards this garden these interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior all the windows were grated 
 not a gleam of light was visible at any one of them 
 the upper story had scuttles like prisons one of those facades cast its shadow on the other which fell over the garden like an immense black pall 
 no other house was visible 
 the bottom of the garden was lost in mist and darkness 
 nevertheless walls could be confusedly made out which intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond and the low roofs of the rue polonceau 
 nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined there was no one in it which was quite natural in view of the hour but it did not seem as though this spot were made for any one to walk in even in broad daylight 
 jean first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put them on again then to step under the shed with cosette a man who is fleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden the child whose thoughts were still on the thenardier shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible 
 cosette trembled and pressed close to him 
 they heard the tumultuous noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets the blows of their against the stones appeals to the police spies whom he had posted and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be distinguished 
 at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that species of stormy roar were becoming more distant 
 jean valjean held his breath 
 he had laid his hand lightly on mouth 
 however the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm that this frightful uproar close and furious as it was did not disturb him by so much as the shadow of a misgiving it seemed as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones of which the scriptures speak 
 all at once in the midst of this profound calm a fresh sound arose a sound as celestial divine ineffable ravishing as the other had been horrible 
 it was a hymn which issued from the gloom a dazzling burst of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night voices but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children voices which are not of the earth and which resemble those that the newborn infant still hears and which the dying man hears already this song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden 
 at the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated one would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom 
 cosette and jean valjean fell on their knees 
 they knew not what it was they knew not where they were but both of them the man and the child the penitent and the innocent felt that they must kneel 
 these voices had this strange characteristic that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted it was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house 
 while these voices were singing jean valjean thought of nothing he no longer beheld the night he beheld a blue sky 
 it seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us unfolding 
 the song died away 
 it may have lasted a long time 
 jean valjean could not have told 
 hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment 
 all fell silent again 
 there was no longer anything in the street there was nothing in the garden 
 that which had menaced that which had reassured had vanished 
 the breeze swayed a few dry weeds on the crest of the wall and they gave out a faint sweet melancholy sound
