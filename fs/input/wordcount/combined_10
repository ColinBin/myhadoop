 no one in gryffindor tower slept that night they knew that the castle was being searched again and the whole house stayed awake in the common room waiting to hear whether black had been caught professor mcgonagall came back at dawn to tell them that he had again escaped 
 
 throughout the day everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security professor flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of sirius black filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes sir cadogan had been fired his portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor and the fat lady was back she had been expertly restored but was still extremely nervous and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection a bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her they paced the corridor in a menacing group talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs 
 
 harry help noticing that the statue of the witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked it seemed that fred and george had been right in thinking that they and now harry ron and hermione were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it 
 
 reckon we should tell someone harry asked ron 
 
 we know not coming in through said ron dismissively heard if the shop had been broken into 
 
 harry was glad ron took this view if the witch was boarded up too he would never be able to go into hogsmeade again 
 
 ron had become an instant celebrity for the first time in his life people were paying more attention to him than to harry and it was clear that ron was rather enjoying the experience though still severely shaken by the events he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened with a wealth of detail 
 
 i was asleep and i heard this ripping noise and i thought it was in my dream you know but then there was this drafti woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled downi rolled overand i saw him standing over melike a skeleton with loads of filthy hairholding this great long knife been twelve inchesand he looked at me and i looked at him and then i yelled and he scampered 
 
 why though ron added to harry as the group of second year girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed why did he run 
 
 harry had been wondering the same thing why had black having got the wrong bed not silenced ron and proceeded to harry black had proved twelve years ago that he mind murdering innocent people and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys four of whom were asleep 
 
 he known have a job getting back out of the castle once yelled and woken people up said harry thoughtfully had to kill the whole house to get back through the portrait holethen he met the teachers 
 
 neville was in total disgrace professor mcgonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future hogsmeade visits given him a detention and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower poor neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him none of these punishments however came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him two days after she sent neville the very worst thing a hogwarts student could receive over breakfast a howler 
 
 the school owls swooped into the great hall carrying the mail as usual and neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak harry and ron who were sitting opposite him recognized the letter as a howler at once ron had got one from his mother the year before 
 
 run for it neville ron advised 
 
 neville need telling twice he seized the envelope and holding it before him like a bomb sprinted out of the hall while the slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him they heard the howler go off in the entrance hall voice magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family 
 
 harry was too busy feeling sorry for neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist 
 
 ouch oh thanks hedwig 
 
 harry tore open the envelope while hedwig helped herself to some of cornflakes the note inside said 
 
 dear harry and ron 
 how about having tea with me this afternoon round six come collect you from the castle wait for me in the entrance hall not allowed out on your own 
 cheers 
 hagrid 
 he probably wants to hear all about black said ron 
 
 so at six that afternoon harry and ron left gryffindor tower passed the security trolls at a run and headed down to the entrance hall 
 
 hagrid was already waiting for them 
 
 all right hagrid said ron you want to hear about saturday night do you 
 
 already heard all abou it said hagrid opening the front doors and leading them outside 
 
 oh said ron looking slightly put out 
 
 the first thing they saw on entering cabin was buckbeak who was stretched out on top of patchwork quilt his enormous wings folded tight to his body enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight harry saw a gigantic hairy brown suit and a very horrible tie hanging from the top of wardrobe door 
 
 what are they for hagrid said harry 
 
 case against the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures said hagrid this friday him an be goin down ter london together booked two beds on the knight bus 
 
 harry felt a nasty pang of guilt he had completely forgotten that trial was so near and judging by the uneasy look on face he had too they had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare defense the arrival of the firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds 
 
 hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of bath buns but they knew better than to accept they had had too much experience with cooking 
 
 i got somethin ter discuss with you two said hagrid sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious 
 
 what said harry 
 
 hermione said hagrid 
 
 what about her said ron 
 
 in a righ state what bin comin down ter visit me a lot since bin feelin lonely firs yeh weren talking to her because o the firebolt now yer not talkin to her because her cat 
 
 c ate scabbers ron interjected angrily 
 
 because her cat acted like all cats do hagrid continued doggedly cried a fair few times yeh know goin through a rough time at the moment bitten off she can chew if yeh ask me all the work tryin ter do still found time ter help me with case found some really good stuff fer mereckon stand a good chance now 
 
 hagrid we helped as well sorry harry began awkwardly 
 
 not blamin yeh said hagrid waving apology aside gawd knows had enough ter be getting on with seen yeh practicin quidditch hour o the day an night but i gotta tell yeh i thought you value yer friend broomsticks or rats all 
 
 harry and ron exchanged uncomfortable looks 
 
 really upset she was when black nearly stabbed yeh ron got her heart in the right place hermione has an you two not talkin to her 
 
 if just get rid of that cat speak to her again ron said angrily but still sticking up for it a maniac and she hear a word against it 
 
 ah well people can be a bit stupid abou their pets said hagrid wisely behind him buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto pillow 
 
 they spent the rest of their visit discussing improved chances for the quidditch cup at nine hagrid walked them back up to the castle 
 
 a large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room 
 
 hogsmeade next weekend said ron craning over the heads to read the new notice what reckon he added quietly to harry as they went to sit down 
 
 well filch done anything about the passage into honeydukes harry said even more quietly 
 
 harry said a voice in his right ear harry started and looked around at hermione who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her 
 
 harry if you go into hogsmeade tell professor mcgonagall about that map said hermione 
 
 can you hear someone talking harry growled ron not looking at hermione 
 
 ron how can you let him go with you after what sirius black nearly did to you i mean it tell 
 
 so now trying to get harry expelled said ron furiously you done enough damage this year 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to respond but with a soft hiss crookshanks leapt onto her lap hermione took one frightened look at the expression on face gathered up crookshanks and hurried away toward the girls dormitories 
 
 so how about it ron said to harry as though there had been no interruption come on last time we went you see anything you even been inside yet 
 
 harry looked around to check that hermione was well out of earshot 
 
 okay he said but taking the invisibility cloak this time 
 
 
 
 on saturday morning harry packed his invisibility cloak in his bag slipped the map into his pocket and went down to breakfast with everyone else hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors 
 
 bye harry called to ron see you when you get back 
 
 ron grinned and winked 
 
 harry hurried up to the third floor slipping the map out of his pocket as he went crouching behind the witch he smoothed it out a tiny dot was moving in his direction harry squinted at it the minuscule writing next to it read neville longbottom 
 
 harry quickly pulled out his wand muttered dissendium and shoved his bag into the statue but before he could climb in himself neville came around the corner 
 
 harry i forgot you going to hogsmeade either 
 
 hi neville said harry moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket what are you up to 
 
 nothing shrugged neville want a game of exploding snap 
 
 er not now i was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for lupin 
 
 come with you said neville brightly i done it either 
 
 er hang on yeah i forgot i finished it last night 
 
 great you can help me said neville his round face anxious i understand that thing about the garlic at all do they have to eat it or 
 
 he broke off with a small gasp looking over shoulder 
 
 it was snape neville took a quick step behind harry 
 
 and what are you two doing here said snape coming to a halt and looking from one to the other an odd place to meet 
 
 to immense disquiet black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them and then to the witch 
 
 not meeting here said harry we just met here 
 
 indeed said snape you have a habit of turning up in unexpected places potter and you are very rarely there for no good reasoni suggest the pair of you return to gryffindor tower where you belong 
 
 harry and neville set off without another word as they turned the corner harry looked back snape was running one of his hands over the head examining it closely 
 
 harry managed to shake neville off at the fat lady by telling him the password then pretending left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back once out of sight of the security trolls he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose 
 
 the third floor corridor seemed to be deserted harry scanned the map carefully and saw with a leap of relief that the tiny dot labeled severus snape was now back in its office 
 
 he sprinted back to the witch opened her hump heaved himself inside and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute he wiped the map blank again then set off at a run 
 
 
 
 harry completely hidden beneath the invisibility cloak emerged into the sunlight outside honeydukes and prodded ron in the back 
 
 me he muttered 
 
 what kept you ron hissed 
 
 snape was hanging around 
 
 they set off up the high street 
 
 where are you ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth are you still there this feels weird 
 
 they went to the post office ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to bill in egypt so that harry could have a good look around the owls sat hooting softly down at him at least three hundred of them from great grays right down to tiny little scops owls local deliveries only which were so small they could have sat in the palm of hand 
 
 then they visited which was so packed with students harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic there were jokes and tricks to fulfill even and wildest dreams harry gave ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak they left with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering but their pockets bulging with dungbombs hiccup sweets frog spawn soap and a teacup apiece 
 
 the day was fine and breezy and neither of them felt like staying indoors so they walked past the three broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the shrieking shack the most haunted dwelling in britain it stood a little way above the rest of the village and even in daylight was slightly creepy with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden 
 
 even the hogwarts ghosts avoid it said ron as they leaned on the fence looking up at it i asked nearly headless nickhe says heard a very rough crowd lives here no one can get in fred and george tried obviously but all the entrances are sealed shut 
 
 harry feeling hot from their climb was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill moments later malfoy had appeared followed closely by crabbe and goyle malfoy was speaking 
 
 should have an owl from father any time now he had to go to the hearing to tell them about my armabout how i use it for three months 
 
 crabbe and goyle sniggered 
 
 i really wish i could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend no arm in im onest that as good as dead 
 
 malfoy suddenly caught sight of ron his pale face split in a malevolent grin 
 
 what are you doing weasley 
 
 malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind ron 
 
 suppose love to live here you weasley dreaming about having your own bedroom i heard your family all sleep in one room is that true 
 
 harry seized the back of robes to stop him from leaping on malfoy 
 
 leave him to me he hissed in ear 
 
 the opportunity was too perfect to miss harry crept silently around behind malfoy crabbe and goyle bent down and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path 
 
 we were just discussing your friend hagrid malfoy said to ron just trying to imagine what saying to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures think cry when they cut off his 
 
 splat 
 
 head jerked forward as the mud hit him his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in muck 
 
 what the 
 
 ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing he was laughing so hard malfoy crabbe and goyle spun stupidly on the spot staring wildly around malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean 
 
 what was that who did that 
 
 very haunted up here it said ron with the air of one commenting on the weather 
 
 crabbe and goyle were looking scared their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape 
 
 harry sneaked along the path where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some green sludge 
 
 splatter 
 
 crabbe and goyle caught some this time goyle hopped furiously on the spot trying to rub it out of his small dull eyes 
 
 it came from over there said malfoy wiping his face and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of harry 
 
 crabbe blundered forward his long arms outstretched like a zombie harry dodged around him picked up a stick and lobbed it at back harry doubled up with silent laughter as crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair trying to see who had thrown it as ron was the only person crabbe could see it was ron he started toward but harry stuck out his leg crabbe stumbled and his huge flat foot caught the hem of cloak harry felt a great tug then the cloak slid off his face 
 
 for a split second malfoy stared at him 
 
 aaargh he yelled pointing at head then he turned tail and ran at breakneck speed back down the hill crabbe and goyle behind him 
 
 harry tugged the cloak up again but the damage was done 
 
 harry ron said stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where harry had disappeared better run for it if malfoy tells anyone better get back to the castle quick 
 
 see you later said harry and without another word he tore back down the path toward hogsmeade 
 
 would malfoy believe what he had seen would anyone believe malfoy nobody knew about the invisibility cloak nobody except dumbledore stomach turned over dumbledore would know exactly what had happened if malfoy said anything 
 
 back into honeydukes back down the cellar steps across the stone floor through the trapdoor harry pulled off the cloak tucked it under his arm and ran flat out along the passagemalfoy would get back first how long would it take him to find a teacher panting a sharp pain in his side harry slow down until he reached the stone slide he would have to leave the cloak where it was it was too much of a giveaway in case malfoy had tipped off a teacher he hid it in a shadowy corner then started to climb fast as he could his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute he reached the inside of the hump tapped it with his wand stuck his head through and hoisted himself out the hump closed and just as harry jumped out from behind the statue he heard quick footsteps approaching 
 
 it was snape he approached harry at a swift walk his black robes swishing then stopped in front of him 
 
 so he said 
 
 there was a look of suppressed triumph about him harry tried to look innocent all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands which he quickly hid in his pockets 
 
 come with me potter said snape 
 
 harry followed him downstairs trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without snape noticing they walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into office 
 
 harry had been in here only once before and he had been in very serious trouble then too snape had acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time all standing on shelves behind his desk glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere 
 
 sit said snape 
 
 harry sat snape however remained standing 
 
 mr malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story potter said snape 
 
 harry say anything 
 
 he tells me that he was up by the shrieking shack when he ran into weasley apparently alone 
 
 still harry speak 
 
 mr malfoy states that he was standing talking to weasley when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head how do you think that could have happened 
 
 harry tried to look mildly surprised 
 
 i know professor 
 
 eyes were boring into it was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff harry tried hard not to blink 
 
 mr malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition can you imagine what it might have been potter 
 
 no said harry now trying to sound innocently curious 
 
 it was your head potter floating in midair 
 
 there was a long silence 
 
 maybe better go to madam pomfrey said harry if seeing things like 
 
 what would your head have been doing in hogsmeade potter said snape softly your head is not allowed in hogsmeade no part of your body has permission to be in hogsmeade 
 
 i know that said harry striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear it sounds like having hallucin 
 
 malfoy is not having hallucinations snarled snape and he bent down a hand on each arm of chair so that their faces were a foot apart if your head was in hogsmeade so was the rest of you 
 
 been up in gryffindor tower said harry like you told 
 
 can anyone confirm that 
 
 harry say anything thin mouth curled into a horrible smile 
 
 so he said straightening up again everyone from the minister of magic downward has been trying to keep famous harry potter safe from sirius black but famous harry potter is a law unto himself let the ordinary people worry about his safety famous harry potter goes where he wants to with no thought for the consequences 
 
 harry stayed silent snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth he going to do it snape had no proof yet 
 
 how extraordinarily like your father you are potter snape said suddenly his eyes glinting he too was exceedingly arrogant a small amount of talent on the quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too strutting around the place with his friends and admirersthe resemblance between you is uncanny 
 
 my dad strut said harry before he could stop himself and neither do i 
 
 your father set much store by rules either snape went on pressing his advantage his thin face full of malice rules were for lesser mortals not quidditch his head was so swollen 
 
 shut up 
 
 harry was suddenly on his feet rage such as he had not felt since his last night in privet drive was coursing through him he care that face had gone rigid the black eyes flashing dangerously 
 
 what did you say to me potter 
 
 i told you to shut up about my dad harry yelled i know the truth all right he saved your life dumbledore told me you even be here if it for my dad 
 
 sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk 
 
 and did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life he whispered or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious delicate ears 
 
 harry bit his lip he know what had happened and want to admit it but snape seemed to have guessed the truth 
 
 i would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father potter he said a terrible grin twisting his face have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism then let me correct you your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father got cold feet at the last moment there was nothing brave about what he did he was saving his own skin as much as mine had their joke succeeded he would have been expelled from hogwarts 
 
 uneven yellowish teeth were bared 
 
 turn out your pockets potter he spat suddenly 
 
 harry move there was a pounding in his ears 
 
 turn out your pockets or we go straight to the headmaster pull them out potter 
 
 cold with dread harry slowly pulled out the bag of tricks and the map 
 
 snap picked up the bag 
 
 ron gave them to me said harry praying get a chance to tip ron off before snape saw him he brought them back from hogsmeade last time 
 
 indeed and been carrying them around ever since how very touchingand what is this 
 
 snape had picked up the map harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive 
 
 spare bit of parchment he said with a shrug 
 
 snape turned it over his eyes on harry 
 
 surely you need such a very old piece of parchment he said why i just throw this away 
 
 his hand moved toward the fire 
 
 no harry said quickly 
 
 so said snape his long nostrils quivering is this another treasured gift from mr weasley or is it something else a letter perhaps written in invisible ink or instructions to get into hogsmeade without passing the dementors 
 
 harry blinked eyes gleamed 
 
 let me see let me see he muttered taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk reveal your secret he said touching the wand to the parchment 
 
 nothing happened harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking 
 
 show yourself snape said tapping the map sharply 
 
 it stayed blank harry was taking deep calming breaths 
 
 professor severus snape master of this school commands you to yield the information you conceal snape said hitting the map with his wand 
 
 as though an invisible hand were writing upon it words appeared on the smooth surface of the map 
 
 mooney presents his compliments to professor snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other business 
 
 snape froze harry stared dumbstruck at the message but the map stop there more writing was appearing beneath the first 
 
 mr prongs agrees with mr mooney and would like to add that professor snape is an ugly git 
 
 it would have been very funny if the situation been so serious and there was more 
 
 mr padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor 
 
 harry closed his eyes in horror when opened them the map had had its last word 
 
 mr wormtail bids professor snape good day and advises him to wash his hair the slimeball 
 
 harry waited for the blow to fall 
 
 so said snape softly see about this 
 
 he strode across to his fire seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace and threw it into the flames 
 
 lupin snape called into the fire i want a word 
 
 utterly bewildered harry stared at the fire a large shape had appeared in it revolving very fast seconds later professor lupin was clambering out of the fireplace brushing ash off his shabby robes 
 
 you called severus said lupin mildly 
 
 i certainly did said snape his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk i have just asked potter to empty his pockets he was carrying this 
 
 snape pointed at the parchment on which the words of messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs were still shining an odd closed expression appeared on face 
 
 well said snape 
 
 lupin continued to stare at the map harry had the impression that lupin was doing some very quick thinking 
 
 well said snape again this parchment is plainly full of dark magic this is supposed to be your area of expertise lupin where do you imagine potter got such a thing 
 
 lupin looked up and by the merest in direction warned him not to interrupt 
 
 full of dark magic he repeated mildly do you really think so severus it looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it childish but surely not dangerous i imagine harry got it from a joke shop 
 
 indeed said snape his jaw had gone rigid with anger you think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing you think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers 
 
 harry understand what snape was talking about nor apparently did lupin 
 
 you mean by mr wormtail or one of these people he said harry do you know any of these men 
 
 no said harry quickly 
 
 you see severus said lupin turning back to snape it looks like a zonko product to me 
 
 right on cue ron came bursting into the office he was completely out of breath and stopped just short of desk clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak 
 
 i gave harry that stuff he choked bought itin ages ago 
 
 well said lupin clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully that seems to clear that up severus take this back shall i he folded the map and tucked it inside his robes harry ron come with me i need a word about my vampire essay excuse us severus 
 
 harry dare look at snape as they left his office he ron and lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking then harry turned to lupin 
 
 professor i 
 
 i want to hear explanations said lupin shortly he glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice i happen to know that this map was confiscated by mr filch many years ago yes i know a map he said as harry and ron looked amazed i want to know how it fell into your possession i am however astounded that you hand it in particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around and i let you have it back harry 
 
 harry had expected that and was too keen for explanations to protest 
 
 why did snape think got it from the manufacturers 
 
 because lupin hesitated because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school think it extremely entertaining 
 
 do you know them said harry impressed 
 
 met he said shortly he was looking at harry more seriously than ever before 
 
 expect me to cover up for you again harry i cannot make you take sirius black seriously but i would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you your parents gave their lives to keep you alive harry a poor way to repay them gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks 
 
 he walked away leaving harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in office slowly he and ron mounted the marble staircase as harry passed the witch he remembered the invisibility cloak it was still down there but he dare go and get it 
 
 my fault said ron abruptly i persuaded you to go right it was stupid we done it 
 
 he broke off they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing and hermione was walking toward them one look at her face convinced harry that she had heard what had happened his heart plummeted had she told professor mcgonagall 
 
 come to have a good gloat said ron savagely as she stopped in front of them or have you just been to tell on us 
 
 no said hermione she was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling i just thought you ought to knowhagrid lost his case buckbeak is going to be executed 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter fifteen beauxbatons and durmstrangcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 early next morning harry woke with a plan fully formed in his mind as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night he got up dressed in the pale dawn light left the dormitory without waking ron and went back down to the deserted common room here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which his divination homework still lay and wrote the following letter 
 
 dear sirius 
 i reckon i just imagined my scar hurting i was half asleep when i wrote to you last time no point coming back fine here worry about me my head feels completely normal 
 harry 
 he then climbed out of the portrait hole up through the silent castle held up only briefly by peeves who tried to overturn a large vase on him halfway along the corridor finally arriving at the owlery which was situated at the top of west tower 
 
 the owlery was a circular stone room rather cold and drafty because none of the windows had glass in them the floor was entirely covered in straw owl droppings and the regurgitated skeletons of mice and voles hundreds upon hundreds of owls of every breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right up to the top of the tower nearly all of them asleep though here and there a round amber eye glared at harry he spotted hedwig nestled between a barn owl and a tawny and hurried over to her sliding a little on the floor 
 
 it took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look at him as she kept shuffling around on her perch showing him her tail she was evidently still furious about his lack of gratitude the previous night in the end it was harry suggesting she might be too tired and that perhaps he would ask ron to borrow pigwidgeon that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it 
 
 just find him all right harry said stroking her back as he carried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall before the dementors do 
 
 she nipped his finger perhaps rather harder than she would ordinarily have done but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise harry watched her fly out of sight with the familiar feeling of unease back in his stomach he had been so sure that reply would alleviate his worries rather than increasing them 
 
 that was a lie harry said hermione sharply over breakfast when he told her and ron what he had done you imagine your scar hurting and you know it 
 
 so what said harry not going back to azkaban because of me 
 
 drop it said ron sharply to hermione as she opened her mouth to argue some more and for once hermione heeded him and fell silent 
 
 harry did his best not to worry about sirius over the next couple of weeks true he could not stop himself from looking anxiously around every morning when the post owls arrived nor late at night before he went to sleep prevent himself from seeing horrible visions of sirius cornered by dementors down some dark london street but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his godfather he wished he still had quidditch to distract him nothing worked so well on a troubled mind as a good hard training session on the other hand their lessons were becoming more difficult and demanding than ever before particularly defense against the dark arts 
 
 to their surprise professor moody had announced that he would be putting the imperius curse on each of them in turn to demonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its effects 
 
 but but you said illegal professor said hermione uncertainly as moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his wand leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room you said to use it against another human was 
 
 dumbledore wants you taught what it feels like said moody his magical eye swiveling onto hermione and fixing her with an eerie unblinking stare if rather learn the hard way when putting it on you so they can control you completely fine by me excused off you go 
 
 he pointed one gnarled finger toward the door hermione went very pink and muttered something about not meaning that she wanted to leave harry and ron grinned at each other they knew hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an important lesson 
 
 moody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the imperius curse upon them harry watched as one by one his classmates did the most extraordinary things under its influence dean thomas hopped three times around the room singing the national anthem lavender brown imitated a squirrel neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he would certainly not have been capable of in his normal state not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse and each of them recovered only when moody had removed it 
 
 potter moody growled you next 
 
 harry moved forward into the middle of the classroom into the space that moody had cleared of desks moody raised his wand pointed it at harry and said imperio 
 
 it was the most wonderful feeling harry felt a floating sensation as every thought and worry in his head was wiped gently away leaving nothing but a vague untraceable happiness he stood there feeling immensely relaxed only dimly aware of everyone watching him 
 
 and then he heard voice echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain jump onto the deskjump onto the desk 
 
 harry bent his knees obediently preparing to spring 
 
 jump onto the desk 
 
 why though another voice had awoken in the back of his brain 
 
 stupid thing to do really said the voice 
 
 jump onto the desk 
 
 no i think i will thanks said the other voice a little more firmlyno i really want to 
 
 jump now 
 
 the next thing harry felt was considerable pain he had both jumped and tried to prevent himself from jumping the result was that smashed headlong into the desk knocking it over and by the feeling in his legs fractured both his kneecaps 
 
 now more like it growled voice and suddenly harry felt the empty echoing feeling in his head disappear he remembered exactly what was happening and the pain in his knees seemed to double 
 
 look at that you lotpotter fought he fought it and he damn near beat it try that again potter and the rest of you pay attention watch his eyes where you see it very good potter very good indeed have trouble controlling you 
 
 
 
 the way he talks harry muttered as he hobbled out of the defense against the dark arts class an hour later moody had insisted on putting harry through his paces four times in a row until harry could throw off the curse entirely think we were all going to be attacked any second 
 
 yeah i know said ron who was skipping on every alternate step he had had much more difficulty with the curse than harry though moody assured him the effects would wear off by lunchtime talk about paranoid ron glanced nervously over his shoulder to check that moody was definitely out of earshot and went on no wonder they were glad to get shot of him at the ministry did you hear him telling seamus what he did to that witch who shouted boo behind him on april fools day and when are we supposed to read up on resisting the imperius curse with everything else got to do 
 
 all the fourth years had noticed a definite increase in the amount of work they were required to do this term professor mcgonagall explained why when the class gave a particularly loud groan at the amount of transfiguration homework she had assigned 
 
 you are now entering a most important phase of your magical education she told them her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles your ordinary wizarding levels are drawing closer 
 
 we take till fifth year said dean thomas indignantly 
 
 maybe not thomas but believe me you need all the preparation you can get miss granger remains the only person in this class who has managed to turn a hedgehog into a satisfactory pincushion i might remind you that your pincushion thomas still curls up in fright if anyone approaches it with a pin 
 
 hermione who had turned rather pink again seemed to be trying not to look too pleased with herself 
 
 harry and ron were deeply amused when professor trelawney told them that they had received top marks for their homework in their next divination class she read out large portions of their predictions commending them for their unflinching acceptance of the horrors in store for them but they were less amused when she asked them to do the same thing for the month after next both of them were running out of ideas for catastrophes 
 
 meanwhile professor binns the ghost who taught history of magic had them writing weekly essays on the goblin rebellions of the eighteenth century professor snape was forcing them to research antidotes they took this one seriously as he had hinted that he might be poisoning one of them before christmas to see if their antidote worked professor flitwick had asked them to read three extra books in preparation for their lesson on summoning charms 
 
 even hagrid was adding to their workload the skrewts were growing at a remarkable pace given that nobody had yet discovered what they ate hagrid was delighted and as part of their project suggested that they come down to his hut on alternate evenings to observe the skrewts and make notes on their extraordinary behavior 
 
 i will not said draco malfoy flatly when hagrid had proposed this with the air of father christmas pulling an toy out of his sack i see enough of these foul things during lessons thanks 
 
 smile faded off his face 
 
 do wha yer told he growled or be takin a leaf outta professor hear yeh made a good ferret malfoy 
 
 the gryffindors roared with laughter malfoy flushed with anger but apparently the memory of punishment was still sufficiently painful to stop him from retorting harry ron and hermione returned to the castle at the end of the lesson in high spirits seeing hagrid put down malfoy was particularly satisfying especially because malfoy had done his very best to get hagrid sacked the previous year 
 
 when they arrived in the entrance hall they found themselves unable to proceed owing to the large crowd of students congregated there all milling around a large sign that had been erected at the foot of the marble staircase ron the tallest of the three stood on tiptoe to see over the heads in front of them and read the sign aloud to the other two 
 
 triwizard tournament 
 the delegations from beauxbatons and durmstrang will be arriving at on friday the th of october lessons will end half an hour early 
 brilliant said harry potions last thing on friday snape have time to poison us all 
 
 students will return their bags and books to their dormitories and assemble in front of the castle to greet our guests beforethe welcoming feast 
 only a week away said ernie macmillan of hufflepuff emerging from the crowd his eyes gleaming i wonder if cedric knows think go and tell him 
 
 cedric said ron blankly as ernie hurried off 
 
 diggory said harry he must be entering the tournament 
 
 that idiot hogwarts champion said ron as they pushed their way through the chattering crowd toward the staircase 
 
 not an idiot you just like him because he beat gryffindor at quidditch said hermione heard a really good student and a prefect 
 
 she spoke as though this settled the matter 
 
 you only like him because handsome said ron scathingly 
 
 excuse me i like people just because handsome said hermione indignantly 
 
 ron gave a loud false cough which sounded oddly like lockhart 
 
 the appearance of the sign in the entrance hall had a marked effect upon the inhabitants of the castle during the following week there seemed to be only one topic of conversation no matter where harry went the triwizard tournament rumors were flying from student to student like highly contagious germs who was going to try for hogwarts champion what the tournament would involve how the students from beauxbatons and durmstrang differed from themselves 
 
 harry noticed too that the castle seemed to be undergoing an cleaning several grimy portraits had been scrubbed much to the displeasure of their subjects who sat huddled in their frames muttering darkly and wincing as they felt their raw pink faces the suits of armor were suddenly gleaming and moving without squeaking and argus filch the caretaker was behaving so ferociously to any students who forgot to wipe their shoes that he terrified a pair of girls into hysterics 
 
 other members of the staff seemed oddly tense too 
 
 longbottom kindly do not reveal that you even perform a simple switching spell in front of anyone from durmstrang professor mcgonagall barked at the end of one particularly difficult lesson during which neville had accidentally transplanted his own ears onto a cactus 
 
 when they went down to breakfast on the morning of the thirtieth of october they found that the great hall had been decorated overnight enormous silk banners hung from the walls each of them representing a hogwarts house red with a gold lion for gryffiindor blue with a bronze eagle for ravenclaw yellow with a black badger for hufflepuff and green with a silver serpent for slytherin behind the teachers table the largest banner of all bore the hogwarts coat of arms lion eagle badger and snake united around a large letter h 
 
 harry ron and hermione sat down beside fred and george at the gryffindor table once again and most unusually they were sitting apart from everyone else and conversing in low voices ron led the way over to them 
 
 a bummer all right george was saying gloomily to fred but if he talk to us in person have to send him the letter after all or stuff it into his hand he avoid us forrever 
 
 avoiding you said ron sitting down next to them 
 
 wish you would said fred looking irritated at the interruption 
 
 a bummer ron asked george 
 
 having a nosy git like you for a brother said george 
 
 you two got any ideas on the triwizard tournament yet harry asked thought any more about trying to enter 
 
 i asked mcgonagall how the champions are chosen but she telling said george bitterly she just told me to shut up and get on with transfiguring my raccoon 
 
 wonder what the tasks are going to be said ron thoughtfully you know i bet we could do them harry done dangerous stuff before 
 
 not in front of a panel of judges you said fred mcgonagall says the champions get awarded points according to how well done the tasks 
 
 who are the judges harry asked 
 
 well the heads of the participating schools are always on the panel said hermione and everyone looked around at her rather surprised because all three of them were injured during the tournament of when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage 
 
 she noticed them all looking at her and said with her usual air of impatience that nobody else had read all the books she had all in hogwarts a history though of course that not entirely reliable a revised history of hogwarts would be a more accurate title or a highly biased and selective history of hogwarts which glosses over the nastier aspects of the school 
 
 what are you on about said ron though harry thought he knew what was coming 
 
 said hermione her eyes flashing not once in over a thousand pages does hogwarts a history mention that we are all colluding in the oppression of a hundred slaves 
 
 harry shook his head and applied himself to his scrambled eggs his and lack of enthusiasm had done nothing whatsoever to curb determination to pursue justice for true both of them had paid two sickles for a badge but they had only done it to keep her quiet their sickles had been wasted however if anything they seemed to have made hermione more vociferous she had been badgering harry and ron ever since first to wear the badges then to persuade others to do the same and she had also taken to rattling around the gryffindor common room every evening cornering people and shaking the collecting tin under their noses 
 
 you do realize that your sheets are changed your fires lit your classrooms cleaned and your food cooked by a group of magical creatures who are unpaid and enslaved she kept saying fiercely 
 
 some people like neville had paid up just to stop hermione from glowering at them a few seemed mildly interested in what she had to say but were reluctant to take a more active role in campaigning many regarded the whole thing as a joke 
 
 ron now rolled his eyes at the ceiling which was flooding them all in autumn sunlight and fred became extremely interested in his bacon both twins had refused to buy a badge george however leaned in toward hermione 
 
 listen have you ever been down in the kitchens hermione 
 
 no of course not said hermione curtly i hardly think students are supposed to 
 
 well we have said george indicating fred loads of times to nick food and met them and happy they think got the best job in the world 
 
 because uneducated and brainwashed hermione began hotly but her next few words were drowned out by the sudden whooshing noise from overhead which announced the arrival of the post owls harry looked up at once and saw hedwig soaring toward him hermione stopped talking abruptly she and ron watched hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto shoulder folded her wings and held out her leg wearily 
 
 harry pulled off reply and offered hedwig his bacon rinds which she ate gratefully then checking that fred and george were safely immersed in further discussions about the triwizard tournament harry read out letter in a whisper to ron and hermione 
 
 nice try harry 
 back in the country and well hidden i want you to keep me posted on everything going on at hogwarts use hedwig keep changing owls and worry about me just watch out for yourself forget what i said about your scar 
 sirius 
 why have to keep changing owls ron asked in a low voice 
 
 attract too much attention said hermione at once she stands out a snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever hidingi mean not native birds are they 
 
 harry rolled up the letter and slipped it inside his robes wondering whether he felt more or less worried than before he supposed that sirius managing to get back without being caught was something he deny either that the idea that sirius was much nearer was reassuring at least he have to wait so long for a response every time he wrote 
 
 thanks hedwig he said stroking her she hooted sleepily dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice then took off again clearly desperate for a good long sleep in the owlery 
 
 there was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day nobody was very attentive in lessons being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from beauxbatons and durmstrang even potions was more bearable than usual as it was half an hour shorter when the bell rang early harry ron and hermione hurried up to gryffindor tower deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed pulled on their cloaks and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall 
 
 the heads of houses were ordering their students into lines 
 
 weasley straighten your hat professor mcgonagall snapped at ron miss patil take that ridiculous thing out of your hair 
 
 parvati scowled and removed a large ornamental butterfly from the end of her plait 
 
 follow me please said professor mcgonagall first years in frontno pushing 
 
 they filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle it was a cold clear evening dusk was falling and a pale moon was already shining over the forbidden forest harry standing between ron and hermione in the fourth row from the front saw dennis creevey positively shivering with anticipation among the other first years 
 
 nearly six said ron checking his watch and then staring down the drive that led to the front gates how reckon coming the train 
 
 i doubt it said hermione 
 
 how then broomsticks harry suggested looking up at the starry sky 
 
 i think sonot from that far away 
 
 a portkey ron suggested or they could apparate maybe allowed to do it under seventeen wherever they come from 
 
 you apparate inside the hogwarts grounds how often do i have to tell you said hermione impatiently 
 
 they scanned the darkening grounds excitedly but nothing was moving everything was still silent and quite as usual harry was starting to feel cold he wished hurry the foreign students were preparing a dramatic remembered what mr weasley had said back at the campsite before the quidditch world cup always the same we resist showing off when we get together 
 
 and then dumbledore called out from the back row where he stood with the other teachers 
 
 aha unless i am very much mistaken the delegation from beauxbatons approaches 
 
 where said many students eagerly all looking in different directions 
 
 there yelled a sixth year pointing over the forest 
 
 something large much larger than a broomstick or indeed a hundred broomsticks was hurtling across the deep blue sky toward the castle growing larger all the time 
 
 a dragon shrieked one of the first years losing her head completely 
 
 be a flying house said dennis creevey 
 
 guess was the gigantic black shape skimmed over the treetops of the forbidden forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it they saw a gigantic powderblue carriage the size of a large house soaring toward them pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses all palominos and each the size of an elephant 
 
 the front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage hurtled ever lower coming in to land at a tremendous speed then with an almighty crash that made neville jump backward onto a slytherin fifth foot the horses hooves larger than dinner plates hit the ground a second later the carriage landed too bouncing upon its vast wheels while the golden horses tossed their enormous heads and rolled large fiery red eyes 
 
 harry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a coat of arms two crossed golden wands each emitting three stars before it opened 
 
 a boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage bent forward fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor and unfolded a set of golden steps he sprang back respectfully then harry saw a shining black shoe emerging from the inside of the carriage a shoe the size of a sled followed almost immediately by the largest woman he had ever seen in his life the size of the carriage and of the horses was immediately explained a few people gasped 
 
 harry had only ever seen one person as large as this woman in his life and that was hagrid he doubted whether there was an inch difference in their heights yet somehow maybe simply because he was used to hagrid this woman now at the foot of the steps and looking around at the waiting crowd seemed even more unnaturally large as she stepped into the light flooding from the entrance hall she was revealed to have a handsome face large black eyes and a rather beaky nose her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck she was dressed from head to foot in black satin and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers 
 
 dumbledore started to clap the students following his lead broke into applause too many of them standing on tiptoe the better to look at this woman 
 
 her face relaxed into a gracious smile and she walked forward toward dumbledore extending a glittering hand dumbledore though tall himself had barely to bend to kiss it 
 
 my dear madame maxime he said welcome to hogwarts 
 
 said madame maxime in a deep voice i ope i find you well 
 
 in excellent form i thank you said dumbledore 
 
 my pupils said madame maxime waving one of her enormous hands carelessly behind her 
 
 harry whose attention had been focused completely upon madame maxime now noticed that about a dozen boys and girls all by the look of them in their late teens had emerged from the carriage and were now standing behind madame maxime they were shivering which was unsurprising given that their robes seemed to be made of fine silk and none of them were wearing cloaks a few had wrapped scarves and shawls around their heads from what harry could see of them they were standing in madame enormous shadow they were staring up at hogwarts with apprehensive looks on their faces 
 
 as karkaroff arrived yet madame maxime asked 
 
 he should be here any moment said dumbledore would you like to wait here and greet him or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle 
 
 warm up i think said madame maxime but ze orses 
 
 our care of magical creatures teacher will be delighted to take care of them said dumbledore the moment he has returned from dealing with a slight situation that has arisen with some of his other er charges 
 
 skrewts ron muttered to harry grinning 
 
 my steeds require er forceful andling said madame maxime looking as though she doubted whether any care of magical creatures teacher at hogwarts could be up to the job zey are very strong 
 
 i assure you that hagrid will be well up to the job said dumbledore smiling 
 
 very well said madame maxime bowing slightly will you please inform zis agrid zat ze orses drink only whiskey 
 
 it will be attended to said dumbledore also bowing 
 
 come said madame maxime imperiously to her students and the hogwarts crowd parted to allow her and her students to pass up the stone steps 
 
 how big reckon horses are going to be seamus finnigan said leaning around lavender and parvati to address harry and ron 
 
 well if any bigger than this lot even hagrid be able to handle them said harry if he been attacked by his skrewts wonder up with them 
 
 maybe escaped said ron hopefully 
 
 oh say that said hermione with a shudder imagine that lot loose on the grounds 
 
 they stood shivering slightly now waiting for the durmstrang party to arrive most people were gazing hopefully up at the sky 
 
 for a few minutes the silence was broken only by madame huge horses snorting and stamping but then 
 
 can you hear something said ron suddenly 
 
 harry listened a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward them from out of the darkness a muffled rumbling and sucking sound as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed 
 
 the lake yelled lee jordan pointing down at it look at the lake 
 
 from their position at the top of the lawns overlooking the grounds they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the water except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all some disturbance was taking place deep in the center great bubbles were forming on the surface waves were now washing over the muddy banks and then out in the very middle of the lake a whirlpool appeared as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of the floor 
 
 what seemed to be a long black pole began to rise slowly out of the heart of the whirlpooland then harry saw the rigging 
 
 a mast he said to ron and hermione 
 
 slowly magnificently the ship rose out of the water gleaming in the moonlight it had a strangely skeletal look about it as though it were a resurrected wreck and the dim misty lights shimmering at its portholes looked like ghostly eyes finally with a great sloshing noise the ship emerged entirely bobbing on the turbulent water and began to glide toward the bank a few moments later they heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shallows and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank 
 
 people were disembarking they could see their silhouettes passing the lights in the portholes all of them harry noticed seemed to be built along the lines of crabbe and goylebut then as they drew nearer walking up the lawns into the light streaming from the entrance hall he saw that their bulk was really due to the fact that they were wearing cloaks of some kind of shaggy matted fur but the man who was leading them up to the castle was wearing furs of a different sort sleek and silver like his hair 
 
 dumbledore he called heartily as he walked up the slope how are you my dear fellow how are you 
 
 blooming thank you professor karkaroff dumbledore replied karkaroff had a fruity unctuous voice when he stepped into the light pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he was tall and thin like dumbledore but his white hair was short and his goatee finishing in a small curl did not entirely hide his rather weak chin when he reached dumbledore he shook hands with both of his own 
 
 dear old hogwarts he said looking up at the castle and smiling his teeth were rather yellow and harry noticed that his smile did not extend to his eyes which remained cold and shrewd how good it is to be here how come along into the warmthyou mind dumbledore viktor has a slight head cold 
 
 karkaroff beckoned forward one of his students as the boy passed harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and thick black eyebrows he need the punch on the arm ron gave him or the hiss in his ear to recognize that profile 
 
 harry krum

lionfish nov chapter fifteen the high inquisitorcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 they had expected to have to comb daily prophet carefully next morning to find the article percy had mentioned in his letter however the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of dolores umbridge smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline 
 
 ministry seeks educational reform 
 
 dolores umbridge appointed 
 
 first ever high inquisitor 
 
 high inquisitor said harry darkly his piece of toast slipping from his fingers what does that mean 
 
 hermione read aloud 
 
 in a surprise move last night the ministry of magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 the minister has been growing uneasy about at hogwarts for some time said junior assistant to the minister percy weasley he is now responding to concerns voiced by anxious parents who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve of 
 
 this is not the first time in recent weeks that the minister cornelius fudge has used new laws to effect improvements at the wizarding school as recently as th august educational decree number was passed to ensure that in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post the ministry should select an appropriate person 
 
 how dolores umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at hogwarts said weasley last night dumbledore find anyone so the minister put in umbridge and of course been an immediate success 
 
 been a what said harry loudly 
 
 wait more said hermione grimly 
 
 an immediate success totally revolutionising the teaching of defence against the dark arts and providing the minister with feedback about really happening at hogwarts 
 
 it is this last function that the ministry has now formalised with the passing of educational decree number which creates the new position of hogwarts high inquisitor 
 
 this is an exciting new phase in the plan to get to grips with what some are calling the falling standards at hogwarts said weasley the inquisitor will have powers to inspect her fellow educators and make sure that they are coming up to scratch professor umbridge has been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post and we are delighted to say that she has accepted 
 
 the new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at hogwarts 
 
 i feel much easier in my mind now that i know dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation said mr lucius malfoy speaking from his wiltshire mansion last night many of us with our best interests at heart have been concerned about some of eccentric decisions in the last few years and are glad to know that the ministry is keeping an eye on the situation 
 
 among those eccentric decisions are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointments previously described in this newspaper which have included the employment of werewolf remus lupin rubeus hagrid and delusional moody 
 
 rumours abound of course that albus dumbledore once supreme mugwump of the international confederation of wizards and chief warlock of the wizengamot is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of hogwarts 
 
 i think the appointment of the inquisitor is a first step towards ensuring that hogwarts has a headmaster in whom we can all repose our confidence said a ministry insider last night 
 
 wizengamot elders griselda marchbanks and tiberius ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of inquisitor to hogwarts 
 
 hogwarts is a school not an outpost of cornelius office said madam marchbanks this is a further disgusting attempt to discredit albus dumbledore for a full account of madam alleged links to subversive goblin groups turn to page seventeen 
 
 hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two 
 
 so now we know how we ended up with umbridge fudge passed this educational decree and forced her on us and now given her the power to inspect the other teachers hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright i believe this outrageous 
 
 i know it is said harry he looked down at his right hand clenched on the and saw the faint white outline of the words umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin 
 
 but a grin was unfurling on face 
 
 what said harry and hermione together staring at him 
 
 oh i wait to see mcgonagall inspected said ron happily umbridge know hit her 
 
 well come on said hermione jumping up better get going if inspecting class we want to be late 
 
 but professor umbridge was not inspecting their history of magic lesson which was just as dull as the previous monday nor was she in dungeon when they arrived for double potions where moonstone essay was handed back to him with a large spiky black d scrawled in an upper corner 
 
 i have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your owl said snape with a smirk as he swept among them passing back their homework this should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in the examination 
 
 snape reached the front of the class and turned on his heel to face them 
 
 the general standard of this homework was abysmal most of you would have failed had this been your examination i expect to see a great deal more effort for this essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes or i shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get a d 
 
 he smirked as malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper some people got a d ha 
 
 harry realised that hermione was looking sideways to see what grade he had received he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag as quickly as possible feeling that he would rather keep that information private 
 
 determined not to give snape an excuse to tail him this lesson harry read and reread every line of instructions on the blackboard at least three times before acting on them his strengthening solution was not precisely the clear turquoise shade of but it was at least blue rather than pink like and he delivered a flask of it to desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief 
 
 well that as bad as last week was it said hermione as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall towards lunch and the homework go too badly either did it 
 
 when neither ron nor harry answered she pressed on i mean all right i expect the top grade not if marking to owl standard but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage you say 
 
 harry made a noise in his throat 
 
 of course a lot can happen between now and the exam got plenty of time to improve but the grades getting now are a sort of baseline they something we can build on 
 
 they sat down together at the gryffindor table 
 
 obviously have been thrilled if got an o 
 
 hermione said ron sharply if you want to know what grades we got ask 
 
 i meanwell if you want to tell me 
 
 i got a p said ron ladling soup into his bowl happy 
 
 well nothing to be ashamed of said fred who had just arrived at the table with george and lee jordan and was sitting down on right nothing wrong with a good healthy p 
 
 but said hermione p stand for 
 
 poor yeah said lee jordan still better than d it dreadful 
 
 harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll when he emerged from this he was sorry to find that hermione was still in full flow about owl grades 
 
 so top o for outstanding she was saying and then a 
 
 no e george corrected her e for exceeds expectations and always thought fred and i got e in everything because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams 
 
 they all laughed except hermione who ploughed on so after e a for acceptable and the last pass grade it 
 
 yep said fred dunking an entire roll in his soup transferring it to his mouth and swallowing it whole 
 
 then you get p for poor ron raised both his arms in mock d for dreadful 
 
 and then t george reminded her 
 
 t asked hermione looking appalled even lower than a d what on earth does t stand for 
 
 troll said george promptly 
 
 harry laughed again though he was not sure whether or not george was joking he imagined trying to conceal from hermione that he had received in all his owls and immediately resolved to work harder from now on 
 
 you lot had an inspected lesson yet fred asked them 
 
 no said hermione at once have you 
 
 just now before lunch said george charms 
 
 what was it like harry and hermione asked together 
 
 fred shrugged 
 
 not that bad umbridge just lurked in the corner making notes on a clipboard you know what like he treated her like a guest seem to bother him at all she say much asked alicia a couple of questions about what the classes are normally like alicia told her they were really good that was it 
 
 i see old flitwick getting marked down said george he usually gets everyone through their exams all right 
 
 you got this afternoon fred asked harry 
 
 trelawney 
 
 a t if ever i saw one 
 
 and umbridge herself 
 
 well be a good boy and keep your temper with umbridge today said george do her nut if you miss any more quidditch practices 
 
 but harry did not have to wait for defence against the dark arts to meet professor umbridge he was pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy divination room when ron elbowed him in the ribs and looking round he saw professor umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor the class which had been talking cheerily fell silent at once the abrupt fall in the noise level made professor trelawney who had been wafting about handing out copies of the dream oracle look round 
 
 good afternoon professor trelawney said professor umbridge with her wide smile you received my note i trust giving the time and date of your inspection 
 
 professor trelawney nodded curtly and looking very disgruntled turned her back on professor umbridge and continued to give out books still smiling professor umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it was a few inches behind professor seat she then sat down took her clipboard from her flowery bag and looked up expectantly waiting for the class to begin 
 
 professor trelawney pulled her shawls tight about her with slightly trembling hands and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lenses 
 
 we shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tones though her voice shook slightly divide into pairs please and interpret each others latest visions with the aid of the oracle 
 
 she made as though to sweep back to her seat saw professor umbridge sitting right beside it and immediately veered left towards parvati and lavender who were already deep in discussion about most recent dream 
 
 harry opened his copy of the dream oracle watching umbridge covertly she was already making notes on her clipboard after a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in wake listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there harry bent his head hurriedly over his book 
 
 think of a dream quick he told ron in case the old toad comes our way 
 
 i did it last time ron protested your turn you tell me one 
 
 oh i dunno said harry desperately who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few days say i dreamed i was drowning snape in my cauldron yeah do 
 
 ron chortled as he opened his dream oracle 
 
 ok got to add your age to the date you had the dream the number of letters in the subject would that be drowning or cauldron or snape 
 
 it matter pick any of them said harry chancing a glance behind him professor umbridge was now standing at professor shoulder making notes while the divination teacher questioned neville about his dream diary 
 
 what night did you dream this again ron said immersed in calculations 
 
 i dunno last night whenever you like harry told him trying to listen to what umbridge was saying to professor trelawney they were only a table away from him and ron now professor umbridge was making another note on her clipboard and professor trelawney was looking extremely put out 
 
 now said umbridge looking up at trelawney been in this post how long exactly 
 
 professor trelawney scowled at her arms crossed and shoulders hunched as though wishing to protect herself as much as possible from the indignity of the inspection after a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question was not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it she said in a deeply resentful tone nearly sixteen years 
 
 quite a period said professor umbridge making a note on her clipboard so it was professor dumbledore who appointed you 
 
 right said professor trelawney shortly 
 
 professor umbridge made another note 
 
 and you are a of the celebrated seer cassandra trelawney 
 
 yes said professor trelawney holding her head a little higher 
 
 another note on the clipboard 
 
 but i think correct me if i am mistakenthat you are the first in your family since cassandra to be possessed of second sight 
 
 these things often skiperthree generations said professor trelawney 
 
 professor toadlike smile widened 
 
 of course she said sweetly making yet another note well if you could just predict something for me then and she looked up enquiringly still smiling 
 
 professor trelawney stiffened as though unable to believe her ears i understand you she said clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck 
 
 like you to make a prediction for me said professor umbridge very clearly 
 
 harry and ron were not the only people now watching and listening sneakily from behind their books most of the class were staring transfixed at professor trelawney as she drew herself up to her lull height her beads and bangles clinking 
 
 the inner eye does not see upon command she said in scandalised tones 
 
 i see said professor umbridge softly making yet another note on her clipboard 
 
 ibutbut wait said professor trelawney suddenly in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice though the mystical effect was ruined somewhat by the way it was shaking with anger i i think i do see something something that concerns you why i sense something something dark some grave peril 
 
 professor trelawney pointed a shaking finger at professor umbridge who continued to smile blandly at her eyebrows raised 
 
 i am afraid i am afraid that you are in grave danger professor trelawney finished dramatically 
 
 there was a pause professor umbridge surveyed professor trelawney 
 
 right she said softly scribbling on her clipboard once more well if really the best you can do 
 
 she turned away leaving professor trelawney standing rooted to the spot her chest heaving harry caught eye and knew that ron was thinking exactly the same as he was they both knew that professor trelawney was an old fraud but on the other hand they loathed umbridge so much that they felt very much on sideuntil she swooped down on them a few seconds later that is 
 
 well she said snapping her long fingers under nose uncharacteristically brisk let me see the start made on your dream diary please 
 
 and by the time she had interpreted dreams at the top of her voice all of which even the ones that involved eating porridge apparently foretold a gruesome and early death he was feeling much less sympathetic towards her all the while professor umbridge stood a few feet away making notes on that clipboard and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first and was waiting for them all when they reached their defence against the dark arts lesson ten minutes later 
 
 she was humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room harry and ron told hermione who had been in arithmancy exactly what had happened in divination while they all took out their copies of defensive magical theory but before hermione could ask any questions professor umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell 
 
 wands away she instructed them all with a smile and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags as we finished chapter one last lesson i would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two common defensive theories and their derivation there will be no need to talk 
 
 still smiling her wide smile she sat down at her desk the class gave an audible sigh as it turned as one to page nineteen harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapters in the book to keep them reading through all this years lessons and was on the point of checking the contents page when he noticed that hermione had her hand in the air again 
 
 professor umbridge had noticed too and what was more she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed hermione she got to her feet and walked around the front row of desks until they were face to face then she bent down and whispered so that the rest of the class could not hear what is it this time miss granger 
 
 already read chapter two said hermione 
 
 well then proceed to chapter three 
 
 read that too read the whole book 
 
 professor umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly 
 
 well then you should be able to tell me what slinkhard says about in chapter fifteen 
 
 he says that are improperly named said hermione promptly he says is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable 
 
 professor umbridge raised her eyebrows and harry knew she was impressed against her will 
 
 but i disagree hermione continued 
 
 professor eyebrows rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder 
 
 you disagree she repeated 
 
 yes i do said hermione who unlike umbridge was not whispering but speaking in a clear carrying voice that had by now attracted the attention of the rest of the class mr slinkhard like jinxes does he but i think they can be very useful when used defensively 
 
 oh you do do you said professor umbridge forgetting to whisper and straightening up well afraid it is mr opinion and not yours that matters within this classroom miss granger 
 
 but hermione began 
 
 that is enough said professor umbridge she walked back to the front of the class and stood before them all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone miss granger i am going to take five points from gryffindor house 
 
 there was an outbreak of muttering at this 
 
 what for said harry angrily 
 
 you get involved hermione whispered urgently to him 
 
 for disrupting my class with pointless interruptions said professor umbridge smoothly i am here to teach you using a method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more licence but as none of themwith the possible exception of professor quirrell who did at least appear to have restricted himself to subjectswould have passed a ministry inspection 
 
 yeah quirrell was a great teacher said harry loudly there was just that minor drawback of him having lord voldemort sticking out of the back of his head 
 
 this pronouncement was followed by one of the loudest silences harry had ever heard then 
 
 i think another detentions would do you some good mr potter said umbridge sleekly 
 
 the cut on the back of hand had barely healed and by the following morning it was bleeding again he did not complain during the detention he was determined not to give umbridge the satisfaction over and over again he wrote i must not tell lies and not a sound escaped his lips though the cut deepened with every letter 
 
 the very worst part of this second worth of detentions just as george had predicted reaction she cornered him just as he arrived at the gryffindor table for breakfast on tuesday and shouted so loudly that professor mcgonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table 
 
 miss johnson how dare you make such a racket in the great hall five points from gryffindor 
 
 but professor gone and landed himself in detention again 
 
 this potter said professor mcgonagall sharply rounding on harry detention from whom 
 
 from professor umbridge muttered harry not meeting professor beady eyes 
 
 are you telling me she said lowering her voice so that the group of curious ravenclaws behind them could not hear that after the warning i gave you last monday you lost your temper in professor class again 
 
 yes harry muttered speaking to the floor 
 
 potter you must get a grip on yourself you are heading for serious trouble another five points from gryffindor 
 
 butwhat professor no harry said furious at this injustice already being punished by her why do you have to take points as well 
 
 because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever said professor mcgonagall tartly no not another word of complaint potter and as for you miss johnson you will confine your shouting matches to the quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team captaincy 
 
 professor mcgonagall strode back towards the staff table angelina gave harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away upon which he flung himself on to the bench beside ron fuming 
 
 taken points off gryffindor because having my hand sliced open every night how is that fair how 
 
 i know mate said ron sympathetically tipping bacon on to plate bang out of order 
 
 hermione however merely rustled the pages of her daily prophet and said nothing 
 
 you think mcgonagall was right do you said harry angrily to the picture of cornelius fudge obscuring face 
 
 i wish she taken points from you but i think right to warn you not to lose your temper with umbridge said voice while fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page clearly giving some kind of speech 
 
 harry did not speak to hermione all through charms but when they entered transfiguration he forgot about being cross with her professor umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head 
 
 excellent whispered ron as they sat down in their usual seats see umbridge get what she deserves 
 
 professor mcgonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew professor umbridge was there 
 
 that will do she said and silence fell immediately mr finnigan kindly come here and hand back the homeworkmiss brown please take this box of be silly girl they hurt youand hand one to each student 
 
 hem hem said professor umbridge employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt dumbledore on the first night of term professor mcgonagall ignored her seamus handed back essay harry took it without looking at him and saw to his relief that he had managed an a 
 
 right then everyone listen closelydean thomas if you do that to the mouse again i shall put you in detentionmost of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell today we shall be 
 
 hem hem said professor umbridge 
 
 yes said professor mcgonagall turning round her eyebrows so close together they seemed to form one long severe line 
 
 i was just wondering professor whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec 
 
 obviously i received it or i would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom said professor mcgonagall turning her back firmly on professor umbridge many of the students exchanged looks of glee as i was saying today we shall be practising the altogether more difficult vanishment of mice now the vanishing spell 
 
 hem hem 
 
 i wonder said professor mcgonagall in cold fury turning on professor umbridge how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me you see i do not generally permit people to talk when i am talking 
 
 professor umbridge looked as though she had just been slapped in the face she did not speak but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously 
 
 looking supremely unconcerned professor mcgonagall addressed the class once more 
 
 as i was saying the vanishing spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished the snail as an invertebrate does not present much of a challenge the mouse as a mammal offers a much greater one this is not therefore magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner so you know the incantation let me see what you can do 
 
 how she can lecture me about not losing my temper with umbridge harry muttered to ron under his breath but he was grinninghis anger with professor mcgonagall had quite evaporated 
 
 professor umbridge did not follow professor mcgonagall around the class as she had followed professor trelawney perhaps she realised professor mcgonagall would not permit it she did however take many more notes while sitting in her corner and when professor mcgonagall finally told them all to pack away she rose with a grim expression on her face 
 
 well a start said ron holding up a long wriggling and dropping it back into the box lavender was passing around 
 
 as they filed out of the classroom harry saw professor umbndge approach the teachers desk he nudged ron who nudged hermione in turn and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop 
 
 how long have you been teaching at hogwarts professor umbridge asked 
 
 years this december said professor mcgonagall brusquely snapping her bag shut 
 
 professor umbridge made a note 
 
 very well she said you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days time 
 
 i can hardly wait said professor mcgonagall in a coldly indifferent voice and she strode off towards the door hurry up you three she added sweeping harry ron and hermione before her 
 
 harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return 
 
 he had thought that the next time he would see umbridge would be in his detention that evening but he was wrong when they walked down the lawns towards the forest for care of magical creatures they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside professor 
 
 you do not usually take this class is that correct harry heard her ask as they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for woodlice like so many living twigs 
 
 quite correct said professor hands behind her back and bouncing on the balls of her feet i am a substitute teacher standing in for professor hagrid 
 
 harry exchanged uneasy looks with ron and hermione malfoy was whispering with crabbe and goyle he would surely love this opportunity to tell tales on hagrid to a member of the ministry 
 
 hmm said professor umbridge dropping her voice though harry could still hear her quite clearly i wonderthe headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the mattercan you tell me what is causing professor very extended leave of absence 
 
 harry saw malfoy look up eagerly and watch umbridge and closely 
 
 fraid i said professor breezily know anything more about it than you do got an owl from dumbledore would i like a couple of weeks teaching work i accepted as much as i know well shall i get started then 
 
 yes please do said professor umbridge scribbling on her clipboard 
 
 umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered amongst the students questioning them on magical creatures most people were able to answer well and spirits lifted somewhat at least the class was not letting hagrid down 
 
 overall said professor umbridge returning to professor side after a lengthy interrogation of dean thomas how do you as a temporary member of staffan objective outsider i suppose you might sayhow do you find hogwarts do you feel you receive enough support from the school management 
 
 oh yes excellent said professor heartily yes very happy with the way things are run very happy indeed 
 
 looking politely incredulous umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on and what are you planning to cover with this class this yearassuming of course that professor hagrid does not return 
 
 oh take them through the creatures that most often come up in owl said professor not much left to studied unicorns and nifflers i thought cover porlocks and kneazles make sure they can recognise crups and knarls you know 
 
 well you seem to know what doing at any rate said professor umbridge making a very obvious tick on her clipboard harry did not like the emphasis she put on you and liked it even less when she put her next question to goyle now i hear there have been injuries in this class 
 
 goyle gave a stupid grin malfoy hastened to answer the question 
 
 that was me he said i was slashed by a hippogriff 
 
 a hippogriff said professor umbridge now scribbling frantically 
 
 only because he was too stupid to listen to what hagrid told him to do said harry angrily 
 
 both ron and hermione groaned professor umbridge turned her head slowly in direction 
 
 another detention i think she said softly well thank you very much professor i think all i need here you will be receiving the results of your inspection within ten days 
 
 jolly good said professor and professor umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle 
 
 it was nearly midnight when harry left office that night his hand now bleeding so severely that it was staining the scarf he had wrapped around it he expected the common room to be empty when he returned but ron and hermione had sat up waiting for him he was pleased to see them especially as hermione was disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical 
 
 here she said anxiously pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid towards him soak your hand in that a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles it should help 
 
 harry placed his bleeding aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief crookshanks curled around his legs purring loudly then leapt into his lap and settled down 
 
 thanks he said gratefully scratching behind ears with his left hand 
 
 i still reckon you should complain about this said ron in a low voice 
 
 no said harry flatly 
 
 mcgonagall would go nuts if she knew 
 
 yeah she probably would said harry dully and how long do you reckon take umbridge to pass another decree saying anyone who complains about the high inquisitor gets sacked immediately 
 
 ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again defeated 
 
 an awful woman said hermione in a small voice know i was just saying to ron when you came in got to do something about her 
 
 i suggested poison said ron grimly 
 
 no i mean something about what a dreadful teacher she is and how not going to learn any defence from her at all said hermione 
 
 well what can we do about that said ron yawning s too late it got the job here to stay make sure of that 
 
 well said hermione tentatively you know i was thinking today she shot a slightly nervous look at harry and then plunged on i was thinking that maybe the come when we should justjust do it ourselves 
 
 do what ourselves said harry suspiciously still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacles 
 
 welllearn defence against the dark arts ourselves said hermione 
 
 come off it groaned ron you want us to do extra work realise harry and i are behind on homework again and only the second week 
 
 but this is much more important than homework said hermione 
 
 harry and ron goggled at her 
 
 i think there was anything in the universe more important than homework said ron 
 
 be silly of course there is said hermione and harry saw with an ominous feeling that her face was suddenly alight with the kind of fervour that spew usually inspired in her about preparing ourselves like harry said in first lesson for waiting for us out there about making sure we really can defend ourselves if we learn anything for a whole year 
 
 we do much by ourselves said ron in a defeated voice i mean all right we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practise them i suppose 
 
 no i agree gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books said hermione we need a teacher a proper one who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if going wrong 
 
 if talking about lupin harry began 
 
 no no not talking about lupin said hermione too busy with the order and anyway the most we could see him is during hogsmeade weekends and not nearly often enough 
 
 who then said harry frowning at her 
 
 hermione heaved a very deep sigh 
 
 it obvious she said talking about 
 
 there was a silence a light night breeze rattled the windowpanes behind ron and the fire guttered 
 
 about me what said harry 
 
 talking about you teaching us defence against the dark arts 
 
 harry stared at her then he turned to ron ready to exchange the exasperated looks they sometimes shared when hermione elaborated on schemes like spew to consternation however ron did not look exasperated 
 
 he was frowning slightly apparently thinking then he said an idea 
 
 an idea said harry 
 
 you said ron teaching us to do it 
 
 but 
 
 harry was grinning now sure the pair of them were pulling his leg 
 
 but not a teacher i 
 
 harry the best in the year at defence against the dark arts said hermione 
 
 me said harry now grinning more broadly than ever no not beaten me in every test 
 
 actually i said hermione coolly you beat me in our third yearthe only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject but not talking about test results harry think what done 
 
 how mean 
 
 you know what not sure i want someone this stupid teaching me ron said to hermione smirking slightly he turned to harry 
 
 think he said pulling a face like goyle concentrating uh first yearyou saved the stone from 
 
 but that was luck said harry it skill 
 
 second year ron interrupted you killed the basilisk and destroyed riddle 
 
 yeah but if fawkes turned up i 
 
 third year said ron louder still you fought off about a hundred dementors at once 
 
 you know that was a fluke if the 
 
 last year ron said almost shouting now you fought off again 
 
 listen to me said harry almost angrily because ron and hermione were both smirking now just listen to me all right it sounds great when you say it like that but all that stuff was lucki know what i was doing half the time i plan any of it i just did whatever i could think of and i nearly always had help 
 
 ron and hermione were still smirking and harry felt his temper rise he even sure why he was feeling so angry 
 
 sit there grinning like you know better than i do i was there i he said heatedly i know what went on all right and i get through any of that because i was brilliant at defence against the dark arts i got through it all because because help came at the right time or because i guessed rightbut i just blundered through it all i have a clue what i was doingstop laughing 
 
 the bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed he became aware that he was on his feet though he remember standing up crookshanks streaked away under a sofa ron and smiles had vanished 
 
 you know what of never had to face him have you you think just memorising a bunch of spells and throwing them at him like in class or something the whole time sure you know nothing between you and dying except your ownyour own brain or guts or whateverlike you can think straight when you know about a nanosecond from being murdered or tortured or watching your friends die never taught us that in their classes what like to deal with things like thatand you two sit there acting like a clever little boy to be standing here alive like diggory was stupid like he messed upyou just get it that could just as easily have been me it would have been if voldemort needed me 
 
 we saying anything like that mate said ron looking aghast we having a go at diggory we got the wrong end of the 
 
 he looked helplessly at hermione whose face was stricken 
 
 harry she said timidly you see this this is exactly why we need you we need to know what like facing him facing 
 
 it was the first time she had ever said name and it was this more than anything else that calmed harry still breathing hard he sank back into his chair becoming aware as he did so that his hand was throbbing horribly again he wished he had not smashed the bowl of murtlap essence 
 
 well think about it said hermione quietly please 
 
 harry could not think of anything to say he was feeling ashamed of his outburst already he nodded hardly aware of what he was agreeing to 
 
 hermione stood up 
 
 well off to bed she said in a voice that was clearly as natural as she could make it erm night 
 
 ron had got to his feet too 
 
 coming he said awkwardly to harry 
 
 yeah said harry in in a minute just clear this up 
 
 he indicated the smashed bowl on the floor ron nodded and left 
 
 reparo harry muttered pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china they flew back together good as new but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl 
 
 he was suddenly so tired he was tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there but instead he forced himself to his feet and followed ron upstairs his restless night was punctuated once more by dreams of long corridors and locked doors and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter fifteen the unbreakable vowcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 snow was swirling against the icy windows once more christmas was approaching fast hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve christmas trees to the great hall garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors large groups of girls tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunches every time harry went past which caused blockages in the corridors fortunately however frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually good knowledge of the secret passageways so that he was often without too much difficulty to navigate routes between classes 
 
 ron who might once have found the necessity of these detours excuse for jealousy rather than hilarity simply roared with laughter about it all although harry much preferred this new laughing joking ron to the moody aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks the improved ron came at a heavy price firstly harry had to put up with the frequent presence of lavender brown who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing ron as a moment wasted and secondly harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again 
 
 ron whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from bird attack was taking a defensive and resentful tone 
 
 she complain he told harry she snogged krum so found out someone wants to snog me too well a free country i done anything wrong 
 
 harry did not answer but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before charms next morning quintessence a quest determined as he was to remain friends with both ron and hermione he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight 
 
 i never promised hermione anything ron mumbled i mean all right i was going to go to christmas party with her but she never said just as friends a free agent 
 
 harry turned a page of quintessence aware that ron was watching him voice trailed away in mutters barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire though harry thought he caught the words krum and complain again 
 
 schedule was so full that harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings when ron was in any case so tightly wrapped around lavender that he did not notice what harry was doing hermione refused to sit in the common room while ron was there so harry generally joined her in the library which meant that their conversations were held in whispers 
 
 at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes said hermione while the librarian madam pince prowled the shelves behind them i really care less 
 
 she raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment harry said nothing he thought his voice might soon vanish from the lack of use he bent a little lower over advanced and continued to make notes on everlasting elixirs occasionally pausing to decipher the useful additions to libatius text 
 
 and incidentally said hermione after a few moments you need to be careful 
 
 for the last time said harry speaking in a slightly hoarse tone after of an silence i am not giving back this book learned more from the prince than snape or slughorn have taught me in 
 
 not talking about your stupid prince said hermione giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her talking about earlier i went into the girls bathroom just before i came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there including that romilda vane trying to decide how to slip you a love potion all hoping going to get you to take them to party and thay all seem to have bought fred and love potions which afraid to say probably work 
 
 why you confiscate them then demanded harry it seemed extraordinary that mania for upholding the rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture 
 
 they have the potions with them in the bathroom said hermione scornfully they were just discussing tactics as i doubt the prince she gave the book another scornful look could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once just invite someone to go with you stop all the others thinking still got a chance tomorrow night getting desperate 
 
 there anyone i want to invite mumbled harry who was still not trying to think about ginny any more than he could help despite the fact the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankful that ron could not perform legilimency 
 
 well just be careful what you drink because romilda vane looked like she meant business said hermione grimly 
 
 she hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill harry watched her with his mind a long way away 
 
 hang on a moment he said slowly i thought filch had banned anything bought at wizard wheezes 
 
 and when has anyone ever paid attention to what filch has banned asked hermione still concentrating on her essay 
 
 but i thought all the owls were being searched so how come these girls are able to bring love potions into the school 
 
 fred and george send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions said hermione part of their owl order service 
 
 you know a lot about it 
 
 hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of advanced 
 
 it was all on the back of the bottles they showed ginny and me in the summer she said coldly i go around putting potions in drinks or pretending too either which is just as bad 
 
 yeah well never mind that said harry quickly the point is filch is being fooled he these girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else so why malfoy have brought the necklace into the school 
 
 oh harry not that again 
 
 come on why not demanded harry 
 
 look sighed hermione secrecy sensors detect jinxes curses and concealment charms they used to find dark magic and dark objects have picked up a powerful curse like the one in the necklace within seconds but something just been put in the wrong bottle registerand anyway love potions dark or dangerous 
 
 easy for you to say muttered harry thinking of romilda vane 
 
 so it would be down to filch to realise it a cough potion and not a very good wizard i doubt he can tell one potion from 
 
 hermione stopped dead harry had heard it too somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves they waited and a moment later the countenance of madam pince appeared around the corner her sunken cheeks her skin like parchment and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying 
 
 the library is now closed she said mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correctwhat have you been doing to that book you depraved boy 
 
 it the mine said harry hastily snatching his copy of advanced off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand 
 
 despoiled she hissed desecrated befouled 
 
 just a book been written on said harry tugging it out of her grip 
 
 she looked as though she might have a seizure hermione who had hastily packed her things grabbed harry by the arm and frogmarched him away 
 
 ban you from the library if not careful why did you have to bring that stupid book 
 
 not my fault barking mad hermione or think she overheard you being rude about filch always thought there might be something between them 
 
 oh ha ha 
 
 enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again they made their way along the deserted corridors back to the common room arguing whether or not filch and madam pince were secretly in love with each other 
 
 baubles said harry to the fat lady this being the new festive password 
 
 same to you said the fat lady with a roguish grin and she swung forward to admit them 
 
 hi harry said romilda vane the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole fancy a gillywater 
 
 hermione gave him a look over her shoulder 
 
 no thanks said harry quickly i like it much 
 
 well take these anyway said romilda thrusting a box into his hands chocolate cauldrons got firewhiskey in them my gran sent them to me but i like them 
 
 ohrightthanks a lot said harry who could not think what else to say just going over here with 
 
 he hurried off behind hermione his voice tailing away feebly 
 
 told you said hermione succinctly sooner you ask someone sooner all leave you alone and you can 
 
 but her face suddnly turned blank she had just spotted ron and lavender who were intertwined in the same armchair 
 
 well goodnight harry said hermione though it was only seven in the evening and she left for the girls dormitory without another word 
 
 harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle through plus party after which he and ron would depart together for the burrow it now seemed impossible that ron and hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began but perhaps somehow the break would give them time to calm down think better of their behavior 
 
 but his hopes were not high and they sank still lower after enduring a transfiguration lesson with them both next day they had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration working in front of mirrors they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows hermione laughed unkindly at disastrous first attempt during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time professor mcgonagall asked a question which lavender and parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced hermione to the verge of tears again she raced out of the classroom on the bell leaving half her things behind harry deciding that her need was greater than just now scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her 
 
 he finally tracked her down as she emerged from a bathroom on the floor below she was accompanied by luna lovegood who was patting her vaguely on the back 
 
 oh hello harry said luna did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow 
 
 hi luna hermione you left your stuff 
 
 he held out her books 
 
 oh yes said hermione in a choked voice taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact she was wiping her eyes with her pencil case thank you harry well better get going 
 
 and she hurried off without ever giving harry any time to offer words of comfort though admittedly he could not think of any 
 
 a bit upset said luna i thought at first it was moaning myrtle in there but it turned out to be hermione she said something about ron weasley 
 
 yeah had a row said harry 
 
 he says funny things sometimes he said luna as they set off down the corridor together but he can be a bit unkind i noticed that last year 
 
 i said harry luna was demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths he had never met anyone quite like her so have you had a good term 
 
 oh been all right said luna a bit lonely without the been nice though she stopped two boys in our transfiguration class calling me loony the other day 
 
 how would you like to come to party with me tonight 
 
 the words were out of mouth before he could stop them he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking 
 
 luna turned her protuberant eyes to him in surprise 
 
 party with you 
 
 yeah said harry supposed to bring guests so i thought you might like i mean he was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear i mean just as friends you know but if you want to 
 
 he was already that she want to 
 
 oh no love to go with you as friends said luna beaming as he had never seen her beam before ever asked me to a party before as a friend is that why you dyed your eyebrow for the party should i do mine too 
 
 no said harry firmly that was a mistake get hermione to put it right for me so meet you in the entrance hall at eight then 
 
 aha screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped unnoticed by either of them they had just passed underneath peeves who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them 
 
 potty asked loony to go to the party potty lurves loony potty luuuuuurves looooony 
 
 and he zoomed away cackling and shrieking potty loves loony 
 
 nice to keep these things private said harry and sure enough in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that harry potter was taking luna lovegood to party 
 
 you taken anyone said ron in disbelief over dinner anyone and you chose loony lovegood 
 
 call her that ron snapped ginny pausing behind harry on her way to join friends really glad taking her harry so excited 
 
 and she moved on down the table to sit with dean harry tried to feel pleased that ginny was glad he was taking luna to the party but could not quite manage it a long way along the table hermione was sitting alone playing with her stew harry noticed ron looking at her furtively 
 
 you could say sorry suggested harry bluntly 
 
 what and get attacked by another flock of canaries muttered ron 
 
 what did you have to imitate her for 
 
 she laughed at my mustache 
 
 so did i it was the stupidest thing ever seen 
 
 but ron did not seem to have heard lavender had just arrived with parvati squeezing herself in between harry and ron lavender flung her arms around neck 
 
 hi harry said parvati who like harry looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends 
 
 hi said harry you staying at hogwarts then i heard your parents wanted you to leave 
 
 i managed to talk them out of it for the time being said parvati that katie thing really freaked them out but as there been anything since oh hi hermione 
 
 parvati positively beamed harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at hermione in transfiguration he looked around and saw that hermione was beaming back if possible even more brightly girls were very strange sometimes 
 
 hi parvati said hermione ignoring ron and lavender completely are you going to party tonight 
 
 no invite said parvati gloomily love to go though it sounds like going to be really good going you 
 
 yes meeting cormac at eight and 
 
 there was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and ron surfaced hermione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything 
 
 going up to the party together 
 
 cormac said parvati cormac mclaggen you mean 
 
 right said hermione sweetly the one who almost she put a great deal of emphasis on the word became gryffindor keeper 
 
 are you going out with him then asked parvati 
 
 you know said harmione with a most giggle 
 
 no said parvati looking positively agog at this piece of gossip wow you like your quidditch players you first krum then mclaggen 
 
 i like really good quidditch players hermione corrected her still smiling well see you got to go and get ready for the party 
 
 she left at once lavender and parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development with everything they had ever heard about mclaggen and all they had ever guessed about hermione ron looked strangely blank and said nothing harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge 
 
 when he arrived in the entrance hall at eight that night he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached luna she was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of giggles from the onlookers but otherwise she looked quite nice harry was glad in any case that she had left off her radish earrings her necklace and her spectrespecs 
 
 hi he said shall we get going then 
 
 oh yes she said happily where is the party 
 
 office said harry leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering did you hear supposed to be a vampire coming 
 
 rufus scrimgeour asked luna 
 
 iwhat said harry disconcerted you mean the minister of magic 
 
 yes a vampire said luna father wrote a very long article about it when scrimgeour first took over from cornelius fudge but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the ministry obviously they want the truth to get out 
 
 harry who thought it most unlikely that rufus scrimgeour was a vampire but who was used to luna repeating her bizarre views as though they were fact did not reply they were already approaching office and the sounds of laughter music and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took 
 
 whether it had been built that way or because he had used magical trickery to make it so office was much larger than the usual study the ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald crimson and gold hangings so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent the room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering each a brilliant speck of light loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation and a number of were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing so that they looked like little roving tables 
 
 harry boomed slughorn almost as soon as harry and luna had squeezed in through the door come in come in so many people like you to meet 
 
 slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket gripping arm so tightly he might have been hoping to disapparate with him slughorn led him purposefully into the party harry seized hand and dragged her along with him 
 
 harry like you to meet eldred worple an old student of mine author of blood brothers my life amongst the vampiresand of course his friend sanguini 
 
 worple who was a small stout bespectacled man grabbed hand and shook it enthusiastically the vampire sanguini who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes merely nodded he looked rather bored a gaggle of girls was standing close to him looking curious and excited 
 
 harry potter i am simply delighted said worple peering up into face i was saying to professor slughorn only the other day where is the biography of harry potter for which we have all been waiting 
 
 er said harry were you 
 
 just as modest as horace described said worple but seriously his manner changed it became suddenly i would be delighted to write it myself people are craving to know more about you dear boy craving if you were prepared to grant me a few interviews say in four or sessions why we could have the book finished within months and all with very little effort on your part i assure youask sanguini here if it quite sanguini stay here added worple suddenly stern for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls a rather hungry look in his eye here have a pasty said worple seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into hand before turning his attention back to harry 
 
 my dear boy the gold you could make you have no idea 
 
 definitely not interested said harry firmly and just seen a friend of mine sorry 
 
 he pulled luna after him into the crowd he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the weird sisters 
 
 hermione hermione 
 
 harry there you are thank goodness hi luna 
 
 happened to you asked harry for hermione looked distinctly disheveled rather as though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of snare 
 
 oh just escapedi mean just left cormac she said under the mistletoe she added in explanation as harry continued to look questioningly at her 
 
 serves you right for coming with him he told her severely 
 
 i thought annoy ron most said hermione dispassionately i debated for a while about zacharias smith but i thought on the whole 
 
 you considered smith said harry revolted 
 
 yes i did and starting to wish chosen him mclaggen makes grawp look a gentleman go this way be able to see him coming so tall 
 
 the three of them made their way over to the other side of the room scooping up goblets of mead on the way realizing too late that professor trelawney was standing there alone 
 
 hello said luna politely to professor trelawney 
 
 good evening my dear said professor trelawney focusing upon luna with some difficulty harry could smell cooking sherry again i seen you in my classes lately 
 
 no got firenze this year said luna 
 
 oh of course said professor trelawney with an angry drunken titter or dobbin as i prefer to think of him you would have thought would you not that now i am returned to the school professor dumbledore might have got rid of the horse but no we share classes an insult frankly an insult do you know 
 
 professor trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized harry under cover of her furious criticisms of firenze harry drew closer to hermione and said let me get something straight are you planning to tell ron that you interfered at keeper tryouts 
 
 hermione raised her eyebrows 
 
 do you really think stoop that low 
 
 harry looked at her shrewdly 
 
 hermione if you can ask out mclaggen 
 
 a difference said hermione with dignity got no plans to tell ron anything about what might or might not have happened at keeper tryouts 
 
 good said harry fervently because just fall apart again and lose the next match 
 
 quidditch said hermione angrily is that all boys care about cormac asked me one single question about myself no just been treated to a hundred great saves made by cormac mclaggen ever sinceoh no here he comes 
 
 she moved so fast it was as though she had disapparated one moment she was there the next she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished 
 
 seen hermione asked mclaggen forcing his way through the throng a minute later 
 
 no sorry said harry and he turned quickly to join in conversation forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking 
 
 harry potter said professor trelawney in deep vibrant tones noticing him for the first time 
 
 oh hello said harry unenthusiastically 
 
 my dear boy she said in a very carrying whisper the rumors the stories the chosen one of course i have known for a very long time the omens were never good harry but why have you not returned to divination for you of all people the subject is of the utmost importance 
 
 ah sybill we all think our most important said a loud voice and slughorn appeared at professor other side his face very red his velvet hat a little askew a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other but i think ever known such a natural at potions said slughorn regarding harry with a fond if bloodshot eye instinctive you knowlike his mother only ever taught a few with this kind of ability i can tell you that sybillwhy even severus 
 
 and to horror slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop snape out of thin air toward them 
 
 stop skulking and come and join us severus hiccuped slughorn happily i was just talking about exceptional some credit must go to you of course you taught him for five years 
 
 trapped with arm around his shoulders snape looked down his hooked nose at harry his black eyes narrowed 
 
 funny i never had the impression that i managed to teach potter anything at all 
 
 well then natural ability shouted slughorn you should have seen what he gave me first lesson draught of living deathnever had a student produce finer on a first attempt i think even you severus 
 
 really said snape quietly his eyes still boring into harry who felt a certain disquiet the last thing he wanted was for snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at potions 
 
 remind me what other subjects taking harry asked slughorn 
 
 defense against the dark arts charms transfiguration herbology 
 
 all the subjects required in short for an auror said snape with the faintest sneer 
 
 yeah well what like to do said harry defiantly 
 
 and a great one make too boomed slughorn 
 
 i think you should be an auror harry said luna unexpectedly everybody looked at her the aurors are part of the rotfang conspiracy i thought everyone knew that planning to bring down the ministry of magic from within using a combination of dark magic and gum disease 
 
 harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh really it had been worth bringing luna just for this emerging from his goblet coughing sopping wet but still grinning he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher draco malfoy being dragged by the ear toward them by argus filch 
 
 professor slughorn wheezed filch his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of in his bulging eyes i discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor he claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out did you issue him with an invitation 
 
 malfoy pulled himself free of grip looking furious 
 
 all right i invited he said angrily i was trying to gatecrash happy 
 
 no not said filch a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face in trouble you are the headmaster say that prowling is out unless got permission he eh 
 
 all right argus all right said slughorn waving a hand christmas and not a crime to want to come to a party just this once forget any punishment you may stay draco 
 
 expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable but why harry wondered watching him did malfoy look almost equally unhappy and why was snape looking at malfoy as though both angry and was it possible a little afraid 
 
 but almost before harry had registered what he had seen filch had turned and shuffled away muttering under his breath malfoy had composed his face into a smile and was thanking slughorn for his generosity and face was smoothly inscrutable again 
 
 nothing nothing said slughorn waving away thanks i did know your grandfather after all 
 
 he always spoke very highly of you sir said malfoy quickly said you were the best ever known 
 
 harry stared at malfoy it was not the that intrigued him he had watched malfoy do that to snape for a long time it was the fact that malfoy did after all look a little ill this was the first time he had seen malfoy close up for ages he now saw that malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin 
 
 like a word with you draco said snape suddenly 
 
 now severus said slughorn hiccuping again christmas be too hard 
 
 his head of house and i shall decide how hard or otherwise to be said snape curtly follow me draco 
 
 they left snape leading the way malfoy looking resentful harry stood there for a moment irresolute then said be back in a bit lunaerbathroom 
 
 all right she said cheerfully and he thought he heard her as he hurried off into the crowd resume the subject of the rotfang conspiracy with professor trelawney who seemed sincerely interested 
 
 it was easy once out of the party to pull his invisibility cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself for the corridor was quite deserted what was more difficult was finding snape and malfoy harry ran down the corridor the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from office behind him perhaps snape had taken malfoy to his office in the dungeons or perhaps he was escorting him back to the slytherin common room harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until with a great jolt of excitement he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices 
 
 cannot afford mistakes draco because if you are expelled 
 
 i have anything to do with it all right 
 
 i hope you are telling the truth because it was both clumsy and foolish already you are suspected of having a hand in it 
 
 who suspects me said malfoy angrily for the last time i do it okay that bell girl had an enemy no one knows look at me like that i know what doing not stupid but it worki can stop you 
 
 there was a pause and then snape said quietly ah aunt bellatrix has been teaching you occlumency i see what thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master draco 
 
 not trying to conceal anything from him i just want you butting in 
 
 harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole what had happened to make malfoy speak to snape like thissnape toward whom he had always shown respect even liking 
 
 so that is why you have been avoiding me this term you have feared my interference you realize that had anybody else failed to come to my office when i had told them repeatedly to be there draco 
 
 so put me in detention report me to dumbledore jeered malfoy 
 
 there was another pause then snape said you know perfectly well that i do not wish to do either of those things 
 
 better stop telling me to come to your office then 
 
 listen to me said snape his voice so low now that harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear i am trying to help you i swore to your mother i would protect you i made the unbreakable vow draco 
 
 looks like have to break it then because i need your protection my job he gave it to me and doing it got a plan and going to work just taking a bit longer than i thought it would 
 
 what is your plan 
 
 none of your business 
 
 if you tell me what you are trying to do i can assist you 
 
 i have all the assistance i need thanks not alone 
 
 you were certainly alone tonight which was foolish in the extreme wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup these are elementary mistakes 
 
 i had crabbe and goyle with me if you put them in detention 
 
 keep your voice down spat snape for voice had risen excitedly if your friends crabbe and goyle intend to pass their defense against the dark arts this time around they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres 
 
 what does it matter said malfoy defense against the dark all just a joke it an act like any of us need protecting against the dark arts 
 
 it is an act that is crucial to success draco said snape where do you think i would have been all these years if i had not known how to act now listen to me you are being incautious wandering around at night getting yourself caught and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like crabbe and goyle 
 
 not the only ones got other people on my side better people 
 
 then why not confide in me and i can 
 
 i know what up to you want to steal my glory 
 
 there was another pause then snape said coldly you are speaking like a child i quite understand that your capture and imprisonment has upset you but 
 
 harry had barely a warning he heard footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open malfoy was striding away down the corridor past the open door of office around the distant corner and out of sight 
 
 hardly daring to breathe harry remained crouched down as snape emerged slowly from the classroom his expression unfathomable he returned to the party harry remained on the floor hidden beneath the cloak his mind racing 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter fifteen the goblins revengecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 early next morning before the other two were awake harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest most gnarled and tree he could find there in its shadows he buried moodys eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand it was not much but harry felt that would have much preferred this to being stuck on dolores umbridges door then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake and discuss what they were going to do next 
 
 harry and hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long and ron agreed with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing while harry and ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there then they disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town 
 
 once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments harry ventured out under the invisibility cloak to find sustenance this however did not go as planned he had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill a descending mist and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood 
 
 but you can make a brilliant patronus protested ron when harry arrived back at the tent empty handed out of breath and mouthing the single word dementors 
 
 i couldnt make one he panted clutching the stitch in his side wouldnt come 
 
 their expressions of consternation and disappointment made harry feel ashamed it had been a nightmarish experience seeing the dementors gliding out of the must in the distance and realizing as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears that he was not going to be able to protect himself it had taken all harrys willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the muggles who might not be able to see them but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went 
 
 so we still havent got any food 
 
 shut up ron snapped hermione harry what happened why do you think you couldnt make your patronus you managed perfectly yesterday 
 
 i dont know 
 
 he sat low in one of perkinss old armchairs feeling more humiliated by the moment he was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him yesterday seemed a long time ago today me might have been thirteen years old again the only one who collapsed on the hogwarts express 
 
 ron kicked a chair leg 
 
 what he snarled at hermione im starving all ive had since i bled half to death is a couple of toadstools 
 
 you go and fight your way through the dementors then said harry stung 
 
 i would but my arms in a sling in case you hadnt noticed 
 
 thats convenient 
 
 and whats that supposed to c 
 
 of course cried hermione clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence harry give me the locket come on she said impatiently clicking her fingers at him when he did not react the horcrux harry youre still wearing it 
 
 she held out her hands and harry lifted the golden chain over his head the moment it parted contact with harrys skin he felt oddly light he had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted 
 
 better asked hermione 
 
 yeah loads better 
 
 harry she said crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick you dont think youve been possessed do you 
 
 what no he said defensively i remember everything weve done while ive bee wearing it i wouldnt know what id done if id been possessed would i ginny told me there were times when she couldnt remember anything 
 
 hmm said hermione looking down at the heavy locket well maybe we ought not to wear it we can just keep it in the tent 
 
 we are not leaving that horcrux lying around harry stated firmly if we lose it if it gets stolen c 
 
 oh all right all right said hermione and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt but well take turns wearing it so nobody keeps it on too long 
 
 great said ron irritably and now weve sorted that out can we please get some food 
 
 fine but well go somewhere else to find it said hermione with half a glance at harry theres no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around 
 
 in the end they settled down for the night in a far flung field belonging to a lonely farm from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread 
 
 its not stealing is it asked hermione in a troubled voice as they devoured scrambled eggs on toast not if i left some money under the chicken coo 
 
 ron rolled his eyes and said with his cheeks bulging oo worry oo much elax 
 
 and indeed it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed the argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night and harry felt cheerful even hopeful as he took the first of the three night watches 
 
 this was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits an empty one bickering and gloom harry was least surprised by this because be had suffered periods of near starvation at the dursleys hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences dour ron however had always been used to three delicious meals a day courtesy of his mother or of the hogwarts and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible whenever lack of food coincided with rons turn to wear the horcrux he became downright unpleasant 
 
 so where next was his constant refrain he did not seem to have any ideas himself but expected harry and hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies accordingly harry and hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other horcruxes and how to destroy the one they already got their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they got no new information 
 
 as dumbledore had told harry that he believed voldemort had hidden the horcruxes in places important to him they kept reciting in a sort of dreary litany those locations they knew that voldemort had lived or visited the orphanage where he had been born and raised hogwarts where he had been educated borgin and burks where he had worked after completing school then albania where he had spent his years of exile these formed the basis of their speculations 
 
 yeah lets go to albania shouldnt take more than an afternoon to search an entire country said ron sarcastically 
 
 there cant be anything there hed already made five of his horcruxes before he went into exile and dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth said hermione we know the snakes not in albania its usually with vol c 
 
 didnt i ask you to stop say that 
 
 fine the snake is usually with c happy 
 
 not particularly 
 
 i cant see him hiding anything at borgin and burkes said harry who had made this point many times before but said it again simply to break the nasty silence borgin and burke were experts at dark objects they wouldve recognized a horcrux straightaway 
 
 ron yawned pointedly repressing a strong urge to throw something at him harry plowed on i still reckon he might have hidden something at hogwarts 
 
 hermione sighed 
 
 but dumbledore would have found it harry 
 
 harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory 
 
 dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of hogwarts secrets im telling you if there was one place vol c 
 
 oi 
 
 then harry shouted goaded past endurance if there was one place that was really important to it was hogwarts 
 
 oh come on scoffed ron his school 
 
 yeah his school it was his first real home the place that meant he was special it meant everything to him and even after he left c 
 
 this is were talking about right not you inquired ron he was tugging at the chain of the horcrux around his neck harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him 
 
 you told us that asked dumbledore to give him a job after he left said hermione 
 
 thats right said harry 
 
 and dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something probably another founders object to make into another horcrux 
 
 yeah said harry 
 
 but he didnt get the job did he said hermione so he never got the chance to find a founders object there and hide it in the school 
 
 okay then said harry defeated forget hogwarts 
 
 
 
 
 without any other leads they traveled into london and hidden beneath the invisibility cloak searching for the orphanage in which voldemort had been raised hermione stole into a library and discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before they visited its site and found a tower block of offices 
 
 we could try digging in to foundations hermione suggested halfheartedly 
 
 he wouldnt have hidden a horcrux here harry said he had known it all along the orphanage had been the place voldemort had been determined to escape he would never have hidden a part of his soul there dumbledore had shown harry that voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places this dismal gray corner of london was as far removed as you could imagine from hogwarts of the ministry or a building like gringotts the wizarding banks with its gilded doors and marble floors 
 
 even without any new idea they continued to move through the countryside pitching the tent in a different place each night for security every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot traveling by apparition to more woods to the shadowy crevices of cliffs to purple moors mountainsides and once a sheltered and pebbly cove every twelve hours or so they passed the horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse game of where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety 
 
 harrys scar kept prickling it happened most often he noticed when he was wearing the horcrux sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain 
 
 what what did you see demanded ron whenever he noticed harry wince 
 
 a face muttered harry every time the same face the thief who stole from gregorovitch 
 
 and ron would turn away making no effort to hide his disappointment harry knew that ron was hoping to bear news of his family or the rest of the order of the phoenix but after all he harry was not a television aerial he could only see what voldemort was thinking at the time not tune in to whatever took his fancy apparently voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face whose name and whereabouts harry felt sure voldemort knew no better than he did as harrys scar continued to burn and the merry boy swam tantalizingly in his memory he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief he could not entirely blame them when they were so desperate for a lead on the horcruxes 
 
 as the days stretched into weeks harry began to suspect that ron and hermione were having conversations without and about him several times they stopped talking abruptly when harry entered the tent and twice he came accidentally upon them huddled a little distance away heads together and talking fast both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water 
 
 harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood and harry was starting to fear that hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership in desperation he tried to think of further horcrux locations but the only one that continued to occur to him was hogwarts and as neither of the others thought this at all likely he stopped suggesting it 
 
 autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it they were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves natural mists joined those cast by the dementors wind and rain added to their troubles the fact that hermione was getting better at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation the lack of other peoples company or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against voldemort 
 
 my mother said ron on night as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in wales can make good food appear out of thin air 
 
 he prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate harry glanced automatically at rons neck and saw as he has expected the golden chain of the horcrux glinting there he managed to fight down the impulse to swear at ron whose attitude would he knew improve slightly when the time came to take off the locket 
 
 your mother cant produce food out of thin air said hermione no one can food is the first of the five principal exceptions to gamps law of elemental transfigura c 
 
 oh speak english cant you ron said prying a fish out from between his teeth 
 
 its impossible to make good food out of nothing you can summon it if you know where it is you can transform it you can increase the quantity if youve already got some c 
 
 well dont bother increasing this its disgusting said ron 
 
 harry caught the fish and i did my best with it i notice im always the one who ends up sorting out the food because im a girl i suppose 
 
 no its because youre supposed to be the best at magic shot back ron 
 
 hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate onto the floor 
 
 you can do the cooking tomorrow ron you can find the ingredients and try and charm them into something worth eating and ill sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see you c 
 
 shut up said harry leaping to his feet and holding up both hands shut up now 
 
 hermione looked outraged 
 
 how can you side with him he hardly ever does the cook c 
 
 hermione be quiet i can hear someone 
 
 he was listening hard his hands still raised warning them not to talk then over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them he heard voices again he looked around at the sneakoscope it was not moving 
 
 you cast the muffliato charm over us right he whispered to hermione 
 
 i did everything she whispered back muffliato and disillusionment charms all of it they shouldnt be able to hear of see us whoever they are 
 
 heavy scuffing and scraping noises plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs told them that several people were clambering down the steep wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank where they had pitched the tent they drew their wands waiting the enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be sufficient in the near total darkness to shield them from the notice of muggles and normal witches and wizards if these were death eaters then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by dark magic for the first time 
 
 the voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage after a moment she drew out three extendible ears and threw one each to harry and ron who hastily inserted the ends of the strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent entrance 
 
 within seconds harry heard a weary male voice 
 
 there ought to be a few salmon in here or dyou reckon its too early in the season accio salmon 
 
 there were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh somebody grunted appreciatively harry pressed the extendable ear deeper into his own over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices but they were not speaking english or any human language he had ever heard it was a rough and unmelodious tongue a string of rattling guttural noises and there seemed to be two speakers one with a slightly lower slower voice than the other 
 
 a fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas large shadows passed between tent and flames the delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction then came the clinking of cutlery on plates and the first man spoke again 
 
 here griphook gornuk 
 
 goblins hermione mouthed at harry who nodded 
 
 thank you said the goblins together in english 
 
 so you three have been on the run how long asked a new mellow and pleasant voice it was vaguely familiar to harry who pictured a man 
 
 six weeks seven i forget said the tired man met up with griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with gornuk not long after nice to have a but of company there was a pause while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground what made you leave ted continued the man 
 
 knew they were coming for me replied ted and harry suddenly knew who he was tonkss father heard death eaters were in the area last week and decided id better run for it refused to register as a on principle see so i knew it was a matter of time knew id have to leave in the end my wife should be okay shes and then i met dean here what a few days ago son 
 
 yeah said another voice and harry ron and hermione stared at each other silent but besides themselves with excitement sure they recognized the voice of dean thomas their fellow gryffindor 
 
 eh asked the first man 
 
 not sure said dean my dad left my mum when i was a kid ive got no proof he was a wizard though 
 
 there was silence for a while except for the sounds of munching then ted spoke again 
 
 ive got to say dirk im surprised to run into you pleased but surprised word was that youd been caught 
 
 i was said dirk i was halfway to azkaban when i made a break for it stunned dawlish and nicked his broom it was easier than youd think i dont reckon hes quite right at the moment might be confunded if so id like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it probably saved my life 
 
 there was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on the ted said and where do you two fit in i er had the impression the goblins were for on the whole 
 
 you had a false impression said the of the goblins we take no sides this is a wizards war 
 
 how come youre in hiding then 
 
 i deemed in prudent said the goblin having refused what i considered an impertinent request i could see that my person safety was in jeopardy 
 
 what did they ask you to do asked ted 
 
 duties the dignity of my race replied the goblin his voice rougher and less human as he said it i am not a 
 
 what about you griphook 
 
 similar reasons said the higher voiced goblin gringotts is no longer under the sole control of my race i recognize no wizarding master 
 
 he added something under his breath in gobbledegook and gornuk laughed 
 
 whats the joke asked dean 
 
 he said replied dirk that there are things wizards dont recognize either 
 
 there was a short pause 
 
 i dont get it said dean 
 
 i had my small revenge before i left said griphook in english 
 
 good man c goblin i should say amended ted hastily didnt manage to lock a death eater up in one of the old vaults i suppose 
 
 if i had the sword would not have helped him break out replied griphook gornuk laughed again and even dirk gave a dry chuckle 
 
 dean and i are still missing something here said ted 
 
 so is severus snape though he does not know it said griphook and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter inside the tent harrys breathing was shallow with excitement he and hermione stared at each other listening as hard as they could 
 
 didnt you hear about that ted asked dirk about the kids who tried to steal gryffindors sword out of snapes office at hogwarts 
 
 an electric current seemed to course through harry jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot 
 
 never heard a word said ted not in the prophet was it 
 
 hardly chortled dirk griphook here told me he heard about it from bill weasley who works for the bank one of the kids who tried to take the sword was bills younger sister 
 
 harry glanced toward hermione and ron both of whom were clutching the extendable ears as tightly as lifelines 
 
 she and a couple of friends got into snapes office and smashed open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the staircase 
 
 ah god bless em said ted what did they think that theyd be able to use the sword on or on snape himself 
 
 well whatever they thought they were going to do with it snape decided the sword wasnt safe where it was said dirk couple of days later once hed got the from i imagine he sent it down to london to be kept in gringotts instead 
 
 the goblins started to laugh again 
 
 im still not seeing the joke said ted 
 
 its a fake rasped griphook 
 
 the sword of gryffindor 
 
 oh yes it is a copy c an excellent copy it is true c but it was the original was forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only armor possesses wherever the genuine sword of gryffindor is it is not in a vault at gringotts bank 
 
 i see said ted and i take it you didnt bother telling the death eaters this 
 
 i saw no reason to trouble them with the information said griphook smugly and now ted and dean joined in gornuk and dirks laughter 
 
 inside the tent harry closed his eyes willing someone to ask the question he needed answered and after a minute that seemed ten dean obliged he was harry remembered with a jolt an of ginnys too 
 
 what happened to ginny and all the others the ones who tried to steal it 
 
 oh they were punished and cruelly said griphook indifferently 
 
 theyre okay though asked ted quickly i mean the weasleys dont need any more of their kids injured do they 
 
 they suffered no serious injury as far as i am aware said griphook 
 
 lucky for them said ted with snapes track record i suppose we should just be glad theyre still alive 
 
 you believe that story then do you ted asked dirk you believe snape killed dumbledore 
 
 course i do said ted youre not going to sit there and tell me you think potter had anything to do with it 
 
 hard to know what to believe these days muttered dirk 
 
 i know harry potter said dean and i reckon hes the real thing c the chosen one or whatever you want to call it 
 
 yeah theres a lot would like to believe hes that son said dirk me included but where is he run for it by the looks of things youd think if he knew anything we dont or had anything special going for him hed be out there now fighting rallying resistance instead of hiding and you know the prophet made a pretty good case against him c 
 
 the prophet scoffed ted you deserve to be lied to if youre still reading that much dirk you want the facts try the quibbler 
 
 there was a sudden explosion of choking and retching plus a good deal of thumping by the sound of it dirk had swallowed a fish bone at last he sputtered the quibbler that lunatic rag of xeno lovegoods 
 
 its not so lunatic these days said ted you want to give it a look xeno is printing all the stuff the prophets ignoring not a single mention of snorkacks in the last issue how long theyll let him get with it mind i dont know but xeno says front page of every issue that any wizard whos against ought to make helping harry potter their priority 
 
 hard to help a boy whos vanished off the face of the earth said dirk 
 
 listen the fact that they havent caught him yets one hell of an achievement said ted id take tips from him gladly its what were trying to do stay free isnt it 
 
 yeah well youve got a point there said dirk heavily with the whole of the ministry and all their informers looking for him id have expected him to be caught by now mind whos to say they havent already caught and killed him without publicizing it 
 
 ah dont say that dirk murmured ted 
 
 there was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks when they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the back or retreat back up the wooded slope deciding the trees would give better cover they extinguished their fire then clambered back up the incline their voices fading away 
 
 harry ron and hermione reeled in the extendable ears harry who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped now found himself unable to say more then ginny c the sword c 
 
 i know said hermione 
 
 she lunged for the tiny beaded bag this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit 
 
 here we are she said between gritted teeth and she pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight harry hurried to help her as they lifted the empty portrait of phineas nigellus free of hermiones bag she kept her wand pointing at it ready to cast a spell at any moment 
 
 if somebody swapped the real sword for the face while it was in dumbledores office she panted as they propped the painting against the side of the tent phineas nigellus would have seen it happen he hangs right beside the case 
 
 unless he was asleep said harry but he still held his breath as hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas her wand directed at its center cleared her throat then said 
 
 er c phineas phineas nigellus 
 
 nothing happened 
 
 phineas nigellus said hermione again professor black please could we talk to you please 
 
 please always helps said a cold snide voice and phineas nigellus slid into his portrait at one hermione cried 
 
 obscura 
 
 a black blindfold appeared over phineas nigelluss clever dark eyes causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain 
 
 what c how dare c what are you c 
 
 im very sorry professor black said hermione but its a necessary precaution 
 
 remove this foul addition at once remove it i say you are ruining a great work of art where am i what is going on 
 
 never mind where we are said harry and phineas nigellus froze abandoning his attempts to peel off the painted blindfold 
 
 can that possible be the voice of the elusive mr potter 
 
 maybe said harry knowing that this would keep phineas nigelluss interest weve got a couple of questions to ask you c about the sword of gryffindor 
 
 ah said phineas nigellus now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight of harry yes that silly girl acted most unwisely there c 
 
 shut up about my sister said ron roughly phineas nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows 
 
 who else is here he asked turning his head from side to side your tone displeases me the girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme thieving from the headmaster 
 
 they werent thieving said harry that sword isnt snapes 
 
 it belongs to professor snapes school said phineas nigellus exactly what claim did the weasley girl have upon it she deserved her punishment as did the idiot longbottom and the lovegood oddity 
 
 neville is not an idiot and luna is not an oddity said hermione 
 
 where am i repeated phineas nigellus starting to wrestle with the blindfold again where have you brought me why have you removed me from the house of my forebears 
 
 never mind that how did snape punish ginny neville and luna asked harry urgently 
 
 professor snape sent them into the forbidden forest to do some work for the oaf hagrid 
 
 hagrids not an oaf said hermione shrilly 
 
 and snape mightve though that was a punishment said harry but ginny neville and luna probably had a good laugh with hagrid the forbidden forest theyve faced plenty worse than the forbidden forest big deal 
 
 he felt relieved he had been imagining horrors the cruciatus curse at the very least 
 
 what we really wanted to know professor black is whether anyone else has um taken out the sword at all maybe its been taken away for cleaning c or something 
 
 phineas nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered 
 
 he said armor does not require cleaning simple girl goblins silver repels mundane dirt imbibing only that which strengthens it 
 
 dont call hermione simple said harry 
 
 i grow weary of contradiction said phineas nigellus perhaps it is time for me to return to the headmasters office 
 
 still blindfolded he began groping the side of his frame trying to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at hogwarts harry had a sudden inspiration 
 
 dumbledore cant you bring us dumbledore 
 
 i beg your pardon asked phineas nigellus 
 
 professor dumbledores portrait c couldnt you bring him along here into yours 
 
 phineas nigellus turned his face in the direction of harrys voice 
 
 evidently it is not only who are ignorant potter the portraits of hogwarts may commune with each other but they cannot travel outside of the castle except to visit a painting of themselves elsewhere dumbledore cannot come here with me and after the treatment i have received at your hands i can assure you that i will not be making a return visit 
 
 slightly crestfallen harry watched phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame 
 
 professor black said hermione couldnt you just tell us please when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case before ginny took it out i mean 
 
 phineas snorted impatiently 
 
 i believe that the last time i saw the sword of gryffindor leave its case was when professor dumbledore used it to break open a ring 
 
 hermione whipped around to look at harry neither of them dared say more in front of phineas nigellus who had at least managed to locate the exit 
 
 well good night to you he said a little waspishly and he began to move out of sight again only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when harry gave a sudden shout 
 
 wait have you told snape you saw this 
 
 phineas nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture 
 
 professor snape has more important things on his mind that the many eccentricities of albus dumbledore potter 
 
 and with that he vanished completely leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop 
 
 harry hermione cried 
 
 i know harry shouted unable to contain himself he punched the air it was more than he had dared to hope for he strode up and down the tent feeling that he could have run a mile he did not even feel hungry anymore hermione was squashing phineas nigelluss back into the beaded bag when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to harry 
 
 the sword can destroy horcruxes blades imbibe only that which strengthens them c harry that swords impregnated with basilisk venom 
 
 and dumbledore didnt give it to me because he still needed it he wanted to use it on the locket c 
 
 c and he must have realized they wouldnt let you have it if he put it in his will c 
 
 c so he made a copy c 
 
 c and put a fake in the glass case c 
 
 c and he left the real one c where 
 
 they gazed at east other harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above them tantalizingly close why hadnt dumbledore told him or had he in fact told harry but harry had not realized it at the time 
 
 think whispered hermione think where would he have left it 
 
 not at hogwarts said harry resuming his pacing 
 
 somewhere in hogsmeade suggested hermione 
 
 the shrieking shack said harry nobody ever goes in there 
 
 but snape knows how to get in wouldnt that be a bit risky 
 
 dumbledore trusted snape harry reminded her 
 
 not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords said hermione 
 
 yeah youre right said harry and he felt even more cheered at the thought that dumbledore had had some reservations however faint about snapes trustworthiness so would he have hidden the sword well away from hogsmeade then what dyou reckon ron ron 
 
 harry looked around for one bewildered moment he thought that ron had left the tent then realized that ron was lying in the shadow of a bunk looking stony 
 
 oh remembered me have you he said 
 
 what 
 
 ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk 
 
 you two carry on dont let me spoil your fun 
 
 perplexed harry looked to hermione for help but she shook her head apparently as nonplussed as he was 
 
 whats the problem asked harry 
 
 problem theres no problem said ron still refusing to look at harry not according to you anyways 
 
 there were several plunks on the canvas over their heads it had started to rain 
 
 well youve obviously got a problem said harry spit it out will you 
 
 ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up he looked mean unlike himself 
 
 all right ill spit it out dont expect me to skip up and down the tent because theres some other damn thing weve got to find just add it to the list of stuff you dont know 
 
 i dont know repeated harry i dont know 
 
 plunk plunk plunk the rain was falling harder and heavier it pattered on the bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark dread doused harrys jubilation ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking 
 
 its not like im not having the time of my life here said ron you know with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night i just hoped you know after wed been running round a few weeks wed have achieved something 
 
 ron hermione said but in such a quiet voice that ron could pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was beating on the tent 
 
 i thought you knew what youd signed up for said harry 
 
 yeah i thought i did too 
 
 so what part of it isnt living up to your expectations asked harry anger was coming to his defense now did you think wed be staying in hotels finding a horcrux every other day did you think youd be back to mummy by christmas 
 
 we thought you knew what you were doing shouted ron standing up and his words harry like scalding knives we thought dumbledore had told you what to do we thought you had a real plan 
 
 ron said hermione this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof but again he ignored her 
 
 well sorry to let you down said harry his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow inadequate ive been straight with you from the start i told you everything dumbledore told me and in the case you havent noticed weve found one horcrux c 
 
 yeah and were about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them c nowhere effing near in other words 
 
 take off the locket ron hermione said her voice unusually high please take it off you wouldnt be talking like this if you hadnt been wearing it all day 
 
 yeah he would said harry who did not want excuses made for ron dyou think i havent noticed the two of you whispering behind my back dyou think i didnt guess you were thinking this stuff 
 
 harry we werent c 
 
 dont lie ron hurled at her you said it too you said you were disappointed you said youd thought he had a bit more to go on than c 
 
 i didnt say it like that c harry i didnt she cried 
 
 the rain was pounding the tent tears were pouring down hermiones face and the excitement of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been a firework that had flared and died leaving everything dark wet and cold the sword of gryffindor was hidden they knew not where and their were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not yet to be dead 
 
 so why are you still here harry asked ron 
 
 search me said ron 
 
 go home then said harry 
 
 yeah maybe i will shouted ron and he took several steps toward harry who did not back away didnt you hear what they said about my sister but you dont give a rats fart do you its only the forbidden forest harry potter doesnt care what happened to her in there c well i do all right giant spiders and mental stuff c 
 
 i was only saying c she was with the others they were with hagrid c 
 
 yeah i get it you dont care and what about the rest of my family the weasleys dont need another kid injured did you hear that 
 
 yeah i c 
 
 not bothered what it meant though 
 
 ron said hermione forcing her way between them i dont think it means anything new has happened anything we dont know about think ron bills already scared plenty of people must have seen that george has lost an ear by now and youre supposed to be on your deathbed with spattergroit im sure thats all he meant c 
 
 oh youre sure are you right then well i wont bother myself about them its all right for you isnt it with your parents safely out of the way c 
 
 my parents are dead harry bellowed 
 
 and mine could be going the same way yelled ron 
 
 then go roared harry go back to them pretend youre got over your spattergroit and mummyll be able to feed you up and c 
 
 ron made a sudden movement harry reacted but before either wand was clear of its owners pocket hermione had raised her own 
 
 prestego she cried and an invisible shield expanded between her and harry on the one side and ron on the other all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell and harry and ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time harry felt a corrosive hatred toward ron something had broken between them 
 
 leave the horcrux harry said 
 
 ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair he turned to hermione 
 
 what are you doing 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 are you staying or what 
 
 i she looked anguished yes c yes im staying ron we said wed go with harry we said wed help c 
 
 i get it you choose him 
 
 ron no c please c come back come back 
 
 she was impeded by her own shield charm by the time she had removed it he had already stormed into the night harry stood quite still and silent listening to her sobbing and calling rons name amongst the trees 
 
 after a few minutes she returned her sopping hair plastered to her face 
 
 hes disapparated 
 
 she threw herself into a chair curled up and started to cry 
 
 harry felt dazed he stooped picked up the horcrux and placed it around his own neck he dragged blankets off rons bunk and threw them over hermione then he climbed onto his own bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof listening to the pounding of the rain 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 ib and little christina 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in the forest that extends from the banks of the gudenau in north 
 jutland a long way into the country and not far from the clear 
 stream rises a great ridge of land which stretches through the 
 wood like a wall westward of this ridge and not far from the 
 river stands a farmhouse surrounded by such poor land that the sandy soil shows itself between the scanty ears of rye and wheat which grow in it some years have passed since the people who lived here cultivated these fields they kept three sheep a pig and two oxen in fact they maintained themselves very well they had quite enough to live upon as people generally have who are content with their lot they even could have afforded to keep two horses but it was a saying among the farmers in those parts the horse eats himself up that is to say he eats as much as he earns jeppe jans 
 cultivated his fields in summer and in the winter he made wooden 
 shoes he also had an assistant a lad who understood as well as he 
 himself did how to make wooden shoes strong but light and in the 
 fashion they carved shoes and spoons which paid well therefore no one could justly call jeppe jans and his family poor people little 
 ib a boy of seven years old and the only child would sit by 
 watching the workmen or cutting a stick and sometimes his finger 
 instead of the stick but one day ib succeeded so well in his 
 carving that he made two pieces of wood look really like two little 
 wooden shoes and he determined to give them as a present to little 
 christina 
 
 and who was little christina she was the daughter 
 graceful and delicate as the child of a gentleman had she been 
 dressed differently no one would have believed that she lived in a 
 hut on the neighboring heath with her father he was a widower and 
 earned his living by carrying firewood in his large boat from the 
 forest to the and on the estate of silkborg and 
 sometimes even to the distant town of randers there was no one 
 under whose care he could leave little christina so she was almost 
 always with him in his boat or playing in the wood among the 
 blossoming heath or picking the ripe wild berries sometimes when 
 her father had to go as far as the town he would take little 
 christina who was a year younger than ib across the heath to the 
 cottage of jeppe jans and leave her there ib and christina agreed 
 together in everything they divided their bread and berries when they 
 were hungry they were partners in digging their little gardens 
 they ran and crept and played about everywhere once they wandered a long way into the forest and even ventured together to climb the high ridge another time they found a few snipes eggs in the wood which was a great event ib had never been on the heath where father lived nor on the river but at last came an opportunity 
 
 father invited him to go for a sail in his boat and the 
 evening before he accompanied the boatman across the heath to his 
 house the next morning early the two children were placed on the top of a high pile of firewood in the boat and sat eating bread and 
 wild strawberries while father and his man drove the boat 
 forward with poles they floated on swiftly for the tide was in their 
 favor passing over lakes formed by the stream in its course 
 sometimes they seemed quite enclosed by reeds and yet 
 there was always room for them to pass out although the old trees 
 overhung the water and the old oaks stretched out their bare branches as if they had turned up their sleeves and wished to show their knotty naked arms old whose roots were loosened from the banks clung with their fibres to the bottom of the stream and the tops of the branches above the water looked like little woody 
 islands the waved themselves to and fro on the river 
 everything made the excursion beautiful and at last they came to 
 the great where the water rushed through the 
 and the children thought this a beautiful sight in those days there 
 was no factory nor any town house nothing but the great farm with 
 its fields in which could be seen a few herd of 
 cattle and one or two farm laborers the rushing of the water through 
 the sluices and the scream of the wild ducks were almost the only 
 signs of active life at silkborg after the firewood had been 
 unloaded father bought a whole bundle of eels and a 
 which were all placed in a basket in the stern of the 
 boat then they returned again up the stream and as the wind was 
 favorable two sails were hoisted which carried the boat on as well 
 as if two horses had been harnessed to it as they sailed on they 
 came by chance to the place where the assistant lived at 
 a little distance from the bank of the river the boat was moored and 
 the two men after desiring the children to sit still both went on 
 shore they obeyed this order for a very short time and then forgot 
 it altogether first they peeped into the basket containing the eels 
 and the then they must needs pull out the pig and take it 
 in their hands and feel it and touch it and as they both wanted 
 to hold it at the same time the consequence was that they let it fall 
 into the water and the pig sailed away with the stream 
 here was a terrible disaster ib jumped ashore and ran a little 
 distance from the boat 
 
 oh take me with you cried christina and she sprang after him 
 in a few minutes they found themselves deep in a thicket and could no longer see the boat or the shore they ran on a little farther and 
 then christina fell down and began to cry 
 
 ib helped her up and said never mind follow me yonder is 
 the house but the house was not yonder and they wandered still 
 farther over the dry rustling leaves of the last year and treading 
 on fallen branches that crackled under their little feet then they 
 heard a loud piercing cry and they stood still to listen 
 
 presently the scream of an eagle sounded through the wood it was an 
 ugly cry and it frightened the children but before them in the 
 thickest part of the forest grew the most beautiful blackberries 
 in wonderful quantities they looked so inviting that the children 
 could not help stopping and they remained there so long eating 
 that their mouths and cheeks became quite black with the juice 
 
 presently they heard the frightful scream again and christina 
 said we shall get into trouble about that pig 
 oh never mind said ib we will go home to my 
 house it is here in the wood so they went on but the road led them 
 out of the way no house could be seen it grew dark and the children 
 were afraid the solemn stillness that reigned around them was now and then broken by the shrill cries of the great horned owl and other 
 birds that they knew nothing of at last they both lost themselves 
 in the thicket christina began to cry and then ib cried too and 
 after weeping and lamenting for some time they stretched themselves 
 down on the dry leaves and fell asleep 
 
 the sun was high in the heavens when the two children woke they 
 felt cold but not far from their on a hill the sun 
 was shining through the trees they thought if they went there they 
 should be warm and ib fancied he should be able to see his 
 house from such a high spot but they were far away from home now in quite another part of the forest they clambered to the top of 
 the rising ground and found themselves on the edge of a declivity 
 which sloped down to a clear transparent lake great quantities of 
 fish could be seen through the clear water sparkling in the 
 rays they were quite surprised when they came so suddenly upon such an unexpected sight 
 
 close to where they stood grew a covered with 
 beautiful nuts they soon gathered some cracked them and ate the 
 fine young kernels which were only just ripe but there was another 
 surprise and fright in store for them out of the thicket stepped a 
 tall old woman her face quite brown and her hair of a deep shining 
 black the whites of her eyes glittered like a on her back she 
 carried a bundle and in her hand a knotted stick she was a gypsy 
 the children did not at first understand what she said she drew out 
 of her pocket three large nuts in which she told them were hidden the 
 most beautiful and lovely things in the world for they were wishing 
 nuts ib looked at her and as she spoke so kindly he took courage 
 and asked her if she would give him the nuts and the woman gave 
 them to him and then gathered some more from the bushes for 
 herself quite a pocket full ib and christina looked at the wishing 
 nuts with wide open eyes 
 
 is there in this nut a carriage with a pair of horses asked 
 ib 
 
 yes there is a golden carriage with two golden horses replied 
 the woman 
 
 then give me that nut said christina so ib gave it to her and 
 the strange woman tied up the nut for her in her handkerchief 
 ib held up another nut is there in this nut a pretty little 
 neckerchief like the one christina has on her neck asked ib 
 
 there are ten neckerchiefs in it she replied as well as 
 beautiful dresses stockings and a hat and veil 
 
 then i will have that one also said christina and it is a 
 pretty one too and then ib gave her the second nut 
 the third was a little black thing you may keep that one 
 said christina it is quite as pretty 
 
 what is in it asked ib 
 
 the best of all things for you replied the gypsy so ib held 
 the nut very tight 
 
 then the woman promised to lead the children to the right path 
 that they might find their way home and they went forward certainly 
 in quite another direction to the one they meant to take therefore no 
 one ought to speak against the woman and say that she wanted to steal the children in the wild they met a forester who knew ib and by his help ib and christina reached home where they found every one had been very anxious about them they were pardoned and forgiven although they really had both done wrong and deserved to get into trouble first because they had let the fall into the water and secondly because they had run away christina was taken back to her house on the heath and ib remained in the on the borders of the wood near the great land ridge 
 
 the first thing ib did that evening was to take out of his 
 pocket the little black nut in which the best thing of all was said 
 to be enclosed he laid it carefully between the door and the 
 and then shut the door so that the nut cracked directly 
 but there was not much kernel to be seen it was what we should call 
 hollow or and looked as if it had been filled with tobacco or rich black earth it is just what i expected exclaimed ib 
 how should there be room in a little nut like this for the best thing 
 of all christina will find her two nuts just the same there will 
 be neither fine clothes or a golden carriage in them 
 
 winter came and the new year and indeed many years passed 
 away until ib was old enough to be confirmed and therefore he went during a whole winter to the clergyman of the nearest village to be prepared 
 
 one day about this time the boatman paid a visit to 
 parents and told them that christina was going to service and that 
 she had been remarkably fortunate in obtaining a good place with most respectable people only think he said she is going to the rich at the hotel in herning many miles west from here 
 she is to assist the landlady in the housekeeping and if afterwards 
 she behaves well and remains to be confirmed the people will treat 
 her as their own daughter 
 
 so ib and christina took leave of each other people already 
 called them the betrothed and at parting the girl showed ib the two 
 nuts which she had taken care of ever since the time that they lost 
 themselves in the wood and she told him also that the little wooden 
 shoes he once carved for her when he was a boy and gave her as a 
 present had been carefully kept in a drawer ever since and so they 
 parted 
 
 after confirmation he remained at home with his mother 
 for he had become a clever shoemaker and in summer managed the farm for her quite alone his father had been dead some time and his 
 mother kept no farm servants sometimes but very seldom he heard 
 of christina through a postillion or who was passing 
 
 but she was well off with the rich innkeeper and after being 
 confirmed she wrote a letter to her father in which was a kind 
 message to ib and his mother in this letter she mentioned that her 
 master and mistress had made her a present of a beautiful new dress 
 and some nice this was of course pleasant news 
 
 one day in the following spring there came a knock at the door 
 of the house where old mother lived and when they opened it 
 lo and behold in stepped the boatman and christina she had come to pay them a visit and to spend the day a carriage had to come from the herning hotel to the next village and she had taken the 
 opportunity to see her friends once more she looked as elegant as a 
 real lady and wore a pretty dress beautifully made on purpose for 
 her there she stood in full dress while ib wore only his working 
 clothes he could not utter a word he could only seize her hand and 
 hold it fast in his own but he felt too happy and glad to open his 
 lips christina however was quite at her ease she talked and 
 talked and kissed him in the most friendly manner even afterwards 
 when they were left alone and she asked did you know me again ib he still stood holding her hand and said at last you are become quite a grand lady christina and i am only a rough working man but i have often thought of you and of old times then they 
 wandered up the great ridge and looked across the stream to the 
 heath where the little hills were covered with the flowering broom 
 ib said nothing but before the time came for them to part it 
 became quite clear to him that christina must be his wife had they 
 not even in childhood been called the betrothed to him it seemed as 
 if they were really engaged to each other although not a word had 
 been spoken on the subject they had only a few more hours to remain together for christina was obliged to return that evening to the 
 neighboring village to be ready for the carriage which was to start 
 the next morning early for herning ib and her father accompanied 
 her to the village it was a fine moonlight evening and when they 
 arrived ib stood holding hand in his as if he could 
 not let her go his eyes brightened and the words he uttered came 
 with hesitation from his lips but from the deepest recesses of his 
 heart christina if you have not become too grand and if you can be 
 contented to live in my house as my wife we will be 
 married some day but we can wait for a while 
 
 oh yes she replied let us wait a little longer ib i can 
 trust you for i believe that i do love you but let me think it 
 over then he kissed her lips and so they parted 
 
 on the way home ib told the boatman that he and christina were as 
 good as engaged to each other and the boatman found out that he had always expected it would be so and went home with ib that evening and remained the night in the farmhouse but nothing further was said of the engagement during the next year two letters passed 
 between ib and christina they were signed faithful till death but 
 at the end of that time one day the boatman came over to see ib with 
 a kind greeting from christina he had something else to say which 
 made him hesitate in a strange manner at last it came out that 
 christina who had grown a very pretty girl was more lucky than ever 
 
 she was courted and admired by every one but her son who had been home on a visit was so much pleased with christina that he wished to marry her he had a very good situation in an office at copenhagen and as she had also taken a liking for him his parents 
 were not unwilling to consent but christina in her heart often 
 thought of ib and knew how much he thought of her so she felt 
 inclined to refuse this good fortune added the boatman at first ib 
 said not a word but he became as white as the wall and shook his 
 head gently and then he spoke christina must not refuse this 
 good fortune 
 
 then will you write a few words to her said the boatman 
 ib sat down to write but he could not get on at all the words 
 were not what he wished to say so he tore up the page the 
 following morning however a letter lay ready to be sent to 
 christina and the following is what he wrote 
 
 the letter written by you to your father i have read and see 
 from it that you are prosperous in everything and that still better 
 fortune is in store for you ask your own heart christina and 
 think over carefully what awaits you if you take me for your 
 husband for i possess very little in the world do not think of me or 
 of my position think only of your own welfare you are bound to me by no promises and if in your heart you have given me one i release you from it may every blessing and happiness be poured out upon you christina heaven will give me the consolation 
 ever your sincere friend ib 
 this letter was sent and christina received it in due time in 
 the course of the following november her banns were published in 
 the church on the heath and also in copenhagen where the 
 bridegroom lived she was taken to copenhagen under the protection 
 of her future because the bridegroom could not spare 
 time from his numerous occupations for a journey so far into 
 jutland on the journey christina met her father at one of the 
 villages through which they passed and here he took leave of her 
 very little was said about the matter to ib and he did not refer to 
 it his mother however noticed that he had grown very silent and 
 pensive thinking as he did of old times no wonder the three nuts 
 came into his mind which the gypsy woman had given him when a child and of the two which he had given to christina these wishing nuts after all had proved true one had contained a gilded carriage and noble horses and the other beautiful clothes all of 
 these christina would now have in her new home at copenhagen her part had come true and for him the nut had contained only black earth the gypsy woman had said it was the best for him perhaps it was and this also would be fulfilled he understood the gypsy meaning now the black earth the dark grave was the best thing for him now 
 
 again years passed away not many but they seemed long years to 
 ib the old innkeeper and his wife died one after the other and the 
 whole of their property many thousand dollars was inherited by their 
 son christina could have the golden carriage now and plenty of 
 fine clothes during the two long years which followed no letter came 
 from christina to her father and when at last her father received one 
 from her it did not speak of prosperity or happiness poor christina 
 neither she nor her husband understood how to economize or save and the riches brought no blessing with them because they had not asked for it 
 
 years passed and for many summers the heath was covered with 
 bloom in winter the snow rested upon it and the rough winds blew 
 across the ridge under which stood sheltered home one spring day the sun shone brightly and he was guiding the plough across his 
 field the ploughshare struck against something which he fancied was a firestone and then he saw glittering in the earth a splinter of 
 shining metal which the plough had cut from something which gleamed brightly in the furrow he searched and found a large golden armlet of superior workmanship and it was evident that the plough had disturbed a grave he searched further and found more 
 valuable treasures which ib showed to the clergyman who explained 
 their value to him then he went to the magistrate who informed the 
 president of the museum of the discovery and advised ib to take the 
 treasures himself to the president 
 
 you have found in the earth the best thing you could find 
 said the magistrate 
 
 the best thing thought ib the very best thing for me and 
 found in the earth well if it really is so then the gypsy woman was 
 right in her prophecy 
 
 so ib went in the from aarhus to copenhagen to him who had only sailed once or twice on the river near his own home this seemed like a voyage on the ocean and at length he arrived at 
 copenhagen the value of the gold he had found was paid to him it was a large sum six hundred dollars then ib of the heath went out and wandered about in the great city 
 
 on the evening before the day he had settled to return with the 
 captain of the ib lost himself in the streets and 
 took quite a different turning to the one he wished to follow he 
 wandered on till he found himself in a poor street of the suburb 
 called haven not a creature could be seen at last a very 
 little girl came out of one of the houses and ib 
 asked her to tell him the way to the street he wanted she looked up 
 timidly at him and began to cry bitterly he asked her what was the 
 matter but what she said he could not understand so he went along 
 the street with her and as they passed under a lamp the light fell 
 on the little face a strange sensation came over ib as he 
 caught sight of it the living breathing embodiment of little 
 christina stood before him just as he remembered her in the days of 
 her childhood he followed the child to the wretched house and 
 ascended the narrow crazy staircase which led to a little garret in 
 the roof the air in the room was heavy and stifling no light was 
 burning and from one corner came sounds of moaning and sighing it was the mother of the child who lay there on a miserable bed with the help of a match ib struck a light and approached her 
 
 can i be of any service to you he asked this little girl 
 brought me up here but i am a stranger in this city are there no 
 neighbors or any one whom i can call 
 
 then he raised the head of the sick woman and smoothed her 
 pillow he started as he did so it was christina of the heath no one 
 had mentioned her name to ib for years it would have disturbed his 
 peace of mind especially as the reports respecting her were not good 
 
 the wealth which her husband had inherited from his parents had made him proud and arrogant he had given up his certain appointment and travelled for six months in foreign lands and on his return had lived in great style and got into terrible debt for a time he had trembled on the high pedestal on which he had placed himself till 
 at last he toppled over and ruin came his numerous merry companions and the visitors at his table said it served him right for he had kept house like a madman one morning his corpse was found in the canal the cold hand of death had already touched the heart of 
 christina her youngest child looked for in the midst of 
 prosperity had sunk into the grave when only a few weeks old and 
 at last christina herself became sick unto death and lay forsaken 
 and dying in a miserable room amid poverty she might have borne in 
 her younger days but which was now more painful to her from the 
 luxuries to which she had lately been accustomed it was her eldest 
 child also a little christina whom ib had followed to her home 
 where she suffered hunger and poverty with her mother 
 
 it makes me unhappy to think that i shall die and leave this poor 
 child sighed she oh what will become of her she could say no 
 more 
 
 then ib brought out another match and lighted a piece of candle 
 which he found in the room and it threw a glimmering light over the 
 wretched dwelling ib looked at the little girl and thought of 
 christina in her young days for her sake could he not love this 
 child who was a stranger to him as he thus reflected the dying 
 woman opened her eyes and gazed at him did she recognize him he never knew for not another word escaped her lips 
 
 in the forest by the river gudenau not far from the heath and 
 beneath the ridge of land stood the little farm newly painted and 
 whitewashed the air was heavy and dark there were no blossoms on the heath the autumn winds whirled the yellow leaves towards the 
 hut in which strangers dwelt but the little farm stood 
 safely sheltered beneath the tall trees and the high ridge the turf 
 blazed brightly on the hearth and within was sunlight the 
 sparkling light from the sunny eyes of a child the birdlike tones 
 from the rosy lips ringing like the song of a lark in spring all 
 was life and joy little christina sat on knee ib was to her 
 both father and mother her own parents had vanished from her 
 memory as a vanishes alike from childhood and age 
 house was well and prettily furnished for he was a prosperous man now while the mother of the little girl rested in the churchyard at 
 copenhagen where she had died in poverty ib had money now money which had come to him out of the black earth and he had christina for his own after all

 angle from behind poster 
 as norton rips the poster from before our eyes stunned faces peer in camera pulls slowly reveal the long crumbling tunnel in the wall 
 int cell minutes later 
 rory tremont a guard barely out of his teens tries not to look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest getting instructions from six different people at once 
 red 
 they got this skinny kid named rory tremont to go in the hole he much in the brains department but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job 
 they slap a flashlight in his hands 
 he was willing to go 
 int tunnel day 
 rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly 
 red 
 probably thought win a bronze star or something 
 int vertical shaft day 
 dark as midnight concrete walls rise on both sides if you imagine them as two huge slices of bread the meat of this particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark tangle of pipes between the cellblocks appears shining his flashlight down the shaft somewhere a rat squeaks 
 red 
 it was his third day on the job 
 rory 
 warden a space here between the walls bout three feet across smells pretty damn bad 
 norton 
 i care what it smells like 
 hadley 
 go on boy we got a hold of you 
 looking none too happy about it rory squeezes from the tunnel and dangles into the shaft he gets lowered shining his light smothered by darkness not having a good time 
 rory 
 gettin worse 
 norton 
 never mind i said just keep going 
 rory 
 smells pretty damn bad warden in fact it smells just like shit 
 his feet touch the ground or what he assumed was the ground not in fact just what it smells like he sinks in past his ankles he slips and sits heavily in it 
 rory 
 oh god what it is shit oh my god shit pull me out fore i blow my groceries oh shit shit oh my gawwwwwwd 
 int cell day 
 red and others listen to violent barfing from below 
 red 
 and then came the unmistakable sound of rory tremont losing his 
 last few meals the whole cellblock heard it i mean it echoed 
 it for red he starts laughing laughing hell bellowing laughter laughing so hard he has to hold himself laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks the look of rage on face makes him laugh all the harder 
 int solitary wing night 
 abrupt silence low angle on steel door 
 red 
 i laughed myself right into solitary two week stretch 
 int solitary night 
 red 
 shit shit oh my god shit 
 he starts laughing all over again fit to split 
 red 
 andy once talked about doing easy time in the hole now i knew what he meant 
 ext shawshank prison wide shot day 
 virgin landscape charming rural road suddenly state police cruisers rocket up the road with sirens and lights 
 red 
 in andy dufresne escaped from shawshank prison 
 ext field day 
 shawshank is half a mile distant we track along a muddy creel as state troopers and prison guards scour the brush a troopee fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick 
 red 
 all they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes a bar of 
 soap and an old damn near worn down to the nub 
 trooper g pulls the from the weeds swish pan 
 to a police photographer his flashbulb glare produces 
 a black and white still photo 
 of the hapless cops posing with reeking uniform and the 
 worn push in on the hammer 
 red 
 i remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel 
 through the wall with it andy did it in less than twenty 
 int cell night 
 once again we see andy using the to scratch his name into the cement suddenly a chunk of cement pops free and hits the floor he stares down at it 
 int cell night 
 andy lies in the dark studying the chunk of concrete in his hands considering the possibilities wrestling with hope 
 red 
 andy loved geology i imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature 
 an ice age here a million years of there plates of 
 bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia 
 int cell night 
 andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen chunk carefully runs his fingertip over it 
 red 
 geology is the study of pressure and time all it takes really pressure and time 
 int cell night 
 rita is now on the wall hanging down over back 
 red 
 that and a big damn poster 
 track in to reveal andy scraping patiently at the concrete 
 red 
 like i said in prison a do most anything to keep his mind 
 occupied 
 he hears footsteps approaching he smoothes the poster down and dives into bed a guard strolls by a moment later shining his

 book eight 
 chapter xv 
 
 on returning late in the evening sonya went to room and to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa open on the table beside her lay letter sonya picked it up and read it 
 as she read she glanced at the sleeping natasha trying to find in her face an explanation of what she was reading but did not find it her face was calm gentle and happy clutching her breast to keep herself from choking sonya pale and trembling with fear and agitation sat down in an armchair and burst into tears 
 how was it i noticed nothing how could it go so far can she have left off loving prince andrew and how could she let kuragin go to such lengths he is a deceiver and a villain plain what will nicholas dear noble nicholas do when he hears of it so this is the meaning of her excited resolute unnatural look the day before yesterday yesterday and today thought sonya but it be that she loves him she probably opened the letter without knowing who it was from probably she is offended by it she could not do such a thing 
 sonya wiped away her tears and went up to natasha again scanning her face 
 natasha she said just audibly 
 natasha awoke and saw sonya 
 ah back 
 and with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of awakening she embraced her friend but noticing look of embarrassment her own face expressed confusion and suspicion 
 sonya read that letter she demanded 
 yes answered sonya softly 
 natasha smiled rapturously 
 no sonya i any longer she said i hide it from you any longer you know we love one another sonya darling he writes sonya 
 sonya stared at natasha unable to believe her ears 
 and bolkonski she asked 
 ah sonya if you only knew how happy i am cried natasha you know what love is 
 but natasha can that be all over 
 natasha looked at sonya with eyes as if she could not grasp the question 
 well then are you refusing prince andrew said sonya 
 oh you understand anything talk nonsense just listen said natasha with momentary vexation 
 but i believe it insisted sonya i understand how is it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly why you have only seen him three times natasha i believe you joking in three days to forget everything and so 
 three days said natasha it seems to me loved him a hundred years it seems to me that i have never loved anyone before you understand it sonya wait a bit sit here and natasha embraced and kissed her 
 i had heard that it happens like this and you must have heard it too but only now that i feel such love not the same as before as soon as i saw him i felt he was my master and i his slave and that i could not help loving him yes his slave whatever he orders i shall do you understand that what can i do what can i do sonya cried natasha with a happy yet frightened expression 
 but think what you are doing cried sonya i leave it like this this secret correspondence how could you let him go so far she went on with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal 
 i told you that i have no will natasha replied why you understand i love him 
 then i let it come to that i shall tell cried sonya bursting into tears 
 what do you mean for sake if you tell you are my enemy declared natasha you want me to be miserable you want us to be separated 
 when she saw fright sonya shed tears of shame and pity for her friend 
 but what has happened between you she asked what has he said to you why he come to the house 
 natasha did not answer her questions 
 for sake sonya tell anyone torture me natasha entreated remember no one ought to interfere in such matters i have confided in you 
 but why this secrecy why he come to the house asked sonya why he openly ask for your hand you know prince andrew gave you complete freedom if it is really so but i believe it natasha have you considered what these secret reasons can be 
 natasha looked at sonya with astonishment evidently this question presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how to answer it 
 i know what the reasons are but there must be reasons 
 sonya sighed and shook her head incredulously 
 if there were reasons she began 
 but natasha guessing her doubts interrupted her in alarm 
 sonya one doubt him one one you understand she cried 
 does he love you 
 does he love me natasha repeated with a smile of pity at her lack of comprehension why you have read his letter and you have seen him 
 but if he is dishonorable 
 he dishonorable if you only knew exclaimed natasha 
 if he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or cease seeing you and if you do this i will i will write to him and i will tell papa said sonya resolutely 
 but i live without him cried natasha 
 natasha i understand you and what are you saying think of your father and of nicholas 
 i want anyone i love anyone but him how dare you say he is dishonorable you know that i love him screamed natasha go away sonya i want to quarrel with you but go for sake go you see how i am suffering natasha cried angrily in a voice of despair and repressed irritation sonya burst into sobs and ran from the room 
 natasha went to the table and without a reflection wrote that answer to princess mary which she had been unable to write all the morning in this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were at an end that availing herself of the magnanimity of prince andrew who when he went abroad had given her her she begged princess mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward her but that she could not be his wife at that moment this all seemed quite easy simple and clear to natasha 
 on friday the rostovs were to return to the country but on wednesday the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near moscow 
 on the day the count left sonya and natasha were invited to a big dinner party at the karagins and marya dmitrievna took them there at that party natasha again met anatole and sonya noticed that she spoke to him trying not to be overheard and that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever when they got home natasha was the first to begin the explanation sonya expected 
 there sonya you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him natasha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be praised we have had an explanation today 
 well what happened what did he say natasha how glad i am not angry with me tell me everything the whole truth what did he say 
 natasha became thoughtful 
 oh sonya if you knew him as i do he said he asked me what i had promised bolkonski he was glad i was free to refuse him 
 sonya sighed sorrowfully 
 but you refused bolkonski said she 
 perhaps i have perhaps all is over between me and bolkonski why do you think so badly of me 
 i think anything only i understand this 
 wait a bit sonya understand everything see what a man he is now think badly of me or of him i think badly of anyone i love and pity everybody but what am i to do 
 sonya did not succumb to the tender tone natasha used toward her the more emotional and ingratiating the expression of face became the more serious and stern grew 
 natasha said she you asked me not to speak to you and i spoken but now you yourself have begun i trust him natasha why this secrecy 
 again again interrupted natasha 
 natasha i am afraid for you 
 afraid of what 
 i am afraid going to your ruin said sonya resolutely and was herself horrified at what she had said 
 anger again showed in face 
 and go to my ruin i will as soon as possible not your business it be you but i suffer leave me alone leave me alone i hate you 
 natasha moaned sonya aghast 
 i hate you i hate you my enemy forever and natasha ran out of the room 
 natasha did not speak to sonya again and avoided her with the same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house taking up now one occupation now another and at once abandoning them 
 hard as it was for sonya she watched her friend and did not let her out of her sight 
 the day before the count was to return sonya noticed that natasha sat by the drawingroom window all the morning as if expecting something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past whom sonya took to be anatole 
 sonya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening natasha was in a strange and unnatural state she answered questions at random began sentences she did not finish and laughed at everything 
 after tea sonya noticed a housemaid at door timidly waiting to let her pass she let the girl go in and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered 
 then suddenly it became clear to sonya that natasha had some dreadful plan for that evening sonya knocked at her door natasha did not let her in 
 she will run away with him thought sonya she is capable of anything there was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today she cried as she said to uncle sonya remembered yes it she means to elope with him but what am i to do thought she recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that natasha had some terrible intention the count is away what am i to do write to kuragin demanding an explanation but what is there to oblige him to reply write to pierre as prince andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune but perhaps she really has already refused bolkonski she sent a letter to princess mary yesterday and uncle is away to tell marya dmitrievna who had such faith in natasha seemed to sonya terrible well anyway thought sonya as she stood in the dark passage now or never i must prove that i remember the goodness to me and that i love nicholas yes if i sleep for three nights not leave this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family be disgraced thought she

 chapter xiii 
 
 little gavroche 
 eight or nine years after the events narrated in the second part of this story people noticed on the boulevard du temple and in the regions of the a little boy eleven or twelve years of age who would have realized with tolerable accuracy that ideal of the gamin sketched out above if with the laugh of his age on his lips he had not had a heart absolutely sombre and empty this child was well muffled up in a pair of trousers but he did not get them from his father and a chemise but he did not get it from his mother 
 some people or other had clothed him in rags out of charity 
 still he had a father and a mother but his father did not think of him and his mother did not love him 
 he was one of those children most deserving of pity among all one of those who have father and mother and who are orphans nevertheless 
 this child never felt so well as when he was in the street the pavements were less hard to him than his heart 
 his parents had despatched him into life with a kick 
 he simply took flight 
 he was a boisterous pallid nimble jeering lad with a vivacious but sickly air 
 he went and came sang played at hopscotch scraped the gutters stole a little but like cats and sparrows gayly laughed when he was called a rogue and got angry when called a thief 
 he had no shelter no bread no fire no love but he was merry because he was free 
 when these poor creatures grow to be men the millstones of the social order meet them and crush them but so long as they are children they escape because of their smallness 
 the tiniest hole saves them 
 nevertheless abandoned as this child was it sometimes happened every two or three months that he said come go and see mamma then he quitted the boulevard the cirque the porte descended to the quays crossed the bridges reached the suburbs arrived at the salpetriere and came to a halt where 
 precisely at that double number with which the reader is acquainted at the gorbeau hovel 
 at that epoch the hovel generally deserted and eternally decorated with the placard 
 chambers to let chanced to be a rare thing inhabited by numerous individuals who however as is always the case in paris had no connection with each other all belonged to that indigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of petty bourgeoisie in straitened circumstances and which extends from misery to misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beings in whom all the material things of civilization end the who sweeps up the mud and the ragpicker who collects scraps 
 the principal lodger of jean day was dead and had been replaced by another exactly like her 
 i know not what philosopher has said 
 old women are never lacking 
 this new old woman was named madame bourgon and had nothing remarkable about her life except a dynasty of three paroquets who had reigned in succession over her soul 
 the most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family of four persons consisting of father mother and two daughters already well grown all four of whom were lodged in the same attic one of the cells which we have already mentioned 
 at first sight this family presented no very special feature except its extreme destitution the father when he hired the chamber had stated that his name was jondrette 
 some time after his moving in which had borne a singular resemblance to the entrance of nothing at all to borrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant this jondrette had said to the woman who like her predecessor was at the same time portress and mother if any one should chance to come and inquire for a pole or an italian or even a spaniard perchance it is i 
 this family was that of the merry barefoot boy 
 he arrived there and found distress and what is still sadder no smile a cold hearth and cold hearts 
 when he entered he was asked whence come you 
 he replied 
 from the street 
 when he went away they asked him 
 whither are you going 
 he replied into the streets 
 his mother said to him 
 what did you come here for 
 this child lived in this absence of affection like the pale plants which spring up in cellars 
 it did not cause him suffering and he blamed no one 
 he did not know exactly how a father and mother should be 
 nevertheless his mother loved his sisters 
 we have forgotten to mention that on the boulevard du temple this child was called little gavroche 
 why was he called little gavroche 
 probably because his name was jondrette 
 it seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the thread 
 the chamber which the jondrettes inhabited in the gorbeau hovel was the last at the end of the corridor 
 the cell next to it was occupied by a very poor young man who was called m marius 
 let us explain who this m marius was

 anatole had lately moved to the plan for natalie abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by dolokhov a few days before and on the day that sonya after listening at door resolved to safeguard her it was to have been put into execution natasha had promised to come out to kuragin at the back porch at ten that evening kuragin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of kamenka where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them at kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to the warsaw highroad and from there they would hasten abroad with post horses 
 anatole had a passport an order for post horses ten thousand rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with help 
 two witnesses for the mock marriage khvostikov a retired petty official whom dolokhov made use of in his gambling transactions and makarin a retired hussar a kindly weak fellow who had an unbounded affection for kuragin were sitting at tea in front room 
 in his large study the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with persian rugs bearskins and weapons sat dolokhov in a traveling cloak and high boots at an open desk on which lay abacus and some bundles of paper money anatole with uniform unbuttoned walked to and fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting through the study to the room behind where his french valet and others were packing the last of his things dolokhov was counting the money and noting something down 
 well he said khvostikov must have two thousand 
 give it to him then said anatole 
 makarka their name for makarin will go through fire and water for you for nothing so here are our accounts all settled said dolokhov showing him the memorandum is that right 
 yes of course returned anatole evidently not listening to dolokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his face 
 dolokhov banged down the or of his and turned to anatole with an ironic smile 
 do you know really better drop it all still time 
 fool retorted anatole talk nonsense if you only knew the devil knows what 
 no really give it up said dolokhov i am speaking seriously no joke this plot hatched 
 what teasing again go to the devil eh said anatole making a grimace really no time for your stupid jokes and he left the room 
 dolokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when anatole had gone out 
 you wait a bit he called after him not joking talking sense come here come here 
 anatole returned and looked at dolokhov trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily 
 now listen to me telling you this for the last time why should i joke about it did i hinder you who arranged everything for you who found the priest and got the passport who raised the money i did it all 
 well thank you for it do you think i am not grateful and anatole sighed and embraced dolokhov 
 i helped you but all the same i must tell you the truth it is a dangerous business and if you think about it a stupid business well carry her off all right will they let it stop at that it will come out that already married why have you in the criminal court 
 oh nonsense nonsense anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace i explain to you what and anatole with the partiality people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning repeated the argument he had already put to dolokhov a hundred times i explain to you that i have come to this conclusion if this marriage is invalid he went on crooking one finger then i have nothing to answer for but if it is valid no matter abroad no one will know anything about it that so and talk to me 
 seriously better drop it only get yourself into a mess 
 go to the devil cried anatole and clutching his hair left the room but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of dolokhov with his feet turned under him the very devil what feel how it beats he took hand and put it on his heart what a foot my dear fellow what a glance a goddess he added in french what 
 dolokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes looked at him evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him 
 well and when the gone what then 
 what then eh repeated anatole sincerely perplexed by a thought of the future what then then i know but why talk nonsense he glanced at his watch time 
 anatole went into the back room 
 now then nearly ready dawdling he shouted to the servants 
 dolokhov put away the money called a footman whom he ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey and went into the room where khvostikov and makarin were sitting 
 anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself 
 come and eat something have a drink dolokhov shouted to him from the other room 
 i want to answered anatole continuing to smile 
 come balaga is here 
 anatole rose and went into the dining room balaga was a famous troyka driver who had known dolokhov and anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas more than once when regiment was stationed at tver he had taken him from tver in the evening brought him to moscow by daybreak and driven him back again the next night more than once he had enabled dolokhov to escape when pursued more than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies and ladykins as he called the cocottes more than once in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by my gentlemen as he called them he had ruined more than one horse in their service more than once they had beaten him and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and madeira which he loved and he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to siberia they often called balaga into their orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies and more than one thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands in their service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year and in their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy but he liked them liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian and flying at full gallop through the moscow streets he liked to hear those wild tipsy shouts behind him get on get on when it was impossible to go any faster he liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who more dead than alive was already hurrying out of his way real gentlemen he considered them 
 anatole and dolokhov liked balaga too for his masterly driving and because he liked the things they liked with others balaga bargained charging rubles for a two hours drive and rarely drove himself generally letting his young men do so but with his gentlemen he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work only a couple of times a year when he knew from their valets that they had money in hand he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him the gentlemen always made him sit down 
 do help me out theodore ivanych sir or your excellency he would say i am quite out of horses let me have what you can to go to the fair 
 and anatole and dolokhov when they had money would give him a thousand or a couple of thousand rubles 
 balaga was a short and peasant of about with a particularly red thick neck glittering little eyes and a small beard he wore a fine cloth coat over a sheepskin 
 on entering the room now he crossed himself turning toward the front corner of the room and went up to dolokhov holding out a small black hand 
 theodore ivanych he said bowing 
 how do friend well here he is 
 good day your excellency he said again holding out his hand to anatole who had just come in 
 i say balaga said anatole putting his hands on the shoulders do you care for me or not eh now do me a service what horses have you come with eh 
 as your messenger ordered your special beasts replied balaga 
 well listen balaga drive all three to death but get me there in three hours eh 
 when they are dead what shall i drive said balaga with a wink 
 mind smash your face in make jokes cried anatole suddenly rolling his eyes 
 why joke said the driver laughing as if grudge my gentlemen anything as fast as ever the horses can gallop so fast go 
 ah said anatole well sit down 
 yes sit down said dolokhov 
 stand theodore ivanych 
 sit down nonsense have a drink said anatole and filled a large glass of madeira for him 
 the eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine after refusing it for manners sake he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap 
 and when are we to start your excellency 
 well anatole looked at his watch start at once mind balaga get there in time eh 
 that depends on our luck in starting else why we be there in time replied balaga we get you to tver in seven hours i think you remember that your excellency 
 do you know one christmas i drove from tver said anatole smilingly at the recollection and turning to makarin who gazed rapturously at him with eyes will you believe it makarka it took breath away the rate we flew we came across a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them eh 
 those were horses balaga continued the tale that time harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts he went on turning to dolokhov will you believe it theodore ivanych those animals flew forty miles i hold them in my hands grew numb in the sharp frost so that i threw down the reins catch hold yourself your excellency says i and i just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled there it a case of urging them on there was no holding them in till we reached the place the devils took us there in three hours only the near one died of it

 ninety years and teeth 
 in the rue boucherat rue de normandie and the rue de saintonge there still exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved the memory of a worthy man named m gillenormand and who mention him with complaisance 
 this good man was old when they were young this silhouette has not yet entirely those who regard with melancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past from the labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the temple to which under louis xiv the names of all the provinces of france were appended exactly as in our day the streets of the new tivoli quarter have received the names of all the capitals of europe a progression by the way in which progress is visible 
 who was as much alive as possible in was one of those men who had become curiosities to be viewed simply because they have lived a long time and who are strange because they formerly resembled everybody and now resemble nobody he was a peculiar old man and in very truth a man of another age the real complete and rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century who wore his good old bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates 
 he was over ninety years of age his walk was erect he talked loudly saw clearly drank neat ate slept and snored 
 he had all of his teeth he only wore spectacles when he read 
 he was of an amorous disposition but declared that for the last ten years he had wholly and decidedly renounced women 
 he could no longer please he said he did not add 
 i am too old but 
 i am too poor 
 he said if i were not 
 all he had left in fact was an income of about fifteen thousand francs 
 his dream was to come into an inheritance and to have a hundred thousand livres income for mistresses 
 he did not belong as the reader will perceive to that puny variety of octogenaries who like m de voltaire have been dying all their life his was no longevity of a cracked pot this jovial old man had always had good health 
 he was superficial rapid easily angered 
 he flew into a passion at everything generally quite contrary to all reason 
 when contradicted he raised his cane he beat people as he had done in the great century he had a daughter over fifty years of age and unmarried whom he chastised severely with his tongue when in a rage and whom he would have liked to whip 
 she seemed to him to be eight years old he boxed his servants ears soundly and said 
 ah carogne one of his oaths was 
 by the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade he had singular freaks of tranquillity he had himself shaved every day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him being jealous of m gillenormand on account of his wife a pretty and coquettish barberess 
 m gillenormand admired his own discernment in all things and declared that he was extremely sagacious here is one of his sayings 
 i have in truth some penetration i am able to say when a flea bites me from what woman it came 
 the words which he uttered the most frequently were 
 the sensible man and nature 
 he did not give to this last word the grand acceptation which our epoch has accorded to it but he made it enter after his own fashion into his little satires nature he said in order that civilization may have a little of everything gives it even specimens of its amusing barbarism europe possesses specimens of asia and africa on a small scale the cat is a tiger the lizard is a pocket crocodile the dancers at the opera are pink female savages 
 they do not eat men they crunch them or magicians that they are they transform them into oysters and swallow them 
 the caribbeans leave only the bones they leave only the shell 
 such are our morals 
 we do not devour we gnaw we do not exterminate we claw

 anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt and a sable cap jauntily set on one side and very becoming to his handsome face having looked in a mirror and standing before dolokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it he lifted a glass of wine 
 well theodore thank you for everything and farewell said anatole well comrades and friends he considered for a moment of my youth farewell he said turning to makarin and the others 
 though they were all going with him anatole evidently wished to make something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades he spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed one leg 
 all take glasses you too balaga well comrades and friends of my youth had our fling and lived and reveled eh and now when shall we meet again i am going abroad we have had a good time now farewell lads to our health hurrah he cried and emptying his glass flung it on the floor 
 to your health said balaga who also emptied his glass and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief 
 makarin embraced anatole with tears in his eyes 
 ah prince how sorry i am to part from you 
 go go cried anatole 
 balaga was about to leave the room 
 no stop said anatole shut the door we have first to sit down the way 
 they shut the door and all sat down 
 now quick march lads said anatole rising 
 joseph his valet handed him his sabretache and saber and they all went out into the vestibule 
 and the fur cloak asked dolokhov hey ignatka go to matrena matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak i have heard what elopements are like continued dolokhov with a wink why rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing if you delay at all be tears and papa and mamma and frozen in a minute and must go back but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh 
 the valet brought a cloak 
 fool i told you the sable one hey matrena the sable he shouted so that his voice rang far through the rooms 
 a handsome slim and gypsy girl with glittering black eyes and curly hair wearing a red shawl ran out with a sable mantle on her arm 
 here i grudge it take it she said evidently afraid of her master and yet regretful of her cloak 
 dolokhov without answering took the cloak threw it over matrena and wrapped her up in it 
 the way said dolokhov and then so and he turned the collar up round her head leaving only a little of the face uncovered and then so do you see and he pushed head forward to meet the gap left by the collar through which brilliant smile was seen 
 well matrena said anatole kissing her ah my revels here are over remember me to steshka there matrena wish me luck 
 well prince may god give you great luck said matrena in her gypsy accent 
 two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were holding the horses balaga took his seat in the front one and holding his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately anatole and dolokhov got in with him makarin khvostikov and a valet seated themselves in the other sleigh 
 well are you ready asked balaga 
 go he cried twisting the reins round his hands and the troyka tore down the nikitski boulevard 
 tproo get out of the way hi tproo the shouting of balaga and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be heard on the arbat square the troyka caught against a carriage something cracked shouts were heard and the troyka flew along the arbat street 
 after taking a turn along the podnovinski boulevard balaga began to rein in and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old konyusheny street 
 the young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and anatole and dolokhov went along the pavement when they reached the gate dolokhov whistled the whistle was answered and a maidservant ran out 
 come into the courtyard or be seen come out directly said she 
 dolokhov stayed by the gate anatole followed the maid into the courtyard turned the corner and ran up into the porch 
 he was met by gabriel marya gigantic footman 
 come to the mistress please said the footman in his deep bass intercepting any retreat 
 to what mistress who are you asked anatole in a breathless whisper 
 kindly step in my orders are to bring you in 
 kuragin come back shouted dolokhov betrayed back 
 dolokhov after anatole entered had remained at the wicket gate and was struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it with a last desperate effort dolokhov pushed the porter aside and when anatole ran back seized him by the arm pulled him through the wicket and ran back with him to the troyka

 like master like house 
 he lived in the marais rue des no he owned the house 
 this house has since been demolished and rebuilt and the number has probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the streets of paris undergo 
 he occupied an ancient and vast apartment on the first floor between street and gardens furnished to the very ceilings with great gobelins and beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on the he enveloped his bed in a vast screen of coromandel lacquer 
 long full curtains hung from the windows and formed great broken folds that were very magnificent the garden situated immediately under his windows was attached to that one of them which formed the angle by means of a staircase twelve or fifteen steps long which the old gentleman ascended and descended with great agility 
 in addition to a library adjoining his chamber he had a boudoir of which he thought a great deal a gallant and elegant retreat with magnificent hangings of straw with a pattern of flowers and made on the galleys of louis xiv 
 and ordered of his convicts by m de vivonne for his mistress 
 m gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal who had died a centenarian 
 he had had two wives his manners were something between those of the courtier which he had never been and the lawyer which he might have been he was gay and caressing when he had a mind 
 in his youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by their wives and never by their mistresses because they are at the same time the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in existence 
 he was a connoisseur of painting 
 he had in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom painted by jordaens executed with great dashes of the brush with millions of details in a confused and manner 
 m attire was not the habit of louis xiv 
 nor yet that of louis xvi it was that of the incroyables of the directory 
 he had thought himself young up to that period and had followed the fashions his coat was of cloth with voluminous revers a long and large steel buttons 
 with this he wore and buckle shoes 
 he always thrust his hands into his fobs he said authoritatively 
 the french revolution is a heap of blackguards

 marya dmitrievna having found sonya weeping in the corridor made her confess everything and intercepting the note to natasha she read it and went into room with it in her hand 
 you shameless said she i hear a word 
 pushing back natasha who looked at her with astonished but tearless eyes she locked her in and having given orders to the yard porter to admit the persons who would be coming that evening but not to let them out again and having told the footman to bring them up to her she seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors 
 when gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run away again she rose frowning and clasping her hands behind her paced through the rooms a long time considering what she should do toward midnight she went to room fingering the key in her pocket sonya was sitting sobbing in the corridor marya dmitrievna for sake let me in to her she pleaded but marya dmitrievna unlocked the door and went in without giving her an answer disgusting abominable in my house horrid girl hussy only sorry for her father thought she trying to restrain her wrath hard as it may be tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the count she entered the room with resolute steps natasha lying on the sofa her head hidden in her hands and she did not stir she was in just the same position in which marya dmitrievna had left her 
 a nice girl very nice said marya dmitrievna arranging meetings with lovers in my house no use pretending you listen when i speak to you and marya dmitrievna touched her arm listen when when i speak disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies treat you differently but sorry for your father so i will conceal it 
 natasha did not change her position but her whole body heaved with noiseless convulsive sobs which choked her marya dmitrievna glanced round at sonya and seated herself on the sofa beside natasha 
 lucky for him that he escaped me but find him she said in her rough voice do you hear what i am saying or not she added 
 she put her large hand under face and turned it toward her both marya dmitrievna and sonya were amazed when they saw how natasha looked her eyes were dry and glistening her lips compressed her cheeks sunken 
 let me be what is it to me i shall die she muttered wrenching herself from marya hands with a vicious effort and sinking down again into her former position 
 natalie said marya dmitrievna i wish for your good lie still stay like that then i touch you but listen i tell you how guilty you are you know that yourself but when your father comes back tomorrow what am i to tell him eh 
 again body shook with sobs 
 suppose he finds out and your brother and your betrothed 
 i have no betrothed i have refused him cried natasha 
 all the same continued dmitrievna if they hear of this will they let it pass he your father i know him if he challenges him to a duel will that be all right eh 
 oh let me be why have you interfered at all why why who asked you to shouted natasha raising herself on the sofa and looking malignantly at marya dmitrievna 
 but what did you want cried marya dmitrievna growing angry again were you kept under lock and key who hindered his coming to the house why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl well if he had carried you off do you think they have found him your father or brother or your betrothed and a scoundrel a wretch a fact 
 he is better than any of you exclaimed natasha getting up if you interfered oh my god what is it all what is it sonya why go away 
 and she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned marya dmitrievna was to speak again but natasha cried out 
 go away go away you all hate and despise me and she threw herself back on the sofa 
 marya dmitrievna went on admonishing her for some time enjoining on her that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody would know anything about it if only natasha herself would undertake to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened natasha did not reply nor did she sob any longer but she grew cold and had a shivering fit marya dmitrievna put a pillow under her head covered her with two quilts and herself brought her some water but natasha did not respond to her 
 well let her sleep said marya dmitrievna as she went of the room supposing natasha to be asleep 
 but natasha was not asleep with pale face and fixed eyes she looked straight before her all that night she did not sleep or weep and did not speak to sonya who got up and went to her several times 
 next day count rostov returned from his estate near moscow in time for lunch as he had promised he was in very good spirits the affair with the purchaser was going on satisfactorily and there was nothing to keep him any longer in moscow away from the countess whom he missed marya dmitrievna met him and told him that natasha had been very unwell the day before and that they had sent for the doctor but that she was better now natasha had not left her room that morning with compressed and parched lips and dry fixed eyes she sat at the window uneasily watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at anyone who entered the room she was evidently expecting news of him and that he would come or would write to her 
 when the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound of a footstep and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent expression she did not even get up to greet him what is the matter with you my angel are you ill asked the count 
 after a silence natasha answered yes ill 
 in reply to the anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed she assured him that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry marya dmitrievna confirmed assurances that nothing had happened from the pretense of illness from his distress and by the embarrassed faces of sonya and marya dmitrievna the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during his absence but it was so terrible for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved daughter and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity that he avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly had happened and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their return to the country

 at the age of sixteen one evening at the opera he had had the honor to be stared at through by two beauties at the same and celebrated beauties then and sung by voltaire the camargo and the salle 
 caught between two fires he had beaten a heroic retreat towards a little dancer a young girl named nahenry who was sixteen like himself obscure as a cat and with whom he was in love 
 he abounded in memories 
 he was accustomed to exclaim how pretty she the last time i saw her at longchamps her hair curled in sustained sentiments with her of turquoises her gown of the color of persons newly arrived and her little agitation muff he had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat of which he was fond of talking about effusively 
 i was dressed like a turk of the levant levantin said he 
 madame de boufflers having seen him by chance when he was twenty had described him as a charming fool 
 he was horrified by all the names which he saw in politics and in power regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois he read the journals the newspapers the gazettes as he said stifling outbursts of laughter the while 
 oh he said what people these are 
 corbiere 
 humann 
 casimir perier a minister for you 
 i can imagine this in a journal m gillenorman minister that would be a farce 
 well 
 they are so stupid that it would pass he merrily called everything by its name whether decent or indecent and did not restrain himself in the least before ladies 
 he uttered coarse speeches obscenities and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant it was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of his century it is to be noted that the age of periphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose 
 his had predicted that he would turn out a man of genius and had bestowed on him these two significant names

 yes indeed a true sage thought pierre he sees nothing beyond the pleasure of the moment nothing troubles him and so he is always cheerful satisfied and serene what i give to be like him he thought enviously 
 in marya anteroom the footman who helped him off with his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom 
 when he opened the ballroom door pierre saw natasha sitting at the window with a thin pale and spiteful face she glanced round at him frowned and left the room with an expression of cold dignity 
 what has happened asked pierre entering marya room 
 fine doings answered dmitrievna for years have i lived in this world and never known anything so disgraceful 
 and having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him marya dmitrievna informed him that natasha had refused prince andrew without her parents knowledge and that the cause of this was anatole kuragin into whose society wife had thrown her and with whom natasha had tried to elope during her absence in order to be married secretly 
 pierre raised his shoulders and listened to what was told him scarcely able to believe his own ears that prince deeply loved affianced wife the same natasha rostova who used to be so charming should give up bolkonski for that fool anatole who was already secretly married as pierre knew and should be so in love with him as to agree to run away with him was something pierre could not conceive and could not imagine 
 he could not reconcile the charming impression he had of natasha whom he had known from a child with this new conception of her baseness folly and cruelty he thought of his wife they are all alike he said to himself reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman but still he pitied prince andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with disgust of that natasha who had just passed him in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity he did not know that soul was overflowing with despair shame and humiliation and that it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity and severity 
 but how get married said pierre in answer to marya dmitrievna he could not marry he is married 
 things get worse from hour to hour ejaculated marya dmitrievna a nice youth what a scoundrel and expecting him expecting him since yesterday she must be told then at least she go on expecting him 
 after hearing the details of marriage from pierre and giving vent to her anger against anatole in words of abuse marya dmitrievna told pierre why she had sent for him she was afraid that the count or bolkonski who might arrive at any moment if they knew of this affair which she hoped to hide from them might challenge anatole to a duel and she therefore asked pierre to tell his in her name to leave moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again pierre only now realizing the danger to the old count nicholas and prince andrew promised to do as she wished having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him she let him go to the drawing room 
 mind the count knows nothing behave as if you know nothing either she said and i will go and tell her it is no use expecting him and stay to dinner if you care to she called after pierre 
 pierre met the old count who seemed nervous and upset that morning natasha had told him that she had rejected bolkonski 
 troubles troubles my dear fellow he said to pierre what troubles one has with these girls without their mother i do so regret having come here i will be frank with you have you heard she has broken off her engagement without consulting anybody true this engagement never was much to my liking of course he is an excellent man but still with his disapproval they have been happy and natasha lack suitors still it has been going on so long and to take such a step without or consent and now ill and god knows what hard count hard to manage daughters in their absence 
 pierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the subject but the count returned to his troubles 
 sonya entered the room with an agitated face 
 natasha is not quite well in her room and would like to see you marya dmitrievna is with her and she too asks you to come 
 yes you are a great friend of no doubt she wants to send him a message said the count oh dear oh dear how happy it all was 
 and clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the room 
 when marya dmitrievna told natasha that anatole was married natasha did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by pierre himself sonya told pierre this as she led him along the corridor to room 
 natasha pale and stern was sitting beside marya dmitrievna and her eyes glittering feverishly met pierre with a questioning look the moment he entered she did not smile or nod but only gazed fixedly at him and her look asked only one thing was he a friend or 
 like the others an enemy in regard to anatole as for pierre he evidently did not exist for her 
 he knows all about it said marya dmitrievna pointing to pierre and addressing natasha let him tell you whether i have told the truth 
 natasha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen 
 natalya ilynichna pierre began dropping his eyes with a feeling of pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do whether it is true or not should make no difference to you because 
 then it is not true that married 
 yes it is true 
 has he been married long she asked on your honor 
 pierre gave his word of honor 
 is he still here she asked quickly 
 yes i have just seen him 
 she was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that they should leave her alone

 he had taken prizes in his boyhood at the college of moulins where he was born and he had been crowned by the hand of the duc de nivernais whom he called the duc de nevers 
 neither the convention nor the death of louis xvi nor the napoleon nor the return of the bourbons nor anything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning the duc de nevers was in his eyes the great figure of the century what a charming grand seigneur he said and what a fine air he had with his blue ribbon

 the elixir of gold he exclaimed the yellow dye of bestucheff general drops in the eighteenth was the great remedy for the catastrophes of love the panacea against venus at one louis the phial louis xv 
 sent two hundred phials of it to the pope 
 he would have been greatly irritated and thrown off his balance had any one told him that the elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron m gillenormand adored the bourbons and had a horror of he was forever narrating in what manner he had saved himself during the terror and how he had been obliged to display a vast deal of gayety and cleverness ins order to escape having his head cut off if any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the republic in his presence he turned purple and grew so angry that he was on the point of swooning

 pierre did not stay for dinner but left the room and went away at once he drove through the town seeking anatole kuragin at the thought of whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in breathing he was not at the ice hills nor at the gypsies nor at pierre drove to the club in the club all was going on as usual the members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about in groups they greeted pierre and spoke of the town news the footman having greeted him knowing his habits and his acquaintances told him there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that prince michael zakharych was in the library but paul timofeevich had not yet arrived one of acquaintances while they were talking about the weather asked if he had heard of abduction of rostova which was talked of in the town and was it true pierre laughed and said it was nonsense for he had just come from the rostovs he asked everyone about anatole one man told him he had not come yet and another that he was coming to dinner pierre felt it strange to see this calm indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his soul he paced through the ballroom waited till everyone had come and as anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home 
 anatole for whom pierre was looking dined that day with dolokhov consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair it seemed to him essential to see natasha in the evening he drove to his to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting when pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over moscow his valet informed him that prince anatole was with the countess the countess drawing room was full of guests 
 pierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever entered the drawing room and seeing anatole went up to him 
 ah pierre said the countess going up to her husband you know what a plight our anatole 
 she stopped seeing in the forward thrust of her head in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with dolokhov 
 where you are there is vice and evil said pierre to his wife anatole come with me i must speak to you he added in french 
 anatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively ready to follow pierre pierre taking him by the arm pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room 
 if you allow yourself in my drawing room whispered helene but pierre did not reply and went out of the room 
 anatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety 
 having entered his study pierre closed the door and addressed anatole without looking at him 
 you promised countess rostova to marry her and were about to elope with her is that so 
 mon cher answered anatole their whole conversation was in french i consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone 
 face already pale became distorted by fury he seized anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side to side till face showed a sufficient degree of terror 
 when i tell you that i must talk to you repeated pierre 
 come now this is stupid what said anatole fingering a button of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth 
 a scoundrel and a blackguard and i know what deprives me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this said pierre expressing himself so artificially because he was talking french 
 he took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly but at once put it back in its place 
 did you promise to marry her 
 i i think of it i never promised because 
 pierre interrupted him 
 have you any letters of hers any letters he said moving toward anatole 
 anatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out his pocketbook 
 pierre took the letter anatole handed him and pushing aside a table that stood in his way threw himself on the sofa 
 i be violent be afraid said pierre in answer to a frightened gesture of first the letters said he as if repeating a lesson to himself secondly he continued after a short pause again rising and again pacing the room tomorrow you must get out of moscow 
 but how can i 
 thirdly pierre continued without listening to him you must never breathe a word of what has passed between you and countess rostova i know i prevent your doing so but if you have a spark of conscience pierre paced the room several times in silence 
 anatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips 
 after all you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such a thing as other happiness and peace and that you are ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself amuse yourself with women like my wife with them you are within your rights for they know what you want of them they are armed against you by the same experience of debauchery but to promise a maid to marry her to deceive to kidnap you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man or a child 
 pierre paused and looked at anatole no longer with an angry but with a questioning look 
 i know about that eh said anatole growing more confident as pierre mastered his wrath i know that and want to he said not looking at pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw but you have used such words to me mean and so on which as a man of honor i allow anyone to use 
 pierre glanced at him with amazement unable to understand what he wanted 
 though it was anatole continued still i 
 is it satisfaction you want said pierre ironically 
 you could at least take back your words what if you want me to do as you wish eh 
 i take them back i take them back said pierre and i ask you to forgive me pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button and if you require money for your journey 
 anatole smiled the expression of that base and cringing smile which pierre knew so well in his wife revolted him 
 oh vile and heartless brood he exclaimed and left the room 
 next day anatole left for petersburg

 basque and nicolette 
 he had theories 
 here is one of them 
 when a man is passionately fond of women and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little who is homely cross legitimate with plenty of rights perched on the code and jealous at need there is but one way of extricating himself from the quandry and of procuring peace and that is to let his wife control the this abdication sets him free 
 then his wife busies herself grows passionately fond of handling coin gets her fingers covered with verdigris in the process undertakes the education of tenants and the training of farmers convokes lawyers presides over notaries harangues scriveners visits limbs of the law follows lawsuits draws up leases dictates contracts feels herself the sovereign sells buys regulates promises and compromises binds fast and annuls yields concedes and retrocedes arranges disarranges hoards lavishes she commits follies a supreme and personal delight and that consoles her 
 while her husband disdains her she has the satisfaction of ruining her husband this theory m gillenormand had himself applied and it had become his history 
 his second administered his fortune in such a manner that one fine day when m gillenormand found himself a widower there remained to him just sufficient to live on by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity of fifteen thousand francs of which would expire with him he had not hesitated on this point not being anxious to leave a property behind him 
 besides he had noticed that patrimonies are subject to adventures and for instance become national property he had been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents and he had no great faith in the great book of the public debt all the rue quincampois he said 
 his house in the rue belonged to him as we have already stated he had two servants a male and a female 
 when a servant entered his establishment m gillenormand him 
 he bestowed on the men the name of their province 
 nimois comtois poitevin picard his last valet was a big foundered fellow of who was incapable of running twenty paces but as he had been born at bayonne m gillenormand called him basque 
 all the female servants in his house were called nicolette even the magnon of whom we shall hear more farther on one day a haughty cook a cordon bleu of the lofty race of porters presented herself how much wages do you want a month asked m gillenormand thirty francs 
 what is your name 
 olympie 
 you shall have fifty francs and you shall be called nicolette

 pierre drove to marya to tell her of the fulfillment of her wish that kuragin should be banished from moscow the whole house was in a state of alarm and commotion natasha was very ill having as marya dmitrievna told him in secret poisoned herself the night after she had been told that anatole was married with some arsenic she had stealthily procured after swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she woke sonya and told her what she had done the necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was now out of danger though still so weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country and so the countess had been sent for pierre saw the distracted count and sonya who had a face but he could not see natasha 
 pierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about the attempted abduction of rostova he resolutely denied these rumors assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his had proposed to her and been refused it seemed to pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and reputation 
 he was awaiting prince return with dread and went every day to the old for news of him 
 old prince bolkonski heard all the rumors current in the town from mademoiselle bourienne and had read the note to princess mary in which natasha had broken off her engagement he seemed in better spirits than usual and awaited his son with great impatience 
 some days after departure pierre received a note from prince andrew informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him 
 as soon as he reached moscow prince andrew had received from his father note to princess mary breaking off her engagement mademoiselle bourienne had purloined it from princess mary and given it to the old prince and he heard from him the story of elopement with additions 
 prince andrew had arrived in the evening and pierre came to see him next morning pierre expected to find prince andrew in almost the same state as natasha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some intrigue going on in petersburg the old voice and another now and then interrupted him princess mary came out to meet pierre she sighed looking toward the door of the room where prince andrew was evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow but pierre saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news of faithlessness 
 he says he expected it she remarked i know his pride will not let him express his feelings but still he has taken it better far better than i expected evidently it had to be 
 but is it possible that all is really ended asked pierre 
 princess mary looked at him with astonishment she did not understand how he could ask such a question pierre went into the study prince andrew greatly changed and plainly in better health but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows stood in civilian dress facing his father and prince meshcherski warmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating the conversation was about speranski the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached moscow 
 now he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a month ago prince andrew was saying and by those who were unable to understand his aims to judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of other mistakes is very easy but i maintain that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him by him alone 
 he paused at the sight of pierre his face quivered and immediately assumed a vindictive expression 
 posterity will do him justice he concluded and at once turned to pierre 
 well how are you still getting stouter he said with animation but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened yes i am well he said in answer to question and smiled 
 to pierre that smile said plainly i am well but my health is now of no use to anyone 
 after a few words to pierre about the awful roads from the polish frontier about people he had met in switzerland who knew pierre and about m dessalles whom he had brought from abroad to be his tutor prince andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about speranski which was still going on between the two old men 
 if there were treason or proofs of secret relations with napoleon they would have been made public he said with warmth and haste i do not and never did like speranski personally but i like justice 
 pierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too familiar to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate when prince meshcherski had left prince andrew took arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him a bed had been made up there and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about prince andrew went to one and took out a small casket from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper he did it all silently and very quickly he stood up and coughed his face was gloomy and his lips compressed 
 forgive me for troubling you 
 pierre saw that prince andrew was going to speak of natasha and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy this expression irritated prince andrew and in a determined ringing and unpleasant tone he continued 
 i have received a refusal from countess rostova and have heard reports of your having sought her hand or something of that kind is that true 
 both true and untrue pierre began but prince andrew interrupted him 
 here are her letters and her portrait said he 
 he took the packet from the table and handed it to pierre 
 give this to the countess if you see her 
 she is very ill said pierre 
 then she is here still said prince andrew and prince kuragin he added quickly 
 he left long ago she has been at door 
 i much regret her illness said prince andrew and he smiled like his father coldly maliciously and unpleasantly 
 so monsieur kuragin has not honored countess rostova with his hand said prince andrew and he snorted several times 
 he could not marry for he was married already said pierre 
 prince andrew laughed disagreeably again reminding one of his father 
 and where is your now if i may ask he said 
 he has gone to peters but i know said pierre 
 well it matter said prince andrew tell countess rostova that she was and is perfectly free and that i wish her all that is good 
 pierre took the packet prince andrew as if trying to remember whether he had something more to say or waiting to see if pierre would say anything looked fixedly at him 
 i say do you remember our discussion in petersburg asked pierre about 
 yes returned prince andrew hastily i said that a fallen woman should be forgiven but i say i could forgive her i 
 but can this be compared said pierre 
 prince andrew interrupted him and cried sharply yes ask her hand again be magnanimous and so on yes that would be very noble but i am unable to follow in that footsteps if you wish to be my friend never speak to me of that of all that well so give her the packet 
 pierre left the room and went to the old prince and princess mary 
 the old man seemed livelier than usual princess mary was the same as always but beneath her sympathy for her brother pierre noticed her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off looking at them pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the rostovs and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of her who could give up prince andrew for anyone else 
 at dinner the talk turned on the war the approach of which was becoming evident prince andrew talked incessantly arguing now with his father now with the swiss tutor dessalles and showing an unnatural animation the cause of which pierre so well understood

 what an abominable calumny

 that same evening pierre went to the rostovs to fulfill the commission entrusted to him natasha was in bed the count at the club and pierre after giving the letters to sonya went to marya dmitrievna who was interested to know how prince andrew had taken the news ten minutes later sonya came to marya dmitrievna 
 natasha insists on seeing count peter kirilovich said she 
 but how are we to take him up to her the room there has not been tidied up 
 no she has dressed and gone into the drawing room said sonya 
 marya dmitrievna only shrugged her shoulders 
 when will her mother come she has worried me to death now mind tell her everything said she to pierre one the heart to scold her she is so much to be pitied so much to be pitied 
 natasha was standing in the middle of the drawing room emaciated with a pale set face but not at all shamefaced as pierre expected to find her when he appeared at the door she grew flurried evidently undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up 
 pierre hastened to her he thought she would give him her hand as usual but she stepping up to him stopped breathing heavily her arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing but with quite a different expression of face 
 peter kirilovich she began rapidly prince bolkonski was your friend is your friend she corrected herself it seemed to her that everything that had once been must now be different he told me once to apply to you 
 pierre sniffed as he looked at her but did not speak till then he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her but he now felt so sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach 
 he is here now tell him to for forgive me she stopped and breathed still more quickly but did not shed tears 
 yes i will tell him answered pierre but 
 he did not know what to say 
 natasha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she had meant 
 no i know all is over she said hurriedly no that can never be only tormented by the wrong i have done him tell him only that i beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything 
 she trembled all over and sat down on a chair 
 a sense of pity he had never before known overflowed heart 
 i will tell him i will tell him everything once more said pierre but i should like to know one thing 
 know what eyes asked 
 i should like to know did you love pierre did not know how to refer to anatole and flushed at the thought of him did you love that bad man 
 call him bad said natasha but i know know at all 
 she began to cry and a still greater sense of pity tenderness and love welled up in pierre he felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed 
 we speak of it any more my dear said pierre and his gentle cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to natasha 
 we speak of it my dear tell him everything but one thing i beg of you consider me your friend and if you want help advice or simply to open your heart to someone not now but when your mind is clearer think of me he took her hand and kissed it i shall be happy if in my power 
 pierre grew confused 
 speak to me like that i am not worth it exclaimed natasha and turned to leave the room but pierre held her hand 
 he knew he had something more to say to her but when he said it he was amazed at his own words 
 stop stop you have your whole life before you said he to her 
 before me no all is over for me she replied with shame and 
 all over he repeated if i were not myself but the handsomest cleverest and best man in the world and were free i would this moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love 
 for the first time for many days natasha wept tears of gratitude and tenderness and glancing at pierre she went out of the room 
 pierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him and without finding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh 
 where to now your excellency asked the coachman 
 where to pierre asked himself where can i go now surely not to the club or to pay calls all men seemed so pitiful so poor in comparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced in comparison with that softened grateful last look she had given him through her tears 
 home said pierre and despite degrees of frost fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the air with joy 
 it was clear and frosty above the dirty streets above the black roofs stretched the dark starry sky only looking up at the sky did pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised at the entrance to the arbat square an immense expanse of dark starry sky presented itself to his eyes almost in the center of it above the prechistenka boulevard surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth its white light and its long uplifted tail shone the enormous and brilliant comet of l the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of the world in pierre however that comet with its long luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear on the contrary he gazed joyfully his eyes moist with tears at this bright comet which having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space seemed suddenly like an arrow piercing the earth to remain fixed in a chosen spot vigorously holding its tail erect shining and displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars it seemed to pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted soul now blossoming into a new life

 receive no one except in the evening 
 such was m gillenormand who had not lost his hair which was gray rather than which was always dressed in ears 
 to sum up he was venerable in spite of all this 
 he had something of the eighteenth century about him frivolous and great 
 in and during the early years of the restoration m gillenormand who was still was only in the faubourg saint germain rue servandoni near he had only retired to the marais when he quitted society long after attaining the age of eighty 
 and on abandoning society he had immured himself in his habits the principal one and that which was invariable was to keep his door absolutely closed during the day and never to receive any one whatever except in the evening 
 he dined at five and after that his door was open 
 that had been the fashion of his century and he would not swerve from it 
 the day is vulgar said he and deserves only a closed shutter 
 fashionable people only light up their minds when the zenith lights up its stars 
 and he barricaded himself against every one even had it been the king himself this was the antiquated elegance of his day

 from the close of the year intensified arming and concentrating of the forces of western europe began and in these forces millions of men reckoning those transporting and feeding the army moved from the west eastwards to the russian frontier toward which since russian forces had been similarly drawn on the twelfth of june the forces of western europe crossed the russian frontier and war began that is an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes frauds treacheries thefts forgeries issues of false money burglaries incendiarisms and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world but which those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes 
 what produced this extraordinary occurrence what were its causes the historians tell us with naive assurance that its causes were the wrongs inflicted on the duke of oldenburg the nonobservance of the continental system the ambition of napoleon the firmness of alexander the mistakes of the diplomatists and so on 
 consequently it would only have been necessary for metternich rumyantsev or talleyrand between a levee and an evening party to have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note or for napoleon to have written to alexander my respected brother i consent to restore the duchy to the duke of oldenburg and there would have been no war 
 we can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries it naturally seemed to napoleon that the war was caused by intrigues as in fact he said on the island of st helena it naturally seemed to members of the english parliament that the cause of the war was ambition to the duke of oldenburg that the cause of the war was the violence done to him to businessmen that the cause of the way was the continental system which was ruining europe to the generals and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of les bons principes and to the diplomatists of that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between russia and austria in had not been sufficiently well concealed from napoleon and from the awkward wording of memorandum no it is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other reasons the number depending on the endless diversity of points of view presented themselves to the men of that day but to us to posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning these causes seem insufficient to us it is incomprehensible that millions of christian men killed and tortured each other either because napoleon was ambitious or alexander was firm or because policy was astute or the duke of oldenburg wronged we cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence why because the duke was wronged thousands of men from the other side of europe killed and ruined the people of smolensk and moscow and were killed by them 
 to us their descendants who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense an incalculable number of causes present themselves the deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events and by its impotence apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes to occasion the event to us the wish or objection of this or that french corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the vistula and to restore the duchy of oldenburg for had he not wished to serve and had a second a third and a thousandth corporal and private also refused there would have been so many less men in army and the war could not have occurred 
 had napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the vistula and not ordered his troops to advance there would have been no war but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war nor could there have been a war had there been no english intrigues and no duke of oldenburg and had alexander not felt insulted and had there not been an autocratic government in russia or a revolution in france and a subsequent dictatorship and empire or all the things that produced the french revolution and so on without each of these causes nothing could have happened so all these causes myriads of causes coincided to bring it about and so there was no one cause for that occurrence but it had to occur because it had to millions of men renouncing their human feelings and reason had to go from west to east to slay their fellows just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west slaying their fellows 
 the actions of napoleon and alexander on whose words the event seemed to hang were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription this could not be otherwise for in order that the will of napoleon and alexander on whom the event seemed to depend should be carried out the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the event could not have taken place it was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power the soldiers who fired or transported provisions and guns should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes 
 we are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational events that is to say events the reasonableness of which we do not understand the more we try to explain such events in history reasonably the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to us 
 each man lives for himself using his freedom to attain his personal aims and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from doing this or that action but as soon as he has done it that action performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to history in which it has not a free but a predestined significance 
 there are two sides to the life of every man his individual life which is the more free the more abstract its interests and his elemental hive life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him 
 man lives consciously for himself but is an unconscious instrument in the attainment of the historic universal aims of humanity a deed done is irrevocable and its result coinciding in time with the actions of millions of other men assumes an historic significance the higher a man stands on the social ladder the more people he is connected with and the more power he has over others the more evident is the predestination and inevitability of his every action 
 the heart is in the hands of the lord 
 a king is slave 
 history that is the unconscious general hive life of mankind uses every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes 
 though napoleon at that time in was more convinced than ever that it depended on him verser ou ne pas verser le sang de ses peuples as alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him he had never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws which compelled him while thinking that he was acting on his own volition to perform for the hive life that is to say for history whatever had to be performed 
 to shed or not to shed the blood of his peoples 
 the people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men and by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and to produce that movement and war reproaches for the nonobservance of the continental system the duke of wrongs the movement of troops into prussia undertaken as it seemed to napoleon only for the purpose of securing an armed peace the french love and habit of war coinciding with his inclinations allurement by the grandeur of the preparations and the expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages to compensate for that expenditure the intoxicating honors he received in dresden the diplomatic negotiations which in the opinion of contemporaries were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace but which only wounded the of both sides and millions and millions of other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or coincided with it 
 when an apple has ripened and falls why does it fall because of its attraction to the earth because its stalk withers because it is dried by the sun because it grows heavier because the wind shakes it or because the boy standing below wants to eat it 
 nothing is the cause all this is only the coincidence of conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur and the botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it equally right or wrong is he who says that napoleon went to moscow because he wanted to and perished because alexander desired his destruction and he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock in historic events the great men are labels giving names to events and like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself 
 every act of theirs which appears to them an act of their own will is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity

 book great bourgeois 
 chapter viii 
 
 two do not make a pair 
 we have just spoken of m two daughters 
 they had come into the world ten years apart 
 in their youth they had borne very little resemblance to each other either in character or countenance and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible 
 the youngest had a charming soul which turned towards all that belongs to the light was occupied with flowers with verses with music which fluttered away into glorious space enthusiastic ethereal and was wedded from her very youth in ideal to a vague and heroic figure 
 the elder had also her chimera she espied in the azure some very wealthy purveyor a contractor a splendidly stupid husband a million made man or even a prefect the receptions of the prefecture an usher in the antechamber with a chain on his neck official balls the harangues of the to be madame la this had created a whirlwind in her imagination 
 thus the two sisters strayed each in her own dream at the epoch when they were young girls both had wings the one like an angel the other like a goose 
 no ambition is ever fully realized here below at least no paradise becomes terrestrial in our day 
 the younger wedded the man of her dreams but she died 
 the elder did not marry at all 
 at the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are relating she was an antique virtue an incombustible prude with one of the sharpest noses and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possible to see 
 a characteristic detail outside of her immediate family no one had ever known her first name she was called mademoiselle gillenormand the elder 
 in the matter of cant mademoiselle gillenormand could have given points to a miss 
 her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness 
 she cherished a frightful memory of her life one day a man had beheld her garter 
 age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty 
 her guimpe was never sufficiently opaque and never ascended sufficiently high she multiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking 
 the peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in proportion as the fortress is the less menaced 
 nevertheless let him who can explain these antique mysteries of innocence she allowed an officer of the lancers her grand nephew named theodule to embrace her without displeasure 
 in spite of this favored lancer the label 
 prude under which we have classed her suited her to absolute perfection 
 mademoiselle gillenormand was a sort of twilight soul 
 prudery is a and a 
 to prudery she added bigotry a lining 
 she belonged to the society of the virgin wore a white veil on certain festivals mumbled special orisons revered the holy blood venerated the sacred heart remained for hours in contemplation before a altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble and through great rays of gilded wood 
 she had a chapel friend an ancient virgin like herself named mademoiselle vaubois who was a positive blockhead and beside whom mademoiselle gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle 
 beyond the agnus dei and ave maria mademoiselle vaubois had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of making preserves 
 mademoiselle vaubois perfect in her style was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence 
 let us say it plainly mademoiselle gillenormand had gained rather than lost as she grew older 
 this is the case with passive natures she had never been malicious which is relative kindness and then years wear away the angles and the softening which comes with time had come to her 
 she was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herself know the secret 
 there breathed from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished and which had never had a beginning 
 she kept house for her father 
 m gillenormand had his daughter near him as we have seen that monseigneur bienvenu had his sister with him 
 these households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are not rare and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on each other for support 
 there was also in this house between this elderly spinster and this old man a child a little boy who was always trembling and mute in the presence of m gillenormand 
 m gillenormand never addressed this child except in a severe voice and sometimes with uplifted cane 
 here sir rascal scoundrel come here answer me you scamp 
 just let me see you you etc etc 
 he idolized him 
 this was his grandson 
 we shall meet with this child again later on

 chapter ii 
 
 on the of may napoleon left dresden where he had spent three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes dukes kings and even an emperor before leaving napoleon showed favor to the emperor kings and princes who had deserved it reprimanded the kings and princes with whom he was dissatisfied presented pearls and diamonds of his own that is which he had taken from other kings to the empress of austria and having as his historian tells us tenderly embraced the empress marie louise who regarded him as her husband though he had left another wife in paris left her grieved by the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear though the diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end and though the emperor napoleon himself wrote a letter to alexander calling him monsieur mon frere and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always love and honor him yet he set off to join his army and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops from west to east he went in a traveling coach with six horses surrounded by pages and an escort along the road to posen thorn danzig and konigsberg at each of these towns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm 
 the army was moving from west to east and relays of six horses carried him in the same direction on the tenth of june coming up with the army he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on 
 the estate of a polish count in the vilkavisski forest 
 old style 
 next day overtaking the army he went in a carriage to the niemen and changing into a polish uniform he drove to the riverbank in order to select a place for the crossing 
 seeing on the other side some cossacks les cosaques and the steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of moscow moscou la ville sainte the capital of a realm such as the scythia into which alexander the great had marched napoleon unexpectedly and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations ordered an advance and the next day his army began to cross the niemen 
 early in the morning of the twelfth of june he came out of his tent which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the niemen and looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of the vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across the river the troops knowing of the presence were on the lookout for him and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill they threw up their caps and shouted vive and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest that had concealed them and separating flowed on and on by the three bridges to the other side 
 now go into action oh when he takes it in hand himself things get hot by heaven there he is vive so these are the steppes of asia a nasty country all the same au revoir beauche keep the best palace in moscow for you au revoir good luck did you see the emperor vive preur if they make me governor of india gerard make you minister of kashmir settled vive hurrah hurrah hurrah the cossacks those rascals see how they run vive there he is do you see him seen him twice as i see you now the little corporal i saw him give the cross to one of the veterans vive came the voices of men old and young of most diverse characters and social positions on the faces of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on the hill 
 on the thirteenth of june a rather small thoroughbred arab horse was brought to napoleon he mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the bridges over the niemen deafened continually by incessant and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the time he joined the army he rode across one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther side turned sharply to the left and galloped in the direction of kovno preceded by enraptured mounted chasseurs of the guard who breathless with delight galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops on reaching the broad river viliya he stopped near a regiment of polish uhlans stationed by the river 
 vivat shouted the poles ecstatically breaking their ranks and pressing against one another to see him 
 napoleon looked up and down the river dismounted and sat down on a log that lay on the bank at a mute sign from him a telescope was handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him and he gazed at the opposite bank then he became absorbed in a map laid out on the logs without lifting his head he said something and two of his galloped off to the polish uhlans 
 what what did he say was heard in the ranks of the polish uhlans when one of the rode up to them 
 the order was to find a ford and to cross the river the colonel of the polish uhlans a handsome old man flushed and fumbling in his speech from excitement asked the whether he would be permitted to swim the river with his uhlans instead of seeking a ford in evident fear of refusal like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the eyes the replied that probably the emperor would not be displeased at this excess of zeal 
 as soon as the had said this the old mustached officer with happy face and sparkling eyes raised his saber shouted vivat and commanding the uhlans to follow him spurred his horse and galloped into the river he gave an angry thrust to his horse which had grown restive under him and plunged into the water heading for the deepest part where the current was swift hundreds of uhlans galloped in after him it was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the stream and the uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their horses some of the horses were drowned and some of the men the others tried to swim on some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses manes they tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and though there was a ford one third of a mile away were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing when the having returned and choosing an opportune moment ventured to draw the attention to the devotion of the poles to his person the little man in the gray overcoat got up and having summoned berthier began pacing up and down the bank with him giving him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the drowning uhlans who distracted his attention 
 for him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the world from africa to the steppes of muscovy alike was enough to dumfound people and impel them to insane he called for his horse and rode to his quarters 
 some forty uhlans were drowned in the river though boats were sent to their assistance the majority struggled back to the bank from which they had started the colonel and some of his men got across and with difficulty clambered out on the further bank and as soon as they had got out in their soaked and streaming clothes they shouted vivat and looked ecstatically at the spot where napoleon had been but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy 
 that evening between issuing one order that the forged russian paper money prepared for use in russia should be delivered as quickly as possible and another that a saxon should be shot on whom a letter containing information about the orders to the french army had been found napoleon also gave instructions that the polish colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the legion of which napoleon was himself the head

 of atheism 
 i had rather believe all the fables in the legend and the talmud and the alcoran than that this universal frame is without a mind and therefore god never wrought miracle to convince atheism because his ordinary works convince it it is true that a little philosophy inclineth mind to atheism but depth in philosophy bringelh 
 minds about to religion for while the mind of man looketh upon second causes scattered it may sometimes rest in them and go no further but when it beholdeth the chain of them confederate and linked together it must needs fly to providence and deity nay even mat school which is most accused of atheism doth most demonstrate 
 religion that is the school of leucippus and democritus and epicurus 
 for it is a thousand times more credible that four mutable elements and one immutable fifth essence duly and eternally placed needs no god than mat an army of infinite small proportions or seeds unplaced should have produced this order and beauty without 
 a divine marshal 
 the scripture saith the fool hath said in his heart mere is no 
 god it is not said the fool hath thought in his heart so as he rather saith it by rote to himself as that he would have than hat he can thoroughly believe it or be persuaded of it for none deny there is a god but those for whom it maketh that there were no god it appeareth in nothing more mat atheism is radher in die 
 lip man in die heart of man man by this dial atheists will ever be talking of that their opinion as if they fainted in it within themselves and would be glad to be strengthened by me consent of others nay more you shall have atheists strive to get disciples as it faredh with other sects and which is most of all you shall have of mem mat will suffer for adieism and not recant whereas if they did truly 
 think mat mere were no such dung as god why should diey trouble themselves epicurus is charged that he did but dissemble for his sake when he affirmed there were blessed natures but such as enjoyed themselves without having respect to the 
 government of the world 
 wherein they say he did temporise though in secret he 
 thought there was no god but certainly he is traduced for his words are noble and divine non deos vulgi negare profanum sed vulgi opines diis applicare prcfanum 
 plato could have said no more and although he had the confidence to deny the administration he had not the power to deny the nature the indians of the west have names for their particular gods though they have no name for god as if the heathens should have had the names jupiter apollo mars c but not the word deus which shows that even those barbarous people have the notion though they 
 have not the latitude and extent of it so that against atheists the very savages take part with the very subtlest philosophers the contemplative atheist is rare a diagoras a bion a lucian perhaps and some others and yet they seem to be more than they are for that all that impugn a received religion or superstition are by the adverse part branded with the name of atheists 
 but me great atheists indeed are hypocrites which are ever handling holy things but without feeling so as they must needs be cauterised in the end the causes of atheism are divisions in religion if they be many for any one main division addeth zeal to both sides but many divisions introduce atheism 
 another is scandal of priests when it is come to that which st bernard saith mon est ian dicere ut populus sic nes sacerdos a third is custom of profane scoffing in holy 
 matters which doth by little and little deface the reverence of religion and lastly learned times specially with peace and prosperity for troubles and adversities do more bow minds to religion 
 they that deny a god destroy nobility for certainly man is of kin to the beasts by his body and if he be not of kin to god by his spirit he is a base and ignoble creature it destroys likewise magnanimity and the raising of human nature for take an example of a dog and mark what a generosity and courage he will put on when he finds himself maintained by a man who to him is in stead of a god or melior natura which courage is manifestly such as that creature without that confidence of a better nature than his own could never attain 
 so man when he resteth and assureth himself upon divine protection and favour gathereth a force and faith which human nature in itself could not obtain 
 therefore as atheism is in all respects hateful so in this that it depriveth human nature of the means to exalt itself above human frailty as it is in particular persons so it is in nations never was there such a state for magnanimity as rome of this state hear what cicero saith quam volumus licet patres conscripti nos amemus tamen nec numero hispans nec robore gallos mec calliditate poems nec 
 artibus denique hoc ipso huius gentis et terrae domestico nativoque sensu itlos ipsos et latinos sed pietate ac religione atque hac una sapientia quod deorum imortalium numine omnia regi gubernarique perspeximus ormes gentes nationesque superavimus

 chapter i 
 
 the evening of a day of walking 
 early in the month of october about an hour before sunset a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of d the few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness it was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance he was a man of medium stature thickset and robust in the prime of life 
 he might have been or years old a cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face burned and tanned by sun and wind and dripping with perspiration his shirt of coarse yellow linen fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor permitted a view of his hairy breast 
 he had a cravat twisted into a string trousers of blue drilling worn and threadbare white on one knee and torn on the other an old gray tattered blouse patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine a tightly packed soldier knapsack well buckled and perfectly new on his back an enormous knotty stick in his hand shoes on his stockingless feet a shaved head and a long beard 
 the sweat the heat the journey on foot the dust added i know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole 
 his hair was closely cut yet bristling for it had begun to grow a little and did not seem to have been cut for some time 
 no one knew him 
 he was evidently only a chance whence came he 
 from the south from the seashore perhaps for he made his entrance into d by the same street which seven months previously had witnessed the passage of the emperor napoleon on his way from cannes to paris 
 this man must have been walking all day he seemed very much fatigued 
 some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard gassendi and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade 
 he must have been very thirsty for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink two hundred paces further on at the fountain in the 
 on arriving at the corner of the rue poichevert he turned to the left and directed his steps toward the he entered then came out a quarter of an hour later 
 a gendarme was seated near the door on the stone bench which general drouot had mounted on the th of march to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of d the proclamation of the gulf juan 
 the man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme 
 the gendarme without replying to his salute stared attentively at him followed him for a while with his eyes and then entered the 
 there then existed at d a fine inn at the sign of the cross of colbas 
 this inn had for a landlord a certain jacquin labarre a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another labarre who kept the inn of the three dauphins in grenoble and had served in the guides 
 at the time of the landing many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the three dauphins 
 it was said that general bertrand disguised as a carter had made frequent trips thither in the month of january and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of gold to the citizens 
 the truth is that when the emperor entered grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture he had thanked the mayor saying i am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance and he had betaken himself to the three dauphins 
 this glory of the labarre of the three dauphins was reflected upon the labarre of the cross of colbas at a distance of five and twenty leagues it was said of him in the town that is the cousin of the man of grenoble 
 the man bent his steps towards this inn which was the best in the he entered the kitchen which opened on a level with the street 
 all the stoves were lighted a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace 
 the host who was also the chief cook was going from one to another very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners whose loud talking conversation and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment any one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners 
 a fat marmot flanked by white partridges and was turning on a long spit before the fire on the stove two huge carps from lake lauzet and a trout from lake alloz were cooking 
 the host hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter said without raising his eyes from his stoves 
 what do you wish sir 
 food and lodging said the man 
 nothing easier replied the host 
 at that moment he turned his head took in the appearance with a single glance and added by paying for it 
 the man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse and answered i have money 
 in that case we are at your service said the host 
 the man put his purse back in his pocket removed his knapsack from his back put it on the ground near the door retained his stick in his hand and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire d is in the mountains 
 the evenings are cold there in october 
 but as the host went back and forth he scrutinized the traveller 
 will dinner be ready soon said the man 
 immediately replied the landlord 
 while the newcomer was warming himself before the fire with his back turned the worthy host jacquin labarre drew a pencil from his pocket then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window 
 on the white margin he wrote a line or two folded it without sealing and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey 
 the landlord whispered a word in the ear and the child set off on a run in the direction of the 
 the traveller saw nothing of all this 
 once more he inquired will dinner be ready soon 
 immediately responded the host 
 the child returned 
 he brought back the paper 
 the host unfolded it eagerly like a person who is expecting a reply 
 he seemed to read it attentively then tossed his head and remained thoughtful for a moment 
 then he took a step in the direction of the traveller who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene 
 i cannot receive you sir said he 
 the man half rose 
 what 
 are you afraid that i will not pay you 
 do you want me to pay you in advance 
 i have money i tell you 
 it is not that 
 what then 
 you have money 
 yes said the man 
 and i said the host have no room 
 the man resumed tranquilly put me in the stable 
 i cannot 
 why 
 the horses take up all the space 
 very well retorted the man a corner of the loft then a truss of straw 
 we will see about that after dinner 
 i cannot give you any dinner 
 this declaration made in a measured but firm tone struck the stranger as grave 
 he rose 
 ah bah 
 but i am dying of hunger 
 i have been walking since sunrise i have travelled twelve leagues 
 i pay 
 i wish to eat 
 i have nothing said the landlord 
 the man burst out laughing and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves 
 nothing and all that 
 all that is engaged 
 by whom 
 by messieurs the wagoners 
 how many are there of them 
 twelve 
 there is enough food there for twenty 
 they have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance 
 the man seated himself again and said without raising his voice i am at an inn i am hungry and i shall remain 
 then the host bent down to his ear and said in a tone which made him start go away 
 at that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the tip of his staff he turned quickly round and as he opened his mouth to reply the host gazed steadily at him and added still in a low voice stop enough of that sort of talk 
 do you want me to tell you your name 
 your name is jean valjean 
 now do you want me to tell you who you are 
 when i saw you come in i suspected something i sent to the and this was the reply that was sent to me can you read 
 so saying he held out to the stranger fully unfolded the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the and from the to the inn 
 the man cast a glance upon it the landlord resumed after a pause 
 i am in the habit of being polite to every one 
 go away 
 the man dropped his head picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground and took his departure 
 he chose the principal street 
 he walked straight on at a venture keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man he did not turn round a single time 
 had he done so he would have seen the host of the cross of colbas standing on his threshold surrounded by all the guests of his inn and all the in the street talking vivaciously and pointing him out with his finger and from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town 
 he saw nothing of all this 
 people who are crushed do not look behind them 
 they know but too well the evil fate which follows them 
 thus he proceeded for some time walking on without ceasing traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing forgetful of his fatigue as is often the case when a man is sad 
 all at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply 
 night was drawing near he glanced about him to see whether he could not discover some shelter 
 the fine hostelry was closed to him he was seeking some very humble public house some hovel however lowly 
 just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets a pine branch suspended from a of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight 
 he proceeded thither 
 it proved to be in fact a public house 
 the public house which is in the rue de chaffaut 
 the wayfarer halted for a moment and peeped through the window into the interior of the room of the public house illuminated by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth 
 some men were engaged in drinking there 
 the landlord was warming himself an iron pot suspended from a crane bubbled over the flame 
 the entrance to this public house which is also a sort of an inn is by two doors 
 one opens on the street the other upon a small yard filled with manure 
 the traveller dare not enter by the street door he slipped into the yard halted again then raised the latch timidly and opened the door 
 who goes there said the master 
 some one who wants supper and bed 
 good 
 we furnish supper and bed here 
 he entered 
 all the men who were drinking turned round the lamp illuminated him on one side the firelight on the other they examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack 
 the host said to him there is the fire 
 the supper is cooking in the pot 
 come and warm yourself comrade 
 he approached and seated himself near the hearth 
 he stretched out his feet which were exhausted with fatigue to the fire a fine odor was emitted by the pot 
 all that could be distinguished of his face beneath his cap which was well pulled down assumed a vague appearance of comfort mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows 
 it was moreover a firm energetic and melancholy profile this physiognomy was strangely composed it began by seeming humble and ended by seeming severe 
 the eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire beneath brushwood 
 one of the men seated at the table however was a fishmonger who before entering the public house of the rue de chaffaut had been to stable his horse at it chanced that he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between bras have forgotten the name i think it was escoublon 
 now when he met him the man who then seemed already extremely weary had requested him to take him on his crupper to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait 
 this fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded jacquin labarre and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the cross of colbas 
 from where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to the the went to him 
 they exchanged a few words in a low tone 
 the man had again become absorbed in his reflections 
 the returned to the fireplace laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man and said to him 
 you are going to get out of here 
 the stranger turned round and replied gently ah 
 you know 
 yes 
 i was sent away from the other inn 
 and you are to be turned out of this one 
 where would you have me go 
 elsewhere 
 the man took his stick and his knapsack and departed 
 as he went out some children who had followed him from the cross of colbas and who seemed to be lying in wait for him threw stones at him 
 he retraced his steps in anger and threatened them with his stick 
 the children dispersed like a flock of birds 
 he passed before the prison 
 at the door hung an iron chain attached to a bell 
 he rang 
 the wicket opened 
 turnkey said he removing his cap politely will you have the kindness to admit me and give me a lodging for the night 
 a voice replied 
 the prison is not an inn 
 get yourself arrested and you will be admitted 
 the wicket closed again 
 he entered a little street in which there were many gardens some of them are enclosed only by hedges which lends a cheerful aspect to the street 
 in the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small house of a single story the window of which was lighted up 
 he peered through the pane as he had done at the public house 
 within was a large whitewashed room with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff and a cradle in one corner a few wooden chairs and a gun hanging on the wall a table was spread in the centre of the room 
 a copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen the pewter jug shining like silver and filled with wine and the brown smoking at this table sat a man of about forty with a merry and open countenance who was dandling a little child on his knees 
 close by a very young woman was nursing another child the father was laughing the child was laughing the mother was smiling 
 the stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender and calming spectacle 
 what was taking place within him he alone could have told 
 it is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable and that in a place where he beheld so much happiness he would find perhaps a little pity 
 he tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock 
 they did not hear him 
 he tapped again 
 he heard the woman say it seems to me husband that some one is knocking 
 no replied the husband 
 he tapped a third time 
 the husband rose took the lamp and went to the door which he opened 
 he was a man of lofty stature half peasant half artisan he wore a huge leather apron which reached to his left shoulder and which a hammer a red handkerchief a and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle as in a pocket caused to bulge out 
 he carried his head thrown backwards his shirt widely opened and turned back displayed his bull neck white and bare 
 he had thick eyelashes enormous black whiskers prominent eyes the lower part of his face like a snout and besides all this that air of being on his own ground which is indescribable 
 pardon me sir said the wayfarer could you in consideration of payment give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in the garden in which to sleep 
 tell me can you for money 
 who are you demanded the master of the house 
 the man replied 
 i have just come from i have walked all day long 
 i have travelled twelve leagues 
 can you if i pay 
 i would not refuse said the peasant to lodge any respectable man who would pay me 
 but why do you not go to the inn 
 there is no room 
 bah 
 impossible 
 this is neither a fair nor a market day have you been to labarre 
 yes 
 well 
 the traveller replied with embarrassment 
 i do not know he did not receive me 
 have you been to in the rue chaffaut 
 the embarrassment increased he stammered he did not receive me either 
 the countenance assumed an expression of distrust he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet and suddenly exclaimed with a sort of shudder 
 are you the man 
 he cast a fresh glance upon the stranger took three steps backwards placed the lamp on the table and took his gun down from the wall 
 meanwhile at the words are you the man the woman had risen had clasped her two children in her arms and had taken refuge precipitately behind her husband staring in terror at the stranger with her bosom uncovered and with frightened eyes as she murmured in a low tone 
 patois of the french alps 
 chat de maraude rascally marauder 
 all this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to self 
 after having scrutinized the man for several moments as one scrutinizes a viper the master of the house returned to the door and said 
 clear out 
 for sake a glass of water said the man 
 a shot from my gun said the peasant 
 then he closed the door violently and the man heard him shoot two large bolts 
 a moment later the was closed and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside 
 night continued to fall 
 a cold wind from the alps was blowing by the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived in one of the gardens which bordered the street a sort of hut which seemed to him to be built of sods 
 he climbed over the wooden fence resolutely and found himself in the garden 
 he approached the hut its door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture and it resembled those buildings which construct for themselves along the roads 
 he thought without doubt that it was in fact the dwelling of a he was suffering from cold and hunger but this was at least a shelter from the cold this sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night 
 he threw himself flat on his face and crawled into the hut 
 it was warm there and he found a tolerably good bed of straw 
 he lay for a moment stretched out on this bed without the power to make a movement so fatigued was he 
 then as the knapsack on his back was in his way and as it furnished moreover a pillow ready to his hand he set about unbuckling one of the straps 
 at that moment a ferocious growl became audible 
 he raised his eyes 
 the head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut 
 it was a kennel 
 he was himself vigorous and formidable he armed himself with his staff made a shield of his knapsack and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could not without enlarging the rents in his rags 
 he left the garden in the same manner but backwards being obliged in order to keep the dog respectful to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as la rose couverte 
 when he had not without difficulty repassed the fence and found himself once more in the street alone without refuge without shelter without a roof over his head chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone and it appears that a heard him exclaim i am not even a dog 
 he soon rose again and resumed his march 
 he went out of the town hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter 
 he walked thus for some time with his head still drooping when he felt himself far from every human habitation he raised his eyes and gazed searchingly about him 
 he was in a field before him was one of those low hills covered with stubble which after the harvest resemble shaved heads 
 the horizon was perfectly black 
 this was not alone the obscurity of night it was caused by very clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself and which were mounting and filling the whole sky 
 meanwhile as the moon was about to rise and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth 
 the earth was thus better lighted than the sky which produces a particularly sinister effect and the hill whose contour was poor and mean was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon the whole effect was hideous petty lugubrious and narrow 
 there was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer 
 this man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things nevertheless there was something in that sky in that hill in that plain in that tree which was so profoundly desolate that after a moment of immobility and revery he turned back abruptly 
 there are instants when nature seems hostile 
 he retraced his steps the gates of d were closed 
 d which had sustained sieges during the wars of religion was still surrounded in by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been demolished since 
 he passed through a breach and entered the town again 
 it might have been eight in the evening 
 as he was not acquainted with the streets he recommenced his walk at random 
 in this way he came to the prefecture then to the seminary as he passed through the cathedral square he shook his fist at the church 
 at the corner of this square there is a printing establishment it is there that the proclamations of the emperor and of the imperial guard to the army brought from the island of elba and dictated by napoleon himself were printed for the first time 
 worn out with fatigue and no longer entertaining any hope he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office 
 at that moment an old woman came out of the church 
 she saw the man stretched out in the shadow 
 what are you doing there my friend said she 
 he answered harshly and angrily 
 as you see my good woman i am sleeping 
 the good woman who was well worthy the name in fact was the marquise de r 
 on this bench she went on 
 i have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years said the man i have a mattress of stone 
 you have been a soldier 
 yes my good woman a soldier 
 why do you not go to the inn 
 because i have no money 
 alas said madame de r i have only four sous in my purse 
 give it to me all the same 
 the man took the four sous 
 madame de r continued 
 you cannot obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum 
 but have you tried it is impossible for you to pass the night thus 
 you are cold and hungry no doubt 
 some one might have given you a lodging out of charity 
 i have knocked at all doors 
 well 
 i have been driven away everywhere 
 the good woman touched the arm and pointed out to him on the other side of the street a small low house which stood beside the palace 
 you have knocked at all doors 
 yes 
 have you knocked at that one 
 no 
 knock there

 the empire strikes back 
 ii 
 
 the temperature on the surface of hoth had dropped but despite the frigid imperial probe droid continued its leisurely drift above the fields andhills its extended sensors still reaching in all directions for life signs 
 the heat sensors suddenly reacted it had found a heat source in thevicinity and warmth was a good indication of life the head swiveled on its sensitive eyelike blisters noting the direction from which the heat sourceoriginated automatically the probe robot adjusted its speed and began to move atmaximum velocity over the icy fields 
 the insectlike machine slowed only when it neared a mound of snow bigger thanthe probe droid itself the scanners made note of the meters in height and an enormous six meters long but the was of only secondary importance what was truly astounding if a surveillancemachine could ever be astounded was the amount of heat radiating from beneath themound the creature under that snowy hill must surely be well protected against thecold 
 a thin beam of light shot from one of the probe intense heat boring into the white mound and scattering gleaming snow flecks inall directions 
 the mound began to shiver then to quake whatever existed beneath it wasdeeply irritated by the probing laser beam snow began to fall away from themound in sizable clumps when at one end two eyes showed through the mass ofwhite 
 huge yellow eyes peered like twin points of fire at the mechanical creature thatcontinued to blast away with its painful beams the eyes burned with primevalhatred for the thing that had interrupted its slumber 
 the mound shook again with a roar that nearly destroyed the probe sensors it zoomed back several meters widening the space between it andthe creature the droid had never before encountered a wampa ice creature itscomputers advised that the beast be dealt with expeditiously 
 the droid made an internal adjustment to regulate the potency of its laser than a moment later the beam was at maximum intensity the machine aimedthe laser at the creature enveloping it in a great flaming and smoking later the few remaining particles of the wampa were swept away by the icywinds 
 the smoke disappeared leaving behind no physical for a largedepression in the an ice creature had ever been there 
 but its existence had been properly recorded in the memory of the probe was already continued on its programmed mission 
 the roars of another wampa ice creature finally awakened the battered youngrebel commander head was spinning aching perhaps exploding for all hecould tell with painstaking effort he brought his vision into focus discerning thathe was in an ice gorge its jagged walls reflecting the fading twilight 
 he suddenly realized he was hanging upside down arms dangling and fingertipssome thirty centimeters from the snowy floor his ankles were numb he cranedhis neck and saw that his feet were frozen in ice hanging from the ceiling and that theice was forming on his legs like stalactites he could feel the frozen mask of hisown blood caked on his face where the wampa ice creature had viciously slashedhim 
 again luke heard the bestial moans louder now as they resounded through thedeep and narrow passageway of ice the roars of the monster were deafening hewondered which would kill him first the cold or the fangs and claws of the thing thatinhabited the gorge 
 got to free myself he thought get free of this ice his strength had not yetreturned fully but with a determined effort he pulled himself up and reached for theconfining bonds still too weak luke could not break the ice and fell back into hishanging position the white floor rushing up at him 
 relax he said to himself relax 
 the ice walls creaked with the bellows of the approaching feet crunched on the frigid ground coming frightening nearer it would not belong before the shaggy white horror would be back and possibly warming the coldyoung warrior in the darkness of its belly 
 eyes darted about the gorge finally spotting the pile of gear he hadbrought with him on his mission now lying in a useless crumpled heap on the equipment was nearly a full unattainable meter beyond his grasp and with thatgear was a device that entirely captured his stout handgrip unit with apair of small switches and a surmounting metal disk the object had once belongedto his father a former jedi knight who had been betrayed and murdered by the youngdarth vader but now it was given him by ben kenobi to be wielded withhonor against imperial tyranny 
 in desperation luke tried twisting his aching body just enough to reach thediscarded lightsaber but the freezing cold coursing through his body slowed himdown and weakened him luke was beginning to resign himself to his fate as heheard the snarling wampa ice creature approaching his last feelings of hope werenearly gone when he sensed the presence 
 but it was not the presence of the white giant that dominated this gorge 
 rather it was that soothing spiritual presence which occasionally visited luke inmoments of stress or danger the presence that had first come to him only after oldben once again in his jedi role of kenobi vanished into a crumple of hisown dark robes after being cut down by darth lightsaber the presence thatwas sometimes like a familiar voice an almost silent whisper that spoke directly mind 
 luke the whisper was there again hauntingly think of the lightsaber inyour hand 
 the words made already aching head throb then he felt a suddenresurgence of strength a feeling of confidence that urged him to continue fightingdespite his apparently hopeless situation his eyes fixed upon the lightsaber hishand reached out painfully the freezing in his limbs already taking its toll hesqueezed his eyes shut in concentration but the weapon was still beyond his knew that the lightsaber would require more than just struggling to reach 
 gotta relax luke told himself relax his disembodied guardian let theforce flow luke 
 the force 
 luke saw the inverted gorillalike image of the wampa ice creature looming itsraised arms ending in enormous gleaming claws he could see the apish face for thefirst time now and shivered at the sight of the ramlike horns the quiveringlower jaw with its protruding fangs 
 but then the warrior divorced the creature from his thoughts he stoppedstruggling for his weapon his body relaxed and went limp allowing his spirit to bereceptive to his suggestion already he could feel coursing through himthat energy field generated by all living beings that bound the very universe together 
 as kenobi had taught him the force was within luke to use as he saw fit 
 the wampa ice creature spread its black hooked claws and lumbered towardthe hanging youth suddenly the lightsaber as if by magic sprang to he depressed a colored button on the weapon releasing a beamthat quickly severed his icy bonds 
 as luke weapon in hand dropped to the floor the monstrous figure toweringover him took a cautious step backward the sulfurous eyes blinkedincredulously at the humming lightshaft a sight baffling to its primitive brain 
 though it was difficult to move luke jumped to his feet and waved hislightsaber at the mass of muscle and hair forcing it back a step anotherstep brining the weapon down luke cut through the hide with the bladeof light the wampa ice creature shrieked its hideous roar of agony shaking thegorge walls it turned and hastily lumbered out of the gorge its white bulk blendingwith the distant terrain 
 the sky was already noticeably darker and with the encroaching darkness camethe colder winds the force was with luke but even that mysterious power couldnot warm him now every step he took as he stumbled out of the gorge was moredifficult than the last finally his vision dimming as rapidly as the daylight lukestumbled down an embankment of snow and was unconscious before he even reachedthe bottom 
 in the subsurface main hangar dock chewie was getting the millennium falconready for takeoff he looked up from his work to see a rather curious pair of figuresthat had just appeared from around a nearby corner to mingle with the usual rebelactivity in the hangar 
 neither of these figures was human although one of them had a humanoid shapeand gave the impression of a man in knightly golden armor his movement wereprecise almost too precise to be human as he clanked stiffly through the companion required no manlike legs for locomotion for he was doing quite wellrolling his shorter barrellike body along on miniature wheels 
 the shorter of the two droids was beeping and whistling excitedly 
 not my fault you malfunctioning tin can the tall anthropomorphic droidstated gesturing with a metallic hand i did not ask you to turn on the thermalheater i merely commented that it was freezing in her chamber but supposedto be freezing how are we going to get all her things dried out ah here weare 
 the golden droid in human shape paused to focus his opticalsensors on the docked millennium falcon 
 the other robot retracted his wheels and frontal leg and rested hisstout metal body on the ground the smaller sensors were reading thefamiliar figures of han solo and his wookiee companion as those two continued thework of replacing the central lifters 
 master solo sir threepio called the only one of the robotic twosomeequipped with an imitation human voice might i have a word with you 
 han was not particularly in a mood to be disturbed especially by this fastidiousdroid what is it 
 mistress leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator threepioinformed him it must be malfunctioning 
 but han knew that it was not i shut it off he said sharply as he continued towork on his ship what does her royal holiness want 
 auditory sensors identified the disdain in voice but did notunderstand it the robot mimicked a human gesture as he added she is looking formaster luke and assumed he would be here with you no one seems to know 
 not back yet immediately han became concerned he could seethat the sky beyond the ice cavern entrance had grown considerably darker since heand chewbacca had begun to repair the millennium falcon han knew just howseverely the temperatures dropped on the surface after nightfall and how deadly thewinds could be 
 in a flash he jumped off the lift not even looking back toward thewookiee bolt it down chewie officer of the deck han yelled then broughthis comlink to his mouth and asked security control has commander skywalkerreported in yet a negative reply brought a scowl to face 
 the deck sergeant and his aide hurried up to solo in response to his summons 
 is commander skywalker back yet han asked tension in his voice 
 i seen him the deck sergeant replied possible he came inthrough the south entrance 
 check on it solo snapped though he was not in an official position to givecommands urgent 
 as the deck sergeant and his aide turned and rushed down the corridor artooemitted a concerned whistle that rose inquiringly in pitch 
 i know artoo threepio answered stiffly turning his upper torso andhead in direction sir might i inquire going on 
 anger welled up inside han as he grunted back at the robot go tell yourprecious princess that luke is dead unless he shows up soon 
 artoo began to whistle hysterically at grim prediction and golden partner exclaimed oh no 
 the main tunnel was filled with activity when han solo rushed in he saw apair of rebel troopers employing all their physical strength to restrain a nervoustauntaun that was trying to break free 
 from the opposite end the deck officer rushed into the corridor his eyes dartingaround the chamber until he had spotted han sir he said skywalker come through the south entrance he might haveforgotten to check in 
 not likely han snapped are the speeders ready 
 not yet the deck officer answered adapting them to the cold is provingdifficult maybe by morning 
 han cut him off there any time to waste on machines that could andprobably would break down have to go out on tauntauns take sectorfour 
 the temperature is falling too rapidly 
 you bet it is han growled and out in it 
 the other officer volunteered cover sector twelve have control set screenalpha 
 but han knew there was no time for control to get its surveillance camerasoperating not with luke probably dying somewhere on the desolate plains pushed his way through the assemblage of rebel troops and took the reins of oneof the trained tauntauns leaping onto the back 
 the night storms will start before any of you can reach the first marker thedeck officer warned 
 then see you in hell grunted han tugging the reins of his mount andmaneuvering the animal out of the cave 
 snow was falling heavily as han solo raced his tauntaun through the was near and the winds were howling fiercely piercing his heavy clothes heknew that he would be as useless as an icicle to luke unless he found the youngwarrior soon 
 the tauntaun was already feeling the effects of the temperature drop not evenits layers of insulating fat or the matted gray fur could protect it from the elementsafter nightfall already the beast was wheezing its breathing becoming increasinglylabored 
 han prayed that the drop at least not until he had locatedluke 
 he drove his mount harder forcing it on across the icy plains 
 another figure was moving across the snow its metal body hovering above thefrozen ground 
 the imperial probe droid paused briefly in its sensors twitching 
 then satisfied with its findings the robot gently lowered itself coming to reston the ground like spider legs several probes separated from the metal some of the snow that had settled there 
 something began to take shape around the robot a pulsating glow that graduallycovered the machine as if with a transparent dome quickly this force fieldsolidified repelling the blowing snow that brushed over the hull 
 after a moment the glow faded and the blowing snow soon formed a perfectdome of white completely concealing the droid and its protective force field 
 the tauntaun was racing at maximum speed certainly too fast considering thedistance it had traveled and the unbearable frigid air no longer wheezing it hadbegun moaning pitifully and its legs were becoming more and more unsteady hanfelt sorry about the pain but at present the life was onlysecondary to that of his friend luke 
 it was becoming difficult for han to see through the thickening he searched for some interruption in the eternal plains some distant spotthat might actually be luke but there was nothing to see other than the darkeningexpanses of snow and ice 
 yet there was a sound 
 han drew the reins in bringing the tauntaun to an abrupt halt on the could not be certain but there seemed to be some sound other than the howlingof the winds that whipped past him he strained to look in the direction of thesound 
 then he spurred his tauntaun forcing it to gallop across the field 
 luke could have been a corpse food for the scavengers by the time the light ofdawn returned but somehow he was still alive though barely and struggling to staythat way even with the night storms violently assaulting him luke painfully pulledhimself upright from the snow only to be blasted back down by the freezing he fell he considered the irony of it farm boy from tatooine maturing tobattle the death star now perishing alone in a frozen alien wasteland 
 it took all of remaining strength to drag himself a half meter beforefinally collapsing sinking into the drifts i he said thoughno one could hear his words 
 but someone though still unseen had heard 
 you must the words vibrated in mind luke look at me 
 luke could not ignore that command the power of those softly spoken wordswas too great 
 with a great effort luke lifted his head and saw what he thought was ahallucination in front of him apparently unaffected by the cold and still clad onlyin the shabby robes he had worn in the hot desert of tatooine stood ben kenobi 
 luke wanted to call out to him but he was speechless 
 the apparition spoke with the same gentle authority ben had always used withthe young man you must survive luke 
 the young commander found the strength to move his lips again cold 
 you must go to the dagobah system the spectral figure of ben kenobiinstructed you will learn from yoda the jedi master the one who taught me 
 luke listened then reached to touch the ghostly figure benben hegroaned 
 the figure remained unmoved by efforts to reach it luke it spokeagain our only hope 
 our only hope 
 luke was confused yet before he could gather the strength to ask for anexplanation the figure began to fade and when every trace of the apparition hadpassed from his sight luke thought he saw the approach of a tauntaun with a humanrider on its back the was approaching its gait unsteady the riderwas still too far away too obscured by the storm for identification 
 in desperation the young rebel commander called out ben before againdropping off into unconsciousness 
 the was barely able to stand on its saurian hind legs when han soloreined it to a stop and dismounted 
 han looked with horror at the almost frozen form lying as if deadat his feet 
 come on buddy he appealed to inert figure immediately forgetting hisown nearly frozen body you dead yet give me a signal here 
 han could detect no sign of life and noticed that face nearly coveredwith snow was savagely torn he rubbed at the face being careful not totouch the drying wounds do this luke not your time 
 finally a slight response a low moan barely audible over the winds wasstrong enough to send a warm glow through own shivering body he grinnedwith relief i knew you leave me out here all alone got to getyou out of here 
 knowing that his in the speed of the moved toward the beast carrying the young warrior limply in his arms butbefore he could drape the unconscious form over the back the an agonized roar then fell into a shaggy gray heap on the snow laying hiscompanion down han rushed to the side of the fallen creature the tauntaun madeone final sound not a roar or bellow but only a sickly rasp then the beast wassilent 
 solo gripped the hide his numbed fingers searching for even theslightest indication of life deader than a triton moon he said knowing that lukedid not hear a word we got much time 
 resting motionless form against the belly of the dead hanproceeded to work it might be something of a sacrilege he mused using a favorite weapon like this but right now lightsaber was the mostefficient and precise tool to cut through the thick skin of a tauntaun 
 at first the weapon felt strange in his hand but momentarily he was cutting carcass from hairy head to scaly hind paws han winced at the foul odorthat rose from the steaming incision there were few things he could remember thatstank like a innards without deliberation he tossed the slipperyentrails into the snow 
 when the corpse had been entirely eviscerated han shoved his friendinside the warm skin i know this smell so good luke keep you from freezing sure this tauntaun hesitate if it were theother way around 
 from the body of the another blast of rose out of thedisemboweled cavity whew han almost gagged just as well outcold pal 
 there much time left to do what had to be done freezing handswent to the supply pack strapped to the back and rummaged through items until he located the shelter container 
 before unpacking it he spoke into his comlink echo base do you copy 
 no response 
 this comlink is useless 
 the sky had darkened ominously and the winds blew violently making evenbreathing close to impossible han fought to open the shelter container and stifflybegan to construct the one piece of rebel equipment that might protect them for a short while longer 
 if i get this shelter up fast he grumbled to himself jabba needthose bounty hunters

 chapter xvi 
 
 pierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself in petersburg and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to moscow the story told about him at count was true pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear he had now been for some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his house though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in moscow and that the ladies about his father who were never favorably disposed toward him would have used it to turn the count against him he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his part of the house entering the drawing room where the princesses spent most of their time he greeted the ladies two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud it was the eldest who was reading the one who had met anna mikhaylovna the two younger ones were embroidering both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper the eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes the second assumed precisely the same expression while the youngest the one with the mole who was of a cheerful and lively disposition bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw she drew her wool down through the canvas and scarcely able to refrain from laughing stooped as if trying to make out the pattern 
 how do you do cousin said pierre you recognize me 
 i recognize you only too well too well 
 how is the count can i see him asked pierre awkwardly as usual but unabashed 
 the count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings 
 can i see the count pierre again asked 
 hm if you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can see him olga go and see whether beef tea is ready it is almost time she added giving pierre to understand that they were busy and busy making his father comfortable while evidently he pierre was only busy causing him annoyance 
 olga went out pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed and said then i will go to my rooms you will let me know when i can see him 
 and he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole 
 next day prince vasili had arrived and settled in the house he sent for pierre and said to him my dear fellow if you are going to behave here as you did in petersburg you will end very badly that is all i have to say to you the count is very very ill and you must not see him at all 
 since then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs 
 when boris appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his room stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall as if running a sword through an invisible foe and glaring savagely over his spectacles and then again resuming his walk muttering indistinct words shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating 
 england is done for said he scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen mr pitt as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man is sentenced to but before pierre who at that moment imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured london could pronounce sentence he saw a and handsome young officer entering his room pierre paused he had left moscow when boris was a boy of fourteen and had quite forgotten him but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took boris by the hand with a friendly smile 
 do you remember me asked boris quietly with a pleasant smile i have come with my mother to see the count but it seems he is not well 
 yes it seems he is ill people are always disturbing him answered pierre trying to remember who this young man was 
 boris felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked pierre straight in the face 
 count rostov asks you to come to dinner today said he after a considerable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortable 
 ah count rostov exclaimed pierre joyfully then you are his son ilya only fancy i know you at first do you remember how we went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot such an age 
 you are mistaken said boris deliberately with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile i am boris son of princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya rostov the father is ilya and his son is nicholas i never knew any madame jacquot 
 pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees 
 oh dear what am i thinking about mixed everything up one has so many relatives in moscow so you are boris of course well now we know where we are and what do you think of the boulogne expedition the english will come off badly you know if napoleon gets across the channel i think the expedition is quite feasible if only villeneuve make a mess of things 
 boris knew nothing about the boulogne expedition he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard name 
 we here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone i know nothing about it and have not thought about it moscow is chiefly busy with gossip he continued just now they are talking about you and your father 
 pierre smiled in his way as if afraid for his sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret but boris spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight into eyes 
 moscow has nothing else to do but gossip boris went on everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune though he may perhaps outlive us all as i sincerely hope he will 
 yes it is all very horrid interrupted pierre very horrid 
 pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself 
 and it must seem to you said boris flushing slightly but not changing his tone or attitude it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man 
 so it does thought pierre 
 but i just wish to say to avoid misunderstandings that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people we are very poor but for my own part at any rate for the very reason that your father is rich i regard myself as a relation of his and neither i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him 
 for a long time pierre could not understand but when he did he jumped up from the sofa seized boris under the elbow in his quick clumsy way and blushing far more than boris began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation 
 well this is strange do you suppose i who could think i know very well 
 but boris again interrupted him 
 i am glad i have spoken out fully perhaps you did not like it you must excuse me said he putting pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him but i hope i have not offended you i always make it a rule to speak out well what answer am i to take will you come to dinner at the rostovs 
 and boris having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it became quite pleasant again 
 no but i say said pierre calming down you are a wonderful fellow what you have just said is good very good of course you know me we have not met for such a long time not since we were children you might think that i i understand quite understand i could not have done it myself i should not have had the courage but splendid i am very glad to have made your acquaintance queer he added after a pause that you should have suspected me he began to laugh well what of it i hope get better acquainted and he pressed boris hand do you know i have not once been in to see the count he has not sent for me i am sorry for him as a man but what can one do 
 and so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across asked boris with a smile 
 pierre saw that boris wished to change the subject and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the boulogne expedition 
 a footman came in to summon boris the princess was going pierre in order to make boris better acquaintance promised to come to dinner and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into boris eyes after he had gone pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant intelligent and resolute young man 
 as often happens in early youth especially to one who leads a lonely life he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends 
 prince vasili saw the princess off she held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful 
 it is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what it may i shall do my duty i will come and spend the night he must not be left like this every moment is precious i think why his nieces put it off perhaps god will help me to find a way to prepare him adieu prince may god support you 
 adieu ma bonne answered prince vasili turning away from her 
 oh he is in a dreadful state said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage he hardly recognizes anybody 
 i understand mamma what is his attitude to pierre asked the son 
 the will will show that my dear our fate also depends on it 
 but why do you expect that he will leave us anything 
 ah my dear he is so rich and we are so poor 
 well that is hardly a sufficient reason mamma 
 oh heaven how ill he is exclaimed the mother

 chapter 
 
 about twelve that night was born the catherine you saw at wuthering heights a puny seven months child and two hours after the mother died having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss heathcliff or know edgar the distraction at his bereavement is a subject too painful to be dwelt on its after effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk a great addition in my eyes was his being left without an heir i bemoaned that as i gazed on the feeble orphan and i mentally abused old linton for what was only natural partiality the securing his estate to his own daughter instead of his an unwelcomed infant it was poor thing it might have wailed out of life and nobody cared a morsel during those first hours of existence we redeemed the neglect afterwards but its beginning was as friendless as its end is likely to be 
 next and cheerful out of softened in through the blinds of the silent room and suffused the couch and its occupant with a mellow tender glow edgar linton had his head laid on the pillow and his eyes shut his young and fair features were almost as deathlike as those of the form beside him and almost as fixed but his was the hush of exhausted anguish and hers of perfect peace her brow smooth her lids closed her lips wearing the expression of a smile no angel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared and i partook of the infinite calm in which she lay my mind was never in a holier frame than while i gazed on that untroubled image of divine rest i instinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours before incomparably beyond and above us all whether still on earth or now in heaven her spirit is at home with god 
 i know if it be a peculiarity in me but i am seldom otherwise than happy while watching in the chamber of death should no frenzied or despairing mourner share the duty with me i see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break and i feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless eternity they have life is boundless in its duration and love in its sympathy and joy in its fulness i noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even in a love like mr when he so regretted blessed release to be sure one might have doubted after the wayward and impatient existence she had led whether she merited a haven of peace at last one might doubt in seasons of cold reflection but not then in the presence of her corpse it asserted its own tranquillity which seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant 
 do you believe such people are happy in the other world sir give a great deal to know 
 i declined answering mrs question which struck me as something heterodox she proceeded 
 retracing the course of catherine linton i fear we have no right to think she is but leave her with her maker 
 the master looked asleep and i ventured soon after sunrise to quit the room and steal out to the pure refreshing air the servants thought me gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch in reality my chief motive was seeing mr heathcliff if he had remained among the larches all night he would have heard nothing of the stir at the grange unless perhaps he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to gimmerton if he had come nearer he would probably be aware from the lights flitting to and fro and the opening and shutting of the outer doors that all was not right within i wished yet feared to find him i felt the terrible news must be told and i longed to get it over but how to do it i did not know he was least a few yards farther in the park leant against an old ash tree his hat off and his hair soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches and fell pattering round him he had been standing a long time in that position for i saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from him busy in building their nest and regarding his proximity no more than that of a piece of timber they flew off at my approach and he raised his eyes and spoke 
 dead he said not waited for you to learn that put your handkerchief snivel before me damn you all she wants none of your tears 
 i was weeping as much for him as her we do sometimes pity creatures that have none of the feeling either for themselves or others and when i first looked into his face i perceived that he had got intelligence of the catastrophe and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled and he prayed because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the ground 
 yes dead i answered checking my sobs and drying my cheeks gone to heaven i hope where we may everyone join her if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good 
 did she take due asked heathcliff attempting a sneer did she die like a saint come give me a true history of the event how did 
 he endeavoured to pronounce the name but could not manage it and compressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony defying meanwhile my sympathy with an unflinching ferocious stare how did she die he resumed at notwithstanding his hardihood to have a support behind him for after the struggle he trembled in spite of himself to his very 
 poor wretch i thought you have a heart and nerves the same as your brother men why should you be anxious to conceal them your pride cannot blind god you tempt him to wring them till he forces a cry of humiliation 
 quietly as a lamb i answered aloud she drew a sigh and stretched herself like a child reviving and sinking again to sleep and five minutes after i felt one little pulse at her heart and nothing more 
 she ever mention me he asked hesitating as if he dreaded the answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear to hear 
 her senses never returned she recognized nobody from the time you left her i said she lies with a sweet smile on her face and her latest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days her life closed in a gentle she wake as kindly in the other world 
 may she wake in torment he cried with frightful vehemence stamping his foot and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion why a liar to the end where is she not in oh you said you cared nothing for my sufferings and i pray one repeat it till my tongue earnshaw may you not rest as long as i am living you said i killed me then the murdered do haunt their murderers i believe i know that ghosts have wandered on earth be with me any me mad only do not leave me in this abyss where i cannot find you oh god it is unutterable i cannot live without my life i cannot live without my soul 
 he dashed his head against the knotted trunk and lifting up his eyes howled not like a man but like a savage beast getting goaded to death with knives and spears i observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree and his hand and forehead were both stained probably the scene i witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night it hardly moved my appalled me still i felt reluctant to quit him so but the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me watching he thundered a command for me to go and i obeyed he was beyond my skill to quiet or console 
 mrs funeral was appointed to take place on the friday following her decease and till then her coffin remained uncovered and strewn with flowers and scented leaves in the great linton spent his days and nights there a sleepless guardian circumstance concealed from all but spent his nights at least outside equally a stranger to repose i held no communication with him still i was conscious of his design to enter if he could and on the tuesday a little after dark when my master from sheer fatigue had been compelled to retire a couple of hours i went and opened one of the windows moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on the faded image of his idol one final adieu he did not omit to avail himself of the opportunity cautiously and briefly too cautiously to betray his presence by the slightest noise indeed i have discovered that he had been there except for the disarrangement of the drapery about the face and for observing on the floor a curl of light hair fastened with a silver thread which on examination i ascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round neck heathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents replacing them by a black lock of his own i twisted the two and enclosed them together 
 mr earnshaw was of course invited to attend the remains of his sister to the grave and he sent no excuse but he never came so that besides her husband the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants isabella was not asked 
 the place of interment to the surprise of the villagers was neither in the chapel under the carved monument of the lintons nor yet by the tombs of her own relations outside it was dug on a green slope in a corner of the kirkyard where the wall is so low that heath and bilberry plants have climbed over it from the moor and peat mould almost buries it her husband lies in the same spot now and they have each a simple headstone above and a plain grey block at their feet to mark the graves

 chapter sixteen 
 
 in the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before for now the shadow of a real trouble had come the little books were full of help and comfort and as they dressed they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them everything seemed very strange when they went down so dim and still outside so full of light and bustle within breakfast at that early hour seemed odd and even familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on the big trunk stood ready in the hall cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa and mother herself sat trying to eat but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution eyes kept filling in spite of herself jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen rollermore than once ant the little girls wore a grave troubled expression as if sorrow was a new experience to them 
 nobody talked much but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage mrs march said to the girls who were all busied about her one folding her shawl another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet a third putting on her overshoes and a forth fastening up her travelling bag 
 children i leave you to care and mr protection hannah is faithfulness itself and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own i have no fears for you yet i am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly grieve and fret when i am gone or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget go on with your work as usual for work is a blessed solace hope and keep busy and whatever happens remember that you never can be fatherless 
 yes mother 
 meg dear be prudent watch over your sisters consult hannah and in any perplexity go to mr laurence be patient jo get despondent or do rash things write to me often and be my brave girl ready to help and cheer all beth comfort yourself with your music and be faithful to the little home duties and you amy help all you can be obedient and keep happy safe at home 
 we will mother we will 
 the rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen that was the hard minute but the girls stood it well no one cried no one ran away or uttered a lamentation though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to father remembering as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them they kissed their mother quietly clung about her tenderly and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away 
 laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off and mr brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him mr greatheart on the spot 
 goodby my darlings god bless and keep us all whispered mrs march as she kissed one dear little face after the other and hurried into the carriage 
 as she rolled away the sun came out and looking back she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen they saw it also and smiled and waved their hands and the last thing she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces and behind them like a bodyguard old mr laurence faithful hannah and devoted laurie 
 how kind everyone is to us she said turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young face 
 i see how they can help it returned mr brooke laughing so infectiously that mrs march could not help smiling and so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine smiles and cheerful words 
 i feel as if there had been an earthquake said jo as their neighbors went home to breakfast leaving them to rest and refresh themselves 
 it seems as if half the house was gone added meg forlornly 
 beth opened her lips to say something but could only point to the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on table showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them it was a little thing but it went straight to their hearts and in spite of their brave resolutions they all broke down and cried bitterly 
 hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings and when the shower showed signs of clearing up she came to the rescue armed with a coffeepot 
 now ny dear young ladies remember what your ma said and fret come and have a cup of coffee all round and then fall to work and be a credit to the family 
 coffee was a treat and hannah showed great tact in making it that morning no one could resist her persuasive nods or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot they drew up to the table exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins and in ten minutes were all right again 
 hope and keep busy the motto for us so see who will remember it best i shall go to aunt march as usual oh she lecture though said jo as she sipped with returning spirit 
 i shall go to my kings though much rather stay at home and attend to things here said meg wishing she made her eyes so red 
 no need of that beth and i can keep house perfectly well 
 put in amy with an important air 
 hannah will tell us what to do and have everything nice when you come home added beth getting out her mop and dish tub without delay 
 i think anxiety is very interesting observed amy eating sugar pensively 
 the girls help laughing and felt better for it though meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar bowl 
 the sight of the turnovers made jo sober again and when the two went out to their daily tasks they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their face it was gone but beth had remembered the little household ceremony and there she was nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin 
 so like my beth said jo waving her hat with a grateful face goodbye meggy i hope the kings strain today fret about father dear she added as they parted 
 and i hope aunt march croak your hair is becoming and it looks very boyish and nice returned meg trying not to smile at the curly head which looked comically small on her tall shoulders 
 my only comfort and touching her hat a la laurie away went jo feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day 
 news from their father comforted the girls very much for though dangerously ill the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good mr brooke sent a bulletin every day and as the head of the family meg insisted on reading the dispatches which grew more cheerful as the week passed at first everyone was eager to write and plump envelopes were carefully 
 poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters who felt rather important with their washington correspondence as one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party we will rob an imaginary mail and read them 
 
 my dearest mother 
 it is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us for the news was so good we help laughing and crying over it how very kind mr brooke is and how fortunate that mr business detains him near you so long since he is so useful to you and father the girls are all as good as gold jo helps me with the sewing and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs i should be afraid she might overdo if i know her moral fit last long beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock and never forgets what you told her she grieves about father and looks sober except when she is at her little piano amy minds me nicely and i take great care of her she does her ownhair and i am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings 
 she tries very hard and i know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come mr laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen as jo says and laurie is very kind and neighborly he and jo keep us merry for we get pretty blue sometimes and feel like orphans with you so far away hannah is a perfect saint she does not scold at all and always calls me miss margaret which is quite proper you know and treats me with respect we are all well and busy but we long day and night to have you back give my dearest love to father and believe me ever your own 
 
 meg 
 
 this note prettily written on scented paper was a great contrast to the next which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and letters 
 
 my precious marmee 
 three cheers for dear father brooke was a trump to telegraph right off and let us know the minute he was better i rushed up garret when the letter came and tried to thank god for being so good to us but i could only cry and say glad glad that do as well as a regular prayer for i felt a great many in my heart we have such funny times and now i can enjoy them for everyone is so desperately good like living in a nest of turtledoves laugh to see meg head the table and try to be motherish she gets prettier every day and in love with her sometimes the children are regular archangels and i well jo and never shall be anything else oh i must tell you that i came near having a quarrel with laurie i freed my mind about a silly little thing and he was offended i was right but speak as i ought and he marched home saying he come again till i begged pardon i declared i and got mad 
 it lasted all day i felt bad and wanted you very much laurie and i are both so proud hard to beg pardon but i thought come to it for i was in the right he come and just at night i remembered what you said when amy fell into the river i read my little book felt better resolved not to let the sun set on my anger and ran over to tell laurie i was sorry i met him at the gate coming for the same thing we both laughed begged each pardon and felt all good and comfortable again 
 i made a pome yesterday when i was helping hannah wash and as father likes my silly little things i put it in to amuse him give him my lovingest hug that ever was and kiss yourself a dozen times for your 
 
 
 jo 
 a song from the suds 
 queen of my tub i merrily sing 
 while the white foam rises high 
 and sturdily wash and rinse and wring 
 and fasten the clothes to dry 
 then out in the free fresh air they swing 
 under the sunny sky 
 i wish we could wash from out hearts and souls 
 the stains of the week away 
 and let water and air by their magic make 
 ourselves as pure as they 
 then on the earth there would be indeed 
 a glorious washing day 
 along the path of a useful life 
 will heartsease ever bloom 
 the busy mind has no time to think 
 of sorrow or care or gloom 
 and anxious thoughts may be swept away 
 as we bravely wield a broom 
 i am glad a task to me is given 
 to labor at day by day 
 for it brings me health and strength and hope 
 and i cheerfully learn to say 
 head you may think heart you may feel 
 but hand you shall work alway 
 
 dear mother 
 there is only room for me to send my love and some pressed pansies from the root i have been keeping safe in the house for father to see i read every morning try to be good all day and sing myself to sleep with tune i sing land of the leal now it makes me cry everyone is very kind and we are as happy as we can be without you amy wants the rest of the page so i must stop i forget to cover the holders and i wind the clock and air the rooms every day

lionfish nov chapter fifteen aragogcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses but with no hagrid visible from the castle windows striding the grounds with fang at his heels the scene look right to harry no better in fact than the inside of the castle where things were so horribly wrong 
 
 harry and ron had tried to visit hermione but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing 
 
 taking no more chances madam pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door no sorry every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off 
 
 with dumbledore gone fear had spread as never before so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows there was barely a face to be seen in the school that look worried and tense and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled 
 
 harry constantly repeated final words to himself i will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it but what good were these words who exactly were they supposed to ask for help when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were 
 
 hint about the spiders was far easier to understand the trouble was there seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow harry looked everywhere he went helped rather reluctantly by ron they were hampered of course by the fact that they allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other gryffindors most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers but harry found it very irksome 
 
 one person however seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion draco malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed head boy harry realize what he was so pleased about until the potions lesson about two weeks after dumbledore and hagrid had left when sitting right behind malfoy harry overheard him gloating to crabbe and goyle 
 
 i always thought father might be the one who got rid of dumbledore he said not troubling to keep his voice down i told you he thinks the worst headmaster the ever had maybe get a decent headmaster now someone who want the chamber of secrets closed mcgonagall last long only filling in 
 
 snape swept past harry making no comment about empty seat and cauldron 
 
 sir said malfoy loudly sir why you apply for the job 
 
 now now malfoy said snape though he suppress a smile professor dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors i daresay be back with us soon enough 
 
 yeah right said malfoy smirking i expect have vote sir if you wanted to apply for the job tell father the best teacher here sir 
 
 snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon fortunately not spotting seamus finnigan who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron 
 
 quite surprised the mudbloods all packed their bags by now malfoy went on bet you five galleons the next one dies pity it granger 
 
 the bell rang at that moment which was lucky at last words ron had leapt off his stool and in the scramble to collect bags and books his attempts to reach malfoy went unnoticed 
 
 let me at him ron growled as harry and dean hung onto his arms i care i need my wand going to kill him with my bare hands 
 
 hurry up got to take you all to herbology barked snape over the heads and off they marched with harry ron and dean bringing up the rear ron still trying to get loose it was only safe to let go of him when snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses 
 
 the herbology class was very subdued there were now two missing from their number justin and hermione 
 
 professor sprout set them all to work pruning the abyssinian shrivelfigs harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself with ernie macmillan ernie took a deep breath and said very formally i just want to say harry that sorry i ever suspected you i know never attack hermione granger and i apologize for all the stuff i said all in the same boat now and well 
 
 he held out a pudgy hand and harry shook it 
 
 ernie and his friend hannah came to work at the same shrivelfig as harry and ron 
 
 that draco malfoy character said ernie breaking off dead twigs he seems very pleased about all this he know i think he might be heir 
 
 clever of you said ron who seem to have forgiven ernie as readily as harry 
 
 do you think malfoy harry ernie asked 
 
 no said harry so firmly that ernie and hannah stared 
 
 a second later harry spotted something 
 
 several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting harry hit ron over the hand with his pruning shears 
 
 ouch you 
 
 harry pointed out the spiders following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun 
 
 oh yeah said ron trying and failing to look pleased but we follow them now 
 
 ernie and hannah were listening curiously 
 
 eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders if they pursued their fixed course there could be no doubt about where they would end up 
 
 looks like heading for the forbidden forest 
 
 and ron looked even unhappier about that 
 
 at the end of the lesson professor sprout escorted the class to their defense against the dark arts lesson harry and ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot 
 
 have to use the invisibility cloak again harry told ron we can take fang with us used to going into the forest with hagrid he might be some help 
 
 right said ron who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers er there there supposed to be werewolves in the forest he added as they took their usual places at the back of classroom 
 
 preferring not to answer that question harry said there are good things in there too the centaurs are all right and the unicorns 
 
 ron had never been into the forbidden forest before harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again 
 
 lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual but lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant 
 
 come now he cried beaming around him why all these long faces 
 
 people swapped exasperated looks but nobody answered 
 
 you people realize said lockhart speaking slowly as though they were all a bit dim the danger has passed the culprit has been taken away 
 
 says who said dean thomas loudly 
 
 my dear young man the minister of magic have taken hagrid if he been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty said lockhart in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two 
 
 oh yes he would said ron even more loudly than dean 
 
 i flatter myself i know a touch more about arrest than you do mr weasley said lockhart in a tone 
 
 ron started to say that he think so somehow but stopped in midsentence when harry kicked him hard under the desk 
 
 we there remember harry muttered 
 
 but disgusting cheeriness his hints that he had always thought hagrid was no good his confidence that the whole business was now at an end irritated harry so much that he yearned to throw gadding with ghouls right in stupid face instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to ron do it tonight 
 
 ron read the message swallowed hard and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by hermione the sight seemed to stiffen his resolve and he nodded 
 
 the gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days because from six onward the gryffindors had nowhere else to go they also had plenty to talk about with the result that the common room often empty until past midnight 
 
 harry went to get the invisibility cloak out of his trunk right after dinner and spent the evening sitting on it waiting for the room to clear fred and george challenged harry and ron to a few games of exploding snap and ginny sat watching them very subdued in usual chair harry and ron kept losing on purpose trying to finish the games quickly but even so it was well past midnight when fred george and ginny finally went to bed 
 
 harry and ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak throwing it over themselves and climbing through the portrait hole 
 
 it was another difficult journey through the castle dodging all the teachers at last they reached the entrance hall slid back the lock on the oak front doors squeezed between them trying to stop any creaking and stepped out into the moonlit grounds 
 
 course said ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass we might get to the forest and find nothing to follow those spiders might been going there at all i know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction but 
 
 his voice trailed away hopefully 
 
 they reached house sad and with its blank windows when harry pushed the door open fang went mad with joy at the sight of them worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep booming barks they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece which glued his teeth together 
 
 harry left the invisibility cloak on table there would be no need for it in the forest 
 
 fang going for a walk said harry patting his leg and fang bounded happily out of the house behind them dashed to the edge of the forest and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree 
 
 harry took out his wand murmured lumos and a tiny light appeared at the end of it just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders 
 
 good thinking said ron light mine too but you know probably blow up or something 
 
 harry tapped ron on the shoulder pointing at the grass two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees 
 
 okay ron sighed as though resigned to the worst ready go 
 
 so with fang scampering around them sniffing tree roots and leaves they entered the forest by the glow of wand they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path they walked behind them for about twenty minutes not speaking listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves then when the trees had become thicker than ever so that the stars overhead were no longer visible and wand shone alone in the sea of dark they saw their spider guides leaving the path 
 
 harry paused trying to see where the spiders were going but everything outside his little sphere of light was he had never been this deep into the forest before he could vividly remember hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time been in here but hagrid was miles away now probably sitting in a cell in azkaban and he had also said to follow the spiders 
 
 something wet touched hand and he jumped backward crushing foot but it was only nose 
 
 what reckon harry said to ron whose eyes he could just make out reflecting the light from his wand 
 
 come this far said ron 
 
 so they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees they move very quickly now there were tree roots and stumps in their way barely visible in the near blackness harry could feel hot breath on his hand more than once they had to stop so that harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight 
 
 they walked for what seemed like at least half an hour their robes snagging on branches and brambles after a while they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward though the trees were as thick as ever 
 
 then fang suddenly let loose a great echoing bark making both harry and ron jump out of their skins 
 
 what said ron loudly looking around into the and gripping elbow very hard 
 
 something moving over there harry breathed listen sounds like something big 
 
 they listened some distance to their right the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees 
 
 oh no said ron oh no oh no oh 
 
 shut up said harry frantically hear you 
 
 hear me said ron in an unnaturally high voice already heard fang 
 
 the darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood terrified waiting there was a strange rumbling noise and then silence 
 
 what think doing said harry 
 
 probably getting ready to pounce said ron 
 
 they waited shivering hardly daring to move 
 
 think gone harry whispered 
 
 dunno 
 
 then to their right came a sudden blaze of light so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes fang yelped and tried to run but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder 
 
 harry ron shouted his voice breaking with relief harry our car 
 
 what 
 
 come on 
 
 harry blundered after ron toward the light stumbling and tripping and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing 
 
 mr car was standing empty in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches its headlights ablaze as ron walked toward it it moved slowly toward him exactly like a large turquoise dog greeting its owner 
 
 been here all the time said ron delightedly walking around the car look at it the turned it wild 
 
 the sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own fang seem at all keen on it he kept close to harry who could feel him quivering his breathing slowing down again harry stuffed his wand back into his robes 
 
 and we thought it was going to attack us said ron leaning against the car and patting it i wondered where it had gone 
 
 harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights 
 
 lost the trail he said go and find them 
 
 ron speak he move his eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor right behind harry his face was livid with terror 
 
 harry even have time to turn around there was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground so that he was hanging facedown struggling terrified he heard more clicking and saw legs leave the ground too heard fang whimpering and howling next moment he was being swept away into the dark trees 
 
 head hanging harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long hairy legs the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers behind him he could hear another of the creatures no doubt carrying ron they were moving into the very heart of the forest harry could hear fang fighting to free himself from a third monster whining loudly but harry have yelled even if he had wanted to he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing 
 
 he never knew how long he was in the clutches he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the ground was now swarming with spiders craning his neck sideways he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow a hollow that had been cleared of trees so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on 
 
 spiders not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below spiders the size of carthorses black hairy gigantic the massive specimen that was carrying harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty domed web in the very center of the hollow while its fellows closed in all around it clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load 
 
 harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him ron and fang thudded down next to him fang howling anymore but cowering silently on the spot ron looked exactly like harry felt his mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping 
 
 harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something it had been hard to tell because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke 
 
 aragog it called aragog 
 
 and from the middle of the misty domed web a spider the size of a small elephant emerged very slowly there was gray in the black of his body and legs and each of the eyes on his ugly pincered head was milky white he was blind 
 
 what is it he said clicking his pincers rapidly 
 
 men clicked the spider who had caught harry 
 
 is it hagrid said aragog moving closer his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely 
 
 strangers clicked the spider who had brought ron 
 
 kill them clicked aragog fretfully i was sleeping 
 
 friends of harry shouted his heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat 
 
 click click click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow 
 
 aragog paused 
 
 hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before he said slowly 
 
 in trouble said harry breathing very fast why come 
 
 in trouble said the aged spider and harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers but why has he sent you 
 
 harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it he think his legs would support him so he spoke from the ground as calmly as he could 
 
 they think up at the school that been setting a a something on students taken him to azkaban 
 
 aragog clicked his pincers furiously and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders it was like applause except applause usually make harry feel sick with fear 
 
 but that was years ago said aragog fretfully years and years ago i remember it well why they made him leave the school they believed that i was the monster that dwells in what they call the chamber of secrets they thought that hagrid had opened the chamber and set me free 
 
 and you you come from the chamber of secrets said harry who could feel cold sweat on his forehead 
 
 i said aragog clicking angrily i was not born in the castle i come from a distant land a traveler gave me to hagrid when i was an egg hagrid was only a boy but he cared for me hidden in a cupboard in the castle feeding me on scraps from the table hagrid is my good friend and a good man when i was discovered and blamed for the death of a girl he protected me i have lived here in the forest ever since where hagrid still visits me he even found me a wife mosag and you see how our family has grown all through goodness 
 
 harry summoned what remained of his courage 
 
 so you never never attacked anyone 
 
 never croaked the old spider it would have been my instinct but out of respect for hagrid i never harmed a human the body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom i never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which i grew up our kind like the dark and the quiet 
 
 but then do you know what did kill that girl said harry because whatever it is back and attacking people again 
 
 his words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily large black shapes shifted all around him 
 
 the thing that lives in the castle said aragog is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others well do i remember how i pleaded with hagrid to let me go when i sensed the beast moving about the school 
 
 what is it said harry urgently 
 
 more loud clicking more rustling the spiders seemed to be closing in 
 
 we do not speak of it said aragog fiercely we do not name it i never even told hagrid the name of that dread creature though he asked me many times 
 
 harry want to press the subject not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides aragog seemed to be tired of talking he was backing slowly into his domed web but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward harry and ron 
 
 just go then harry called desperately to aragog hearing leaves rustling behind him 
 
 go said aragog slowly i think not 
 
 but but 
 
 my sons and daughters do not harm hagrid on my command but i cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst friend of hagrid 
 
 harry spun around feet away towering above him was a solid wall of spiders clicking their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads 
 
 even as he reached for his wand harry knew it was no good there were too many of them but as he tried to stand ready to die fighting a loud long note sounded and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow 
 
 mr car was thundering down the slope headlights glaring its horn screeching knocking spiders aside several were thrown onto their backs their endless legs waving in the air the car screeched to a halt in front of harry and ron and the doors flew open 
 
 get fang harry yelled diving into the front seat ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him yelping into the back of the car the doors slammed shut ron touch the accelerator but the car need him the engine roared and they were off hitting more spiders they sped up the slope out of the hollow and they were soon crashing through the forest branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps following a path it obviously knew 
 
 harry looked sideways at ron his mouth was still open in the silent scream but his eyes popping anymore 
 
 are you okay 
 
 ron stared straight ahead unable to speak 
 
 they smashed their way through the undergrowth fang howling loudly in the back seat and harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak after ten noisy rocky minutes the trees thinned and harry could again see patches of sky 
 
 the car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield they had reached the edge of the forest fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out and when harry opened the door he shot off through the trees to house tail between his legs harry got out too and after a minute or so ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed still and staring harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view 
 
 harry went back into cabin to get the invisibility cloak fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket when harry got outside again he found ron being violent sick in the pumpkin patch 
 
 follow the spiders said ron weakly wiping his mouth on his sleeve never forgive hagrid lucky to be alive 
 
 i bet he thought aragog hurt friends of his said harry 
 
 exactly problem said ron thumping the wall of the cabin he always thinks monsters as bad as made out and look where got him a cell in azkaban he was shivering uncontrollably now what was the point of sending us in there what have we found out like to know 
 
 that hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets said harry throwing the cloak over ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk he was innocent 
 
 ron gave a loud snort evidently hatching aragog in a cupboard his idea of being innocent 
 
 as the castle loomed nearer harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden then pushed the creaking front doors ajar they walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking at last they reached the safety of the gryffindor common room where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash they took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory 
 
 ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed harry however feel very sleepy he sat on the edge of his fourposter thinking hard about everything aragog had said 
 
 the creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle he thought sounded like a sort of monster voldemort even other monsters want to name it but he and ron were no closer to finding out what it was or how it petrified its victims even hagrid had never known what was in the chamber of secrets 
 
 harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window 
 
 he see what else they could do they had hit dead ends everywhere riddle had caught the wrong person the heir of slytherin had got off and no one could tell whether it was the same person or a different one who had opened the chamber this time there was nobody else to ask harry lay down still thinking about what aragog had said 
 
 he was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him and he suddenly sat bolt upright 
 
 ron he hissed through the dark ron 
 
 ron woke with a yelp like stared wildly around and saw harry 
 
 ron that girl who died aragog said she was found in a bathroom said harry ignoring snuffling snores from the corner what if she never left the bathroom what if still there 
 
 ron rubbed his eyes frowning through the moonlight and then he understood too 
 
 you think not moaning myrtle 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter sixteen professor predictioncontents prev chapter next chapter 
 euphoria at finally winning the quidditch cup lasted at least a week even the weather seemed to be celebrating as june approached the days became cloudless and sultry and all anybody felt like doing was strolling onto the grounds and flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin juice perhaps playing a casual game of gobstones or watching the giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake 
 
 but they exams were nearly upon them and instead of lazing around outside the students were forced to remain inside the castle trying to bully their brains into concentrating while enticing wafts of summer air drifted in through the windows even fred and george weasley had been spotted working they were about to take their ordinary wizarding levels percy was getting ready to take his nastily exhausting wizarding tests the highest qualification hogwarts offered as percy hoped to enter the ministry of magic he needed top grades he was becoming increasingly edgy and gave very severe punishments to anybody who disturbed the quiet of the common room in the evenings in fact the only person who seemed more anxious than percy was hermione 
 
 harry and ron had given up asking her how she was managing to attend several classes at once but they restrain themselves when they saw the exam schedule she had drawn up for herself the first column read 
 
 monday 
 
 arithmancy 
 
 transfiguration 
 
 lunch 
 
 charms 
 
 ancient runes 
 
 hermione ron said cautiously because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days er are you sure copied down these times right 
 
 what snapped hermione picking up the exam schedule and examining it yes of course i have 
 
 is there any point asking how going to sit for two exams at once said harry 
 
 no said hermione shortly have either of you seen my copy of numerology and gramatica 
 
 oh yeah i borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading said ron but very quietly hermione started shifting heaps of parchment harry ron and hermione had plenty of opportunity to speak to hagrid 
 
 gettin a bit depressed hagrid told them bending low on the pretense of checking that flobberworm was still alive bin cooped up too long but know day after tomorrow one way or the other 
 
 they had potions that afternoon which was an unqualified disaster try as harry might he get his confusing concoction to thicken and snape standing watch with an air of vindictive pleasure scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero onto his notes before moving away 
 
 then came astronomy at midnight up on the tallest tower history of magic on wednesday morning in which harry scribbled everything florean fortescue had ever told him about medieval while wishing he could have had one of sundaes with him in the stifling classroom wednesday afternoon meant herbology in the greenhouses under a sun then back to the common room once more with sunburnt necks thinking longingly of this time next day when it would all be over 
 
 their second to last exam on thursday morning was defense against the dark arts professor lupin had compiled the most unusual exam any of them had ever taken a sort of obstacle course outside in the sun where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow cross a series of potholes full of red caps squish their way across a patch of marsh while ignoring misleading directions from a hinkypunk then climb into an old trunk and battle with a new boggart 
 
 excellent harry lupin muttered as harry climbed out of the trunk grinning full marks 
 
 flushed with his success harry hung around to watch ron and hermione ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk which successfully confused him into sinking into the quagmire hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the trunk with the boggart in it after about a minute inside it she burst out again screaming 
 
 hermione said lupin startled the matter 
 
 mcgonagall hermione gasped pointing into the trunk said failed everything 
 
 it took a little while to calm hermione down when at last she had regained a grip on herself she harry and ron went back to the castle ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at boggart but an argument was averted by the sight that met them on the top of the steps 
 
 cornelius fudge sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak was standing there staring out at the grounds he started at the sight of harry 
 
 hello there harry he said just had an exam i expect nearly finished 
 
 yes said harry hermione and ron not being on speaking terms with the minister of magic hovered awkwardly in the background 
 
 lovely day said fudge casting an eye over the lake 
 
 pitypity 
 
 he sighed deeply and looked down at harry 
 
 here on an unpleasant mission harry the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff as i needed to visit hogwarts to check on the black situation i was asked to step in 
 
 does that mean the already happened ron interrupted stepping forward 
 
 no no scheduled for this afternoon said fudge looking curiously at ron 
 
 then you might not have to witness an execution at all said ron stoutly the hippogriff might get off 
 
 before fudge could answer two wizards came through the castle doors behind him one was so ancient he appeared to be withering before their very eyes the other was tall and strapping with a thin back mustache harry gathered that they were representatives of the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures because the very old wizard squinted toward cabin and said in a feeble voice dear dear getting too old for it fudge 
 
 the man was fingering something in his belt harry looked and saw that he was running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe ron opened his mouth to say something but hermione nudged him hard in the ribs and jerked her head toward the entrance hall 
 
 you stop me said ron angrily as they entered the great hall for lunch did you see them even got the axe ready this justice 
 
 ron your dad works for the ministry you go saying things like that to his boss said hermione but she too looked very upset as long as hagrid keeps his head this time and argues his case properly they possibly execute buckbeak 
 
 but harry could tell hermione really believe what she was saying all around them people were talking excitedly as they ate their lunch happily anticipating the end of the exams that afternoon but harry ron and hermione lost in worry about hagrid and buckbeak join in 
 
 and last exam was divination muggle studies they walked up the marble staircase together hermione left them on the first floor and harry and ron proceeded all the way up to the seventh where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to professor classroom trying to cram in a bit of studying 
 
 seeing us all separately neville informed them as they went to sit down next to him he had his copy of unfogging the future open on his lap at the pages devoted to crystal gazing have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball he asked them unhappily 
 
 nope said ron in an offhand voice he kept checking his watch harry knew that he was counting down the time until appeal started 
 
 the line of people outside the classroom shortened very slowly as each person climbed back down the silver ladder the rest of the class hissed what did she ask was it okay 
 
 but they all refused to say 
 
 she says the crystal told her that if i tell you have a horrible accident squeaked neville as he clambered back down the ladder toward harry and ron who had now reached the landing 
 
 convenient snorted ron you know starting to think hermione was right about her he jabbed his thumb toward the trapdoor overhead a right old fraud 
 
 yeah said harry looking at his own watch it was now two wish hurry up 
 
 parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride 
 
 she says got all the makings of a true seer she informed harry and ron i saw loads of stuffwell good luck 
 
 she hurried off down the spiral staircase toward lavender 
 
 ronald weasley said the familiar misty voice from over their heads ron grimaced at harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight harry was now the only person left to be tested he settled himself on the floor with his back against the wall listening to a fly buzzing in the sunny window his mind across the grounds with hagrid 
 
 finally after about twenty minutes large feet reappeared on the ladder 
 
 it go harry asked him standing up 
 
 rubbish said ron see a thing so i made some stuff up think she was convinced though 
 
 meet you in the common room harry muttered as professor voice called harry potter 
 
 the tower room was hotter than ever before the curtains were closed the fire was alight and the usual sickly scent made harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and table to where professor trelawney sat waiting for him before a large crystal ball 
 
 good day my dear she said softly if you would kindly gaze into the orbtake your time nowthen tell me what you see within it 
 
 harry bent over the crystal ball and stared stared as hard as he could willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog but nothing happened 
 
 well professor trelawney prompted delicately what do you see 
 
 the heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them he thought of what ron had just said and decided to pretend 
 
 er said harry a dark shapeum 
 
 what does it resemble whispered professor trelawney think now 
 
 harry cast his mind around and it landed on buckbeak 
 
 a hippogriff he said firmly 
 
 indeed whispered professor trelawney scribbling keenly on the parchment perched upon her knees my boy you may well be seeing the outcome of poor trouble with the ministry of magic look closerdoes the hippogriff appear tohave its head 
 
 yes said harry firmly 
 
 are you sure professor trelawney urged him are you quite sure dear you see it writhing on the ground perhaps and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it 
 
 no said harry starting to feel slightly sick 
 
 no blood no weeping hagrid 
 
 no said harry again wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat it looks fine flying away 
 
 professor trelawney sighed 
 
 well dear i think leave it therea little disappointingbut sure you did your best 
 
 relieved harry got up picked up his bag and turned to go but then a loud harsh voice spoke behind him 
 
 it will happen tonight 
 
 harry wheeled around professor trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging 
 
 s sorry said harry 
 
 but professor trelawney seem to hear him her eyes started to roll harry sat there in a panic she looked as though she was about to have some sort of seizure he hesitated thinking of running to the hospital wing and then professor trelawney spoke again in the same harsh voice quite unlike her own 
 
 the dark lord lies alone and friendless abandoned by his followers his servant has been chained these twelve years tonight before midnightthe servant will break free and set out to rejoin his master the dark lord will rise again with his aid greater and more terrible than ever he was tonightbefore midnightthe servantwill set outto rejoinhis master 
 
 professor head fell forward onto her chest she made a grunting sort of noise harry sat there staring at her then quite suddenly professor head snapped up again 
 
 so sorry dear boy she said dreamily the heat of the day you knowi drifted off for a moment 
 
 harry sat there staring at her 
 
 is there anything wrong my dear 
 
 you you just told me that the the dark going to rise againthat his going to go back to him 
 
 professor trelawney looked thoroughly startled 
 
 the dark lord my dear boy hardly something to joke aboutrise again indeed 
 
 but you just said it you said the dark lord 
 
 i think you must have dozed off too dear said professor trelawney i would certainly not presume to predict anything quite as as that 
 
 harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase wonderinghad he just heard professor trelawney make a real prediction or had that been her idea of an impressive end to the test 
 
 five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside the entrance to gryffindor tower professor words still resounding in his head people were striding past him in the opposite direction laughing and joking heading for the grounds and a bit of freedom by the time he had reached the portrait hole and entered the common room it was almost deserted over in the corner however sat ron and hermione 
 
 professor trelawney harry panted just told me 
 
 but he stopped abruptly at the sight of their faces 
 
 buckbeak lost said ron weakly just sent this 
 
 note was dry this time no tears had splattered it yet his hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly legible 
 
 lost appeal going to execute at sunset nothing you can do come down i want you to see it 
 hagrid 
 got to go said harry at once he just sit there on his own waiting for the executioner 
 
 sunset though said ron who was staring out the window ill a glazed sort of way never be allowed specially you harry 
 
 harry sank his head into his hands thinking 
 
 if we only had the invisibility cloak 
 
 where is it said hermione 
 
 harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the witch 
 
 if snape sees me anywhere near there again in serious trouble he finished 
 
 true said hermione getting to her feet if he sees youhow do you open the hump again 
 
 you you tap it and say dissendium said harry but 
 
 hermione wait for the rest of his sentence she strode across the room pushed open the fat portrait and vanished from sight 
 
 she gone to get it ron said staring after her 
 
 she had hermione returned a quarter of an hour later with the silvery cloak folded carefully under her robes 
 
 hermione i know gotten into you lately said ron astounded first you hit malfoy then you walk out on professor trelawney 
 
 hermione looked rather flattered 
 
 they went down to dinner with everybody else but did not return to gryffindor tower afterward harry had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes he had to keep his arms folded to hide the lump they skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall listening until they were sure it was deserted they heard a last pair of people hurrying across the hall and a door slamming hermione poked her head around the door 
 
 okay she whispered no one there cloak on 
 
 walking very close together so that nobody would see them they crossed the hall on tiptoe beneath the cloak then walked down the stone front steps into the grounds the sun was already sinking behind the forbidden forest gilding the top branches of the trees 
 
 they reached cabin and knocked he was a minute in answering and when he did he looked all around for his visitor and trembling 
 
 us harry hissed wearing the invisibility cloak let us in and we can take it off 
 
 yeh come hagrid whispered but he stood back and they stepped inside hagrid shut the door quickly and harry pulled off the cloak 
 
 hagrid was not crying nor did he throw himself upon their necks he looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do this helplessness was worse to watch than tears 
 
 wan some tea he said his great hands were shaking as he reached for the kettle 
 
 buckbeak hagrid said hermione hesitantly 
 
 i i took him outside said hagrid spilling milk all over the table as he filled up the jug tethered in me pumpkin patch thought he oughta see the trees an an smell fresh air before 
 
 hand trembled so violently that the milk jug slipped from his grasp and shattered all over the floor 
 
 do it hagrid said hermione quickly hurrying over and starting to clean up the mess 
 
 another one in the cupboard hagrid said sitting down and wiping his forehead on his sleeve harry glanced at ron who looked back hopelessly 
 
 there anything anyone can do hagrid harry asked fiercely sitting down next to him dumbledore 
 
 tried said hagrid got no power ter overrule the committee he told em all right but scaredyeh know what lucius likethreatened em i expectan the executioner macnair an old pal o be quick an cleanan be beside him 
 
 hagrid swallowed his eyes were darting all over the cabin as though looking for some shred of hope or comfort 
 
 gonna come down while it while it happens wrote me this mornin said he wants ter ter be with me great man dumbledore 
 
 hermione who had been rummaging in cupboard for another milk jug let out a small quickly stifled sob she straightened up with the new jug in her hands fighting back tears 
 
 stay with you too hagrid she began but hagrid shook his shaggy head 
 
 ter go back up ter the castle i told yeh i don wan yeh watchin an yeh shouldn be down here anywayif fudge an dumbledore catch yeh out without permission harry be in big trouble 
 
 silent tears were now streaming down face but she hid them from hagrid bustling around making tea then as she picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug she let out a shriek 
 
 ron i believe it scabbers 
 
 ron gaped at her 
 
 what are you talking about 
 
 hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it upside down with a frantic squeak and much scrambling to get back inside scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table 
 
 scabbers said ron blankly scabbers what are you doing here 
 
 he grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light scabbers looked dreadful he was thinner than ever large tufts of hair had fallen out leaving wide bald patches and he writhed in hands as though desperate to free himself 
 
 okay scabbers said ron no cats nothing here to hurt you 
 
 hagrid suddenly stood up his eyes fixed on the window his normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment 
 
 comin 
 
 harry ron and hermione whipped around a group of men was walking down the distant castle steps in front was albus dumbledore his silver beard gleaming in the dying sun next to him trotted cornelius fudge behind them came the feeble old committee member and the executioner macnair 
 
 yeh gotta go said hagrid every inch of him was trembling they mustn find yeh herego now 
 
 ron stuffed scabbers into his pocket and hermione picked up the cloak let yeh out the back way said hagrid 
 
 they followed him to the door into his back garden harry felt strangely unreal and even more so when he saw buckbeak a few yards away tethered to a tree behind pumpkin patch buckbeak seemed to know something was happening he turned his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously 
 
 okay beaky said hagrid softly okay he turned to harry ron and hermione go on he said get goin 
 
 but they move 
 
 hagrid we 
 
 tell them what really happened 
 
 they kill him 
 
 go said hagrid fiercely bad enough without you lot in trouble an all 
 
 they had no choice as hermione threw the cloak over harry and ron they heard voices at the front of the cabin hagrid looked at the place where they had just vanished from sight 
 
 go quick he said hoarsely don listen 
 
 and he strode back into his cabin as someone knocked at the front door 
 
 slowly in a kind of horrified trance harry ron and hermione set off silently around house as they reached the other side the front door closed with a sharp snap 
 
 please hurry hermione whispered i stand it i bear it 
 
 they started up the sloping lawn toward the castle the sun was sinking fast now the sky had turned to a clear gray but to the west there was a glow 
 
 ron stopped dead 
 
 oh please ron hermione began 
 
 scabbers he stay put 
 
 ron was bent over trying to keep scabbers in his pocket but the rat was going berserk squeaking madly twisting and flailing trying to sink his teeth into hand 
 
 scabbers me you idiot ron ron hissed 
 
 they heard a door open behind them and voices 
 
 oh ron please move going to do it hermione breathed 
 
 okay scabbers stay put 
 
 they walked forward harry like hermione was trying not to listen to the rumble of voices behind them ron stopped again 
 
 i hold him scabbers shut up hear us 
 
 the rat was squealing wildly but not loudly enough to cover up the sounds drifting from garden there was a jumble of indistinct male voices a silence and then without warning the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe 
 
 hermione swayed on the spot 
 
 they did it she whispered to harry believe it they did it 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the prisoner of azkaban 
 

lionfish nov chapter sixteen the goblet of firecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 i believe it ron said in a stunned voice as the hogwarts students filed back up the steps behind the party from durmstrang krum harry viktor krum 
 
 for sake ron only a quidditch player said hermione 
 
 only a quidditch player ron said looking at her as though he believe his ears hermione one of the best seekers in the world i had no idea he was still at school 
 
 as they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the hogwarts students heading for the great hall harry saw lee jordan jumping up and down on the soles of his feet to get a better look at the back of head several girls were frantically searching their pockets as they walked 
 
 oh i believe it i got a single quill on me 
 
 think sign my hat in lipstick 
 
 really hermione said loftily as they passed the girls now squabbling over the lipstick 
 
 getting his autograph if i can said ron you got a quill have you harry 
 
 nope upstairs in my bag said harry 
 
 they walked over to the gryffindor table and sat down ron took care to sit on the side facing the doorway because krum and his fellow durmstrang students were still gathered around it apparently unsure about where they should sit the students from beauxbatons had chosen seats at the ravenclaw table they were looking around the great hall with glum expressions on their faces three of them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads 
 
 not that cold said hermione defensively why they bring cloaks 
 
 over here come and sit over here ron hissed over here hermione budge up make a space 
 
 what 
 
 too late said ron bitterly 
 
 viktor krum and his fellow durmstrang students had settled themselves at the slytherin table harry could see malfoy crabbe and goyle looking very smug about this as he watched malfoy bent forward to speak to krum 
 
 yeah right smarm up to him malfoy said ron scathingly i bet krum can see right through him thoughbet he gets people fawning over him all the reckon going to sleep we could offer him a space in our dormitory harryi mind giving him my bed i could kip on a camp bed 
 
 hermione snorted 
 
 they look a lot happier than the beauxbatons lot said harry the durmstrang students were pulling off their heavy furs and looking up at the starry black ceiling with expressions of interest a couple of them were picking up the golden plates and goblets and examining them apparently impressed 
 
 up at the staff table filch the caretaker was adding chairs he was wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion harry was surprised to see that he added four chairs two on either side of 
 
 but there are only two extra people harry said filch putting out four chairs who else is coming 
 
 eh said ron vaguely he was still staring avidly at krum 
 
 when all the students had entered the hall and settled down at their house tables the staff entered filing up to the top table and taking their seats last in line were professor dumbledore professor karkaroff and madame maxime when their headmistress appeared the pupils from beauxbatons leapt to their feet a few of the hogwarts students laughed the beauxbatons party appeared quite unembarrassed however and did not resume their seats until madame maxime had sat down on side dumbledore remained standing and a silence fell over the great hall 
 
 good evening ladies and gentlemen ghosts and most particularly guests said dumbledore beaming around at the foreign students i have great pleasure in welcoming you all to hogwarts i hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable 
 
 one of the beauxbatons girls still clutching a muffler around her head gave what was unmistakably a derisive laugh 
 
 no making you stay hermione whispered bristling at her 
 
 the tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast said dumbledore i now invite you all to eat drink and make yourselves at home 
 
 he sat down and harry saw karkaroff lean forward at once and engage him in conversation 
 
 the plates in front of them filled with food as usual the in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops there was a greater variety of dishes in front of them than harry had ever seen including several that were definitely foreign 
 
 that said ron pointing at a large dish of some sort of shellfish stew that stood beside a large pudding 
 
 bouillabaisse said hermione 
 
 bless you said ron 
 
 french said hermione i had it on holiday summer before last very nice 
 
 take your word for it said ron helping himself to black pudding 
 
 the great hall seemed somehow much more crowded than usual even though there were barely twenty additional students there perhaps it was because their differently colored uniforms stood out so clearly against the black of the hogwarts robes now that they had removed their furs the durmstrang students were revealed to be wearing robes of a deep bloodred 
 
 hagrid sidled into the hall through a door behind the staff table twenty minutes after the start of the feast he slid into his seat at the end and waved at harry ron and hermione with a very heavily bandaged hand 
 
 skrewts doing all right hagrid harry called 
 
 thrivin hagrid called back happily 
 
 yeah just bet they are said ron quietly looks like finally found a food they like it fingers 
 
 at that moment a voice said excuse me are you wanting ze bouillabaisse 
 
 it was the girl from beauxbatons who had laughed during speech she had finally removed her muffler a long sheet of hair fell almost to her waist she had large deep blue eyes and very white even teeth 
 
 ron went purple he stared up at her opened his mouth to reply but nothing came out except a faint gurgling noise 
 
 yeah have it said harry pushing the dish toward the girl 
 
 you ave finished wiz it 
 
 yeah ron said breathlessly yeah it was excellent 
 
 the girl picked up the dish and carried it carefully off to the ravenclaw table ron was still goggling at the girl as though he had never seen one before harry started to laugh the sound seemed to jog ron back to his senses 
 
 a veela he said hoarsely to harry 
 
 of course she said hermione tartly i see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot 
 
 but she entirely right about that as the girl crossed the hall many boys heads turned and some of them seemed to have become temporarily speechless just like ron 
 
 telling you not a normal girl said ron leaning sideways so he could keep a clear view of her they make them like that at hogwarts 
 
 they make them okay at hogwarts said harry without thinking cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the girl with the silvery hair 
 
 when both put your eyes back in said hermione briskly be able to see just arrived 
 
 she was pointing up at the staff table the two remaining empty seats had just been filled ludo bagman was now sitting on professor other side while mr crouch boss was next to madame maxime 
 
 what are they doing here said harry in surprise 
 
 they organized the triwizard tournament they said hermione i suppose they wanted to be here to see it start 
 
 when the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfamiliar desserts too ron examined an odd sort of pale blancmange closely then moved it carefully a few inches to his right so that it would be clearly visible from the ravenclaw table the girl who looked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough however and did not come over to get it 
 
 once the golden plates had been wiped clean dumbledore stood up again a pleasant sort of tension seemed to fill the hall now harry felt a slight thrill of excitement wondering what was coming several seats down from them fred and george were leaning forward staring at dumbledore with great concentration 
 
 the moment has come said dumbledore smiling around at the sea of upturned faces the triwizard tournament is about to start i would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket 
 
 the what harry muttered 
 
 ron shrugged 
 
 just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year but first let me introduce for those who do not know them mr bartemius crouch head of the department of international magical cooperation there was a smattering of polite applause and mr ludo bagman head of the department of magical games and sports 
 
 there was a much louder round of applause for bagman than for crouch perhaps because of his fame as a beater or simply because he looked so much more likable he acknowledged it with a jovial wave of his hand bartemius crouch did not smile or wave when his name was announced remembering him in his neat suit at the quidditch world cup harry thought he looked strange in robes his toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked very odd next to long white hair and beard 
 
 mr bagman and mr crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the triwizard tournament dumbledore continued and they will be joining myself professor karkaroff and madame maxime on the panel that will judge the champions efforts 
 
 at the mention of the word champions the attentiveness of the listening students seemed to sharpen perhaps dumbledore had noticed their sudden stillness for he smiled as he said the casket then if you please mr filch 
 
 filch who had been lurking unnoticed in a far corner of the hall now approached dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest encrusted with jewels it looked extremely old a murmur of excited interest rose from the watching students dennis creevey actually stood on his chair to see it properly but being so tiny his head hardly rose above anyone 
 
 the instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by mr crouch and mr bagman said dumbledore as filch placed the chest carefully on the table before him and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge there will be three tasks spaced throughout the school year and they will test the champions in many different ways their magical prowess their daring their powers of deduction and of course their ability to cope with danger 
 
 at this last word the hall was filled with a silence so absolute that nobody seemed to be breathing 
 
 as you know three champions compete in the tournament dumbledore went on calmly one from each of the participating schools they will be marked on how well they perform each of the tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the triwizard cup the champions will be chosen by an impartial selector the goblet of fire 
 
 dumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times upon the top of the casket the lid creaked slowly open dumbledore reached inside it and pulled out a large roughly hewn wooden cup it would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full to the brim with dancing flames 
 
 dumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on top of it where it would be clearly visible to everyone in the hall 
 
 anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet said dumbledore aspiring champions have hours in which to put their names forward tomorrow night halloween the goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools the goblet will be placed in the entrance hall tonight where it will be freely accessible to all those wishing to compete 
 
 to ensure that no underage student yields to temptation said dumbledore i will be drawing an age line around the goblet of fire once it has been placed in the entrance hall nobody under the age of seventeen will be able to cross this line 
 
 finally i wish to impress upon any of you wishing to compete that this tournament is not to be entered into lightly once a champion has been selected by the goblet of fire he or she is obliged to see the tournament through to the end the placing of your name in the goblet constitutes a binding magical contract there can be no change of heart once you have become a champion please be very sure therefore that you are wholeheartedly prepared to play before you drop your name into the goblet now i think it is time for bed good night to you all 
 
 an age line fred weasley said his eyes glinting as they all made their way across the hall to the doors into the entrance hall well that should be fooled by an aging potion it and once your in that goblet laughing it tell whether seventeen or not 
 
 but i think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance said hermione we just learned enough 
 
 speak for yourself said george shortly try and get in you harry 
 
 harry thought briefly of insistence that nobody under seventeen should submit their name but then the wonderful picture of himself winning the triwizard tournament filled his mind wondered how angry dumbledore would be if someone younger than seventeen did find a way to get over the age line 
 
 where is he said ron who listening to a word of this conversation but looking through the crowd to see what had become of krum dumbledore say where the durmstrang people are sleeping did he 
 
 but this query was answered almost instantly they were level with the slytherin table now and karkaroff had just bustled up to his students 
 
 back to the ship then he was saying viktor how are you feeling did you eat enough should i send for some mulled wine from the kitchens 
 
 harry saw krum shake his head as he pulled his furs back on professor ivood like some vine said one of the other durmstrang boys hopefully 
 
 i offering it to you poliakoff snapped karkaroff his warmly paternal air vanishing in an instant i notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again disgusting boy 
 
 karkaroff turned and led his students toward the doors reaching them at exactly the same moment as harry ron and hermione harry stopped to let him walk through first 
 
 thank you said karkaroff carelessly glancing at him 
 
 and then karkaroff froze he turned his head back to harry and stared at him as though he believe his eyes behind their headmaster the students from durmstrang came to a halt too eyes moved slowly up face and fixed upon his scar the durmstrang students were staring curiously at harry too out of the corner of his eye harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces the boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at forehead 
 
 yeah harry potter said a growling voice from behind them 
 
 professor karkaroff spun around moody was standing there leaning heavily on his staff his magical eye glaring unblinkingly at the durmstrang headmaster 
 
 the color drained from face as harry watched a terrible look of mingled fury and fear came over him 
 
 you he said staring at moody as though unsure he was really seeing him 
 
 me said moody grimly and unless got anything to say to potter karkaroff you might want to move blocking the doorway 
 
 it was true half the students in the hall were now waiting behind them looking over one shoulders to see what was causing the holdup 
 
 without another word professor karkaroff swept his students away with him moody watched him until he was out of sight his magical eye fixed upon his back a look of intense dislike upon his mutilated face 
 
 
 
 as the next day was saturday most students would normally have breakfasted late harry ron and hermione however were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends when they went down into the entrance hall they saw about twenty people milling around it some of them eating toast all examining the goblet of fire it had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the sorting hat a thin golden line had been traced on the floor forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction 
 
 anyone put their name in yet ron asked a girl eagerly 
 
 all the durmstrang lot she replied but i seen anyone from hogwarts yet 
 
 bet some of them put it in last night after all gone to bed said harry i if it had been have wanted everyone watching what if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again 
 
 someone laughed behind harry turning he saw fred george and lee jordan hurrying down the staircase all three of them looking extremely excited 
 
 done it fred said in a triumphant whisper to harry ron and hermione just taken it 
 
 what said ron 
 
 the aging potion dung brains said fred 
 
 one drop each said george rubbing his hands together with glee we only need to be a few months older 
 
 going to split the thousand galleons between the three of us if one of us wins said lee grinning broadly 
 
 not sure this is going to work you know said hermione warningly sure dumbledore will have thought of this 
 
 fred george and lee ignored her 
 
 ready fred said to the other two quivering with excitement then go first 
 
 harry watched fascinated as fred pulled a slip of parchment out of his pocket bearing the words fred weasley hogwarts fred walked right up to the edge of the line and stood there rocking on his toes like a diver preparing for a drop then with the eyes of every person in the entrance hall upon him he took a great breath and stepped over the line 
 
 for a split second harry thought it had worked george certainly thought so for he let out a yell of triumph and leapt after fred but next moment there was a loud sizzling sound and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible they landed painfully ten feet away on the cold stone floor and to add insult to injury there was a loud popping noise and both of them sprouted identical long white beards 
 
 the entrance hall rang with laughter even fred and george joined in once they had gotten to their feet and taken a good look at each beards 
 
 i did warn you said a deep amused voice and everyone turned to see professor dumbledore coming out of the great hall he surveyed fred and george his eyes twinkling i suggest you both go up to madam pomfrey she is already tending to miss fawcett of ravenclaw and mr summers of hufflepuff both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too though i must say neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours 
 
 fred and george set off for the hospital wing accompanied by lee who was howling with laughter and harry ron and hermione also chortling went in to breakfast 
 
 the decorations in the great hall had changed this morning as it was halloween a cloud of live bats was fluttering around the enchanted ceiling while hundreds of carved pumpkins leered from every corner harry led the way over to dean and seamus who were discussing those hogwarts students of seventeen or over who might be entering 
 
 a rumor going around that warrington got up early and put his name in dean told harry that big bloke from slytherin who looks like a sloth 
 
 harry who had played quidditch against warrington shook his head in disgust 
 
 we have a slytherin champion 
 
 and all the hufflepuffs are talking about diggory said seamus contemptuously but i have thought have wanted to risk his good looks 
 
 listen said hermione suddenly 
 
 people were cheering out in the entrance hall they all swiveled around in their seats and saw angelina johnson coming into the hall grinning in an embarrassed sort of way a tall black girl who played chaser on the gryffindor quidditch team angelina came over to them sat down and said well done it just put my name in 
 
 kidding said ron looking impressed 
 
 are you seventeen then asked harry 
 
 course she is see a beard can you said ron 
 
 i had my birthday last week said angelina 
 
 well glad someone from entering said hermione i really hope you get it angelina 
 
 thanks hermione said angelina smiling at her 
 
 yeah better you than diggory said seamus causing several hufflepuffs passing their table to scowl heavily at him 
 
 we going to do today then ron asked harry and hermione when they had finished breakfast and were leaving the great hall 
 
 we been down to visit hagrid yet said harry 
 
 okay said ron just as long as he ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts 
 
 a look of great excitement suddenly dawned on face 
 
 just realized i asked hagrid to join yet she said brightly wait for me will you while i nip upstairs and get the badges 
 
 what is it with her said ron exasperated as hermione ran away up the marble staircase 
 
 hey ron said harry suddenly your friend 
 
 the students from beauxbatons were coming through the front doors from the grounds among them the those gathered around the goblet of fire stood back to let them pass watching eagerly 
 
 madame maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line one by one the beauxbatons students stepped across the age line and dropped their slips of parchment into the flames as each name entered the fire it turned briefly red and emitted sparks 
 
 what happen to the ones who chosen ron muttered to harry as the dropped her parchment into the goblet of fire reckon go back to school or hang around to watch the tournament 
 
 dunno said harry hang around i staying to judge she 
 
 when all the beauxbatons students had submitted their names madame maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again 
 
 where are they sleeping then said ron moving toward the front doors and staring after them 
 
 a loud rattling noise behind them announced reappearance with the box of s p badges 
 
 oh good hurry up said ron and he jumped down the stone steps keeping his eyes on the back of the who was now halfway across the lawn with madame maxime 
 
 as they neared cabin on the edge of the forbidden forest the mystery of the beauxbatons sleeping quarters was solved the gigantic carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from front door and the students were climbing back inside it the elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it 
 
 harry knocked on door and booming barks answered instantly 
 
 bout time said hagrid when flung open the door thought you forgotten where i live 
 
 been really busy hag hermione started to say but then she stopped dead looking up at hagrid apparently lost for words 
 
 hagrid was wearing his best and very horrible hairy brown suit plus a checked tie this the worst of it though he had evidently tried to tame his hair using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease it was now slicked down into two bunches perhaps he had tried a ponytail like but found he had too much hair the look really suit hagrid at all for a moment hermione goggled at him then obviously deciding not to comment she said erm where are the skrewts 
 
 out by the pumpkin patch said hagrid happily gettin massive mus be nearly three foot long now trouble is started killin each other 
 
 oh no really said hermione shooting a repressive look at ron who staring at odd hairstyle had just opened his mouth to say something about it 
 
 yeah said hagrid sadly s okay though got em in separate boxes now still got abou twenty 
 
 well lucky said ron hagrid missed the sarcasm 
 
 cabin comprised a single room in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt a similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling they sat down at the table while hagrid started to make tea and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the triwizard tournament hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were 
 
 you wait he said grinning you jus wait yer going ter see some stuff never seen before firs taskah but not supposed ter say 
 
 go on hagrid harry ron and hermione urged him but he just shook his head grinning 
 
 i don want ter spoil it fer yeh said hagrid but gonna be spectacular tell yeh that them going ter have their work cut out never thought live ter see the triwizard tournament played again 
 
 they ended up having lunch with hagrid though they eat much hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole but after hermione unearthed a large talon in hers she harry and ron rather lost their appetites however they enjoyed themselves trying to make hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions and wondering whether fred and george were beardless yet 
 
 a light rain had started to fall by midafternoon it was very cozy sitting by the fire listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window watching hagrid darning his socks and arguing with hermione about for he flatly refused to join when she showed him her badges 
 
 be doin em an unkindness hermione he said gravely threading a massive bone needle with thick yellow yarn in their nature ter look after humans what they like see be makin em unhappy ter take away their work an insutin em if yeh tried ter pay em 
 
 but harry set dobby free and he was over the moon about it said hermione and we heard asking for wages now 
 
 yeah well yeh get weirdos in every breed not sayin there the odd elf take freedom but never persuade most of em ter do it no nothin doin hermione 
 
 hermione looked very cross indeed and stuffed her box of badges back into her cloak pocket 
 
 by half past five it was growing dark and ron harry and hermione decided it was time to get back up to the castle for the halloween feast and more important the announcement of the school champions 
 
 come with yeh said hagrid putting away his darning jus give us a sec 
 
 hagrid got up went across to the chest of drawers beside his bed and began searching for something inside it they pay too much attention until a truly horrible smell reached their nostrils coughing ron said hagrid that 
 
 eh said hagrid turning around with a large bottle in his hand don yeh like it 
 
 is that aftershave said hermione in a slightly choked voice 
 
 er eau de cologne hagrid muttered he was blushing 
 
 maybe a bit much he said gruffly go take it off hang on 
 
 he stumped out of the cabin and they saw him washing himself vigorously in the water barrel outside the window 
 
 eau de cologne said hermione in amazement hagrid 
 
 and with the hair and the suit said harry in an undertone 
 
 look said ron suddenly pointing out of the window hagrid had just straightened up and turned round if he had been blushing before it was nothing to what he was doing now getting to their feet very cautiously so that hagrid spot them harry ron and hermione peered through the window and saw that madame maxime and the beauxbatons students had just emerged from their carriage clearly about to set off for the feast too they hear what hagrid was saying but he was talking to madame maxime with a rapt expression harry had only ever seen him wear once before when he had been looking at the baby dragon norbert 
 
 going up to the castle with her said hermione indignantly i thought he was waiting for us 
 
 without so much as a backward glance at his cabin hagrid was trudging off up the grounds with madame maxime the beauxbatons students following in their wake jogging to keep up with their enormous strides 
 
 he fancies her said ron incredulously well if they end up having children be setting a world record bet any baby of theirs would weigh about a ton 
 
 they let themselves out of the cabin and shut the door behind them it was surprisingly dark outside drawing their cloaks more closely around themselves they set off up the sloping lawns 
 
 ooh them look hermione whispered 
 
 the durmstrang party was walking up toward the castle from the lake viktor krum was walking side by side with karkaroff and the other durmstrang students were straggling along behind them ron watched krum excitedly but krum did not look around as he reached the front doors a little ahead of hermione ron and harry and proceeded through them 
 
 when they entered the candlelit great hall it was almost full the goblet of fire had been moved it was now standing in front of empty chair at the teachers table fred and george again seemed to have taken their disappointment fairly well 
 
 hope angelina said fred as harry ron and hermione sat down 
 
 so do i said hermione breathlessly well soon know 
 
 the halloween feast seemed to take much longer than usual perhaps because it was their second feast in two days harry seem to fancy the extravagantly prepared food as much as he would have normally like everyone else in the hall judging by the constantly craning necks the impatient expressions on every face the fidgeting and the standing up to see whether dumbledore had finished eating yet harry simply wanted the plates to clear and to hear who had been selected as champions 
 
 at long last the golden plates returned to their original spotless state there was a sharp upswing in the level of noise within the hall which died away almost instantly as dumbledore got to his feet on either side of him professor karkaroff and madame maxime looked as tense and expectant as anyone ludo bagman was beaming and winking at various students mr crouch however looked quite uninterested almost bored 
 
 well the goblet is almost ready to make its decision said dumbledore i estimate that it requires one more minute now when the champions names are called i would ask them please to come up to the top of the hall walk along the staff table and go through into the next chamber he indicated the door behind the staff table where they will be receiving their first instructions 
 
 he took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it at once all the candles except those inside the carved pumpkins were extinguished plunging them into a state of semidarkness the goblet of fire now shone more brightly than anything in the whole hall the sparkling bright of the flames almost painful on the eyes everyone watched few people kept checking their watches 
 
 any second lee jordan whispered two seats away from harry 
 
 the flames inside the goblet turned suddenly red again sparks began to fly from it next moment a tongue of flame shot into the air a charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it the whole room gasped 
 
 dumbledore caught the piece of parchment and held it at length so that he could read it by the light of the flames which had turned back to 
 
 the champion for durmstrang he read in a strong clear voice will be viktor krum 
 
 no surprises there yelled ron as a storm of applause and cheering swept the hall harry saw viktor krum rise from the slytherin table and slouch up toward dumbledore he turned right walked along the staff table and disappeared through the door into the next chamber 
 
 bravo viktor boomed karkaroff so loudly that everyone could hear him even over all the applause knew you had it in you 
 
 the clapping and chatting died down now attention was focused again on the goblet which seconds later turned red once more a second piece of parchment shot out of it propelled by the flames 
 
 the champion for beauxbatons said dumbledore is fleur delacour 
 
 her ron harry shouted as the girl who so resembled a veela got gracefully to her feet shook back her sheet of silvery blonde hair and swept up between the ravenclaw and hufflepuff tables 
 
 oh look all disappointed hermione said over the noise nodding toward the remainder of the beauxbatons party disappointed was a bit of an understatement harry thought two of the girls who had not been selected had dissolved into tears and were sobbing with their heads on their arms 
 
 when fleur delacour too had vanished into the side chamber silence fell again but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it the hogwarts champion next 
 
 and the goblet of fire turned red once more sparks showered out of it the tongue of flame shot high into the air and from its tip dumbledore pulled the third piece of parchment 
 
 the hogwarts champion he called is cedric diggory 
 
 no said ron loudly but nobody heard him except harry the uproar from the next table was too great every single hufflepuff had jumped to his or her feet screaming and stamping as cedric made his way past them grinning broadly and headed off toward the chamber behind the teachers table indeed the applause for cedric went on so long that it was some time before dumbledore could make himself heard again 
 
 excellent dumbledore called happily as at last the tumult died down well we now have our three champions i am sure i can count upon all of you including the remaining students from beauxbatons and durmstrang to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster by cheering your champion on you will contribute in a very real 
 
 but dumbledore suddenly stopped speaking and it was apparent to everybody what had distracted him 
 
 the fire in the goblet had just turned red again sparks were flying out of it a long flame shot suddenly into the air and borne upon it was another piece of parchment 
 
 automatically it seemed dumbledore reached out a long hand and seized the parchment he held it out and stared at the name written upon it there was a long pause during which dumbledore stared at the slip in his hands and everyone in the room stared at dumbledore and then dumbledore cleared his throat and read out

lionfish nov chapter sixteen in the headcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 hermione made no mention of harry giving defence against the dark arts lessons for two whole weeks after her original suggestion detentions with umbridge were finally over he doubted whether the words now etched into the back of his hand would ever fade entirely ron had had four more quidditch practices and not been shouted at during the last two and all three of them had managed to vanish their mice in transfiguration hermione had actually progressed to vanishing kittens before the subject was broached again on a wild blustery evening at the end of september when the three of them were sitting in the library looking up potion ingredients for snape 
 
 i was wondering hermione said suddenly whether thought any more about defence against the dark arts harry 
 
 course i have said harry grumpily forget it can we with that hag teaching us 
 
 i meant the idea ron and i had ron cast her an alarmed threatening kind of look she frowned at him oh all right the idea i had thenabout you teaching us 
 
 harry did not answer at once he pretended to be perusing a page of asiatic because he did not want to say what was in his mind 
 
 he had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight sometimes it seemed an insane idea just as it had on the night hermione had proposed it but at others he had found himself thinking about the spells that had served him best in his various encounters with dark creatures and death eatersfound himself in fact subconsciously planning lessons 
 
 well he said slowly when he could no longer pretend to find asiatic interesting yeah thought about it a bit 
 
 and said hermione eagerly 
 
 i dunno said harry playing for time he looked up at ron 
 
 i thought it was a good idea from the start said ron who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he was sure harry was not going to start shouting again 
 
 harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair 
 
 you did listen to what i said about a load of it being luck you 
 
 yes harry said hermione gently but all the same no point pretending that not good at defence against the dark arts because you are you were the only person last year who could throw off the imperius curse completely you can produce a patronus you can do all sorts of stuff that wizards viktor always said 
 
 ron looked round at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck rubbing it he said yeah what did vicky say 
 
 ho ho said hermione in a bored voice he said harry knew how to do stuff even he and he was in the final year at durmstrang 
 
 ron was looking at hermione suspiciously 
 
 not still in contact with him are you 
 
 so what if i am said hermione coolly though her face was a little pink i can have a if i 
 
 he only want to be your said ron accusingly 
 
 hermione shook her head exasperatedly and ignoring ron who was continuing to watch her said to harry well what do you think will you teach us 
 
 just you and ron yeah 
 
 well said hermione looking a mite anxious again well now fly off the handle again harry please but i really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn i mean talking about defending ourselves against oh be pathetic ron it seem fair if we offer the chance to other people 
 
 harry considered this for a moment then said yeah but i doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me a nutter remember 
 
 well i think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what got to say said hermione seriously look she leaned towards him ron who was still watching her with a frown on his face leaned forwards to listen know the first weekend in a hogsmeade weekend how would it be if we tell anyone interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over 
 
 why do we have to do it outside school said ron 
 
 because said hermione returning to the diagram of the chinese chomping cabbage she was copying i think umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to 
 
 harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into hogsmeade but there was one thing worrying him sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of september harry knew they had made him angry by saying they want him to comebut he still worried from time to time that sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway what were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street towards them in hogsmeade perhaps under the nose of draco malfoy 
 
 well you blame him for wanting to get out and about said ron when harry discussed his fears with him and hermione i mean been on the run for over two years he and i know that have been a laugh but at least he was free he and now just shut up all the time with that ghastly elf 
 
 hermione scowled at ron but otherwise ignored the slight on kreacher 
 
 the trouble is she said to harry until for comes out into the open sirius is going to have to stay hidden he i mean the stupid ministry going to realise sirius is innocent until they accept that been telling the truth about him all along and once the fools start catching real death eaters again be obvious sirius one i mean he got the mark for one thing 
 
 i reckon be stupid enough to turn up said ron bracingly go mad if he did and sirius listens to dumbledore even if he like what he hears 
 
 when harry continued to look worried hermione said listen ron and i have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper defence against the dark arts and there are a couple who seem interested told them to meet us in hogsmeade 
 
 right said harry vaguely his mind still on sirius 
 
 worry harry hermione said quietly got enough on your plate without sirius too 
 
 she was quite right of course he was barely keeping up with his homework though he was doing much better now that he was no longer spending every evening in detention with umbridge ron was even further behind with his work than harry because while they both had quidditch practice twice a week ron also had his prefect duties however hermione who was taking more subjects than either of them had not only finished all her homework but was also finding time to knit more elf clothes harry had to admit that she was getting better it was now almost always possible to distinguish between the hats and the socks 
 
 the morning of the hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy alter breakfast they queued up in front of filch who matched their names to the long list of students who had permission from their parents or guardian to visit the village with a slight pang harry remembered that if it been for sirius he would not have been going at all 
 
 when harry reached filch the caretaker gave a great sniff as though trying to detect a whiff of something from harry then he gave a curt nod that set his jowls aquiver again and harry walked on out on to the stone steps and the cold sunlit day 
 
 erwhy was filch sniffing you asked ron as he harry and hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gates 
 
 i suppose he was checking for the smell of dungbombs said harry with a small laugh i forgot to tell you 
 
 and he recounted the story of sending his letter to sirius and filch bursting in seconds later demanding to see the letter to his slight surprise hermione found this story highly interesting much more indeed than he did himself 
 
 he said he was tipped off you were ordering dungbombs but who tipped him off 
 
 i dunno said harry shrugging maybe malfoy think it was a laugh 
 
 they walked between the tall stone pillars topped with winged boars and turned left on to the road into the village the wind whip ping their hair into their eyes 
 
 malfoy said hermione sceptically well yes maybe 
 
 and she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirts of hogsmeade 
 
 where are we going anyway harry asked the three broomsticks 
 
 ohno said hermione coming out of her reverie no always packed and really noisy told the others to meet us in the head that other pub you know the one not on the main road i think a bit you know dodgy but students normally go in there so i think be overheard 
 
 they walked down the main street past wizarding joke shop where they were not surprised to see fred george and lee jordan past the post office from which owls issued at regular intervals and turned up a at the top of which stood a small inn a battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door with a picture on it of a wild severed head leaking blood on to the white cloth around it the sign creaked in the wind as they approached all three of them hesitated outside the door 
 
 well come on said hermione slightly nervously harry led the way inside 
 
 it was not at all like the three broomsticks whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness the head bar comprised one small dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goats the bay windows were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room which was lit instead with the stubs of candles sitting on rough wooden tables the floor seemed at first glance to be compressed earth though as harry stepped on to it he realised that there was stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of centuries 
 
 harry remembered hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year yeh get a lot o funny folk in the head he had said explaining how he had won a egg from a hooded stranger there at the time harry had wondered why hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter now he saw that keeping your face hidden was something of a fashion in the head there was a man at the bar whose whole head was wrapped in dirty grey bandages though he was still managing to gulp endless glasses of some smoking fiery substance through a slit over his mouth two figures shrouded in hoods sat at a table in one of the windows harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong yorkshire accents and in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick black veil that fell to her toes they could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly 
 
 i know about this hermione harry muttered as they crossed to the bar he was looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch has it occurred to you umbridge might be under that 
 
 hermione cast an appraising eye over the veiled figure 
 
 umbridge is shorter than that woman she said quietly and anyway even if umbridge does come in here nothing she can do to stop us harry because double and the school rules not out of bounds i specifically asked professor flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the head and he said yes but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses and looked up everything i can think of about study groups and homework groups and definitely allowed i just think a good idea if we parade what doing 
 
 no said harry drily especially as not exactly a homework group planning is it 
 
 the barman sidled towards them out of a back room he was a old man with a great deal of long grey hair and beard he was tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to harry 
 
 what he grunted 
 
 three butterbeers please said hermione 
 
 the man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty very dirty bottles which he slammed on the bar 
 
 six sickles he said 
 
 get them said harry quickly passing over the silver the eyes travelled over harry resting for a fraction of a second on his scar then he turned away and deposited money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it harry ron and hermione retreated to the furthest table from the bar and sat down looking around the man in the dirty grey bandages rapped the counter with his knuckles and received another smoking drink from the barman 
 
 you know what ron murmured looking over at the bar with enthusiasm we could order anything we liked in here i bet that bloke would sell us anything he care always wanted to try firewhisky 
 
 youareaprefect snarled hermione 
 
 oh said ron the smile fading from his face yeah 
 
 so who did you say is supposed to be meeting us harry asked wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig 
 
 just a couple of people hermione repeated checking her watch and looking anxiously towards the door i told them to be here about now and sure they all know where it isoh look this might be them now 
 
 the door of the pub had opened a thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people 
 
 first came neville with dean and lavender who were closely followed by parvati and padma patil with stomach did a cho and one of her girlfriends then on her own and looking so dreamy she might have walked in by accident luna lovegood then katie bell alicia spinnet and angelina johnson colin and dennis creevey ernie macmillan justin hannah abbott a hufflepuff girl with a long plait clown her back whose name harry did not know three ravenclaw boys he was pretty sure were called anthony goldstein michael corner and terry boot ginny closely followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom harry recognised vaguely as being a member of the hufflepuff quidditch team and bringing up the rear fred and george weasley with their friend lee jordan all three of whom were carrying large paper bags crammed with merchandise 
 
 a couple of people said harry hoarsely to hermione a couple of people 
 
 yes well the idea seemed quite popular said hermione happily ron do you want to pull up some more chairs 
 
 the barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked as though it had never been washed possibly he had never seen his pub so full 
 
 hi said fred reaching the bar first and counting his companions quickly could we have butterbeers please 
 
 the barman glared at him for a moment then throwing down his rag irritably as though he had been interrupted in something very important he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the bar 
 
 cheers said fred handing them out cough up everyone i got enough gold for all of these 
 
 harry watched numbly as the large chattering group took their beers from fred and rummaged in their robes to find coins he could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible thought occurred to him that they might be expecting same kind of speech at which he rounded on hermione 
 
 what have you been telling people he said in a low voice what are they expecting 
 
 told you they just want to hear what got to say said hermione soothingly but harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly you have to do anything yet speak to them first 
 
 hi harry said neville beaming and taking a seat opposite him 
 
 harry tried to smile back but did not speak his mouth was exceptionally dry cho had just smiled at him and sat down on right her friend who had curly hair did not smile but gave harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that given her way she would not be here at all 
 
 in twos and threes the new arrivals settled around harry ron and hermione some looking rather excited others curious luna lovegood gazing dreamily into space when everybody had pulled up a chair the chatter died out every eye was upon harry 
 
 er said hermione her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerves wellerhi 
 
 the group focused its attention on her instead though eyes continued to dart back regularly to harry 
 
 well erm well you know why here erm well harry here had the ideai mean harry had thrown her a sharp look i had the ideathat it might be good if people who wanted to study defence against the dark artsand i mean really study it you know not the rubbish that umbridge is doing with us voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident because nobody could call that defence against the dark arts hear hear said anthony goldstein and hermione looked heartened well i thought it would be good if we well took matters into our own hands 
 
 she paused looked sideways at harry and went on and by that i mean learning how to defend ourselves properly not just in theory but doing the real spells 
 
 you want to pass your defence against the dark arts owl too though i bet said michael corner who was watching her closely 
 
 of course i do said hermione at once but more than that i want to be properly trained in defence because because she took a great breath and finished because lord voldemort is back 
 
 the reaction was immediate and predictable friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down herself terry boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch padma patil shuddered and neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough all of them however looked fixedly even eagerly at harry 
 
 well the plan anyway said hermione if you want to join us we need to decide how going to 
 
 the proof back said the blond hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice 
 
 well dumbledore believes it hermione began 
 
 you mean dumbledore believes him said the blond boy nodding at harry 
 
 who are you said ron rather rudely 
 
 zacharias smith said the boy and i think got the right to know exactly what makes him say back 
 
 look said hermione intervening swiftly really not what this meeting was supposed to be about 
 
 ok hermione said harry 
 
 it had just dawned on him why there were so many people there he thought hermione should have seen this coming some of these peoplemaybe even most of themhad turned up in the hopes of hearing story firsthand 
 
 what makes me say back he repeated looking zacharias straight in the face i saw him but dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year and if you believe him you believe me and not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone 
 
 the whole group seemed to have held its breath while harry spoke harry had the impression that even the barman was listening he was wiping the same glass with the filthy rag making it steadily dirtier 
 
 zacharias said dismissively all dumbledore told us last year was that cedric diggory got killed by and that you brought body back to hogwarts he give us details he tell us exactly how diggory got murdered i think all like to know 
 
 if come to hear exactly what it looks like when voldemort murders someone i help you harry said his temper always so close to the surface these days was rising again he did not take his eyes from zacharias aggressive face and was determined not to look at cho i want to talk about cedric diggory all right so if what here for you might as well clear out 
 
 he cast an angry look in direction this was he felt all her fault she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just now wild his story was but none of them left their seats not even zacharias smith though he continued to gaze intently at harry 
 
 so said hermione her voice very again so like i was saying if you want to learn some defence then we need to work out how going to do it how often going to meet and where going to 
 
 is it true interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back looking at harry that you can produce a patronus 
 
 there was a murmur of interest around the group at this 
 
 yeah said harry slightly defensively 
 
 a corporeal patronus 
 
 the phrase stirred something in memory 
 
 eryou know madam bones do you he asked 
 
 the girl smiled 
 
 my auntie she said susan bones she told me about your hearing sois it really true you make a stag patronus 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 blimey harry said lee looking deeply impressed i never knew that 
 
 mum told ron not to spread it around said fred grinning at harry she said you got enough attention as it was 
 
 not wrong mumbled harry and a couple of people laughed 
 
 the veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat 
 
 and did you kill a basilisk with that sword in office demanded terry boot what one of the portraits on the wall told me when i was in there last year 
 
 eryeah i did yeah said harry 
 
 justin whistled the creevey brothers exchanged awestruck looks and lavender brown said wow softly harry was feeling slightly hot around the collar now he was determinedly looking anywhere but at cho 
 
 and in our first year said neville to the group at large he saved that philological stone 
 
 hissed hermione 
 
 yes thatfrom finished neville 
 
 hannah abbotts eyes were as round as galleons 
 
 and not to mention said cho eyes snapped across to her she was looking at him smiling his stomach did another somersault all the tasks he had to get through in the triwizard tournament last yeargetting past dragons and merpeople and acromantula and things 
 
 there was a murmur of impressed agreement around the table insides were squirming he was trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself the fact that cho had just praised him made it much much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them 
 
 look he said and everyone fell silent at once i i want to sound like trying to be modest or anything but i had a lot of help with all that stuff 
 
 not with the dragon you said michael corner at once that was a seriously cool bit of flying 
 
 yeah well said harry feeling it would be churlish to disagree 
 
 and nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer said susan bones 
 
 no said harry no ok i know i did bits of it without help but the point trying to make is 
 
 are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff said zacharias smith 
 
 an idea said ron loudly before harry could speak why you shut your mouth 
 
 perhaps the word weasel had affected ron particularly strongly in any case he was now looking at zacharias as though he would like nothing better than to thump him zacharias flushed 
 
 well all turned up to learn from him and now telling us he really do any of it he said 
 
 not what he said snarled fred 
 
 would you like us to clean out your ears for you enquired greorge pulling a long and metal instrument from inside one of the bags 
 
 or any part of your body really not fussy where we stick this said fred 
 
 yes well said hermione hastily moving on the point is are we agreed we want to take lessons from harry 
 
 there was a murmur of general agreement zacharias folded his arms and said nothing though perhaps this was because he was too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in hand 
 
 right said hermione looking relieved that something had at last been settled well then the next question is how often we do it i really think any point in meeting less than once a week 
 
 hang on said angelina we need to make sure this clash with our quidditch practice 
 
 no said cho nor with ours 
 
 nor ours added zacharias smith 
 
 sure we can find a night that suits everyone said hermione slightly impatiently but you know this is rather important talking about learning to defend ourselves against death eaters 
 
 well said barked ernie macmillan who harry had been expecting to speak long before this personally i think this is really important possibly more important than anything else do this year even with our owls coming up 
 
 he looked around impressively as though waiting for people to cry surely not when nobody spoke he went on i personally am at a loss to see why the ministry has foisted such a useless teacher on us at this critical period obviously they are in denial about the return of but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells 
 
 we think the reason umbridge want us trained in defence against the dark arts said hermione is that got some some mad idea that dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army she thinks mobilise us against the ministry 
 
 nearly everybody looked stunned at this news everybody except luna lovegood who piped up well that makes sense after all cornelius fudge has got his own private army 
 
 what said harry completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information 
 
 yes got an army of heliopaths said luna solemnly 
 
 no he snapped hermione 
 
 yes he has said luna 
 
 what are heliopaths asked neville looking blank 
 
 spirits of fire said luna her protuberant eyes widening so that she looked madder than ever great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of 
 
 they exist neville said hermione tartly 
 
 oh yes they do said luna angrily 
 
 sorry but the proof of that snapped hermione 
 
 there are plenty of accounts just because so you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you 
 
 hem hem said ginny in such a good imitation of professor umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed we trying to decide how often going to meet and have defence lessons 
 
 yes said hermione at once yes we were right ginny 
 
 well once a week sounds cool said lee jordan 
 
 as long as began angelina 
 
 yes yes we know about the quidditch said hermione in a tense voice well the other thing to decide is where going to meet 
 
 this was rather more difficult the whole group fell silent 
 
 library suggested katie bell after a few moments 
 
 i see madam pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library said harry 
 
 maybe an unused classroom said dean 
 
 yeah said ron mcgonagall might let us have hers she did when harry was practising for the tri wizard 
 
 but harry was pretty certain that mcgonagall would not be so accommodating this time for all that hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed he had the distinct feeling that this one might be considered a lot more rebellious 
 
 right well try to find somewhere said hermione send a message round to everybody when got a time and a place for the first meeting 
 
 she rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill then hesitated rather as though she was steeling herself to say something 
 
 ii think everybody should write their name down just so we know who was here but i also think she took a deep breath that we all ought to agree not to shout about what doing so if you sign agreeing not to tell umbridge or anybody else what up to 
 
 fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully wrote his signature but harry noticed at once that several people looked less than happy at the prospect of putting their names on the list 
 
 er said zacharias slowly not taking the parchment that george was trying to pass to him well sure ernie will tell me when the meeting is 
 
 but ernie was looking rather hesitant about signing too hermione raised her eyebrows at him 
 
 iwell we are prefects ernie burst out and if this list was found well i mean to say you said yourself if umbridge finds out 
 
 you just said this group was the most important thing do this year harry reminded him 
 
 iyes said ernie yes i do believe that just 
 
 ernie do you really think leave that list lying around said hermione testily 
 
 no no of course not said ernie looking slightly less anxious iyes of course sign 
 
 nobody raised objections after ernie though harry saw friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name when the last personzacharias had signed hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag there was an odd feeling in the group now it was as though they had just signed some kind of contract 
 
 well ticking on said fred briskly getting to his feet george lee and i have got items of a sensitive nature to purchase be seeing you all later 
 
 in twos and threes the rest of the group took their leave too 
 
 cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving her long dark curtain of hair swinging forwards to hide her face but her friend stood beside her arms folded clicking her tongue so that cho had little choice but to leave with her as her friend ushered her through the door cho looked back and waved at harry 
 
 well i think that went quite well said hermione happily as she harry and ron walked out of the head into the bright sunlight a few moments later harry and ron were clutching their bottles of butterbeer 
 
 that zacharias a wart said ron who was glowering after the figure of smith just discernible in the distance 
 
 i like him much either admitted hermione but he overheard me talking to ernie and hannah at the hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming so what could i say but the more people the better reallyi mean michael corner and his friends have come if he been going out with ginny 
 
 ron who had been draining the last few drops from his butterbeer bottle gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front 
 
 what spluttered ron outraged his ears now resembling curls of raw beef going out withmy goingwhat mean michael corner 
 
 well why he and his friends came i thinkwell obviously interested in learning defence but if ginny told michael what was going on 
 
 when did this when did she 
 
 they met at the yule ball and got together at the end of last year said hermione composedly they had turned into the high street and she paused outside quill shop where there was a handsome display of pheasant feather quills in the window hmm i could do with a new quill 
 
 she turned into the shop harry and ron followed her 
 
 which one was michael corner ron demanded furiously 
 
 the dark one said hermione 
 
 i like him said ron at once 
 
 big surprise said hermione under her breath 
 
 but said ron following hermione along a row of quills in copper pots i thought ginny fancied harry 
 
 hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head 
 
 ginny used to fancy harry but she gave up on him months ago not that she like you of course she added kindly to harry while she examined a long black and gold quill 
 
 harry whose head was still full of parting wave did not find this subject quite as interesting as ron who was positively quivering with indignation but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered 
 
 so why she talks now he asked hermione she never used to talk in front of me 
 
 exactly said hermione yes i think have this one 
 
 she went up to the counter and handed over fifteen sickles and two knuts with ron still breathing down her neck 
 
 ron she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet this is exactly why ginny told you seeing michael she knew take it badly so harp on about it for sake 
 
 what mean taking anything badly not going to harp on about anything ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street 
 
 hermione rolled her eyes at harry and then said in an undertone while ron was still muttering imprecations about michael corner and talking about michael and ginny what about cho and you 
 
 what mean said harry quickly 
 
 it was as though boiling water was rising rapidly inside him a burning sensation that was causing his face to smart in the coldhad he been that obvious 
 
 well said hermione smiling slightly she just keep her eyes off you could she 
 
 harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of hogsmeade was 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter sixteen a very frosty christmascontents prev chapter next chapter 
 so snape was offering to help him he was definitely offering to help him 
 
 if you ask that once more said harry going to stick this sprout 
 
 only checking said ron they were standing alone at the kitchen sink peeling a mountain of sprouts for mrs weasley snow was drifting past the window in front of them 
 
 yes snape was offering to help him said harry he said promised mother to protect him that made an unbreakable oath or something 
 
 an unbreakable vow said ron looking stunned nah he have are you sure 
 
 yes sure said harry why what does it mean 
 
 well you break an unbreakable vow 
 
 worked that much out for myself funnily enough what happens if you break it then 
 
 you die said ron simply fred and george tried to get me to make one when i was about five i nearly did too i was holding hands with fred and everything when dad found us he went mental said ron with a reminiscent gleam in his eyes only time ever seen dad as angry as mum fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since 
 
 yeah well passing over left buttock 
 
 i beg your pardon said voice as the twins entered the kitchen 
 
 aaah george look at this using knives and everything bless them 
 
 be seventeen in two and a bit months time said ron grumpily and then be able to do it by magic 
 
 but meanwhile said george sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a 
 
 you made me do that said ron angrily sucking his cut thumb you wait when seventeen 
 
 sure dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills yawned fred 
 
 and speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills ronald said george what is this we hear from ginny about you and a young lady calledunless our information is faultylavender brown 
 
 ron turned a little pink but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts mind your own business 
 
 what a snappy retort said fred i really know how you think of them no what we wanted to know was how did it happen 
 
 what mean 
 
 did she have an accident or something 
 
 what 
 
 well how did she sustain such extensive brain damage careful now 
 
 mrs weasley entered the room just in time to see ron throw the sprout knife at fred who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand 
 
 ron she said furiously you ever let me see you throwing knives again 
 
 i said ron let you see he added under his breath as he turned back to the sprout mountain 
 
 fred george sorry dears but remus is arriving tonight so bill will have to squeeze in with you two 
 
 no problem said george 
 
 then as charlie coming home that just leaves harry and ron in the attic and if fleur shares with ginny 
 
 make christmas muttered fred 
 
 everyone should be comfortable well have a bed anyway said mrs weasley sounding slightly harassed 
 
 percy definitely not showing his ugly face then asked fred 
 
 mrs weasley turned away before she answered 
 
 no busy i expect at the ministry 
 
 or the biggest prat said fred as mrs weasley left the kitchen one of the two well get going then george 
 
 what are you two up to asked ron cant you help us with these sprouts you could just use your wand and then be free too 
 
 no i think we can do that said fred seriously very stuff learning to peel sprouts without magic makes you appreciate how difficult it is for muggles and squibs 
 
 and if you want people to help you ron added george throwing the paper airplane at him i chuck knives at them just a little hint off to the village a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous almost like real magic 
 
 gits said ron darkly watching fred and george setting off across the snowy yard only taken them ten seconds and then we gone too 
 
 i said harry i promised dumbledore i wander off while staying here 
 
 oh yeah said ron he peeled a few more sprouts and then said are you going to tell dumbledore what you heard snape and malfoy saying to each other 
 
 yep said harry going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it and top of the list i might have another word with your dad too 
 
 pity you hear what actually doing though 
 
 i have done could i that was the whole point he was refusing to tell snape 
 
 there was silence for a moment or two then ron said course you know what all say dad and dumbledore and all of them say snape really trying to help malfoy he was just trying to find out what up to 
 
 they hear him said harry flatly no that good an actor not even snape 
 
 yeah just saying though said ron 
 
 harry turned to face him frowning 
 
 you think right though 
 
 yeah i do said ron hastily seriously i do but all convinced in the order they 
 
 harry said nothing it had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence he could hear hermione now 
 
 obviously harry he was pretending to offer help so he could trick malfoy into telling him what doing 
 
 this was pure imagination however as he had had no opportunity to tell hermione what he had overheard she had disappeared from party before he returned to it or so he had been informed by an irate mclaggen and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room as he and ron had left for the burrow early the next day he had barely had time to wish her a happy christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays he was not entirely sure that she had heard him though ron and lavender had been saying a thoroughly goodbye just behind him at the time 
 
 still even hermione would not be able to deny one thing malfoy was definitely up to something and snape knew it so harry felt fully justified in saying i told you so which he had done several times to ron already 
 
 harry did not get the chance to speak to mr weasley who was working very long hours at the ministry until christmas eve night the weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living room which ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a explosion fred george harry and ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for christmas dinner stupefied painted gold stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to his back it glowered down at them all the ugliest angel harry had ever seen with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet 
 
 they were all supposed to be listening to a christmas broadcast by mrs favorite singer celestina warbeck whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set fleur who seemed to find celestina very dull was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling mrs weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control so that celestina grew louder and louder under cover of a particularly jazzy number called a cauldron full of hot strong love fred and george started a game of exploding snap with ginny ron kept shooting bill and fleur covert looks as though hoping to pick up tips meanwhile remus lupin who was thinner and more than ever was sitting beside the fire staring into its depths as though he could not hear voice 
 
 oh come and stir my cauldron 
 
 and if you do it right 
 
 boil you up some hot strong love 
 
 to keep you warm tonight 
 
 we danced to this when we were eighteen said mrs weasley wiping her eyes on her knitting do you remember arthur 
 
 mphf said mr weasley whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling oh yes marvelous tune 
 
 with an effort he sat up a little straighter and looked around at harry who was sitting next to him 
 
 sorry about this he said jerking his head toward the wireless as celestina broke into the chorus be over soon 
 
 no problem said harry grinning has it been busy at the ministry 
 
 very said mr weasley i mind if we were getting anywhere but of the three arrests made in the last couple of months i doubt that one of them is a genuine death eateronly repeat that harry he added quickly looking much more awake all of a sudden 
 
 not still holding stan shunpike are they asked harry 
 
 afraid so said mr weasley i know tried appealing directly to scrimgeour about stan i mean anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that about as much a death eater as this satsuma but the top levels want to look as though making some progress and three arrests sounds better than three mistaken arrests and releases but again this is all top secret 
 
 i say anything said harry he hesitated for a moment wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say as he marshaled his thoughts celestina warbeck began a ballad called you charmed the heart right out of me 
 
 mr weasley you know what i told you at the station when we were setting off for school 
 
 i checked harry said mr weasley at once i went and searched the malfoys house there was nothing either broken or whole that have been there 
 
 yeah i know i saw in the prophet that looked but this is something different well something more 
 
 and he told mr weasley everything he had overheard between malfoy and snape as harry spoke he saw head turn a little toward him taking in every word when he had finished there was silence except for crooning 
 
 oh my poor heart where has it gone 
 
 left me for a spell 
 
 has it occurred to you harry said mr weasley that snape was simply pretending 
 
 pretending to offer help so that he could find out what up to said harry quickly yeah i thought say that but how do we know 
 
 it our business to know said lupin unexpectedly he had turned his back on the fire now and faced harry across mr weasley business dumbledore trusts severus and that ought to be good enough for all of us 
 
 but said harry just sayjust say wrong about snape 
 
 people have said it many times it comes down to whether or not you trust judgment i do therefore i trust severus 
 
 but dumbledore can make mistakes argued harry he says it himself and you 
 
 he looked lupin straight in the eye 
 
 do you honestly like snape 
 
 i neither like nor dislike severus said lupin no harry i am speaking the truth he added as harry pulled a skeptical expression we shall never be bosom friends perhaps after all that happened between james and sirius and severus there is too much bitterness there but i do not forget that during the year i taught at hogwarts severus made the wolfsbane potion for me every month made it perfectly so that i did not have to suffer as i usually do at the full moon 
 
 but he accidentally let it slip that a werewolf so you had to leave said harry angrily 
 
 lupin shrugged 
 
 the news would have leaked out anyway we both know he wanted my job but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion he kept me healthy i must be grateful 
 
 maybe he dare mess with the potion with dumbledore watching him said harry 
 
 you are determined to hate him harry said lupin with a faint smile and i understand with james as your father with sirius as your godfather you have inherited an old prejudice by all means tell dumbledore what you have told arthur and me but do not expect him to share your view of the matter do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him it might have been on orders that severus questioned draco 
 
 and now torn it quite apart 
 
 thank you to give back my heart 
 
 celestina ended her song on a very long note and loud applause issued out of the wireless which mrs weasley joined in with enthusiastically 
 
 eez eet over said fleur loudly thank goodness what an orrible 
 
 shall we have a nightcap then asked mr weasley loudly leaping to his feet who wants eggnog 
 
 what have you been up to lately harry asked lupin as mr weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation 
 
 oh been underground said lupin almost literally why i been able to write harry sending letters to you would have been something of a 
 
 what do you mean 
 
 been living among my fellows my equals said lupin werewolves he added at look of incomprehension nearly all of them are on side dumbledore wanted a spy and here i was 
 
 he sounded a little bitter and perhaps realized it for he smiled more warmly as he went on i am not complaining it is necessary work and who can do it better than i however it has been difficult gaining their trust i bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards you see whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margins stealingand sometimes killingto eat 
 
 how come they like voldemort 
 
 they think that under his rule they will have a better life said lupin and it is hard to argue with greyback out there 
 
 greyback 
 
 you heard of him hands closed convulsively in his lap fenrir greyback is perhaps the most savage werewolf alive today he regards it as his mission in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services greyback specializes in children bite them young he says and raise them away from their parents raise them to hate normal wizards voldemort has threatened to unleash him upon sons and daughters it is a threat that usually produces good results 
 
 lupin paused and then said it was greyback who bit me 
 
 what said harry astonished whenwhen you were a kid you mean 
 
 yes my father had offended him i did not know for a very long time the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me i even felt pity for him thinking that he had had no control knowing by then how it felt to transform but greyback is not like that at the full moon he positions himself close to victims ensuring that he is near enough to strike he plans it all and this is the man voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves i cannot pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against insistence that we werewolves deserve blood that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people 
 
 but you are normal said harry fiercely just got aa problem 
 
 lupin burst out laughing 
 
 sometimes you remind me a lot of james he called it my furry little problem in company many people were under the impression that i owned a badly behaved rabbit 
 
 he accepted a glass of eggnog from mr weasley with a word of thanks looking slightly more cheerful harry meanwhile felt a rush of excitement this last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he had been looking forward to asking lupin 
 
 have you ever heard of someone called the prince 
 
 the what 
 
 prince said harry watching him closely for signs of recognition 
 
 there are no wizarding princes said lupin now smiling is this a title thinking of adopting i should have thought being the chosen one would be enough 
 
 nothing to do with me said harry indignantly the prince is someone who used to go to hogwarts got his old potions book he wrote spells all over it spells he invented one of them was levicorpus 
 
 oh that one had a great vogue during my time at hogwarts said lupin reminiscently there were a few months in my fifth year when you move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle 
 
 my dad used it said harry i saw him in the pensieve he used it on snape 
 
 he tried to sound casual as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect smile was a little too understanding 
 
 yes he said but he the only one as i say it was very popular you know how these spells come and go 
 
 but it sounds like it was invented while you were at school harry persisted 
 
 not necessarily said lupin jinxes go in and out of fashion like everything else he looked into face and then said quietly james was a harry and i promise you he never asked us to call him prince 
 
 abandoning pretense harry said and it sirius or you 
 
 definitely not 
 
 oh harry stared into the fire i just thoughtwell helped me out a lot in potions classes the prince has 
 
 how old is this book harry 
 
 i dunno never checked 
 
 well perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the prince was at hogwarts said lupin 
 
 shortly after this fleur decided to imitate celestina singing a cauldron full of hot strong love which was taken by everyone once they had glimpsed mrs expression to be the cue to go to bed harry and ron climbed all the way up to attic bedroom where a camp bed had been added for harry 
 
 ron fell asleep almost immediately but harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of advanced before getting into bed there he turned its pages searching until he finally found at the front of the book the date that it had been published it was nearly fifty years old neither his father nor his friends had been at hogwarts fifty years ago feeling disappointed harry threw the book back into his trunk turned off the lamp and rolled over thinking of werewolves and snape stan shunpike and the prince and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children 
 
 got to be joking 
 
 harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed he put on his glasses and looked around the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and in front of it ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain 
 
 that asked harry 
 
 from lavender said ron sounding revolted she honestly think wear 
 
 harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words my sweetheart 
 
 nice he said classy you should definitely wear it in front of fred and george 
 
 if you tell them said ron shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow 
 
 stutter at me said harry grinning come on would i 
 
 how could she think like something like that though ron demanded of thin air looking rather shocked 
 
 well think back said harry have you ever let it slip that like to go out in public with the words my sweetheart round your neck 
 
 well we really talk much said ron mainly 
 
 snogging said harry 
 
 well yeah said ron he hesitated a moment then said is hermione really going out with mclaggen 
 
 i dunno said harry they were at party together but i think it went that well 
 
 ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking 
 
 presents included a sweater with a large golden snitch worked onto the front by mrs weasley a large box of weasleys wizard wheezes products from the twins and a slightly damp package that came with a label reading to master from kreacher 
 
 harry stared at it reckon this is safe to open he asked 
 
 be anything dangerous all our still being searched at the ministry replied ron though he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously 
 
 i think of giving kreacher anything do people usually give their christmas presents asked harry prodding the parcel cautiously 
 
 hermione would said ron but wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty 
 
 a moment later harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed the package contained a large number of maggots 
 
 nice said ron roaring with laughter very thoughtful 
 
 rather have them than that necklace said harry which sobered ron up at once 
 
 everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for christmas lunch everyone except fleur on whom it appeared mrs weasley had not wanted to waste one and mrs weasley herself who was sporting a midnight blue hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds and a spectacular golden necklace 
 
 fred and george gave them to me they beautiful 
 
 well we find we appreciate you more and more mum now washing our own socks said george waving an airy hand parsnips remus 
 
 harry got a maggot in your hair said ginny cheerfully leaning across the table to pick it out harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot 
 
 ow orrible said fleur with an affected little shudder 
 
 yes it said ron gravy fleur 
 
 in his eagerness to help her he knocked the gravy boat flying bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat 
 
 you are as bad as zat tonks said fleur to ron when she had finished kissing bill in thanks she is always knocking 
 
 i invited dear tonks to come along today said mrs weasley setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at fleur but she come have you spoken to her lately remus 
 
 no i been in contact with anybody very much said lupin but tonks has got her own family to go to she 
 
 hmmm said mrs weasley maybe i got the impression she was planning to spend christmas alone actually 
 
 she gave lupin an annoyed look as though it was all his fault she was getting fleur for a instead of tonks but harry glancing across at fleur who was now feeding bill bits of turkey off her own fork thought that mrs weasley was fighting a battle he was however reminded of a question he had with regard to tonks and who better to ask than lupin the man who knew all about patronuses 
 
 patronus has changed its form he told him snape said so anyway i know that could happen why would your patronus change 
 
 lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly sometimes a great shock an emotional upheaval 
 
 it looked big and it had four legs said harry struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice hey it be 
 
 arthur said mrs weasley suddenly she had risen from her chair her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out of the kitchen window percy 
 
 what 
 
 mr weasley looked around everybody looked quickly at the window ginny stood up for a better look there sure enough was percy weasley striding across the snowy yard his glasses glinting in the sunlight he was not however alone 
 
 arthur with the minister 
 
 and sure enough the man harry had seen in the daily prophet was following along in wake limping slightly his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow before any of them could say anything before mr and mrs weasley could do more than exchange stunned looks the back door opened and there stood percy 
 
 there was a painful silence then percy said rather stiffly merry christmas mother 
 
 oh percy said mrs weasley and she threw herself into his arms 
 
 rufus scrimgeour paused in the doorway leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene 
 
 you must forgive this intrusion he said when mrs weasley looked around at him beaming and wiping her eyes percy and i were in the vicinityworking you know and he resist dropping in and seeing you all 
 
 but percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family he stood and and stared over everybody heads mr weasley fred and george were all observing him 
 
 please come in sit down minister fluttered mrs weasley straightening her hat have a little purkey or some tooding i mean 
 
 no no my dear molly said scrimgeour harry guessed that he had checked her name with percy before they entered the house i want to intrude be here at all if percy wanted to see you all so badly 
 
 oh perce said mrs weasley tearfully reaching up to kiss him 
 
 only looked in for five minutes so have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with percy no no i assure you i want to butt in well if anybody cared to show me your charming garden ah that young finished why he take a stroll with me 
 
 the atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly everybody looked from scrimgeour to harry nobody seemed to find pretense that he did not know name convincing or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the minister around the garden when ginny fleur and george also had clean plates 
 
 yeah all right said harry into the silence 
 
 he was not fooled for all talk that they had just been in the area that percy wanted to look up his family this must be the real reason that they had come so that scrimgeour could speak to harry alone 
 
 fine he said quietly as he passed lupin who had half risen from his chair fine he added as mr weasley opened his mouth to speak 
 
 wonderful said scrimgeour standing back to let harry pass through the door ahead of him just take a turn around the garden and percy and be off carry on everyone 
 
 harry walked across the yard toward the weasleys overgrown garden scrimgeour limping slightly at his side he had harry knew been head of the auror office he looked tough and very different from portly fudge in his bowler hat 
 
 charming said scrimgeour stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants charming 
 
 harry said nothing he could tell that scrimgeour was watching him 
 
 wanted to meet you for a very long time said scrimgeour after a few moments did you know that 
 
 no said harry truthfully 
 
 oh yes for a very long time but dumbledore has been very protective of you said scrimgeour natural of course natural after what been through especially what happened at the ministry 
 
 he waited for harry to say something but harry did not oblige so he went on i have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since i gained office but dumbledore hasmost understandably as i sayprevented this 
 
 still harry said nothing waiting 
 
 the rumors that have flown around said scrimgeour well of course we both know how these stories get distorted all these whispers of a prophecy of you being the chosen one 
 
 they were getting near it now harry thought the reason scrimgeour was here 
 
 i assume that dumbledore has discussed these matters with you 
 
 harry deliberated wondering whether he ought to lie or not he looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds and the patch that marked the spot where fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the christmas tree finally he decided on the truth or a bit of it 
 
 yeah discussed it 
 
 have you have you said scrimgeour harry could see out of the corner of his eye scrimgeour squinting at him so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron and what has dumbledore told you harry 
 
 sorry but between us said harry 
 
 he kept his voice as pleasant as he could and tone too was light and friendly as he said oh of course if a question of confidences i want you to divulge no no and in any case does it really matter whether you are the chosen one or not 
 
 harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding 
 
 i really know what you mean minister 
 
 well of course to you it will matter enormously said scrimgeour with a laugh but to the wizarding community at large all perception it what people believe important 
 
 harry said nothing he thought he saw dimly where they were heading but he was not going to help scrimgeour get there the gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots and harry kept his eyes fixed upon it 
 
 people believe you are the chosen one you see said scrimgeour they think you quite the herowhich of course you arc harry chosen or not how many times have you faced now well anyway he pressed on without waiting for a reply the point is you are a symbol of hope for many harry the idea that there is somebody out there who might be able who might even be destined to destroy naturally it gives people a lift and i help but feel that once you realize this you might consider it well almost a duty to stand alongside the ministry and give everyone a boost 
 
 the gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm it was now tugging very hard on it trying to get it out of the frozen ground harry was silent so long that scrimgeour said looking from harry to the gnome funny little chaps they but what say you harry 
 
 i exactly understand what you want said harry slowly stand alongside the ministry what does that mean 
 
 oh well nothing at all onerous i assure you said scrimgeour if you were to be seen popping in and out of the ministry from time to time for instance that would give the right impression and of course while you were there you would have ample opportunity to speak to gawain robards my successor as head of the auror office dolores umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an auror well that could be arranged very easily 
 
 harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach so dolores umbridge was still at the ministry was she 
 
 so basically he said as though he just wanted to clarify a few points like to give the impression that working for the ministry 
 
 it would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved harry said scrimgeour sounding relieved that harry had cottoned on so quickly the chosen one you know all about giving people hope the feeling that exciting things are happening 
 
 but if i keep running in and out of the ministry said harry still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly that seem as though i approve of what the up to 
 
 well said scrimgeour frowning slightly well yes partly why like 
 
 no i think work said harry pleasantly you see i like some of the things the doing locking up stan shunpike for instance 
 
 scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly 
 
 i would not expect you to understand he said and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as harry had been these are dangerous times and certain measures need to be taken you are sixteen years old 
 
 a lot older than sixteen and he think stan should be in azkaban either said harry making stan a scapegoat just like you want to make me a mascot 
 
 they looked at each other long and hard finally scrimgeour said with no pretense at warmth i see you preferlike your hero dumbledoreto disassociate yourself from the ministry 
 
 i want to be used said harry 
 
 some would say your duty to be used by the ministry 
 
 yeah and others might say your duty to check that people really are death eaters before you chuck them in prison said harry his temper rising now doing what barty crouch did you never get it right you people do you either got fudge pretending lovely while people get murdered right under his nose or got you chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend got the chosen one working for you 
 
 so not the chosen one said scrimgeour 
 
 i thought you said it matter either way said harry with a bitter laugh not to you anyway 
 
 i have said that said scrimgeour quickly it was tactless 
 
 no it was honest said harry one of the only honest things said to me you care whether i live or die but you do care that i help you convince everyone winning the war against voldemort i forgotten minister 
 
 he raised his right fist there shining white on the back of his cold hand were the scars which dolores umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh i must not tell lies 
 
 i remember you rushing to my defense when i was trying to tell everyone voldemort was back the ministry so keen to be pals last year 
 
 they stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet the gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily leaning against the branches of the rhododendron bush 
 
 what is dumbledore up to said scrimgeour brusquely where does he go when he is absent from hogwarts 
 
 no idea said harry 
 
 and you tell me if you knew said scrimgeour would you 
 
 no i said harry 
 
 well then i shall have to see whether i find out by other means 
 
 you can try said harry indifferently but you seem cleverer than fudge so have thought have learned from his mistakes he tried interfering at hogwarts you might have noticed not minister anymore but still headmaster leave dumbledore alone if i were you 
 
 there was a long pause

 when harry woke the following day it was several seconds before he remembered what had happened then he hoped childishly that it had been a dream that ron was still there and had never left yet by turning his head on his pillow he could see rons deserted bunk it was like a dead body in the way it seems to draw his eyes harry jumped down from his own bed keeping his eyes averted from rons hermione who was already busy in the kitchen did not wish harry good morning but turned her face away quickly as he went by hes gone harry told himself hes gone he had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed as though repetition would dull the shock of it hes gone and hes not coming back and that was the simple truth of it harry knew because their protective enchantments meant that it would be impossible once they vacated this spot for ron to find them again he and hermione ate breakfast in silence hermiones eyes were puffy and red she looked as if she had not slept they packed up their things hermione dawdling harry knew why she wanted to spin out their time on the riverbank several times he saw her look up eagerly and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain but no figure appeared between the trees every time harry imitated her looked around for he could not help hoping a little himself and saw nothing but woods another little parcel of fury exploded inside him he could hear ron saying we thought you knew what you were doing and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach 
 
 the muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank they had lingered a good hour after they would usually have departed their campsite finally having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times hermione seemed unable to find any more reasons to delay she and harry grasped hands and disapparated reappearing on a windswept hillside the instant they arrived hermione dropped harrys hand and walked away from him finally sitting down on a large rock her face on her knees shaking with what he knew were sobs he watched her supposing that he ought to go and comfort her but something kept him rooted to the spot everything inside him felt cold and tight again he saw the contemptuous expression on rons face harry strode off through the heather walking in a large circle with the distraught hermione at its center casting the spell she usually performed to ensure their protection 
 
 they did not discuss ron at all over the next few days harry was determined never to mention his name again and hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue although sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping he would hear her crying meanwhile harry had started bringing out the marauders map and examining it by wandlight he was waiting for the moment when rons labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of hogwarts proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle protected by his status of pureblood however ron did not appear on the map and after a while harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at ginnys name in the girls dormitory wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep that she would somehow know he was thinking about her hoping that she was all right 
 
 by day they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of gryffindors sword but the more they talked about the places in which dumbledore might have hidden it the more desperate and their speculation became cudgel his brains though he might harry could not remember dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something there were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with ron or with dumbledore we thought you knew what you were doingwe thought dumbledore had told you what to do we thought you had a real plan 
 
 he could not hide it from himself ron had been right dumbledore had left him with virtually nothing they had discovered one horcrux but they had no means of destroying it the others were as unattainable as they had ever been hopelessness threatened to engulf him he was staggered now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends offers to accompany him on this meandering pointless journey he knew nothing he had no ideas and he was constantly painfully on the alert for any indications that hermione too was about to tell him that she had had enough that she was leaving 
 
 they were spending many evenings in near silence and hermione took to bringing out phineas nigelluss portrait and propping it up in a chair as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left by rons departure despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again phineas nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what harry was up to and consented to reappear blindfolded every few days of so harry was even glad to see him because he was company albeit of a snide and taunting kind they relished any news about what was happening at hogwarts though phineas nigellus was not an ideal informer he venerated snape the first slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school and they had to be careful not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about snape or phineas nigellus would instantly leave his painting 
 
 however he did let drop certain snippets snape seemed to be facing a constant low level of mutiny from a hard core of students ginny had been banned from going into hogsmeade snape had reinstated umbridges old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any unofficial student societies from all of these things harry deduced that ginny and probably neville and luna along with her had been doing their best to continue dumbledores army this scant news made harry want to see ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache but it also made him think of ron again and of dumbledore and of hogwarts itself which he missed nearly as much as his indeed as phineas niggellus talked about snapes crackdown harry experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the destabilization of snapes regime being fed and having a soft bad and other people being in charge seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at this moment but then he remembered that he was undesirable number one that there was a galleon price on his head and that to walk into hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the ministry of magic indeed phineas nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about harry and hermiones whereabouts hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time he did this and phineas nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious 
 
 the weather grew colder and colder they did not dare remain in any area too long so rather than staying in the south of england where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries they continued to meander up and down the country braving a mountainside where sleet pounded the tent a wide flat marsh where the tent was flooded with chill water and a tiny island in the middle of a scottish loch where snow half buried the tent in the night they had already spotted christmas trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before there came an evening when harry resolved to suggest again what seemed to him the only unexplored avenue left to them they had just eaten an unusually good meal hermione had been to a supermarket under the invisibility cloak scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left and harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti bolognese and tinned pears 
 
 he had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours break from wearing the horcrux which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him 
 
 hermione 
 
 hmm she was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with the tales of beedle the bard he could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book which was not after all very long but evidently she was still deciphering something in it because spellmans syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair 
 
 harry cleared his throat he felt exactly as he had done on the occasion several years previously when he had asked professor mcgonagall whether he could go into hogsmeade despite the fact that he had not persuaded the dursleys to sign his permission slip 
 
 hermione ive been thinking and c 
 
 harry could you help me with something 
 
 apparently she had not been listening to him she leaned forward and held out the tales of beedle the bard 
 
 look at that symbol she said pointing to the top of a page above what harry assumed was the title of the story being unable to read runes he could not be sure there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye its pupil crossed with a vertical line 
 
 i never took ancient runes hermione 
 
 i know that but it isnt a rune and its not in the syllabary either all along i thought it was a picture of an eye but i dont think it is its been inked in look somebodys drawn it there it isnt really part of the book think have you ever seen it before 
 
 no no wait a moment harry looked closer isnt it the same symbol lunas dad was wearing round his neck 
 
 well thats what i thought too 
 
 then its grindelwalds mark 
 
 she stared at him openmouthed 
 
 what 
 
 krum told me 
 
 he recounted the story that viktor krum had told him at the wedding hermione looked astonished 
 
 grindelwalds mark 
 
 she looked from harry to the weird symbol and back again ive never heard that grindelwald had a mark theres no mention of it in anything ive ever read about him 
 
 well like i say krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at durmstrang and grindelwald put it there 
 
 she fell back into the old armchair frowning 
 
 thats very odd if its a symbol of dark magic whats it doing in a book of childrens stories 
 
 yeah it is weird said harry and youd think scrimgeour would have recognized it he was minister he ought to have been expert on dark stuff 
 
 i know perhaps he thought it was an eye just like i did all the other stories have little pictures over the titles 
 
 she did not speak but continued to pore over the strange mark harry tried again 
 
 hermione 
 
 hmm 
 
 ive been thinking i c i want to go to godrics hollow 
 
 she looked up at him but her eyes were unfocused and he was sure she was still thinking about the mysterious mark on the book 
 
 yes she said yes ive been wondering that too i really think well have to 
 
 did you hear me right he asked 
 
 of course i did you want to go to godrics hollow i agree i think we should i mean i cant think of anywhere else it could be either itll be dangerous but the more i think about it the more likely it seems its there 
 
 er c whats there asked harry 
 
 at that she looked just as bewildered as he felt 
 
 well the sword harry dumbledore must have known youd want to go back there and i mean godrics hollow is godric gryffindors birthplace c 
 
 really gryffindor came from godrics hollow 
 
 harry did you ever even open a history of magic 
 
 erm he said smiling for what felt like the first time in months the muscles in his face felt oddly stiff i mightve opened it you know when i bought it just the once 
 
 well as the village is named after him id have thought you might have made the connection said hermione she sounded much more like her old self than she had done of late harry half expected her to announce that she was off to the library theres a bit about the village in a history of magic wait 
 
 she opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while finally extracting her copy of their old school textbook a history of magic by bathilda bagshot which she thumbed through until finding the page she wanted 
 
 
 
 
 upon the signature of the international statute of secrecy in wizards went into hiding for good it was natural perhaps that they formed their own small communities within a community many small villages and hamlets attracted several magical families who banded together for mutual support and protection the villages of tinworsh in cornwall upper flagley in yorkshire and ottery st catchpole on the south coast of england were notable homes to knots of wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes confunded muggles most celebrated of these dwelling places is perhaps godrics hollow the west country village where the great wizard godric gryffindor was born and where bowman wright wizarding smith forged the first golden snitch the graveyard is full of the names of ancient magical families and this accounts no doubt for the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for many centuries 
 
 
 
 
 you and your parents arent mentioned hermione said closing the book because professor bagshot doesnt cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century but you see godrics hollow godric gryffindor gryffindors sword dont you think dumbledore would have expected you to make the connection 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he suggested they go to godrics hollow for him the lore of the village lay in his parents graves the house where he had narrowly escaped death and in the person of bathilda bagshot 
 
 remember what muriel said he asked eventually 
 
 who 
 
 you know he hesitated he did not want to say rons name ginnys at the wedding the one who said you had skinny ankles 
 
 oh said hermione it was a sticky moment harry knew that she had sensed rons name in the offing he rushed on 
 
 she said bathilda bagshot still lived in godrics hollow 
 
 bathilda bagshot murmured hermione running her index finger over bathildas embossed name on the front cover of a history of magic well i suppose c 
 
 she gasped so dramatically that harrys insides turned over he drew his wand looking around at the entrance half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap but there was nothing there 
 
 what he said half angry half relieved what did you do that for i thought youd seen a death eater unzipping the tent at least c 
 
 harry what if bathildas got the sword what if dumbledore entrusted it to her 
 
 harry considered this possibility bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now and according to muriel she was gaga was it likely that dumbledore would have hidden the sword of gryffindor with her if so harry felt that dumbledore had left a great deal to chance dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship with bathilda now however was not the moment to cast doubt on hermiones theory not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with harrys dearest wish 
 
 yeah he might have done so are we going to go to godrics hollow 
 
 yes but well have to think it through carefully harry she was sitting up now and harry could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his well need to practice disapparating together under the invisibility cloak for a start and perhaps disillusionment charms would be sensible too unless you think we should go the whole hog and use polyjuice potion in that case well need to collect hair from somebody i actually think wed better do that harry the thicker our disguises the better 
 
 harry let her talk nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause but his mind had left the conversation for the first time since he had discovered that the sword in gringotts was a fake he felt excited 
 
 he was about to go home about to return to the place where he had had a family it was in godrics hollow that but for voldemort he would have grown up and spent every school holiday he could have invited friends to his house he might even have had brothers and sisters it would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake the life he had lost had hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment when he knew he was about to see the place where it had been taken from him after hermione had gone to bed that night harry quietly extracted his rucksack from hermiones beaded bag and from inside it the photograph album hagrid had given him so long ago for the first time in months he perused the old pictures of his parents smiling and waving up at him from the images which were all he had left of them now 
 
 harry would gladly have set out for godrics hollow the following day but hermione had other ideas convinced as she was that voldemort would expect harry to return to the scene of his parents deaths she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they had the best disguises possible it was therefore a full week later c once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from innocent muggles who were christmas shopping and had practiced apparating and disapparating while underneath the invisibility cloak together c that hermione agreed to make the journey 
 
 they were to apparate to the village under cover of darkness so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed polyjuice potion harry transforming into a balding muggle man hermione into his small and rather mousy wife the beaded bag containing all of their possessions apart from the horcrux which harry was wearing around his neck was tucked into an inside pocket of hermiones coat harry lowered the invisibility cloak over them then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again 
 
 heart beating in his throat harry opened his eyes they were standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky in which the nights first stars were already glimmering feebly cottages stood on either side of the narrow road christmas decorations twinkling in their windows a short way ahead of them a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the village 
 
 all this snow hermione whispered beneath the cloak why didnt we think of snow after all our precautions well leave prints well just have to get rid of them c you go in front ill do it c 
 
 harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their traces 
 
 lets take off the cloak said harry and when she looked frightened oh come on we dont look like us and theres no one around 
 
 he stowed the cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered the icy air stinging their faces as they passed more cottages any one of them might have been the one in which james and lily had once lived or where bathilda lived now harry gazed at the front doors their roofs and their front porches wondering whether he remembered any of them knowing deep inside that it was impossible that he had been little more than a year old when he had left this place forever he was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at all he did not know what happened when the subjects of a fidelius charm died then the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village a small square was revealed to them 
 
 strung all around with colored lights there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle partly obscured by a windblown christmas tree there were several shops a post office a pub and a little church whose windows were glowing across the square 
 
 the snow here had become impacted it was hard and slippery where people had trodden on it all day villagers were crisscrossing in front of them their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps they heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed then they heard a carol start up inside the little church 
 
 harry i think its christmas eve said hermione 
 
 is it 
 
 he had lost track of the date they had not seen a newspaper for weeks 
 
 im sure it is said hermione her eyes upon the church they theyll be in there wont they your mum and dad i can see the graveyard behind it 
 
 harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement more like fear now that he was so near he wondered whether he wanted to see after all perhaps hermione knew how he was feeling because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time pulling him forward halfway across the square however she stopped dead 
 
 harry look 
 
 she was pointing at the war memorial as they had passed it it had transformed instead of an obelisk covered in names there was a statue of three people a man with untidy hair and glasses a woman with long hair and a kind pretty face and a baby boy sitting in his mothers arms snow lay upon all their heads like fluffy white caps 
 
 harry drew closer gazing up into his parents faces he had never imagined that there would be a statue how strange it was to see himself represented in stone a happy baby without a scar on his forehead 
 
 cmon said harry when he had looked his fill and they turned again toward the church as they crossed the road he glanced over his shoulder the statue had turned back into the war memorial 
 
 the singing grew louder as they approached the church it made harrys throat constrict it reminded him so forcefully of hogwarts of peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of armor of the great halls twelve christmas trees of dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker of ron in a sweater 
 
 there was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard hermione pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through it on either side of the slippery path to the church doors the snow lay deep and untouched they moved off through the snow carving deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows 
 
 behind the church row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling red gold and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass hit the snow keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket harry moved toward the nearest grave 
 
 look at this its an abbott could be some relation of hannahs 
 
 keep your voice down hermione begged him 
 
 they waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard gouging dark tracks into the snow behind them stooping to peer at the words on old headstones every now and then squinting into the surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied 
 
 harry here 
 
 hermione was two rows of tombstones away he had to wade back to her his heart positively banging in his chest 
 
 is it c 
 
 no but look 
 
 she pointed to the dark stone harry stooped down and saw upon the frozen granite the words kendra dumbledore and a short way down her dates of birth and death and her daughter ariana there was also a quotation 
 
 where your treasure is there will your heart be also 
 
 so rita skeeter and muriel had got some of their facts right the dumbledore family had indeed lived here and part of it had died here 
 
 seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it harry could not help thinking that he and dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard and that dumbledore ought to have told him so yet he had never thought to share the connection they could have visited the place together for a moment harry imagined coming here with dumbledore of what a bond that would have been of how much it would have meant to him but it seemed that to dumbledore the fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence irrelevant perhaps to the job he wanted harry to do 
 
 hermione was looking at harry and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow he read the words on the tombstone again where your treasure is there will your heart be also he did not understand what these words meant surely dumbledore had chosen them as the eldest member of the family once his mother had died 
 
 are you sure he never mentioned c hermione began 
 
 no said harry curtly then lets keep looking and he turned away wishing he had not seen the stone he did not want his excited trepidation tainted with resentment 
 
 here cried hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness oh no sorry i thought it said potter 
 
 she was rubbing at a crumbling mossy stone gazing down at it a little frown on her face 
 
 harry come back a moment 
 
 he did not want to be sidetracked again and only grudgingly made his way back through the snow toward her 
 
 what 
 
 look at this 
 
 the grave was extremely old weathered so that harry could hardly make out the name hermione showed him the symbol beneath it 
 
 harry thats the mark in the book 
 
 he peered at the place she indicated the stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what was engraved there though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name 
 
 yeah it could be 
 
 hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone 
 
 it says ig c ignotus i think 
 
 im going to keep looking for my parents all right harry told her a slight edge to his voice and he set off again leaving her crouched beside the old grave 
 
 every now and then he recognized a surname that like abbott he had met at hogwarts sometimes there were several generations of the same wizarding family represented in the graveyard harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out or the current members had moved away from godrics hollow deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went and every time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation 
 
 the darkness and the silence seemed to become all of a sudden much deeper harry looked around worried thinking of dementors then realized that the carols had finished that the chatter and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights 
 
 then hermiones voice came out of the blackness for the third time sharp and clear from a few yards away 
 
 harry theyre here right here 
 
 and he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time he moved toward her feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest the same sensation he had had right after dumbledore had died a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs 
 
 the headstone was only two rows behind kendra and arianas it was made of white marble just like dumbledores tomb and this made it easy to read as it seemed to shine in the dark harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it 
 
 
 
 
 james potter lily potter 
 born march born january 
 died october died october 
 
 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death 
 
 harry read the words slowly as though he would have only one chance to take in their meaning and he read the last of them aloud 
 
 the last enemy that shall be defeated is death a horrible thought came to him and with a kind of panic isnt that a death eater idea why is that there 
 
 it doesnt mean defeating death in the way the death eaters mean it harry said hermione her voice gentle it means you know living beyond death living after death 
 
 but they were not living thought harry they were gone the empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone indifferent unknowing and tears came before he could stop them boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face and what was the point in wiping them off or pretending he let them fall his lips pressed hard together looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of lily and james lay bones now surely or dust not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near his heart still beating alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing at this moment that he was sleeping under the snow with them 
 
 hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly he could not look at her but returned the pressure now taking deep sharp gulps of the night air trying to steady himself trying to regain control he should have brought something o give them and he had not thought of it and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen but hermione raised her wand moved it in a circle through the air and a wreath of christmas roses blossomed before them harry caught it and laid it on his parents grave 
 
 as soon as he stood up he wanted to leave he did not think he could stand another moment there he put his arm around hermiones shoulders and she put hers around his waist and they turned in silence and walked away through the snow past dumbledores mother and sister back toward the dark church and the kissing gate

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 in a thousand years 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 yes in a thousand years people will fly on the wings of steam 
 through the air over the ocean the young inhabitants of america will 
 become visitors of old europe they will come over to see the 
 monuments and the great cities which will then be in ruins just as 
 we in our time make pilgrimages to the tottering splendors of southern asia in a thousand years they will come 
 
 the thames the danube and the rhine still roll their course 
 mont blanc stands firm with its summit and the northern lights gleam over the land of the north but generation after 
 generation has become dust whole rows of the mighty of the moment are forgotten like those who already slumber under the hill on which 
 the rich trader whose ground it is has built a bench on which he 
 can sit and look out across his waving corn fields 
 
 to europe cry the young sons of america to the land of our 
 ancestors the glorious land of monuments and fancy to europe 
 the ship of the air comes it is crowded with passengers for 
 the transit is quicker than by sea the wire under 
 the ocean has already telegraphed the number of the aerial caravan 
 europe is in sight it is the coast of ireland that they see but 
 the passengers are still asleep they will not be called till they are 
 exactly over england there they will first step on european shore in 
 the land of shakespeare as the educated call it in the land of 
 politics the land of machines as it is called by others 
 
 here they stay a whole day that is all the time the busy race can 
 devote to the whole of england and scotland then the journey is 
 continued through the tunnel under the english channel to france the land of charlemagne and napoleon moliere is named the learned men talk of the classic school of remote antiquity there is rejoicing and shouting for the names of heroes poets and men of science whom our time does not know but who will be born after our time in 
 paris the centre of europe and elsewhere 
 
 the air steamboat flies over the country whence columbus went 
 forth where cortez was born and where calderon sang dramas in 
 sounding verse beautiful women live still in the 
 blooming valleys and the oldest songs speak of the cid and the 
 alhambra 
 
 then through the air over the sea to italy where once lay 
 old everlasting rome it has vanished the campagna lies desert a 
 single ruined wall is shown as the remains of st but there 
 is a doubt if this ruin be genuine 
 
 next to greece to sleep a night in the grand hotel at the top 
 of mount olympus to say that they have been there and the journey is continued to the bosphorus to rest there a few hours and see the 
 place where byzantium lay and where the legend tells that the harem 
 stood in the time of the turks poor fishermen are now spreading their nets 
 
 over the remains of mighty cities on the broad danube cities 
 which we in our time know not the travellers pass but here and 
 there on the rich sites of those that time shall bring forth the 
 caravan sometimes descends and departs thence again 
 
 down below lies germany that was once covered with a close net of 
 railway and canals the region where luther spoke where goethe 
 sang and mozart once held the sceptre of harmony great names shine there in science and in art names that are unknown to us one day devoted to seeing germany and one for the north the country of oersted and linnaeus and for norway the land of the old heroes and the young normans iceland is visited on the journey home the geysers burn no more hecla is an extinct volcano but the rocky island is still fixed in the midst of the foaming sea a continual monument of legend and poetry 
 
 there is really a great deal to be seen in europe says the 
 young american and we have seen it in a week according to the 
 directions of the great traveller and here he mentions the name of 
 one of his contemporaries in his celebrated work how to see all 
 europe in a week

 book grandfather and the grandson 
 chapter i 
 
 an ancient salon 
 when m gillenormand lived in the rue servandoni he had frequented many very good and very aristocratic salons 
 although a bourgeois m gillenormand was received in society 
 as he had a double measure of wit in the first place that which was born with him and secondly that which was attributed to him he was even sought out and made much of 
 he never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there 
 there are people who will have influence at any price and who will have other people busy themselves over them when they cannot be oracles they turn wags m gillenormand was not of this nature his domination in the royalist salons which he frequented cost his nothing he was an oracle everywhere 
 it had happened to him to hold his own against m de bonald and even against m 
 about he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in his own neighborhood in the rue ferou with madame la baronne de t a worthy and respectable person whose husband had been ambassador of france to berlin under louis xvi 
 baron de t who during his lifetime had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions had died bankrupt during the emigration leaving as his entire fortune some very curious memoirs about mesmer and his tub in ten manuscript volumes bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges madame de t had not published the memoirs out of pride and maintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew how 
 madame de t lived far from the court a very mixed society as she said in a noble isolation proud and poor 
 a few friends assembled twice a week about her widowed hearth and these constituted a purely royalist salon 
 they sipped tea there and uttered groans or cries of horror at the century the charter the bonapartists the prostitution of the blue ribbon or the jacobinism of louis xviii according as the wind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs and they spoke in low tones of the hopes which were presented by monsieur afterwards charles x 
 the songs of the fishwomen in which napoleon was called nicolas were received there with transports of joy 
 duchesses the most delicate and charming women in the world went into ecstasies over couplets like the following addressed to the federates refoncez dans vos culottes 
 le bout d chemis qui vous pend 
 n dis pas qu les patriotes 
 ont arbore l drapeau blanc 
 tuck into your trousers the that is hanging out let it not be said that patriots have hoisted the white flag 
 there they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous with quatrains with distiches even thus upon the dessolles ministry a moderate cabinet of which mm 
 decazes and deserre were raffermir le trone ebranle sur sa base 
 il faut changer de sol et de serre et de case 
 in order to the shaken throne firmly on its base soil des solles greenhouse and house decazes must be changed 
 or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers an abominably jacobin chamber and from this list they combined alliances of names in such a manner as to form for example phrases like the following damas 
 sabran 
 this was done merrily in that society they parodied the revolution 
 they used i know not what desires to give point to the same wrath in inverse sense they sang their little ca ira ah ca ira ca ira ca ira 
 les bonapartistes a la lanterne 
 songs are like the guillotine they chop away indifferently this head that 
 it is only a variation 
 in the fualdes affair which belongs to this epoch they took part for bastide and jausion because fualdes was a buonapartist they designated the liberals as friends and brothers this constituted the most deadly insult 
 like certain church towers madame de salon had two cocks one of them was m gillenormand the other was comte de of whom it was whispered about with a sort of respect 
 do you know that is the lamothe of the affair of the necklace 
 these singular amnesties do occur in parties 
 let us add the following 
 in the bourgeoisie honored situations decay through too easy relations one must beware whom one admits in the same way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are cold there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despised persons 
 the ancient society of the upper classes held themselves above this law as above every other 
 marigny the brother of the pompadour had his entry with m le prince de soubise in spite of 
 no because 
 du barry the of the vaubernier was very welcome at the house of m le marechal de richelieu this society is olympus 
 mercury and the prince de guemenee are at home there 
 a thief is admitted there provided he be a god 
 the comte de lamothe who in was an old man years of age had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious air his cold and angular face his perfectly polished manners his coat buttoned up to his cravat and his long legs always crossed in long flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna his face was the same color as his trousers 
 this m de lamothe was held in consideration in this salon on account of his celebrity and strange to say though true because of his name of valois 
 as for m gillenormand his consideration was of absolutely quality 
 he had in spite of his levity and without its interfering in any way with his dignity a certain manner about him which was imposing dignified honest and lofty in a bourgeois fashion and his great age added to it 
 one is not a century with impunity the years finally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment 
 in addition to this he said things which had the genuine sparkle of the old rock 
 thus when the king of prussia after having restored louis xviii came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the count de ruppin he was received by the descendant of louis xiv somewhat as though he had been the marquis de brandebourg and with the most delicate impertinence 
 m gillenormand approved 
 all kings who are not the king of france said he are provincial kings one day the following question was put and the following answer returned in his presence 
 to what was the editor of the courrier francais condemned 
 to be suspended 
 sus is superfluous observed m gillenormand remarks of this nature found a situation 
 suspendu suspended pendu hung 
 at the te deum on the anniversary of the return of the bourbons he said on seeing m de talleyrand pass by 
 there goes his excellency the evil one 
 m gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter that tall mademoiselle who was over forty and looked fifty and by a handsome little boy of seven years white rosy fresh with happy and trusting eyes who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur around him 
 how handsome he is what a pity 
 poor child 
 this child was the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago 
 he was called poor child because he had for a father a brigand of the loire 
 this brigand of the loire was m who has already been mentioned and whom m gillenormand called the disgrace of his family

 chapter iii 
 
 the emperor of russia had meanwhile been in vilna for more than a month reviewing troops and holding maneuvers nothing was ready for the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the emperor had come from petersburg there was no general plan of action the vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after the emperor had been at headquarters for a month each of the three armies had its own commander in chief but there was no supreme commander of all the forces and the emperor did not assume that responsibility himself 
 the longer the emperor remained in vilna the less did everybody tired of waiting prepare for the war all the efforts of those who surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending 
 in june after many balls and fetes given by the polish magnates by the courtiers and by the emperor himself it occurred to one of the polish in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for the emperor by his this idea was eagerly received the emperor gave his consent the collected money by subscription the lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the emperor was invited to act as hostess count bennigsen being a landowner in the vilna province offered his country house for the fete and the thirteenth of june was fixed for a ball dinner regatta and fireworks at zakret count country seat 
 the very day that napoleon issued the order to cross the niemen and his vanguard driving off the cossacks crossed the russian frontier alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his at country house 
 it was a gay and brilliant fete connoisseurs of such matters declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place countess bezukhova was present among other russian ladies who had followed the sovereign from petersburg to vilna and eclipsed the refined polish ladies by her massive so called russian type of beauty the emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance 
 boris drubetskoy having left his wife in moscow and being for the present en garcon as he phrased it was also there and though not an had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses boris was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his own age he was meeting helene in vilna after not having seen her for a long time and did not recall the past but as helene was enjoying the favors of a very important personage and boris had only recently married they met as good friends of long standing 
 at midnight dancing was still going on helene not having a suitable partner herself offered to dance the mazurka with boris they were the third couple boris coolly looking at dazzling bare shoulders which emerged from a dark gauze gown talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time unaware of it himself and unnoticed by others never for an instant ceased to observe the emperor who was in the same room the emperor was not dancing he stood in the doorway stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter 
 as the mazurka began boris saw that adjutant general balashev one of those in closest attendance on the emperor went up to him and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a polish lady having finished speaking to her the emperor looked inquiringly at balashev and evidently understanding that he only acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing nodded slightly to the lady and turned to him hardly had balashev begun to speak before a look of amazement appeared on the face he took balashev by the arm and crossed the room with him unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him boris noticed excited face when the sovereign went out with balashev arakcheev looked at the emperor from under his brow and sniffing with his red nose stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the emperor to address him boris understood that arakcheev envied balashev and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the emperor otherwise than through himself 
 but the emperor and balashev passed out into the illuminated garden without noticing arakcheev who holding his sword and glancing wrathfully around followed some twenty paces behind them 
 all the time boris was going through the figures of the mazurka he was worried by the question of what news balashev had brought and how he could find it out before others in the figure in which he had to choose two ladies he whispered to helene that he meant to choose countess potocka who he thought had gone out onto the veranda and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the garden where seeing balashev and the emperor returning to the veranda he stood still they were moving toward the door boris fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head 
 the emperor with the agitation of one who has been personally affronted was finishing with these words 
 to enter russia without declaring war i will not make peace as long as a single armed enemy remains in my country it seemed to boris that it gave the emperor pleasure to utter these words he was satisfied with the form in which he had expressed his thoughts but displeased that boris had overheard it 
 let no one know of it the emperor added with a frown 
 boris understood that this was meant for him and closing his eyes slightly bowed his head the emperor the ballroom and remained there about another 
 boris was thus the first to learn the news that the french army had crossed the niemen and thanks to this was able to show certain important personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him and by this means he rose higher in their estimation 
 the unexpected news of the french having crossed the niemen was particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations and at a ball on first receiving the news under the influence of indignation and resentment the emperor had found a phrase that pleased him fully expressed his feelings and has since become famous on returning home at two that night he sent for his secretary shishkov and told him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to field marshal prince saltykov in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a single armed frenchman remained on russian soil 
 next day the following letter was sent to napoleon 
 monsieur mon frere 
 yesterday i learned that despite the loyalty which i have kept my engagements with your majesty your troops have crossed the russian frontier and i have this moment received from petersburg a note in which count lauriston informs me as a reason for this aggression that your majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me from the time prince kuragin asked for his passports the reasons on which the duc de bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for aggression in fact the ambassador as he himself has declared was never authorized to make that demand and as soon as i was informed of it i let him know how much i disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at his post if your majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding and consents to withdraw your troops from russian territory i will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible in the contrary case your majesty i shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked it still depends on your majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war i am etc

 chapter ii 
 
 one of the red spectres of that epoch 
 any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of vernon at this epoch and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge which will soon be succeeded let us hope by some hideous iron cable bridge might have observed had he dropped his eyes over the parapet a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon was sewn shod with wooden sabots tanned by the sun his face nearly black and his hair nearly white a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek bowed bent prematurely aged who walked nearly every day hoe and sickle in hand in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge and border the left bank of the seine like a chain of terraces charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say were they much larger 
 these are gardens and were they a little smaller these are bouquets 
 all these enclosures abut upon the river at one end and on a house at the other 
 the man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken inhabited the smallest of these enclosures and the most humble of these houses about 
 he lived there alone and solitary silently and poorly with a woman who was neither young nor old neither homely nor pretty neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise who served him the plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there these flowers were his occupation 
 by dint of labor of perseverance of attention and of buckets of water he had succeeded in creating after the creator and he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten by nature 
 he was ingenious he had forestalled soulange bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould for the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from america and china 
 he was in his alleys from the break of day in summer planting cutting hoeing watering walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness sadness and sweetness sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours listening to the song of a bird in the trees the babble of a child in a house or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass of which the sun made a carbuncle 
 his table was very plain and he drank more milk than wine 
 a child could make him give way and his servant scolded him 
 he was so timid that be seemed shy he rarely went out and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his pane and his cure the abbe mabeuf a good old man nevertheless if the inhabitants of the town or strangers or any chance comers curious to see his tulips rang at his little cottage he opened his door with a smile 
 he was the brigand of the loire 
 any one who had at the same time read military memoirs biographies the moniteur and the bulletins of the grand army would have been struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency the name of georges pontmercy 
 when very young this georges pontmercy had been a soldier in regiment 
 the revolution broke out regiment formed a part of the army of the rhine for the old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the monarchy and were only divided into brigades in 
 pontmercy fought at spire at worms at neustadt at turkheim at alzey at mayence where he was one of the two hundred who formed rearguard 
 it was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the prince of hesse behind the old rampart of andernach and only rejoined the main body of the army when the cannon had opened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis 
 he was under kleber at marchiennes and at the battle of where a ball from a biscaien broke his arm 
 then he passed to the frontier of italy and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the col de tende with joubert 
 joubert was appointed its and pontmercy pontmercy was by side in the midst of the of that day at lodi which caused bonaparte to say 
 berthier has been cannoneer cavalier and grenadier he beheld his old general joubert fall at novi at the moment when with uplifted sabre he was shouting 
 forward 
 having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign on board a pinnace which was proceeding from genoa to some obscure port on the coast he fell into a of seven or eight english vessels the genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea to hide the soldiers between decks and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel 
 pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak and sailed proudly past under the guns of the british frigates twenty leagues further on his audacity having increased he attacked with his pinnace and captured a large english transport which was carrying troops to sicily and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea in he was in that malher division which took gunzberg from the archduke ferdinand 
 at weltingen he received into his arms beneath a storm of bullets colonel maupetit mortally wounded at the head of the th dragoons 
 he distinguished himself at austerlitz in that admirable march in echelons effected under the fire when the cavalry of the imperial russian guard crushed a battalion of the th of the line pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the guard 
 the emperor gave him the cross pontmercy saw wurmser at mantua melas and alexandria mack at ulm made prisoners in succession 
 he formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which mortier commanded and which captured hamburg then he was transferred to the th of the line which was the old regiment of flanders 
 at eylau he was in the cemetery where for the space of two hours the heroic captain louis hugo the uncle of the author of this book sustained alone with his company of men every effort of the hostile army pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery he was at friedland 
 then he saw moscow 
 then la beresina then lutzen bautzen dresden wachau leipzig and the defiles of gelenhausen then montmirail craon the banks of the marne the banks of the aisne and the redoubtable position of laon at being then a captain he put ten cossacks to the sword and saved not his general but his corporal 
 he was well slashed up on this occasion and splinters were extracted from his left arm alone 
 eight days before the capitulation of paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry he had what was called under the old regime the double hand that is to say an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier or a squadron or a battalion as an officer 
 it is from this aptitude perfected by a military education which certain special branches of the service arise the dragoons for example who are both and infantry at one and the same time he accompanied napoleon to the island of elba 
 at waterloo he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers in dubois brigade 
 it was he who captured the standard of the lunenburg battalion 
 he came and cast the flag at the feet 
 he was covered with blood while tearing down the banner he had received a across his face 
 the emperor greatly pleased shouted to him 
 you are a colonel you are a baron you are an officer of the legion of honor pontmercy replied 
 sire i thank you for my widow 
 an hour later he fell in the ravine of ohain 
 now who was this georges pontmercy he was this same brigand of the loire 
 we have already seen something of his history 
 after waterloo pontmercy who had been pulled out of the hollow road of ohain as it will be remembered had succeeded in joining the army and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the loire 
 the restoration had placed him on then had sent him into residence that is to say under surveillance at vernon king louis xviii regarding all that which had taken place during the hundred days as not having occurred at all did not recognize his quality as an officer of the legion of honor nor his grade of colonel nor his title of baron 
 he on his side neglected no occasion of signing himself colonel baron pontmercy he had only an old blue coat and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the legion of honor the attorney for the crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for illegal wearing of this decoration when this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile 
 i do not know whether i no longer understand french or whether you no longer speak it but the fact is that i do not understand 
 then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette 
 they dared not interfere with him two or three times the minister of war and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following address a monsieur le commandant pontmercy 
 he sent back the letters with the seals unbroken 
 at the same moment napoleon at saint helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of sir hudson lowe addressed to general bonaparte 
 pontmercy had ended may we be pardoned the expression by having in his mouth the same saliva as his emperor 
 in the same way there were at rome carthaginian prisoners who refused to salute flaminius and who had a little of spirit 
 one day he encountered the in one of the streets of vernon stepped up to him and said 
 mr crown attorney am i permitted to wear my scar 
 he had nothing save his meagre as chief of squadron he had hired the smallest house which he could find at vernon he lived there alone we have just seen how 
 under the empire between two wars he had found time to marry mademoiselle gillenormand the old bourgeois thoroughly indignant at bottom had given his consent with a sigh saying 
 the greatest families are forced into it in madame pontmercy an admirable woman in every sense by the way lofty in sentiment and rare and worthy of her husband died leaving a child 
 this child had been the joy in his solitude but the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson declaring that if the child were not given to him he would disinherit him 
 the father had yielded in the little interest and had transferred his love to flowers 
 moreover he had renounced everything and neither stirred up mischief nor conspired 
 he shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he was then doing and the great things which he had done he passed his time in expecting a pink or in recalling austerlitz 
 m gillenormand kept up no relations with his the colonel was a bandit to him 
 m gillenormand never mentioned the colonel except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to his baronship 
 it had been expressly agreed that pontmercy should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him under penalty of having the latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited for the gillenormands pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague they intended to bring up the child in their own way 
 perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions but he submitted to them thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself 
 the inheritance of father gillenormand did not amount to much but the inheritance of mademoiselle gillenormand the elder was considerable this aunt who had remained unmarried was very rich on the maternal side and her son was her natural heir 
 the boy whose name was marius knew that he had a father but nothing more no one opened his mouth to him about it 
 nevertheless in the society into which his grandfather took him whispers innuendoes and winks had eventually enlightened the little mind he had finally understood something of the case and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were so to speak the air he breathed by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart 
 while he was growing up in this fashion the colonel slipped away every two or three months came to paris on the sly like a criminal breaking his ban and went and posted himself at at the hour when aunt gillenormand led marius to the mass there trembling lest the aunt should turn round concealed behind a pillar motionless not daring to breathe he gazed at his child the scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster 
 from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon m mabeuf 
 that worthy priest was the brother of a warden of who had often observed this man gazing at his child and the scar on his cheek and the large tears in his eyes 
 that man who had so manly an air yet who was weeping like a woman had struck the warden that face had clung to his mind 
 one day having gone to vernon to see his brother he had encountered colonel pontmercy on the bridge and had recognized the man of the warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure and both had paid the colonel a visit on some pretext or other 
 this visit led to others 
 the colonel who had been extremely reserved at first ended by opening his heart and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history and how pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his future this caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness and the colonel on his side became fond of the cure 
 and moreover when both are sincere and good no men so penetrate each other and so amalgamate with each other as an old priest and an old soldier at bottom the man is the same 
 the one has devoted his life to his country here below the other to his country on high that is the only difference 
 twice a year on the first of january and on st day marius wrote duty letters to his father which were dictated by his aunt and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula this was all that m gillenormand tolerated and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread

 he was in his alleys from the break of day in summer planting cutting hoeing watering walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness sadness and sweetness sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours listening to the song of a bird in the trees the babble of a child in a house or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass of which the sun made a carbuncle 
 his table was very plain and he drank more milk than wine 
 a child could make him give way and his servant scolded him 
 he was so timid that be seemed shy he rarely went out and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his pane and his cure the abbe mabeuf a good old man nevertheless if the inhabitants of the town or strangers or any chance comers curious to see his tulips rang at his little cottage he opened his door with a smile 
 he was the brigand of the loire 
 any one who had at the same time read military memoirs biographies the moniteur and the bulletins of the grand army would have been struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency the name of georges pontmercy 
 when very young this georges pontmercy had been a soldier in regiment 
 the revolution broke out regiment formed a part of the army of the rhine for the old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the monarchy and were only divided into brigades in 
 pontmercy fought at spire at worms at neustadt at turkheim at alzey at mayence where he was one of the two hundred who formed rearguard 
 it was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the prince of hesse behind the old rampart of andernach and only rejoined the main body of the army when the cannon had opened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis 
 he was under kleber at marchiennes and at the battle of where a ball from a biscaien broke his arm 
 then he passed to the frontier of italy and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the col de tende with joubert 
 joubert was appointed its and pontmercy pontmercy was by side in the midst of the of that day at lodi which caused bonaparte to say 
 berthier has been cannoneer cavalier and grenadier he beheld his old general joubert fall at novi at the moment when with uplifted sabre he was shouting 
 forward 
 having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign on board a pinnace which was proceeding from genoa to some obscure port on the coast he fell into a of seven or eight english vessels the genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea to hide the soldiers between decks and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel 
 pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak and sailed proudly past under the guns of the british frigates twenty leagues further on his audacity having increased he attacked with his pinnace and captured a large english transport which was carrying troops to sicily and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea in he was in that malher division which took gunzberg from the archduke ferdinand 
 at weltingen he received into his arms beneath a storm of bullets colonel maupetit mortally wounded at the head of the th dragoons 
 he distinguished himself at austerlitz in that admirable march in echelons effected under the fire when the cavalry of the imperial russian guard crushed a battalion of the th of the line pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the guard 
 the emperor gave him the cross pontmercy saw wurmser at mantua melas and alexandria mack at ulm made prisoners in succession 
 he formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which mortier commanded and which captured hamburg then he was transferred to the th of the line which was the old regiment of flanders 
 at eylau he was in the cemetery where for the space of two hours the heroic captain louis hugo the uncle of the author of this book sustained alone with his company of men every effort of the hostile army pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery he was at friedland 
 then he saw moscow 
 then la beresina then lutzen bautzen dresden wachau leipzig and the defiles of gelenhausen then montmirail craon the banks of the marne the banks of the aisne and the redoubtable position of laon at being then a captain he put ten cossacks to the sword and saved not his general but his corporal 
 he was well slashed up on this occasion and splinters were extracted from his left arm alone 
 eight days before the capitulation of paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry he had what was called under the old regime the double hand that is to say an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier or a squadron or a battalion as an officer 
 it is from this aptitude perfected by a military education which certain special branches of the service arise the dragoons for example who are both and infantry at one and the same time he accompanied napoleon to the island of elba 
 at waterloo he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers in dubois brigade 
 it was he who captured the standard of the lunenburg battalion 
 he came and cast the flag at the feet 
 he was covered with blood while tearing down the banner he had received a across his face 
 the emperor greatly pleased shouted to him 
 you are a colonel you are a baron you are an officer of the legion of honor pontmercy replied 
 sire i thank you for my widow 
 an hour later he fell in the ravine of ohain 
 now who was this georges pontmercy he was this same brigand of the loire 
 we have already seen something of his history 
 after waterloo pontmercy who had been pulled out of the hollow road of ohain as it will be remembered had succeeded in joining the army and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the loire 
 the restoration had placed him on then had sent him into residence that is to say under surveillance at vernon king louis xviii regarding all that which had taken place during the hundred days as not having occurred at all did not recognize his quality as an officer of the legion of honor nor his grade of colonel nor his title of baron 
 he on his side neglected no occasion of signing himself colonel baron pontmercy he had only an old blue coat and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the legion of honor the attorney for the crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for illegal wearing of this decoration when this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile 
 i do not know whether i no longer understand french or whether you no longer speak it but the fact is that i do not understand 
 then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette 
 they dared not interfere with him two or three times the minister of war and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following address a monsieur le commandant pontmercy 
 he sent back the letters with the seals unbroken 
 at the same moment napoleon at saint helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of sir hudson lowe addressed to general bonaparte 
 pontmercy had ended may we be pardoned the expression by having in his mouth the same saliva as his emperor 
 in the same way there were at rome carthaginian prisoners who refused to salute flaminius and who had a little of spirit 
 one day he encountered the in one of the streets of vernon stepped up to him and said 
 mr crown attorney am i permitted to wear my scar 
 he had nothing save his meagre as chief of squadron he had hired the smallest house which he could find at vernon he lived there alone we have just seen how 
 under the empire between two wars he had found time to marry mademoiselle gillenormand the old bourgeois thoroughly indignant at bottom had given his consent with a sigh saying 
 the greatest families are forced into it in madame pontmercy an admirable woman in every sense by the way lofty in sentiment and rare and worthy of her husband died leaving a child 
 this child had been the joy in his solitude but the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson declaring that if the child were not given to him he would disinherit him 
 the father had yielded in the little interest and had transferred his love to flowers 
 moreover he had renounced everything and neither stirred up mischief nor conspired 
 he shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he was then doing and the great things which he had done he passed his time in expecting a pink or in recalling austerlitz 
 m gillenormand kept up no relations with his the colonel was a bandit to him 
 m gillenormand never mentioned the colonel except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to his baronship 
 it had been expressly agreed that pontmercy should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him under penalty of having the latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited for the gillenormands pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague they intended to bring up the child in their own way 
 perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions but he submitted to them thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself 
 the inheritance of father gillenormand did not amount to much but the inheritance of mademoiselle gillenormand the elder was considerable this aunt who had remained unmarried was very rich on the maternal side and her son was her natural heir 
 the boy whose name was marius knew that he had a father but nothing more no one opened his mouth to him about it 
 nevertheless in the society into which his grandfather took him whispers innuendoes and winks had eventually enlightened the little mind he had finally understood something of the case and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were so to speak the air he breathed by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart 
 while he was growing up in this fashion the colonel slipped away every two or three months came to paris on the sly like a criminal breaking his ban and went and posted himself at at the hour when aunt gillenormand led marius to the mass there trembling lest the aunt should turn round concealed behind a pillar motionless not daring to breathe he gazed at his child the scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster 
 from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon m mabeuf 
 that worthy priest was the brother of a warden of who had often observed this man gazing at his child and the scar on his cheek and the large tears in his eyes 
 that man who had so manly an air yet who was weeping like a woman had struck the warden that face had clung to his mind 
 one day having gone to vernon to see his brother he had encountered colonel pontmercy on the bridge and had recognized the man of the warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure and both had paid the colonel a visit on some pretext or other 
 this visit led to others 
 the colonel who had been extremely reserved at first ended by opening his heart and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history and how pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his future this caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness and the colonel on his side became fond of the cure 
 and moreover when both are sincere and good no men so penetrate each other and so amalgamate with each other as an old priest and an old soldier at bottom the man is the same 
 the one has devoted his life to his country here below the other to his country on high that is the only difference 
 twice a year on the first of january and on st day marius wrote duty letters to his father which were dictated by his aunt and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula this was all that m gillenormand tolerated and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread

 book nine 
 chapter iv 
 
 at two in the morning of the fourteenth of june the emperor having sent for balashev and read him his letter to napoleon ordered him to take it and hand it personally to the french emperor when dispatching balashev the emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on russian soil and told him to transmit those words to napoleon alexander did not insert them in his letter to napoleon because with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made but he definitely instructed balashev to repeat them personally to napoleon 
 having set off in the small hours of the fourteenth accompanied by a bugler and two cossacks balashev reached the french outposts at the village of rykonty on the russian side of the niemen by dawn there he was stopped by french cavalry sentinels 
 a french noncommissioned officer of hussars in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap shouted to the approaching balashev to halt balashev did not do so at once but continued to advance along the road at a walking pace 
 the noncommissioned officer frowned and muttering words of abuse advanced his chest against balashev put his hand to his saber and shouted rudely at the russian general asking was he deaf that he did not do as he was told balashev mentioned who he was the noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the russian general 
 after living at the seat of the highest authority and power after conversing with the emperor less than three hours before and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service balashev found it very strange here on russian soil to encounter this hostile and still more this disrespectful application of brute force to himself 
 the sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds the air was fresh and dewy a herd of cattle was being driven along the road from the village and over the fields the larks rose trilling one after another like bubbles rising in water 
 balashev looked around him awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village the russian cossacks and bugler and the french hussars looked silently at one another from time to time 
 a french colonel of hussars who had evidently just left his bed came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse accompanied by two hussars the officer the soldiers and their horses all looked smart and well kept 
 it was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full trim almost like that of peacetime maneuvers but with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes and a touch of the gaiety and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign 
 the french colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn but was polite and evidently understood importance he led him past his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to the emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately as the quarters were he believed not far off 
 they rode through the village of rykonty past tethered french hussar horses past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at a russian uniform and came out at the other end of the village the colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive balashev and conduct him to his destination 
 the sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure 
 they had hardly ridden up a hill past a tavern before they saw a group of horsemen coming toward them in front of the group on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun rode a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders he wore a red mantle and stretched his long legs forward in french fashion this man rode toward balashev at a gallop his plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright june sunshine 
 balashev was only two horses length from the equestrian with the bracelets plunies necklaces and gold embroidery who was galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance when julner the french colonel whispered respectfully the king of naples it was in fact murat now called king of naples though it was quite incomprehensible why he should be king of naples he was called so and was himself convinced that he was so and therefore assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly he was so sure that he really was the king of naples that when on the eve of his departure from that city while walking through the streets with his wife some italians called out to him viva il re he turned to his wife with a pensive smile and said poor fellows they know that i am leaving them tomorrow 
 long live the king 
 but though he firmly believed himself to be king of naples and pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning latterly after he had been ordered to return to military service and especially since his last interview with napoleon in danzig when his august had told him i made you king that you should reign in my way but not in yours he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business and like a but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shafts he dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible and gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of poland without himself knowing why or whither 
 on seeing the russian general he threw back his head with its long hair curling to his shoulders in a majestically royal manner and looked inquiringly at the french colonel the colonel respectfully informed his majesty of mission whose name he could not pronounce 
 de said the king overcoming by his assurance the difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel charmed to make your acquaintance general he added with a gesture of kingly condescension 
 as soon as the king began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity instantly forsook him and without noticing it he passed into his natural tone of familiarity he laid his hand on the withers of horse and said 
 well general it all looks like war as if regretting a circumstance of which he was unable to judge 
 your majesty replied balashev my master the emperor does not desire war and as your majesty sees said balashev using the words your majesty at every opportunity with the affectation unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty 
 face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to monsieur de but royaute oblige and he felt it incumbent on him as a king and an ally to confer on state affairs with envoy he dismounted took arm and moving a few steps away from his suite which waited respectfully began to pace up and down with him trying to speak significantly he referred to the fact that the emperor napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his troops from prussia especially when that demand became generally known and the dignity of france was thereby offended 
 royalty has its obligations 
 balashev replied that there was nothing offensive in the demand because but murat interrupted him 
 then you consider the emperor alexander the aggressor he asked unexpectedly with a kindly and foolish smile 
 balashev told him why he considered napoleon to be the originator of the war 
 oh my dear general murat again interrupted him with all my heart i wish the emperors may arrange the affair between them and that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible said he in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters 
 and he went on to inquiries about the grand duke and the state of his health and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent with him in naples then suddenly as if remembering his royal dignity murat solemnly drew himself up assumed the pose in which he had stood at his coronation and waving his right arm said 
 i detain you longer general i wish success to your mission and with his embroidered red mantle his flowing feathers and his glittering ornaments he rejoined his suite who were respectfully awaiting him 
 balashev rode on supposing from words that he would very soon be brought before napoleon himself but instead of that at the next village the sentinels of infantry corps detained him as the pickets of the vanguard had done and an adjutant of the corps commander who was fetched conducted him into the village to marshal davout

 book grandfather and the grandson 
 chapter iii 
 
 requiescant 
 madame de salon was all that marius pontmercy knew of the world it was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life 
 this opening was sombre and more cold than warmth more night than day came to him through this skylight 
 this child who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world soon became melancholy and what is still more contrary to his age grave 
 surrounded by all those singular and imposing personages he gazed about him with serious amazement 
 everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him 
 there were in madame de salon some very noble ladies named mathan noe was pronounced pronounced cambyse 
 these antique visages and these biblical names mingled in the mind with the old testament which he was learning by heart and when they were all there seated in a circle around a dying fire sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green with their severe profiles their gray or white hair their long gowns of another age whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished dropping at rare intervals words which were both majestic and severe little marius stared at them with frightened eyes in the conviction that he beheld not women but patriarchs and magi not real beings but phantoms 
 with these phantoms priests were sometimes mingled frequenters of this ancient salon and some gentlemen the marquis de sass private secretary to madame de berry the vicomte de val who published under the pseudonyme of monorhymed odes the prince de beauff who though very young had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife whose very toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows the marquis de the man in all france who best understood proportioned politeness the comte the kindly man with the amiable chin and the chevalier de a pillar of the library of the louvre called the cabinet m de bald and rather aged than old was wont to relate that in at the age of sixteen he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian the bishop of mirepoix also refractory but as a priest while he was so in the capacity of a soldier 
 this was at toulon their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses and their red blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck which was dry in the morning and wet at night these tragic tales abounded in madame de salon and by dint of cursing marat they applauded trestaillon 
 some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there m thibord du chalard m lemarchant de gomicourt and the celebrated scoffer of the right m the bailiff de ferrette with his short breeches and his thin legs sometimes traversed this salon on his way to m de talleyrand 
 he had been m le comte companion in pleasures and unlike aristotle crouching under campaspe he had made the guimard crawl on all fours and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff as for the priests there was the abbe halma the same to whom m larose his collaborator on la foudre said 
 bah 
 who is there who is not fifty years old a few greenhorns perhaps the abbe letourneur preacher to the king the abbe frayssinous who was not as yet either count or bishop or minister or peer and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing and the abbe keravenant cure of also the nuncio then monsignor macchi archbishop of nisibi later on cardinal remarkable for his long pensive nose and another monsignor entitled thus 
 abbate palmieri domestic prelate one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the holy see canon of the illustrious liberian basilica advocate of the saints postulatore dei santi which refers to matters of canonization and signifies very nearly master of requests of the section of paradise 
 lastly two cardinals m de la luzerne and m de cl t the cardinal of luzerne was a writer and was destined to have a few years later the honor of signing in the conservateur articles side by side with chateaubriand m de cl t was archbishop of toul and often made trips to paris to his nephew the marquis de t who was minister of marine and war 
 the cardinal of cl t was a merry little man who displayed his red stockings beneath his cassock his specialty was a hatred of the encyclopaedia and his desperate play at billiards and persons who at that epoch passed through the rue m on summer evenings where the hotel de cl t then stood halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the cardinal shouting to his conclavist monseigneur cotiret bishop in partibus of caryste mark abbe i make a cannon 
 the cardinal de cl t had been brought to madame de by his most intimate friend m de roquelaure former bishop of senlis and one of the forty m de roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the academy through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the french academy then held its meetings the curious could on every tuesday contemplate the of senlis usually standing erect freshly powdered in violet hose with his back turned to the door apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar 
 all these ecclesiastics though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen added to the gravity of the t salon whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of france the marquis de vib the marquis de tal the marquis de herb the vicomte damb and the duc de val this duc de val although prince de mon that is to say a reigning prince abroad had so high an idea of france and its peerage that he viewed everything through their medium it was he who said 
 the cardinals are the peers of france of rome the lords are the peers of france of england 
 moreover as it is indispensable that the revolution should be everywhere in this century this feudal salon was as we have said dominated by a bourgeois m gillenormand reigned there 
 there lay the essence and quintessence of the parisian white society there reputations even royalist reputations were held in quarantine there is always a trace of anarchy in renown 
 chateaubriand had he entered there would have produced the effect of pere duchene 
 some of the did nevertheless penetrate thither on sufferance comte beug was received there subject to correction 
 the noble salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons the faubourg reeks of the fagot even now 
 the royalists of are demagogues let us record it to their credit 
 at madame de the society was superior taste was exquisite and haughty under the cover of a great show of politeness manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself buried but still alive 
 some of these habits especially in the matter of language seem eccentric persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique 
 a woman was called madame la generale 
 madame la colonelle was not entirely disused the charming madame de leon in memory no doubt of the duchesses de longueville and de chevreuse preferred this appellation to her title of princesse 
 the marquise de crequy was also called madame la colonelle 
 it was this little high society which invented at the tuileries the refinement of speaking to the king in private as the king in the third person and never as your majesty the designation of your majesty having been soiled by the usurper 
 men and deeds were brought to judgment there 
 they jeered at the age which released them from the necessity of understanding it they abetted each other in amazement 
 they communicated to each other that modicum of light which they possessed methuselah bestowed information on epimenides 
 the deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course of things 
 they declared that the time which had elasped since coblentz had not existed in the same manner that louis xviii 
 was by the grace of god in the five and twentieth year of his reign the emigrants were by rights in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence 
 all was harmonious nothing was too much alive speech hardly amounted to a breath the newspapers agreeing with the salons seemed a papyrus 
 there were some young people but they were rather dead 
 the liveries in the antechamber were antiquated these utterly obsolete personages were served by domestics of the same stamp 
 they all had the air of having lived a long time ago and of obstinately resisting the sepulchre 
 nearly the whole dictionary consisted of conserver conservation conservateur to be in good odor that was the point 
 there are in fact aromatics in the opinions of these venerable groups and their ideas smelled of it it was a mummified society 
 the masters were embalmed the servants were stuffed with straw 
 a worthy old marquise an emigree and ruined who had but a solitary maid continued to say 
 my people 
 what did they do in madame de salon 
 they were ultra 
 to be ultra this word although what it represents may not have disappeared has no longer any meaning at the present day let us explain it 
 to be ultra is to go beyond 
 it is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne and the mitre in the name of the attar it is to the thing which one is dragging it is to kick over the traces it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry it is to insult through excess of respect it is to discover that the pope is not sufficiently papish that the king is not sufficiently royal and that the night has too much light it is to be discontented with alabaster with snow with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy it is to be so strongly for as to be against 
 the ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the restoration 
 nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in and terminates about with the advent of m de villele the practical man of the right 
 these six years were an extraordinary moment at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy smiling and sombre illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered at the same time with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past 
 there existed in that light and that shadow a complete little new and old world comic and sad juvenile and senile which was rubbing its eyes nothing resembles an awakening like a return a group which regarded france with and which france regarded with irony good old owls of marquises by the streetful who had returned and of ghosts the former subjects of amazement at everything brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in france but wept also delighted to behold their country once more in despair at not finding their monarchy the nobility of the crusades treating the nobility of the empire that is to say the nobility of the sword with scorn historic races who had lost the sense of history the sons of the companions of charlemagne disdaining the companions of napoleon the swords as we have just remarked returned the insult the sword of fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap of rusty iron the sword of marengo was odious and was only a sabre 
 former days did not recognize yesterday 
 people no longer had the feeling for what was grand 
 there was some one who called bonaparte scapin this society no longer exists 
 nothing of it we repeat exists when we select from it some one figure at random and attempt to make it live again in thought it seems as strange to us as the world before the deluge 
 it is because it too as a matter of fact has been engulfed in a deluge 
 it has disappeared beneath two revolutions 
 what billows are ideas 
 how quickly they cover all that it is their mission to destroy and to bury and how promptly they create frightful gulfs 
 such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times when m martainville had more wit than voltaire 
 these salons had a literature and politics of their own they believed in fievee 
 m agier laid down the law in them they commentated m colnet the old bookseller and publicist of the quay malaquais 
 napoleon was to them thoroughly the corsican ogre later on the introduction into history of m le marquis de bonaparte of the armies was a concession to the spirit of the age 
 these salons did not long preserve their purity 
 beginning with doctrinarians began to spring up in them a disturbing shade their way was to be royalists and to excuse themselves for being so where the ultras were very proud the doctrinarians were rather ashamed they had wit they had silence their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance they should have succeeded they indulged and usefully too in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats 
 the mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth 
 they assumed the poses of wise men 
 they dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle 
 they opposed and sometimes with rare intelligence conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes 
 they were heard to say thanks for royalism 
 it has rendered more than one service 
 it has brought back tradition worship religion respect 
 it is faithful brave chivalric loving devoted 
 it has mingled though with regret the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation 
 its mistake is not to understand the revolution the empire glory liberty young ideas young generations the age 
 but this mistake which it makes with regard to us have we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them 
 the revolution whose heirs we are ought to be intelligent on all points to attack royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism 
 what an error and what blindness 
 revolutionary france is wanting in respect towards historic france that is to say towards its mother that is to say towards itself 
 after the th of september the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the empire was treated after the th of july 
 they were unjust to the eagle we are unjust to the it seems that we must always have something to proscribe 
 does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of louis xiv to scrape the coat of arms of henry iv we scoff at m de vaublanc for erasing the from the bridge of jena what was it that he did 
 what are we doing 
 bouvines belongs to us as well as marengo 
 the are ours as well as the that is our patrimony 
 to what purpose shall we diminish it we must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present why not accept the whole of history 
 why not love the whole of france 
 it is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected royalism which was displeased at criticism and furious at protection 
 the ultras marked the first epoch of royalism congregation characterized the second skill follows ardor 
 let us confine ourselves here to this sketch 
 in the course of this narrative the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown but he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea 
 souvenirs both respectful and affectionate for they touch his mother attach him to this past 
 moreover let us remark this same petty world had a grandeur of its own one may smile at it but one can neither despise nor hate it it was the france of former days 
 marius pontmercy pursued some studies as all children do 
 when he emerged from the hands of aunt gillenormand his grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence this young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant 
 marius went through his years of college then he entered the law school 
 he was a royalist fanatical and severe 
 he did not love his grandfather much as the gayety and cynicism repelled him and his feelings towards his father were gloomy 
 he was on the whole a cold and ardent noble generous proud religious enthusiastic lad dignified to harshness pure to shyness 
 requiescant 
 madame de salon was all that marius pontmercy knew of the world it was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life 
 this opening was sombre and more cold than warmth more night than day came to him through this skylight 
 this child who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world soon became melancholy and what is still more contrary to his age grave 
 surrounded by all those singular and imposing personages he gazed about him with serious amazement 
 everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him 
 there were in madame de salon some very noble ladies named mathan noe was pronounced pronounced cambyse 
 these antique visages and these biblical names mingled in the mind with the old testament which he was learning by heart and when they were all there seated in a circle around a dying fire sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green with their severe profiles their gray or white hair their long gowns of another age whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished dropping at rare intervals words which were both majestic and severe little marius stared at them with frightened eyes in the conviction that he beheld not women but patriarchs and magi not real beings but phantoms 
 with these phantoms priests were sometimes mingled frequenters of this ancient salon and some gentlemen the marquis de sass private secretary to madame de berry the vicomte de val who published under the pseudonyme of monorhymed odes the prince de beauff who though very young had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife whose very toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows the marquis de the man in all france who best understood proportioned politeness the comte the kindly man with the amiable chin and the chevalier de a pillar of the library of the louvre called the cabinet m de bald and rather aged than old was wont to relate that in at the age of sixteen he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian the bishop of mirepoix also refractory but as a priest while he was so in the capacity of a soldier 
 this was at toulon their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses and their red blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck which was dry in the morning and wet at night these tragic tales abounded in madame de salon and by dint of cursing marat they applauded trestaillon 
 some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there m thibord du chalard m lemarchant de gomicourt and the celebrated scoffer of the right m the bailiff de ferrette with his short breeches and his thin legs sometimes traversed this salon on his way to m de talleyrand 
 he had been m le comte companion in pleasures and unlike aristotle crouching under campaspe he had made the guimard crawl on all fours and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff as for the priests there was the abbe halma the same to whom m larose his collaborator on la foudre said 
 bah 
 who is there who is not fifty years old a few greenhorns perhaps the abbe letourneur preacher to the king the abbe frayssinous who was not as yet either count or bishop or minister or peer and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing and the abbe keravenant cure of also the nuncio then monsignor macchi archbishop of nisibi later on cardinal remarkable for his long pensive nose and another monsignor entitled thus 
 abbate palmieri domestic prelate one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the holy see canon of the illustrious liberian basilica advocate of the saints postulatore dei santi which refers to matters of canonization and signifies very nearly master of requests of the section of paradise 
 lastly two cardinals m de la luzerne and m de cl t the cardinal of luzerne was a writer and was destined to have a few years later the honor of signing in the conservateur articles side by side with chateaubriand m de cl t was archbishop of toul and often made trips to paris to his nephew the marquis de t who was minister of marine and war 
 the cardinal of cl t was a merry little man who displayed his red stockings beneath his cassock his specialty was a hatred of the encyclopaedia and his desperate play at billiards and persons who at that epoch passed through the rue m on summer evenings where the hotel de cl t then stood halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the cardinal shouting to his conclavist monseigneur cotiret bishop in partibus of caryste mark abbe i make a cannon 
 the cardinal de cl t had been brought to madame de by his most intimate friend m de roquelaure former bishop of senlis and one of the forty m de roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the academy through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the french academy then held its meetings the curious could on every tuesday contemplate the of senlis usually standing erect freshly powdered in violet hose with his back turned to the door apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar 
 all these ecclesiastics though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen added to the gravity of the t salon whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of france the marquis de vib the marquis de tal the marquis de herb the vicomte damb and the duc de val this duc de val although prince de mon that is to say a reigning prince abroad had so high an idea of france and its peerage that he viewed everything through their medium it was he who said 
 the cardinals are the peers of france of rome the lords are the peers of france of england 
 moreover as it is indispensable that the revolution should be everywhere in this century this feudal salon was as we have said dominated by a bourgeois m gillenormand reigned there 
 there lay the essence and quintessence of the parisian white society there reputations even royalist reputations were held in quarantine there is always a trace of anarchy in renown 
 chateaubriand had he entered there would have produced the effect of pere duchene 
 some of the did nevertheless penetrate thither on sufferance comte beug was received there subject to correction 
 the noble salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons the faubourg reeks of the fagot even now 
 the royalists of are demagogues let us record it to their credit 
 at madame de the society was superior taste was exquisite and haughty under the cover of a great show of politeness manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself buried but still alive 
 some of these habits especially in the matter of language seem eccentric persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique 
 a woman was called madame la generale 
 madame la colonelle was not entirely disused the charming madame de leon in memory no doubt of the duchesses de longueville and de chevreuse preferred this appellation to her title of princesse 
 the marquise de crequy was also called madame la colonelle 
 it was this little high society which invented at the tuileries the refinement of speaking to the king in private as the king in the third person and never as your majesty the designation of your majesty having been soiled by the usurper 
 men and deeds were brought to judgment there 
 they jeered at the age which released them from the necessity of understanding it they abetted each other in amazement 
 they communicated to each other that modicum of light which they possessed methuselah bestowed information on epimenides 
 the deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course of things 
 they declared that the time which had elasped since coblentz had not existed in the same manner that louis xviii 
 was by the grace of god in the five and twentieth year of his reign the emigrants were by rights in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence 
 all was harmonious nothing was too much alive speech hardly amounted to a breath the newspapers agreeing with the salons seemed a papyrus 
 there were some young people but they were rather dead 
 the liveries in the antechamber were antiquated these utterly obsolete personages were served by domestics of the same stamp 
 they all had the air of having lived a long time ago and of obstinately resisting the sepulchre 
 nearly the whole dictionary consisted of conserver conservation conservateur to be in good odor that was the point 
 there are in fact aromatics in the opinions of these venerable groups and their ideas smelled of it it was a mummified society 
 the masters were embalmed the servants were stuffed with straw 
 a worthy old marquise an emigree and ruined who had but a solitary maid continued to say 
 my people 
 what did they do in madame de salon 
 they were ultra 
 to be ultra this word although what it represents may not have disappeared has no longer any meaning at the present day let us explain it 
 to be ultra is to go beyond 
 it is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne and the mitre in the name of the attar it is to the thing which one is dragging it is to kick over the traces it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry it is to insult through excess of respect it is to discover that the pope is not sufficiently papish that the king is not sufficiently royal and that the night has too much light it is to be discontented with alabaster with snow with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy it is to be so strongly for as to be against 
 the ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the restoration 
 nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in and terminates about with the advent of m de villele the practical man of the right 
 these six years were an extraordinary moment at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy smiling and sombre illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered at the same time with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past 
 there existed in that light and that shadow a complete little new and old world comic and sad juvenile and senile which was rubbing its eyes nothing resembles an awakening like a return a group which regarded france with and which france regarded with irony good old owls of marquises by the streetful who had returned and of ghosts the former subjects of amazement at everything brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in france but wept also delighted to behold their country once more in despair at not finding their monarchy the nobility of the crusades treating the nobility of the empire that is to say the nobility of the sword with scorn historic races who had lost the sense of history the sons of the companions of charlemagne disdaining the companions of napoleon the swords as we have just remarked returned the insult the sword of fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap of rusty iron the sword of marengo was odious and was only a sabre 
 former days did not recognize yesterday 
 people no longer had the feeling for what was grand 
 there was some one who called bonaparte scapin this society no longer exists 
 nothing of it we repeat exists when we select from it some one figure at random and attempt to make it live again in thought it seems as strange to us as the world before the deluge 
 it is because it too as a matter of fact has been engulfed in a deluge 
 it has disappeared beneath two revolutions 
 what billows are ideas 
 how quickly they cover all that it is their mission to destroy and to bury and how promptly they create frightful gulfs 
 such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times when m martainville had more wit than voltaire 
 these salons had a literature and politics of their own they believed in fievee 
 m agier laid down the law in them they commentated m colnet the old bookseller and publicist of the quay malaquais 
 napoleon was to them thoroughly the corsican ogre later on the introduction into history of m le marquis de bonaparte of the armies was a concession to the spirit of the age 
 these salons did not long preserve their purity 
 beginning with doctrinarians began to spring up in them a disturbing shade their way was to be royalists and to excuse themselves for being so where the ultras were very proud the doctrinarians were rather ashamed they had wit they had silence their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance they should have succeeded they indulged and usefully too in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats 
 the mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth 
 they assumed the poses of wise men 
 they dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle 
 they opposed and sometimes with rare intelligence conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes 
 they were heard to say thanks for royalism 
 it has rendered more than one service 
 it has brought back tradition worship religion respect 
 it is faithful brave chivalric loving devoted 
 it has mingled though with regret the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation 
 its mistake is not to understand the revolution the empire glory liberty young ideas young generations the age 
 but this mistake which it makes with regard to us have we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them 
 the revolution whose heirs we are ought to be intelligent on all points to attack royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism 
 what an error and what blindness 
 revolutionary france is wanting in respect towards historic france that is to say towards its mother that is to say towards itself 
 after the th of september the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the empire was treated after the th of july 
 they were unjust to the eagle we are unjust to the it seems that we must always have something to proscribe 
 does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of louis xiv to scrape the coat of arms of henry iv we scoff at m de vaublanc for erasing the from the bridge of jena what was it that he did 
 what are we doing 
 bouvines belongs to us as well as marengo 
 the are ours as well as the that is our patrimony 
 to what purpose shall we diminish it we must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present why not accept the whole of history 
 why not love the whole of france 
 it is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected royalism which was displeased at criticism and furious at protection 
 the ultras marked the first epoch of royalism congregation characterized the second skill follows ardor 
 let us confine ourselves here to this sketch 
 in the course of this narrative the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown but he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea 
 souvenirs both respectful and affectionate for they touch his mother attach him to this past 
 moreover let us remark this same petty world had a grandeur of its own one may smile at it but one can neither despise nor hate it it was the france of former days 
 marius pontmercy pursued some studies as all children do 
 when he emerged from the hands of aunt gillenormand his grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence this young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant 
 marius went through his years of college then he entered the law school 
 he was a royalist fanatical and severe 
 he did not love his grandfather much as the gayety and cynicism repelled him and his feelings towards his father were gloomy 
 he was on the whole a cold and ardent noble generous proud religious enthusiastic lad dignified to harshness pure to shyness

 chapter v 
 
 davout was to napoleon what arakcheev was to alexander though not a coward like arakcheev he was as precise as cruel and as unable to express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty 
 in the organism of states such men are necessary as wolves are necessary in the organism of nature and they always exist always appear and hold their own however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the head of the government may be this inevitability alone can explain how the cruel arakcheev who tore out a mustache with his own hands whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face danger and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier was able to maintain his powerful position with alexander whose own character was chivalrous noble and gentle 
 balashev found davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a hut writing he was auditing accounts better quarters could have been found him but marshal davout was one of those men who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy for the same reason they are always hard at work and in a hurry how can i think of the bright side of life when as you see i am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed the expression of his face seemed to say the chief pleasure and necessity of such men when they encounter anyone who shows animation is to flaunt their own dreary persistent activity davout allowed himself that pleasure when balashev was brought in he became still more absorbed in his task when the russian general entered and after glancing over his spectacles at face which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with murat he did not rise or even stir but scowled still more and sneered malevolently 
 when he noticed in face the disagreeable impression this reception produced davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted 
 thinking he could have been received in such a manner only because davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the emperor alexander and even his envoy to napoleon balashev hastened to inform him of his rank and mission contrary to his expectation davout after hearing him became still surlier and ruder 
 where is your dispatch he inquired give it to me i will send it to the emperor 
 balashev replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the emperor 
 your orders are obeyed in your army but here said davout you must do as told 
 and as if to make the russian general still more conscious of his dependence on brute force davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on duty 
 balashev took out the packet containing the letter and laid it on the table made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it laid across two barrels davout took the packet and read the inscription 
 you are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not protested balashev but permit me to observe that i have the honor to be adjutant general to his majesty 
 davout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on face 
 you will be treated as is fitting said he and putting the packet in his pocket left the shed 
 a minute later the adjutant de castres came in and conducted balashev to the quarters assigned him 
 that day he dined with the marshal at the same board on the barrels 
 next day davout rode out early and after asking balashev to come to him peremptorily requested him to remain there to move on with the baggage train should orders come for it to move and to talk to no one except monsieur de castres 
 after four days of solitude ennui and consciousness of his impotence and insignificance particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of power in which he had so lately moved and after several marches with the baggage and the french army which occupied the whole district balashev was brought to vilna now occupied by the french through the very gate by which he had left it four days previously 
 next day the imperial the comte de turenne came to balashev and informed him of the emperor wish to honor him with an audience 
 four days before sentinels of the preobrazhensk regiment had stood in front of the house to which balashev was conducted and now two french grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads and an escort of hussars and uhlans and a brilliant suite of pages and generals who were waiting for napoleon to come out were standing at the porch round his saddle horse and his mameluke rustan napoleon received balashev in the very house in vilna from which alexander had dispatched him on his mission

 chapter iv 
 
 end of the brigand 
 the conclusion of marius classical studies coincided with m departure from society 
 the old man bade farewell to the faubourg and to madame de salon and established himself in the mardis in his house of the rue des there he had for servants in addition to the porter that chambermaid nicolette who had succeeded to magnon and that and pursy basque who have been mentioned above 
 in marius had just attained his seventeenth year 
 one evening on his return home he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand 
 marius said m gillenormand you will set out for vernon 
 why said marius 
 to see your father 
 marius was seized with a trembling fit 
 he had thought of everything except he should one day be called upon to see his father nothing could be more unexpected more surprising and let us admit it more disagreeable to him 
 it was forcing estrangement into reconciliation 
 it was not an affliction but it was an unpleasant duty 
 marius in addition to his motives of political antipathy was convinced that his father the slasher as m gillenormand called him on his amiable days did not love him this was evident since he had abandoned him to others 
 feeling that he was not beloved he did not love 
 nothing is more simple he said to himself 
 he was so astounded that he did not question m gillenormand the grandfather resumed 
 it appears that he is ill 
 he demands your presence 
 and after a pause he added 
 set out morning 
 i think there is a coach which leaves the cour des fontaines at six and which arrives in the evening take it 
 he says that here is haste 
 then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket marius might have set out that very evening and have been with his father on the following morning 
 a diligence from the rue du bouloi took the trip to rouen by night at that date and passed through vernon 
 neither marius nor thought of making inquiries about it 
 the next day at twilight marius reached vernon 
 people were just beginning to light their candles 
 he asked the first person whom be met for m house 
 for in his own mind he agreed with the restoration and like it did not recognize his claim to the title of either colonel or baron 
 the house was pointed out to him 
 he rang a woman with a little lamp in her hand opened the door 
 m pontmercy said marius 
 the woman remained motionless 
 is this his house demanded marius 
 the woman nodded affirmatively 
 can i speak with him 
 the woman shook her head 
 but i am his son persisted marius 
 he is expecting me 
 he no longer expects you said the woman 
 then he perceived that she was weeping 
 she pointed to the door of a room on the he entered 
 in that room which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the there were three men one standing erect another kneeling and one lying at full length on the floor in his shirt 
 the one on the floor was the colonel 
 the other two were the doctor and the priest who was engaged in prayer 
 the colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously as he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness he had written to m gillenormand to demand his son 
 the malady had grown worse 
 on the very evening of marius arrival at vernon the colonel had had an attack of delirium he had risen from his bed in spite of the efforts to prevent him crying 
 my son is not coming 
 i shall go to meet him 
 then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the floor of the antechamber 
 he had just expired 
 the doctor had been summoned and the cure 
 the doctor had arrived too late 
 the son had also arrived too late 
 by the dim light of the candle a large tear could be distinguished on the pale and prostrate cheek where it had trickled from his dead eye 
 the eye was extinguished but the tear was not yet dry 
 that tear was his delay 
 marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time on that venerable and manly face on those open eyes which saw not on those white locks those robust limbs on which here and there brown lines marking and a sort of red stars which indicated were visible 
 he contemplated that gigantic sear which stamped heroism on that countenance upon which god had imprinted goodness 
 he reflected that this man was his father and that this man was dead and a chill ran over him 
 the sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the presence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out in death 
 anguish poignant anguish was in that chamber 
 the was lamenting in a corner the cure was praying and his sobs were audible the doctor was wiping his eyes the corpse itself was weeping 
 the doctor the priest and the woman gazed at marius in the midst of their affliction without uttering a word he was the stranger there 
 marius who was far too little affected felt ashamed and embarrassed at his own attitude he held his hat in his hand and he dropped it on the floor in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of the strength to hold it 
 at the same time he experienced remorse and he despised himself for behaving in this manner 
 but was it his fault 
 he did not love his father 
 why should he 
 the colonel had left nothing 
 the sale of big furniture barely paid the expenses of his burial 
 the servant found a scrap of paper which she handed to marius it contained the following in the handwriting 
 for my emperor made me a baron on the of waterloo 
 since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it that he will be worthy of it is a matter of course 
 below the colonel had added 
 at that same battle of waterloo a sergeant saved my life the name was thenardier 
 i think that he has recently been keeping a little inn in a village in the neighborhood of paris at chelles or montfermeil 
 if my son meets him he will do all the good he can to thenardier 
 marius took this paper and preserved it not out of duty to his father but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious in the heart of man 
 nothing remained of the colonel 
 m gillenormand had his sword and uniform sold to an dealer 
 the neighbors devastated the garden and pillaged the rare flowers 
 the other plants turned to nettles and weeds and died 
 marius remained only hours at vernon 
 after the interment he returned to paris and applied himself again to his law studies with no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived in two days the colonel was buried and in three forgotten 
 marius wore crape on his hat 
 that was all

 chapter vi 
 
 though balashev was used to imperial pomp he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of court 
 the comte de turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals and polish magnates several of whom balashev had seen at the court of the emperor of russia were waiting duroc said that napoleon would receive the russian general before going for his ride 
 after some minutes the who was on duty came into the great reception room and bowing politely asked balashev to follow him 
 balashev went into a small reception room one door of which led into a study the very one from which the russian emperor had dispatched him on his mission he stood a minute or two waiting he heard hurried footsteps beyond the door both halves of it were opened rapidly all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps firm and resolute they were those of napoleon he had just finished dressing for his ride and wore a blue uniform opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs and hessian boots his short hair had evidently just been brushed but one lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead his plump white neck stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform and he smelled of eau de cologne his full face rather with its prominent chin wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome 
 he entered briskly with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown back his whole short corpulent figure with broad thick shoulders and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding had that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in comfort it was evident too that he was in the best of spirits that day 
 he nodded in answer to low and respectful bow and coming up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well 
 good day general said he i have received the letter you brought from the emperor alexander and am very glad to see you he glanced with his large eyes into face and immediately looked past him 
 it was plain that personality did not interest him at all evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him nothing outside himself had any significance for him because everything in the world it seemed to him depended entirely on his will 
 i do not and did not desire war he continued but it has been forced on me even now he emphasized the word i am ready to receive any explanations you can give me 
 and he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for dissatisfaction with the russian government judging by the calmly moderate and amicable tone in which the french emperor spoke balashev was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into negotiations 
 when napoleon having finished speaking looked inquiringly at the russian envoy balashev began a speech he had prepared long before sire the emperor my master but the sight of the eyes bent on him confused him you are flurried compose yourself napoleon seemed to say as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at uniform and sword 
 balashev recovered himself and began to speak he said that the emperor alexander did not consider demand for his passports a sufficient cause for war that kurakin had acted on his own initiative and without his assent that the emperor alexander did not desire war and had no relations with england 
 not yet interposed napoleon and as if fearing to give vent to his feelings he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that balashev might proceed 
 after saying all he had been instructed to say balashev added that the emperor alexander wished for peace but would not enter into negotiations except on condition that here balashev hesitated he remembered the words the emperor alexander had not written in his letter but had specially inserted in the rescript to saltykov and had told balashev to repeat to napoleon balashev remembered these words so long as a single armed foe remains on russian soil but some complex feeling restrained him he could not utter them though he wished to do so he grew confused and said on condition that the french army retires beyond the niemen 
 napoleon noticed embarrassment when uttering these last words his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver rhythmically without moving from where he stood he began speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before during the speech that followed balashev who more than once lowered his eyes involuntarily noticed the quivering of left leg which increased the more napoleon raised his voice 
 i desire peace no less than the emperor alexander he began have i not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it i have waited eighteen months for explanations but in order to begin negotiations what is demanded of me he said frowning and making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand 
 the withdrawal of your army beyond the niemen sire replied balashev 
 the niemen repeated napoleon so now you want me to retire beyond the niemen only the niemen repeated napoleon looking straight at balashev 
 the latter bowed his head respectfully 
 instead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from pomerania only a withdrawal beyond the niemen was now demanded napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room 
 you say the demand now is that i am to withdraw beyond the niemen before commencing negotiations but in just the same way two months ago the demand was that i should withdraw beyond the vistula and the oder and yet you are willing to negotiate 
 he went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again stopped in front of balashev balashev noticed that his left leg was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern expression this quivering of his left leg was a thing napoleon was conscious of the vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me he remarked at a later date 
 such demands as to retreat beyond the vistula and oder may be made to a prince of baden but not to me napoleon almost screamed quite to his own surprise if you gave me petersburg and moscow i could not accept such conditions you say i have begun this war but who first joined his army the emperor alexander not i and you offer me negotiations when i have expended millions when you are in alliance with england and when your position is a bad one you offer me negotiations but what is the aim of your alliance with england what has she given you he continued hurriedly evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its possibility but only to prove his own rectitude and power and errors and duplicity 
 the commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate but he had begun talking and the more he talked the less could he control his words 
 the whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and insult alexander just what he had least desired at the commencement of the interview 
 i hear you have made peace with turkey 
 balashev bowed his head affirmatively 
 peace has been concluded he began 
 but napoleon did not let him speak he evidently wanted to do all the talking himself and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone 
 yes i know you have made peace with the turks without obtaining moldavia and wallachia i would have given your sovereign those provinces as i gave him finland yes he went on i promised and would have given the emperor alexander moldavia and wallachia and now he have those splendid provinces yet he might have united them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended russia from the gulf of bothnia to the mouths of the danube catherine the great could not have done more said napoleon growing more and more excited as he paced up and down the room repeating to balashev almost the very words he had used to alexander himself at tilsit all that he would have owed to my friendship oh what a splendid reign he repeated several times then paused drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox lifted it to his nose and greedily sniffed at it 
 what a splendid reign the emperor might have been 
 he looked compassionately at balashev and as soon as the latter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him 
 what could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship demanded napoleon shrugging his shoulders in perplexity but no he has preferred to surround himself with my enemies and with whom with steins armfeldts bennigsens and wintzingerodes stein a traitor expelled from his own country armfeldt a rake and an intriguer wintzingerode a fugitive french subject bennigsen rather more of a soldier than the others but all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in and who should awaken terrible memories in the emperor mind granted that were they competent they might be made use of continued napoleon hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up proving how right and strong he was in his perception the two were one and the same but they are not even that they are neither fit for war nor peace barclay is said to be the most capable of them all but i cannot say so judging by his first movements and what are they doing all these courtiers pfuel proposes armfeldt disputes bennigsen considers and barclay called on to act does not know what to decide on and time passes bringing no result bagration alone is a military man stupid but he has experience a quick eye and resolution and what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd they compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that happens a sovereign should not be with the army unless he is a general said napoleon evidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the emperor he knew how alexander desired to be a military commander 
 the campaign began only a week ago and you even been able to defend vilna you are cut in two and have been driven out of the polish provinces your army is grumbling 
 on the contrary your majesty said balashev hardly able to remember what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with difficulty the troops are burning with eagerness 
 i know everything napoleon interrupted him i know everything i know the number of your battalions as exactly as i know my own you have not two hundred thousand men and i have three times that number i give you my word of honor said napoleon forgetting that his word of honor could carry no weight i give you my word of honor that i have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the vistula the turks will be of no use to you they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you as for the swedes it is their fate to be governed by mad kings their king was insane and they changed him for another bernadotte who promptly went mad for no swede would ally himself with russia unless he were mad 
 napoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose 
 balashev knew how to reply to each of remarks and would have done so he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say something but napoleon always interrupted him to the alleged insanity of the swedes balashev wished to reply that when russia is on her side sweden is practically an island but napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk talk and talk merely to convince himself that he is in the right balashev began to feel uncomfortable as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying but as a man he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized napoleon he knew that none of the words now uttered by napoleon had any significance and that napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses balashev stood with downcast eyes looking at the movements of stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes 
 but what do i care about your allies said napoleon i have allies the poles there are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions and there will be two hundred thousand of them 
 and probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood and that balashev still stood silently before him in the same attitude of submission to fate napoleon abruptly turned round drew close to face and gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands almost shouted 
 know that if you stir up prussia against me wipe it off the map of europe he declared his face pale and distorted by anger and he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other yes i will throw you back beyond the dvina and beyond the dnieper and will against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of europe to allow to be destroyed yes that is what will happen to you that is what you have gained by alienating me and he walked silently several times up and down the room his fat shoulders twitching 
 he put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket took it out again lifted it several times to his nose and stopped in front of balashev he paused looked ironically straight into eyes and said in a quiet voice 
 and yet what a splendid reign your master might have had 
 balashev feeling it incumbent on him to reply said that from the russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light napoleon was silent still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him balashev said that in russia the best results were expected from the war napoleon nodded condescendingly as if to say i know your duty to say that but you believe it yourself i have convinced you 
 when balashev had ended napoleon again took out his snuffbox sniffed at it and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal the door opened a bending respectfully handed the emperor his hat and gloves another brought hima pocket handkerchief napoleon without giving them a glance turned to balashev 
 assure the emperor alexander from me said he taking his hat that i am as devoted to him as before i know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities i will detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter to the emperor 
 and napoleon went quickly to the door everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase

 the utility of going to mass in order to become a revolutionist 
 marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood one sunday when he went to hear mass at at that same chapel of the virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad he placed himself behind a pillar being more and thoughtful than usual on that occasion and knelt down without paying any special heed upon a chair of utrecht velvet on the back of which was inscribed this name 
 monsieur mabeuf warden 
 mass had hardly begun when an old man presented himself and said to marius 
 this is my place sir 
 marius stepped aside promptly and the old man took possession of his chair 
 the mass concluded marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant the old man approached him again and said 
 i beg your pardon sir for having disturbed you a while ago and for again disturbing you at this moment you must have thought me intrusive and i will explain myself 
 there is no need of that sir said marius 
 yes went on the old man i do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me 
 you see i am attached to this place 
 it seems to me that the mass is better from here 
 why 
 i will tell you it is from this place that i have watched a poor brave father come regularly every two or three months for the last ten years since he had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child because he was prevented by family arrangements he came at the hour when he knew that his son would be brought to mass 
 the little one never suspected that his father was there perhaps he did not even know that he had a father poor innocent the father kept behind a pillar so that he might not be seen he gazed at his child and he wept 
 he adored that little fellow poor man 
 i could see that 
 this spot has become sanctified in my sight and i have contracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass 
 i prefer it to the stall to which i have a right in my capacity of warden 
 i knew that unhappy gentleman a little too he had a a wealthy aunt relatives i know exactly what all who threatened to disinherit the child if he the father saw him 
 he sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy some day 
 he was separated from him because of political opinions 
 certainly i approve of political opinions but there are people who do not know where to stop mon dieu a man is not a monster because he was at waterloo a father is not separated from his child for such a reason as that he was one of colonels 
 he is dead i believe 
 he lived at vernon where i have a brother who is a cure and his name was something like pontmarie or montpercy 
 he had a fine on my honor 
 pontmercy suggested marius turning pale 
 precisely pontmercy 
 did you know him 
 sir said marius he was my father 
 the old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed 
 ah you are the child 
 yes true he must be a man by this time 
 well poor child you may say that you had a father who loved you dearly 
 marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings 
 on the following day he said to m gillenormand 
 i have arranged a with some friends 
 will you permit me to be absent for three days 
 four replied his grandfather 
 go and amuse yourself 
 and he said to his daughter in a low tone and with a wink some love affair

 after all that napoleon had said to him those bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken words i will detain you no longer general you shall receive my letter balashev felt convinced that napoleon would not wish to see him and would even avoid another meeting with him an insulted envoy especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger but to his surprise balashev received through duroc an invitation to dine with the emperor that day 
 bessieres caulaincourt and berthier were present at that dinner 
 napoleon met balashev cheerfully and amiably he not only showed no sign of constraint or on account of his outburst that morning but on the contrary tried to reassure balashev it was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake and that in his perception whatever he did was right not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong but because he did it 
 the emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through vilna where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him from all the windows of the streets through which he rode rugs flags and his monogram were displayed and the polish ladies welcoming him waved their handkerchiefs to him 
 at dinner having placed balashev beside him napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if balashev were one of his own courtiers one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his success in the course of conversation he mentioned moscow and questioned balashev about the russian capital not merely as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit but as if convinced that balashev as a russian must be flattered by his curiosity 
 how many inhabitants are there in moscow how many houses is it true that moscow is called holy moscow how many churches are there in moscow he asked 
 and receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches he remarked 
 why such a quantity of churches 
 the russians are very devout replied balashev 
 but a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a people said napoleon turning to caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark 
 balashev respectfully ventured to disagree with the french emperor 
 every country has its own character said he 
 but nowhere in europe is there anything like that said napoleon 
 i beg your pardon returned balashev besides russia there is spain where there are also many churches and monasteries 
 this reply of which hinted at the recent defeats of the french in spain was much appreciated when he related it at court but it was not much appreciated at dinner where it passed unnoticed 
 the uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what tone suggested if there is a point we see it or it is not at all witty their expressions seemed to say so little was his rejoinder appreciated that napoleon did not notice it at all and naively asked balashev through what towns the direct road from there to moscow passed balashev who was on the alert all through the dinner replied that just as all roads lead to rome so all roads lead to moscow there were many roads and among them the road through poltava which charles xii chose balashev involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply but hardly had he uttered the word poltava before caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from petersburg to moscow and of his petersburg reminiscences 
 after dinner they went to drink coffee in study which four days previously had been that of the emperor alexander napoleon sat down toying with his sevres coffee cup and motioned balashev to a chair beside him 
 napoleon was in that mood which more than any reasoned cause makes a man contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend it seemed to him that he was surrounded by men who adored him and he felt convinced that after his dinner balashev too was his friend and worshiper napoleon turned to him with a pleasant though slightly ironic smile 
 they tell me this is the room the emperor alexander occupied strange it general he said evidently not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his superiority to alexander 
 balashev made no reply and bowed and bowed his head in silence 
 yes four days ago in this room wintzingerode and stein were deliberating continued napoleon with the same derisive and smile what i understand he went on is that the emperor alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies that i do not understand has he not thought that i may the same and he turned inquiringly to balashev and evidently this thought turned him back on to the track of his anger which was still fresh in him 
 and let him know that i will do so said napoleon rising and pushing his cup away with his hand drive all his wurttemberg baden and weimar relations out of germany yes drive them out let him prepare an asylum for them in russia 
 balashev bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to make his bow and leave and only listened because he could not help hearing what was said to him napoleon did not notice this expression he treated balashev not as an envoy from his enemy but as a man now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former humiliation 
 and why has the emperor alexander taken command of the armies what is the good of that war is my profession but his business is to reign and not to command armies why has he taken on himself such a responsibility 
 again napoleon brought out his snuffbox paced several times up and down the room in silence and then suddenly and unexpectedly went up to balashev and with a slight smile as confidently quickly and simply as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to balashev he raised his hand to the russian face and taking him by the ear pulled it gently smiling with his lips only 
 to have ear pulled by the emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the french court 
 well adorer and courtier of the emperor alexander why you say anything said he as if it was ridiculous in his presence to be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself napoleon are the horses ready for the general he added with a slight inclination of his head in reply to bow let him have mine he has a long way to go 
 the letter taken by balashev was the last napoleon sent to alexander every detail of the interview was communicated to the russian monarch and the war began

 chapter vi 
 
 the consequences of having met a warden 
 where it was that marius went will be disclosed a little further on 
 marius was absent for three days then he returned to paris went straight to the library of the and asked for the files of the moniteur 
 he read the moniteur he read all the histories of the republic and the empire the memorial de all the memoirs all the newspapers the bulletins the proclamations he devoured everything 
 the first time that he came across his name in the bulletins of the grand army he had a fever for a week he went to see the generals under whom georges pontmercy had served among others comte h mabeuf whom he went to see again told him about the life at vernon the retreat his flowers his solitude 
 marius came to a full knowledge of that rare sweet and sublime man that species of who had been his father 
 in the meanwhile occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all his moments as well as his thoughts he hardly saw the gillenormands at all 
 he made his appearance at meals then they searched for him and he was not to be found 
 father gillenormand smiled 
 bah bah he is just of the age for the girls 
 sometimes the old man added the deuce 
 i thought it was only an affair of gallantry it seems that it is an affair of passion 
 it was a passion in fact 
 marius was on the high road to adoring his father 
 at the same time his ideas underwent an extraordinary change the phases of this change were numerous and successive 
 as this is the history of many minds of our day we think it will prove useful to follow these phases step by step and to indicate them all 
 that history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him 
 the first effect was to dazzle him 
 up to that time the republic the empire had been to him only monstrous words 
 the republic a guillotine in the twilight the empire a sword in the night 
 he had just taken a look at it and where he had expected to find only a chaos of shadows he had beheld with a sort of unprecedented surprise mingled with fear and joy stars sparkling mirabeau vergniaud robespierre camille desmoulins danton and a sun arise napoleon 
 he did not know where he stood 
 he recoiled blinded by the brilliant lights little by little when his astonishment had passed off he grew accustomed to this radiance he contemplated these deeds without dizziness he examined these personages without terror the revolution and the empire presented themselves luminously in perspective before his eye he beheld each of these groups of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts the republic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses the empire in the sovereignty of the french idea imposed on europe he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the revolution and the grand figure of france spring forth from the empire he asserted in his conscience that all this had been good what his dazzled state neglected in this his first far too synthetic estimation we do not think it necessary to point out here it is the state of a mind on the march that we are recording progress is not accomplished in one stage 
 that stated once for all in connection with what precedes as well as with what is to follow we continue 
 he then perceived that up to that moment he had comprehended his country no more than he had comprehended his father 
 he had not known either the one or the other and a sort of voluntary night had obscured his eyes 
 now he saw and on the one hand he admired while on the other he adored 
 he was filled with regret and remorse and he reflected in despair that all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb oh if his father had still been in existence if he had still had him if god in his compassion and his goodness had permitted his father to be still among the living how he would have run how he would have precipitated himself how he would have cried to his father 
 father 
 here i am 
 it is i 
 i have the same heart as thou 
 i am thy son 
 how he would have embraced that white head bathed his hair in tears gazed upon his scar pressed his hands adored his garment kissed his feet 
 oh 
 why had his father died so early before his time before the justice the love of his son had come to him 
 marius had a continual sob in his heart which said to him every moment 
 alas 
 at the same time he became more truly serious more truly grave more sure of his thought and his faith 
 at each instant gleams of the true came to complete his reason 
 an inward growth seemed to be in progress within him 
 he was conscious of a sort of natural enlargement which gave him two things that were new to father and his country 
 as everything opens when one has a key so he explained to himself that which he had hated he penetrated that which he had abhorred henceforth he plainly perceived the providential divine and human sense of the great things which he had been taught to detest and of the great men whom he had been instructed to curse 
 when he reflected on his former opinions which were but those of yesterday and which nevertheless seemed to him already so very ancient he grew indignant yet he smiled 
 from the rehabilitation of his father he naturally passed to the rehabilitation of napoleon 
 but the latter we will confess was not effected without labor 
 from his infancy he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of on bonaparte 
 now all the prejudices of the restoration all its interests all its instincts tended to disfigure napoleon it execrated him even more than it did robespierre 
 it had very cleverly turned to sufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation and the hatred of mothers 
 bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster and in order to paint him to the imagination of the people which as we lately pointed out resembles the imagination of children the party of made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession from that which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is terrible and becomes grotesque from tiberius to the bugaboo 
 thus in speaking of bonaparte one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter provided that hatred lay at the bottom 
 marius had never entertained about that man as he was other ideas in his mind they had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature there was in him a headstrong little man who hated napoleon 
 on reading history on studying him especially in the documents and materials for history the veil which concealed napoleon from the eyes of marius was gradually rent 
 he caught a glimpse of something immense and he suspected that he had been deceived up to that moment on the score of bonaparte as about all the rest each day he saw more distinctly and he set about mounting slowly step by step almost regretfully in the beginning then with intoxication and as though attracted by an irresistible fascination first the sombre steps then the vaguely illuminated steps at last the luminous and splendid steps of enthusiasm 
 one night he was alone in his little chamber near the roof his candle was burning he was reading with his elbows resting on his table close to the open window 
 all sorts of reveries reached him from space and mingled with his thoughts 
 what a spectacle is the night 
 one hears dull sounds without knowing whence they proceed one beholds jupiter which is twelve hundred times larger than the earth glowing like a firebrand the azure is black the stars shine it is formidable 
 he was perusing the bulletins of the grand army those heroic strophes penned on the field of battle there at intervals he beheld his name always the name of the emperor the whole of that great empire presented itself to him he felt a flood swelling and rising within him it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close to him like a breath and whispered in his ear he gradually got into a singular state he thought that he heard drums cannon trumpets the measured tread of battalions the dull and distant gallop of the cavalry from time to time his eyes were raised heavenward and gazed upon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measureless depths of space then they fell upon his book once more and there they beheld other colossal things moving confusedly 
 his heart contracted within him he was in a transport trembling panting 
 all at once without himself knowing what was in him and what impulse he was obeying he sprang to his feet stretched both arms out of the window gazed intently into the gloom the silence the infinite darkness the eternal immensity and exclaimed 
 long live the emperor 
 from that moment forth all was over the ogre of corsica the monster who was the lover of his own actor who took lessons of poisoner of this vanished and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone at an inaccessible height the pale marble phantom of caesar the emperor had been for his father only the captain whom one admires for whom one sacrifices self he was something more to marius 
 he was the predestined constructor of the french group succeeding the roman group in the domination of the universe he was a prodigious architect of a destruction the continuer of charlemagne of louis xi of henry iv of richelieu of louis xiv and of the committee of public safety having his spots no doubt his faults his crimes even being a man that is to say but august in his faults brilliant in his spots powerful in his crime 
 he was the predestined man who had forced all nations to say the great nation 
 he was better than that he was the very incarnation of france conquering europe by the sword which he grasped and the world by the light which he shed 
 marius saw in bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always rise upon the frontier and which will guard the future 
 despot but dictator a despot resulting from a republic and summing up a revolution napoleon became for him the as jesus christ is the 
 it will be perceived that like all new converts to a religion his conversion intoxicated him he hurled himself headlong into adhesion and he went too far 
 his nature was so constructed once on the downward slope it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag 
 fanaticism for the sword took possession of him and complicated in his mind his enthusiasm for the idea he did not perceive that along with genius and he was admitting force that is to say that he was installing in two compartments of his idolatry on the one hand that which is divine on the other that which is brutal 
 in many respects he had set about deceiving himself otherwise 
 he admitted everything there is a way of encountering error while on way to the truth he had a violent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump in the new path which he had entered on in judging the mistakes of the old regime as in measuring the glory of napoleon he neglected the attenuating circumstances 
 at all events a tremendous step had been taken 
 where he had formerly beheld the fall of the monarchy he now saw the advent of france his orientation had changed 
 what had been his east became the west he had turned squarely round 
 all these revolutions were accomplished within him without his family obtaining an inkling of the case 
 when during this mysterious labor he had entirely shed his old bourbon and ultra skin when he had cast off the aristocrat the jacobite and the royalist when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist profoundly democratic and republican he went to an engraver on the quai des orfevres and ordered a hundred cards bearing this name le baron marius pontmercy 
 this was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had taken place in him a change in which everything gravitated round his father 
 only as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with any porter he put them in his pocket 
 by another natural consequence in proportion as he drew nearer to his father to the memory and to the things for which the colonel had fought five and twenty years before he receded from his grandfather 
 we have long ago said that m temper did not please him 
 there already existed between them all the dissonances of the grave young man and the frivolous old man the gayety of geronte shocks and exasperates the melancholy of werther 
 so long as the same political opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both marius had met m gillenormand there as on a bridge 
 when the bridge fell an abyss was formed and then over and above all marius experienced unutterable impulses to revolt when he reflected that it was m gillenormand who had from stupid motives torn him ruthlessly from the colonel thus depriving the father of the child and the child of the father 
 by dint of pity for his father marius had nearly arrived at aversion for his grandfather 
 nothing of this sort however was betrayed on the exterior as we have already said 
 only he grew colder and colder laconic at meals and rare in the house 
 when his aunt scolded him for it he was very gentle and alleged his studies his lectures the examinations etc as a pretext 
 his grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis 
 in love 
 i know all about it 
 from time to time marius absented himself 
 where is it that he goes off like this said his aunt 
 on one of these trips which were always very brief he went to montfermeil in order to obey the injunction which his father had left him and he sought the old sergeant to waterloo the thenardier 
 thenardier had failed the inn was closed and no one knew what had become of him marius was away from the house for four days on this quest 
 he is getting decidedly wild said his grandfather 
 they thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast under his shirt which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon

 after his interview with pierre in moscow prince andrew went to petersburg on business as he told his family but really to meet anatole kuragin whom he felt it necessary to encounter on reaching petersburg he inquired for kuragin but the latter had already left the city pierre had warned his that prince andrew was on his track anatole kuragin promptly obtained an appointment from the minister of war and went to join the army in moldavia while in petersburg prince andrew met kutuzov his former commander who was always well disposed toward him and kutuzov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in moldavia to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief so prince andrew having received an appointment on the headquarters staff left for turkey 
 prince andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge kuragin he thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might compromise the young countess rostova and so he wanted to meet kuragin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel but he again failed to meet kuragin in turkey for soon after prince andrew arrived the latter returned to russia in a new country amid new conditions prince andrew found life easier to bear after his betrothed had broken faith with him which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects the surroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with pierre and which had filled his solitude at bogucharovo and then in switzerland and rome but he even dreaded to recall them and them and the bright and boundless horizons they had revealed he was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past interests and he seized on these the more eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him it was as if that lofty infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him had suddenly turned into a low solid vault that weighed him down in which all was clear but nothing eternal or mysterious 
 of the activities that presented themselves to him army service was the simplest and most familiar as a general on duty on staff he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised kutuzov by his willingness and accuracy in work not having found kuragin in turkey prince andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to russia after him but all the same he knew that however long it might be before he met kuragin despite his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him he knew that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him out any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food and the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged that his rancor was still unspent weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in turkey by means of restless plodding and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity 
 in the year when news of the war with napoleon reached bucharest where kutuzov had been living for two months passing his days and nights with a wallachian woman prince andrew asked kutuzov to transfer him to the western army kutuzov who was already weary of activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness very readily let him go and gave him a mission to barclay de tolly 
 before joining the western army which was then in may encamped at drissa prince andrew visited bald hills which was directly on his way being only two miles off the smolensk highroad during the last three years there had been so many changes in his life he had thought felt and seen so much having traveled both in the east and the west that on reaching bald hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail he entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted sleeping castle the same old stateliness the same cleanliness the same stillness reigned there and inside there was the same furniture the same walls sounds and smell and the same timid faces only somewhat older princess mary was still the same timid plain maiden getting on in years uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant suffering mademoiselle bourienne was the same coquettish girl enjoying every moment of her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future she had merely become more prince andrew thought dessalles the tutor he had brought from switzerland was wearing a coat of russian cut and talking broken russian to the servants but was still the same narrowly intelligent conscientious and pedantic preceptor the old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth in character he was the same as ever only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was happening in the world little nicholas alone had changed he had grown become rosier had curly dark hair and when merry and laughing quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do he alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted sleeping castle but though externally all remained as of old the inner relations of all these people had changed since prince andrew had seen them last the household was divided into two alien and hostile camps who changed their habits for his sake and only met because he was there to the one camp belonged the old prince madmoiselle bourienne and the architect to the other princess mary dessalles little nicholas and all the old nurses and maids 
 during his stay at bald hills all the family dined together but they were ill at ease and prince andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all feel awkward involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day he was taciturn and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner in the evening when prince andrew went to him and trying to rouse him began to tell him of the young count campaign the old prince began unexpectedly to talk about princess mary blaming her for her superstitions and her dislike of mademoiselle bourienne who he said was the only person really attached to him 
 the old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of princess mary that she purposely worried and irritated him and that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little prince nicholas the old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was very hard but he also knew that he could not help tormenting her and that she deserved it why does prince andrew who sees this say nothing to me about his sister does he think me a scoundrel or an old fool who without any reason keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this frenchwoman to himself he understand so i must explain it and he must hear me out thought the old prince and he began explaining why he could not put up with his unreasonable character 
 if you ask me said prince andrew without looking up he was censuring his father for the first time in his life i did not wish to speak about it but as you ask me i will give you my frank opinion if there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and mary i blame her for it at all i know how she loves and respects you since you ask me continued prince andrew becoming irritable as he was always liable to do of late i can only say that if there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman who is not fit to be my companion 
 the old man at first stared fixedly at his son and an unnatural smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which prince andrew could not get accustomed 
 what companion my dear boy eh already been talking it over eh 
 father i did not want to judge said prince andrew in a hard and bitter tone but you challenged me and i have said and always shall say that mary is not to blame but those to blame the one to blame is that frenchwoman 
 ah he has passed judgment passed judgement said the old man in a low voice and as it seemed to prince andrew with some embarrassment but then he suddenly jumped up and cried be off be off let not a trace of you remain here 
 prince andrew wished to leave at once but princess mary persuaded him to stay another day that day he did not see his father who did not leave his room and admitted no one but mademoiselle bourienne and tikhon but asked several times whether his son had gone next day before leaving prince andrew went to his rooms the boy like his mother and glowing with health sat on his knee and prince andrew began telling him the story of bluebeard but fell into a reverie without finishing the story he thought not of this pretty child his son whom he held on his knee but of himself he sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him and was horrified to find neither what meant still more to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on his knee 
 well go on said his son 
 prince andrew without replying put him down from his knee and went out of the room 
 as soon as prince andrew had given up his daily occupations and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been happy weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon as possible 
 so decided to go andrew asked his sister 
 thank god that i can replied prince andrew i am very sorry you 
 why do you say that replied princess mary why do you say that when you are going to this terrible war and he is so old mademoiselle bourienne says he has been asking about you 
 as soon as she began to speak of that her lips trembled and her tears began to fall prince andrew turned away and began pacing the room 
 ah my god my god when one thinks who and what what trash can cause people misery he said with a malignity that alarmed princess mary 
 she understood that when speaking of trash he referred not only to mademoiselle bourienne the cause of her misery but also to the man who had ruined his own happiness 
 andrew one thing i beg i entreat of you she said touching his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears i understand you she looked down imagine that sorrow is the work of men men are his tools she looked a little above prince head with the confident accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs sorrow is sent by him not by men men are his instruments they are not to blame if you think someone has wronged you forget it and forgive we have no right to punish and then you will know the happiness of forgiving 
 if i were a woman i would do so mary that is a virtue but a man should not and cannot forgive and forget he replied and though till that moment he had not been thinking of kuragin all his unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart 
 if mary is already persuading me forgive it means that i ought long ago to have punished him he thought and giving her no further reply he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet kuragin who he knew was now in the army 
 princess mary begged him to stay one day more saying that she knew how unhappy her father would be if andrew left without being reconciled to him but prince andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again from the army and would certainly write to his father but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become 
 andrew remember that misfortunes come from god and men are never to blame were the last words he heard from his sister when he took leave of her 
 then it must be so thought prince andrew as he drove out of the avenue from the house at bald hills she poor innocent creature is left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits the old man feels he is guilty but cannot change himself my boy is growing up and rejoices in life in which like everybody else he will deceive or be deceived and i am off to the army why i myself know i want to meet that man whom i despise so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me 
 these conditions of life had been the same before but then they were all connected while now they had all tumbled to pieces only senseless things lacking coherence presented themselves one after another to prince mind

 book grandfather and the grandson 
 chapter vii 
 
 we have mentioned a lancer 
 he was a of m gillenormand on the paternal side who led a garrison life outside the family and far from the domestic hearth 
 lieutenant theodule gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions required to make what is called a fine officer he had a waist a victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustache in a hook 
 he visited paris very rarely and so rarely that marius had never seen him the cousins knew each other only by name 
 we think we have said that theodule was the favorite of aunt gillenormand who preferred him because she did not see him 
 not seeing people permits one to attribute to them all possible perfections 
 one morning mademoiselle gillenormand the elder returned to her apartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing marius had just asked his permission to take a little trip adding that he meant to set out that very evening go had been his reply and m gillenormand had added in an aside as he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead 
 here he is passing the night out again mademoiselle gillenormand had ascended to her chamber greatly puzzled and on the staircase had dropped this exclamation 
 this is too this interrogation 
 but where is it that he goes she espied some adventure of the heart more or less illicit a woman in the shadow a rendezvous a mystery and she would not have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair tasting a mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal sainted souls do not detest this 
 there is some curiosity about scandal in the secret compartments of bigotry 
 so she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history 
 in order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond her wont she took refuge in her talents and set about scalloping with one layer of cotton after another one of those embroideries of the empire and the restoration in which there are numerous the work was clumsy the worker cross 
 she had been seated at this for several hours when the door opened 
 mademoiselle gillenormand raised her nose lieutenant theodule stood before her making the regulation salute she uttered a cry of delight 
 one may be old one may be a prude one may be pious one may be an aunt but it is always agreeable to see a lancer enter chamber 
 you here theodule she exclaimed 
 on my way through town aunt 
 embrace me 
 here goes said theodule 
 and he kissed her 
 aunt gillenormand went to her and opened it 
 you will remain with us a week at least 
 i leave this very evening aunt 
 it is not possible 
 mathematically 
 remain my little theodule i beseech you 
 my heart says yes but my orders say no the matter is simple they are changing our garrison we have been at melun we are being transferred to gaillon 
 it is necessary to pass through paris in order to get from the old post to the new one 
 i said 
 i am going to see my aunt 
 here is something for your trouble 
 and she put ten louis into his hand 
 for my pleasure you mean to say my dear aunt 
 theodule kissed her again and she experienced the joy of having some of the skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform 
 are you making the journey on horseback with your regiment she asked him 
 no aunt 
 i wanted to see you 
 i have special permission my servant is taking my horse i am travelling by diligence and by the way i want to ask you something 
 what is it 
 is my cousin marius pontmercy travelling so too 
 how do you know that said his aunt suddenly pricked to the quick with a lively curiosity 
 on my arrival i went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupe 
 well 
 a traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial i saw his name on the card 
 what name 
 marius pontmercy 
 the wicked fellow exclaimed his aunt 
 ah your cousin is not a steady lad like yourself 
 to think that he is to pass the night in a diligence 
 just as i am going to do 
 but is your duty in his case it is wildness 
 bosh said theodule 
 here an event occurred to mademoiselle gillenormand the elder an idea struck her 
 if she had been a man she would have slapped her brow 
 she apostrophized theodule 
 are you aware whether your cousin knows you 
 no i have seen him but he has never deigned to notice me 
 so you are going to travel together 
 he in the imperial i in the coupe 
 where does this diligence run 
 to andelys 
 then that is where marius is going 
 unless like myself he should stop on the way 
 i get down at vernon in order to take the branch coach for gaillon 
 i know nothing of marius plan of travel 
 marius what an ugly name what possessed them to name him marius while you at least are called theodule 
 i would rather be called alfred said the officer 
 listen theodule 
 i am listening aunt 
 pay attention 
 i am paying attention 
 you understand 
 yes 
 well marius absents himself 
 eh eh 
 he travels 
 ah ah 
 he spends the night out 
 oh oh 
 we should like to know what there is behind all this 
 theodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze 
 some petticoat or other 
 and with that inward laugh which denotes certainty he added 
 a lass 
 that is evident exclaimed his aunt who thought she heard m gillenormand speaking and who felt her conviction become irresistible at that word fillette accentuated in almost the very same fashion by the granduncle and the grandnephew 
 she resumed 
 do us a favor 
 follow marius a little 
 he does not know you it will be easy 
 since a lass there is try to get a sight of her you must write us the tale 
 it will amuse his grandfather 
 theodule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying but he was much touched by the ten louis and he thought he saw a chance for a possible sequel 
 he accepted the commission and said as you please aunt 
 and he added in an aside to himself 
 here i am a duenna 
 mademoiselle gillenormand embraced him 
 you are not the man to play such pranks theodule 
 you obey discipline you are the slave of orders you are a man of scruples and duty and you would not quit your family to go and see a creature 
 the lancer made the pleased grimace of cartouche when praised for his probity 
 marius on the evening following this dialogue mounted the diligence without suspecting that he was watched 
 as for the watcher the first thing he did was to fall asleep 
 his slumber was complete and conscientious 
 argus snored all night long 
 at daybreak the conductor of the diligence shouted 
 vernon relay of vernon 
 travellers for vernon 
 and lieutenant theodule woke 
 good he growled still half asleep this is where i get out 
 then as his memory cleared by degrees the effect of waking he recalled his aunt the ten louis and the account which he had undertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of marius this set him to laughing 
 perhaps he is no longer in the coach he thought as he rebuttoned the waistcoat of his undress uniform 
 he may have stopped at poissy he may have stopped at triel if he did not get out at meulan he may have got out at mantes unless he got out at rolleboise or if he did not go on as far as pacy with the choice of turning to the left at evreus or to the right at run after him aunty 
 what the devil am i to write to that good old soul 
 at that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial made its appearance at the window of the coupe 
 can that be marius said the lieutenant 
 it was marius 
 a little peasant girl all entangled with the horses and the postilions at the end of the vehicle was offering flowers to the travellers give your ladies flowers she cried 
 marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat basket 
 come now said theodule leaping down from the coupe this piques my curiosity 
 who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to she must be a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet i want to see her 
 and no longer in pursuance of orders but from personal curiosity like dogs who hunt on their own account he set out to follow marius 
 marius paid no attention to theodule 
 elegant women descended from the diligence he did not glance at them 
 he seemed to see nothing around him 
 he is pretty deeply in love thought theodule 
 marius directed his steps towards the church 
 capital said theodule to himself 
 rendezvous seasoned with a bit of mass are the best sort 
 nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes over the good head 
 on arriving at the church marius did not enter it but skirted the apse 
 he disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse 
 the rendezvous is appointed outside said theodule 
 have a look at the lass 
 and he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which marius had turned 
 on arriving there he halted in amazement 
 marius with his forehead clasped in his hands was kneeling upon the grass on a grave 
 he had strewn his bouquet there 
 at the extremity of the grave on a little swelling which marked the head there stood a cross of black wood with this name in white letters colonel baron pontmercy 
 marius sobs were audible 
 the lass was a grave

 book nine 
 chapter ix 
 
 prince andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of june the first army with which was the emperor occupied the fortified camp at drissa the second army was retreating trying to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by large french forces everyone was dissatisfied with the general course of affairs in the russian army but no one anticipated any danger of invasion of the russian provinces and no one thought the war would extend farther than the western the polish provinces 
 prince andrew found barclay de tolly to whom he had been assigned on the bank of the drissa as there was not a single town or large village in the vicinity of the camp the immense number of generals and courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the villages on both sides of the river over a radius of six miles barclay de tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the emperor he received bolkonski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he would mention him to the emperor for a decision as to his employment but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff anatole kuragin whom prince andrew had hoped to find with the army was not there he had gone to petersburg but prince andrew was glad to hear this his mind was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting a gigantic war and he was glad to be free for a while from the distraction caused by the thought of kuragin during the first four days while no duties were required of him prince andrew rode round the whole fortified camp and by the aid of his own knowledge and by talks with experts tried to form a definite opinion about it but the question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained for him undecided already from his military experience and what he had seen in the austrian campaign he had come to the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy that cannot be foreseen are met and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled to clear up this last point for himself prince andrew utilizing his position and acquaintances tried to fathom the character of the control of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it and he deduced for himself the following of the state of affairs 
 while the emperor had still been at vilna the forces had been divided into three armies first the army under barclay de tolly secondly the army under bagration and thirdly the one commanded by tormasov the emperor was with the first army but not as commander in chief in the orders issued it was stated not that the emperor would take command but only that he would be with the army the emperor moreover had with him not a commander in staff but the imperial headquarters staff in attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff quartermaster general prince volkonski as well as generals imperial diplomatic officials and a large number of foreigners but not the army staff besides these there were in attendance on the emperor without any definite appointments arakcheev the of war count bennigsen the senior general in rank the grand duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich count rumyantsev the chancellor stein a former prussian minister armfeldt a swedish general pfuel the chief author of the plan of campaign paulucci an adjutant general and sardinian emigre wolzogen and many others though these men had no military appointment in the army their position gave them influence and often a corps commander or even the commander in chief did not know in what capacity he was questioned by bennigsen the grand duke arakcheev or prince volkonski or was given this or that advice and did not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated from the man who gave it or from the emperor and whether it had to be executed or not but this was only the external condition the essential significance of the presence of the emperor and of all these people from a point of view and in an vicinity all became courtiers was clear to everyone it was this the emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief but disposed of all the armies the men around him were his assistants arakcheev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the bodyguard bennigsen was a landlord in the vilna province who appeared to be doing the honors of the district but was in reality a good general useful as an adviser and ready at hand to replace barclay the grand duke was there because it suited him to be the stein was there because his advice was useful and the emperor alexander held him in high esteem personally armfeldt virulently hated napoleon and was a general full of a quality that always influenced alexander paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech the adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the emperor and lastly and chiefly pfuel was there because he had drawn up the plan of campaign against napoleon and having induced alexander to believe in the efficacy of that plan was directing the whole business of the war with pfuel was wolzogen who expressed thoughts in a more comprehensible way than pfuel himself who was a harsh bookish theorist to the point of despising everyone else was able to do 
 besides these russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected ideas every day especially the foreigners who did so with a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their own there were many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals were there 
 among the opinions and voices in this immense restless brilliant and proud sphere prince andrew noticed the following sharply defined subdivisions of and parties 
 the first party consisted of pfuel and his adherents military theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws laws of oblique movements outflankings and so forth pfuel and his adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise laws defined by a of war and they saw only barbarism ignorance or evil intention in every deviation from that theory to this party belonged the foreign nobles wolzogen wintzingerode and others chiefly germans 
 the second party was directly opposed to the first one extreme as always happens was met by representatives of the other the members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from vilna into poland and freedom from all prearranged plans besides being advocates of bold action this section also represented nationalism which made them still more in the dispute they were russians bagration ermolov who was beginning to come to the front and others at that time a famous joke of was being circulated that as a great favor he had petitioned the emperor to make him a german the men of that party remembering suvorov said that what one had to do was not to reason or stick pins into maps but to fight beat the enemy keep him out of russia and not let the army get discouraged 
 to the third party in which the emperor had most confidence belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two the members of this party chiefly civilians and to whom arakcheev belonged thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say they said that undoubtedly war particularly against such a genius as bonaparte they called him bonaparte now needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect pfuel was a genius but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one sided and therefore one should not trust them absolutely but should also listen to what opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say and then choose a middle course they insisted on the retention of the camp at drissa according to plan but on changing the movements of the other armies though by this course neither one aim nor the other could be attained yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party 
 of a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the tsarevich who could not forget his disillusionment at austerlitz where he had ridden out at the head of the guards in his casque and cavalry uniform as to a review expecting to crush the french gallantly but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid the general confusion the men of this party had both the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions they feared napoleon recognized his strength and their own weakness and frankly said so they said nothing but sorrow shame and ruin will come of all this we have abandoned vilna and vitebsk and shall abandon drissa the only reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible before we are turned out of petersburg 
 this view was very general in the upper army circles and found support also in petersburg and from the chancellor rumyantsev who for other reasons of state was in favor of peace 
 the fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of barclay de tolly not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in chief be he what he may they always began like that he is an honest practical man and we have nobody better give him real power for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command and he will show what he can do as he did in finland if our army is well organized and strong and has withdrawn to drissa without suffering any defeats we owe this entirely to barclay if barclay is now to be superseded by bennigsen all will be lost for bennigsen showed his incapacity already in 
 the sixth party the bennigsenites said on the contrary that at any rate there was no one more active and experienced than bennigsen and twist about as you may you will have to come to bennigsen eventually let the others make mistakes now said they arguing that our retirement to drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders the more mistakes that are made the better it will at any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this what is wanted is not some barclay or other but a man like bennigsen who made his mark in and to whom napoleon himself did justice a man whose authority would be willingly recognized and bennigsen is the only such man 
 the seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be found especially around young sovereigns and of whom there were particularly many round alexander generals and imperial passionately devoted to the emperor not merely as a monarch but as a man adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly as rostov had done in and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human capabilities as well these men though enchanted with the sovereign for refusing the command of the army yet blamed him for such excessive modesty and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place himself at the head of the army gather round him a commander in staff and consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary would himself lead the troops whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest pitch 
 the eighth and largest group which in its enormous numbers was to the others as to one consisted of men who desired neither peace nor war neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the drissa or anywhere else neither barclay nor the emperor neither pfuel nor bennigsen but only the one most essential thing as much advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible in the troubled waters of conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the headquarters it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times a man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would today agree with pfuel tomorrow with his opponent and the day after merely to avoid responsibility or to please the emperor would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter another who wished to gain some advantage would attract the attention by loudly advocating the very thing the emperor had hinted at the day before and would dispute and shout at the council beating his breast and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels thereby proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good a third in the absence of opponents between two councils would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services well knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him a fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the eye a fifth to achieve his aim of dining with the emperor would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct 
 all the men of this party were fishing for rubles decorations and promotions and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial favor and directly they noticed it turning in any direction this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way so that it was all the harder for the emperor to turn it elsewhere amid the uncertainties of the position with the menace of serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything amid this vortex of intrigue egotism conflict of views and feelings and the diversity of race among these people this eighth and largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and obscurity to the common task whatever question arose a swarm of these drones without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme flew over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly 
 from among all these parties just at the time prince andrew reached the army another a ninth party was being formed and was beginning to raise its voice this was the party of the elders reasonable men experienced and capable in state affairs who without sharing any of those conflicting opinions were able to take a detached view of what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this muddle indecision intricacy and weakness 
 the men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted chiefly from the presence in the army with his military court and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite conditional and unsteady fluctuation of relations which is in place at court but harmful in an army that a sovereign should reign but not command the army and that the only way out of the position would be for the emperor and his court to leave the army that the mere presence of the emperor paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his personal safety and that the worst commander in chief if independent would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch 
 just at the time prince andrew was living unoccupied at drissa shishkov the secretary of state and one of the chief representatives of this party wrote a letter to the emperor which arakcheev and balashev agreed to sign in this letter availing himself of permission given him by the emperor to discuss the general course of affairs he respectfully suggested on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the people of the capital that the emperor should leave the army 
 that arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to defend their country the very incitement which was the chief cause of triumph in so far as it was produced by the personal presence in moscow was suggested to the emperor and accepted by him as a pretext for quitting the army

 chapter viii 
 
 marble against granite 
 it was hither that marius had come on the first occasion of his absenting himself from paris 
 it was hither that he had come every time that m gillenormand had said 
 he is sleeping out 
 lieutenant theodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this unexpected encounter with a sepulchre he experienced a singular and disagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing and which was composed of respect for the tomb mingled with respect for the colonel 
 he retreated leaving marius alone in the cemetery and there was discipline in this retreat 
 death appeared to him with large epaulets and he almost made the military salute to him not knowing what to write to his aunt he decided not to write at all and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by theodule as to the love affairs of marius if by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance the scene at vernon had not had an almost immediate at paris 
 marius returned from vernon on the third day in the middle of the morning descended at his door and wearied by the two nights spent in the diligence and feeling the need of repairing his loss of sleep by an hour at the he mounted rapidly to his chamber took merely time enough to throw off his and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck and went off to the bath 
 who had risen betimes like all old men in good health had heard his entrance and had made haste to climb as quickly as his old legs permitted the stairs to the upper story where marius lived in order to embrace him and to question him while so doing and to find out where he had been 
 but the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to ascend and when father gillenormand entered the attic marius was no longer there 
 the bed had not been disturbed and on the bed lay outspread but not defiantly the and the black ribbon 
 i like this better said m gillenormand 
 and a moment later he made his entrance into the salon where mademoiselle gillenormand was already seated busily embroidering her 
 the entrance was a triumphant one 
 m gillenormand held in one hand the and in the other the and exclaimed 
 victory 
 we are about to penetrate the mystery 
 we are going to learn the most minute details we are going to lay our finger on the debaucheries of our sly friend 
 here we have the romance itself i have the portrait 
 in fact a case of black shagreen resembling a medallion portrait was suspended from the ribbon 
 the old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening it with that air of enjoyment rapture and wrath with which a poor hungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him pass under his very nose 
 for this evidently is a portrait 
 i know all about such things that is worn tenderly on the heart 
 how stupid they are some abominable fright that will make us shudder probably 
 young men have such bad taste nowadays 
 let us see father said the old spinster 
 the case opened by the pressure of a spring 
 they found in it nothing but a carefully folded paper 
 from the same to the same said m gillenormand bursting with laughter 
 i know what it is 
 a 
 ah let us read it said the aunt 
 and she put on her spectacles 
 they unfolded the paper and read as follows 
 for my emperor made me a baron on the battlefield of waterloo 
 since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it that he will be worthy of it is a matter of course 
 the feelings of father and daughter cannot be described 
 they felt chilled as by the breath of a they did not exchange a word 
 only m gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking to himself 
 it is the handwriting 
 the aunt examined the paper turned it about in all directions then put it back in its case 
 at the same moment a little oblong packet enveloped in blue paper fell from one of the pockets of the mademoiselle gillenormand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper 
 it contained marius hundred cards 
 she handed one of them to m gillenormand who read 
 le baron marius pontmercy 
 the old man rang the bell 
 nicolette came 
 m gillenormand took the ribbon the case and the coat flung them all on the floor in the middle of the room and said 
 carry those duds away 
 a full hour passed in the most profound silence 
 the old man and the old spinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other and were thinking each on his own account the same things in all probability 
 at the expiration of this hour aunt gillenormand pretty state of things 
 a few moments later marius made his appearance 
 he entered even before he had crossed the threshold he saw his grandfather holding one of his own cards in his hand and on catching sight of him the latter exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was something crushing 
 well well well well well so you are a baron now 
 i present you my compliments 
 what is the meaning of this 
 marius reddened slightly and replied 
 it means that i am the son of my father 
 m gillenormand ceased to laugh and said harshly 
 i am your father 
 my father retorted marius with downcast eyes and a severe air was a humble and heroic man who served the republic and france gloriously who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made who lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century beneath and bullets in snow and mud by day beneath rain at night who captured two flags who received twenty wounds who died forgotten and abandoned and who never committed but one mistake which was to love too fondly two ingrates his country and myself 
 this was more than m gillenormand could bear to hear 
 at the word republic he rose or to speak more correctly he sprang to his feet 
 every word that marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the old royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand 
 from a dull hue he had turned red from red purple and from purple 
 marius he cried 
 abominable child 
 i do not know what your father was 
 i do not wish to know 
 i know nothing about that and i do not know him 
 but what i do know is that there never was anything but scoundrels among those men 
 they were all rascals assassins thieves 
 i say all 
 i say all i know not one 
 i say all 
 do you hear me marius 
 see here you are no more a baron than my slipper is 
 they were all bandits in the service of robespierre 
 all who served were brigands 
 they were all traitors who betrayed betrayed betrayed their legitimate king 
 all cowards who fled before the prussians and the english at waterloo 
 that is what i do know whether monsieur your father comes in that category i do not know i am sorry for it so much the worse your humble servant 
 in his turn it was marius who was the firebrand and m gillenormand who was the bellows 
 marius quivered in every limb he did not know what would happen next his brain was on fire 
 he was the priest who beholds all his sacred wafers cast to the winds the fakir who beholds a spit upon his idol 
 it could not be that such things had been uttered in his presence what was he to do 
 his father had just been trampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence but by whom 
 by his grandfather how was he to avenge the one without outraging the other it was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was equally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged on the one hand was a sacred grave on the other hoary locks 
 he stood there for several moments staggering as though intoxicated with all this whirlwind dashing through his head then he raised his eyes gazed fixedly at his grandfather and cried in a voice of thunder 
 down with the bourbons and that great hog of a louis xviii 
 louis xviii 
 had been dead for four years but it was all the same to him 
 the old man who had been crimson turned whiter than his hair he wheeled round towards a bust of m le duc de berry which stood on the and made a profound bow with a sort of peculiar majesty 
 then he paced twice slowly and in silence from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace traversing the whole length of the room and making the polished floor creak as though he had been a stone statue walking 
 on his second turn he bent over his daughter who was watching this encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb and said to her with a smile that was almost calm 
 a baron like this gentleman and a bourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof 
 and drawing himself up all at once pallid trembling terrible with his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath he extended his arm towards marius and shouted to him 
 be off 
 marius left the house 
 on the following day m gillenormand said to his daughter 
 you will send sixty pistoles every six months to that and you will never mention his name to me 
 having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of and not knowing what to do with it he continued to address his daughter as you instead of thou for the next three months 
 marius on his side had gone forth in indignation 
 there was one circumstance which it must be admitted aggravated his exasperation there are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic dramas 
 they augment the grievances in such cases although in reality the wrongs are not increased by them while carrying marius duds precipitately to his chamber at his command nicolette had inadvertently let fall probably on the attic staircase which was dark that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper penned by the colonel neither paper nor case could afterwards be found 
 marius was convinced that monsieur that day forth he never alluded to him flung his testament in the fire 
 he knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written and consequently nothing was lost 
 but the paper the writing that sacred that was his very heart what had been done with it 
 marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going and without knowing where with thirty francs his watch and a few clothes in a he had entered a had engaged it by the hour and had directed his course at towards the latin quarter

 this letter had not yet been presented to the emperor when barclay one day at dinner informed bolkonski that the sovereign wished to see him personally to question him about turkey and that prince andrew was to present himself at quarters at six that evening 
 news was received at the quarters that very day of a fresh movement by napoleon which might endanger the army news subsequently found to be false and that morning colonel michaud had ridden round the drissa fortifications with the emperor and had pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed by pfuel and till then considered a of tactical science which would ensure destruction was an absurdity threatening the destruction of the russian army 
 prince andrew arrived at quarters a country house of moderate size situated on the very banks of the river neither bennigsen nor the emperor was there but chernyshev the received bolkonski and informed him that the emperor accompanied by general bennigsen and marquis paulucci had gone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications of the drissa camp of the suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt 
 chernyshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a french novel in his hand this room had probably been a music room there was still an organ in it on which some rugs were piled and in one corner stood the folding bedstead of adjutant this adjutant was also there and sat dozing on the bedding evidently exhausted by work or by feasting two doors led from the room one straight on into what had been the drawing room and another on the right to the study through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in german and occasionally in french in that drawing room were gathered by the wish not a military council the emperor preferred indefiniteness but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending difficulties it was not a council of war but as it were a council to elucidate certain questions for the emperor personally to this semicouncil had been invited the swedish general armfeldt adjutant general wolzogen wintzingerode whom napoleon had referred to as a renegade french subject michaud toll count stein who was not a military man at all and pfuel himself who as prince andrew had heard was the mainspring of the whole affair prince andrew had an opportunity of getting a good look at him for pfuel arrived soon after himself and in passing through to the drawing room stopped a minute to speak to chernyshev 
 at first sight pfuel in his uniform of a russian general which fitted him badly like a fancy costume seemed familiar to prince andrew though he saw him now for the first time there was about him something of weyrother mack and schmidt and many other german whom prince andrew had seen in but he was more typical than any of them prince andrew had never yet seen a german theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to such an extent 
 pfuel was short and very thin but of coarse robust build broad in the hips and with prominent shoulder blades his face was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set his hair had evidently been hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples but stuck up behind in quaint little tufts he entered the room looking restlessly and angrily around as if afraid of everything in that large apartment awkwardly holding up his sword he addressed chernyshev and asked in german where the emperor was one could see that he wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as possible finish with the bows and greetings and sit down to business in front of a map where he would feel at home he nodded hurriedly in reply to chernyshev and smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he pfuel had planned in accord with his theory he muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice as germans do it might have been stupid fellow or the whole affair will be ruined or something absurd will come of it prince andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed on but chernyshev introduced him to pfuel remarking that prince andrew was just back from turkey where the war had terminated so fortunately pfuel barely glanced not so much at prince andrew as past him and said with a laugh that must have been a fine tactical war and laughing contemptuously went on into the room from which the sound of voices was heard 
 pfuel always inclined to be irritably sarcastic was particularly disturbed that day evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect and criticize his camp in his absence from this short interview with pfuel prince andrew thanks to his austerlitz experiences was able to form a clear conception of the man pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably men to the point of martyrdom as only germans are because only germans are on the basis of an abstract notion science that is the supposed knowledge of absolute truth a frenchman is because he regards himself personally both in mind and body as irresistibly attractive to men and women an englishman is as being a citizen of the state in the world and therefore as an englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an englishman is undoubtedly correct an italian is because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people a russian is just because he knows nothing does not want to know anything since he does not believe that anything can be known the is worst of all stronger and more repulsive than any other because he imagines that he knows the truth science which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth 
 pfuel was evidently of that sort he had a science the theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of frederick the wars and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous monstrous collisions in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars they did not accord with the theory and therefore could not serve as material for science 
 in pfuel had been one of those responsible for the plan of campaign that ended in jena and auerstadt but he did not see the least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war on the contrary the deviations made from his theory were in his opinion the sole cause of the whole disaster and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark there i said the whole affair would go to the devil pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the object its practical application his love of theory made him hate everything practical and he would not listen to it he was even pleased by failures for failures resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his theory 
 he said a few words to prince andrew and chernyshev about the present war with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong and who is not displeased that it should be so the unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently 
 he passed into the next room and the deep querulous sounds of his voice were at once heard from there
