 but why you got occlumency lessons any more said hermione frowning 
 
 told you harry muttered snape reckons i can carry on by myself now got the basics 
 
 so stopped having funny dreams said hermione sceptically 
 
 pretty much said harry not looking at her 
 
 well i think snape should stop until absolutely sure you can control them said hermione indignantly harry i think you should go back to him and ask 
 
 no said harry forcefully just drop it hermione ok 
 
 it was the first day of the easter holidays and hermione as was her custom had spent a large part of the day drawing up revision timetables for the three of them harry and ron had let her do it it was easier than arguing with her and in any case they might come in useful 
 
 ron had been startled to discover there were only six weeks left until their exams 
 
 how can that come as a shock hermione demanded as she tapped each little square on timetable with her wand so that it flashed a different colour according to its subject 
 
 i dunno said ron been a lot going on 
 
 well there you are she said handing him his timetable if you follow that you should do fine 
 
 ron looked down it gloomily but then brightened 
 
 given me an evening off every week 
 
 for quidditch practice said hermione 
 
 the smile faded from face 
 
 the point he said dully got about as much chance of winning the quidditch cup this year as got of becoming minister for magic 
 
 hermione said nothing she was looking at harry who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while crookshanks pawed at his hand trying to get his ears scratched 
 
 wrong harry 
 
 what he said quickly nothing 
 
 he seized his copy of defensive magical theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under chair 
 
 i saw cho earlier said hermione tentatively she looked really miserable too have you two had a row again 
 
 whaoh yeah we have said harry seizing gratefully on the excuse 
 
 what about 
 
 that sneak friend of hers marietta said harry 
 
 yeah well i blame you said ron angrily setting down his revision timetable if it been for her 
 
 ron went into a rant about marietta edgecombe which harry found helpful all he had to do was look angry nod and say yeah and right whenever ron drew breath leaving his mind free to dwell ever more miserably on what he had seen in the pensieve 
 
 he felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside he had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions snape cast on his character people like hagrid and sirius told harry how wonderful his father had been yeah well look what sirius was like himself said a nagging voice inside head he was as bad he yes he had once overheard professor mcgonagall saying that his father and sirius had been troublemakers at school but she had described them as forerunners of the weasley twins and harry could not imagine fred and george dangling someone for the fun of it not unless they really loathed them perhaps malfoy or somebody who really deserved it 
 
 harry tried to make a case for snape having deserved what he had suffered at hands but lily asked he done to you and james replied more the fact that he exists if you know what i mean james started it all simply because sirius had said he was bored harry remembered lupin saying back in grimmauld place that dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over james and sirius but in the pensieve he had sat there and let it all happen 
 
 harry kept reminding himself that lily had intervened his mother had been decent yet the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at james disturbed him quite as much as anything else she had clearly loathed james and harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married once or twice he even wondered whether james had forced her into it 
 
 for nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort of inspiration whenever someone had told him he was like james he had glowed with pride inside and now now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him 
 
 the weather grew breezier brighter and warmer as the easter holidays passed but harry along with the rest of the fifth and was trapped inside revising traipsing back and forth to the library harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams and as his fellow gryffindors were sick of studying themselves his excuse went unchallenged 
 
 harry talking to you can you hear me 
 
 huh 
 
 he looked round ginny weasley looking very windswept had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone it was late on sunday evening hermione had gone back to gryffindor tower to revise ancient runes and ron had quidditch practice 
 
 oh hi said harry pulling his books towards him how come not at practice 
 
 over said ginny ron had to take jack sloper up to the hospital wing 
 
 why 
 
 well not sure but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat she sighed heavily anyway a package just arrived only just got through new screening process 
 
 she hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly there was a scribbled note across it in red ink reading inspected and passed by the hogwarts high inquisitor 
 
 easter eggs from mum said ginny one for you there you go 
 
 she handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small iced snitches and according to the packaging containing a bag of fizzing whizzbees harry looked at it for a moment then to his horror felt a lump rise in his throat 
 
 are you ok harry ginny asked quietly 
 
 yeah fine said harry gruffly the lump in his throat was painful he did not understand why an easter egg should have made him feel like this 
 
 you seem really down lately ginny persisted you know sure if you just talked to cho 
 
 not cho i want to talk to said harry brusquely 
 
 who is it then asked ginny watching him closely 
 
 i 
 
 he glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening madam pince was several shelves away stamping out a pile cf books for a hannah abbott 
 
 i wish i could talk to sirius he muttered but i know i 
 
 ginny continued to watch him thoughtfully more to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any harry unwrapped his easter egg broke off a large bit and put it into his mouth 
 
 well said ginny slowly helping herself to a bit of egg too if you really want to talk to sirius i expect we could think of a way to do it 
 
 come on said harry dully with umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail 
 
 the thing about growing up with fred and george said ginny thoughtfully is that you sort of start thinking possible if got enough nerve 
 
 harry looked at her perhaps it was the effect of the chocolatelupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementorsor simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week but he felt a bit more hopeful 
 
 what do you think you are doing 
 
 oh damn whispered ginny jumping to her feet i forgot 
 
 madam pince was swooping down on them her shrivelled face contorted with rage 
 
 chocolate in the library she screamed outoutout and whipping out her wand she caused books bag and ink bottle to chase him and ginny from the library whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran 
 
 as though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations a batch of pamphlets leaflets and notices concerning various wizarding careers appeared on the tables in gryffindor tower shortly before the end of the holidays along with yet another notice on the board which read 
 
 careers advice 
 
 all are required to attend a short meeting with their 
 
 head of house during the first week of the summer term to discuss 
 
 their future careers times of individual appointments are listed below 
 
 
 
 harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in professor office at half past two on monday which would mean missing most of divination he and the other spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal 
 
 well i fancy healing said ron on the last evening of the holidays he was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed emblem of st on its front it says here you need at least e at newt level in potions herbology transfiguration charms and defence against the dark arts i mean blimey want much do they 
 
 well a very responsible job it said hermione absently 
 
 she was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet that was headed so you think like to work in muggle relations you seem to need many qualifications to liaise with muggles all they want is an owl in muggle studies much more important is your enthusiasm patience and a good sense of fun 
 
 need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle said harry darkly good sense of when to duck more like he was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking listen to this are you seeking a challenging career involving travel adventure and substantial treasure bonuses then consider a position with gringotts wizarding bank who are currently recruiting for thrilling opportunities abroad they want arithmancy though you could do it hermione 
 
 i much fancy banking said hermione vaguely now immersed in have you got what it takes to train security trolls 
 
 hey said a voice in ear he looked round fred and george had come to join them had a word with us about you said fred stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the ministry of magic to slide off on to the floor she says you need to talk to sirius 
 
 what said hermione sharply freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up make a bang at the department of magical accidents and catastrophes 
 
 yeah said harry trying to sound casual yeah i thought like 
 
 be so ridiculous said hermione straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes with umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls 
 
 well we think we can find a way around that said george stretching and smiling a simple matter of causing a diversion now you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the easter holidays 
 
 what was the point we asked ourselves of disrupting leisure time continued fred no point at all we answered ourselves and of course have messed up revision too which would be the very last thing want to do 
 
 he gave hermione a sanctimonious little nod she looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness 
 
 but business as usual from tomorrow fred continued briskly and if going to be causing a bit of uproar why not do it so that harry can have his chat with sirius 
 
 yes but still said hermione with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse even if you do cause a diversion how is harry supposed to talk to him 
 
 office said harry quietly 
 
 he had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own 
 
 areyou insane said hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the cultivated fungus trade and was watching the conversation warily 
 
 i think so said harry shrugging 
 
 and how are you going to get in there in the first place 
 
 harry was ready for this question 
 
 knife he said 
 
 excuse me 
 
 christmas before last sirius gave me a knife open any lock said harry so even if bewitched the door so alahomora work which i bet she has 
 
 what do you think about this hermione demanded of ron and harry was reminded irresistibly of mrs weasley appealing to her husband during first dinner in grimmauld place 
 
 i dunno said ron looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion if harry wants to do it up to him it 
 
 spoken like a true friend and weasley said fred clapping ron hard on the back right then thinking of doing it tomorrow just after lessons because it should cause maximum impact in in the corridorsharry set it off in the east wing somewhere draw her right away from her own officei reckon we should be able to guarantee you what twenty minutes he said looking at george 
 
 easy said george 
 
 what sort of diversion is it asked ron 
 
 see little bro said fred as he and george got up again at least you will if you trot along to gregory the corridor round about five tomorrow 
 
 harry awoke very early the next day feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the ministry of magic it was not only the prospect of breaking into office and using her fire to speak to sirius that was making him feel nervous though that was certainly bad enough today also happened to be the first time harry would be in close proximity to snape since snape had thrown him out of his office 
 
 after lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside bed and stared out on a truly glorious morning the sky was a clear misty opalescent blue directly ahead of him harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented snape he was not sure what sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the pensieve but he was desperate to hear own account of what had happened to know of any mitigating factors there might have been any excuse at all for his behaviour 
 
 something caught attention movement on the edge of the forbidden forest harry squinted into the sun and saw hagrid emerging from between the trees he seemed to be limping as harry watched hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it harry watched the cabin for several minutes hagrid did not emerge again but smoke furled from the chimney so hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire 
 
 harry turned away from the window headed back to his trunk and started to dress 
 
 with the prospect of forcing entry into office ahead harry had never expected the day to be a restful one but he had not reckoned on almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five for the first time ever she was at least as inattentive to professor binns in history of magic as harry and ron were keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that harry tried very hard to ignore 
 
 and if she does catch you there apart from being expelled be able to guess been talking to snuffles and this time i expect force you to drink veritaserum and answer her questions 
 
 hermione said ron in a low and indignant voice are you going to stop telling harry off and listen to binns or am i going to have to take my own notes 
 
 you take notes for a change it kill you 
 
 by the time they reached the dungeons neither harry nor ron was speaking to hermione undeterred she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks 
 
 snape meanwhile seemed to have decided to act as though harry were invisible harry was of course to this tactic as it was one of uncle favourites and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse in fact compared to what he usually had to endure from snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks he found the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to find that when left well alone he was able to concoct an invigoration draught quite easily at the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask corked it and took it up to desk for marking feeling that he might at last have scraped an e 
 
 he had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter harry whipped around his potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure 
 
 whoops he said softly another zero then potter 
 
 harry was too incensed to speak he strode back to his cauldron intending to fill another flask and force snape to mark it but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished 
 
 sorry said hermione with her hands over her mouth really sorry harry i thought finished so i cleared up 
 
 harry could not bring himself to answer when the bell rang he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance and made sure that he found himself a seat between neville and seamus for lunch so that hermione could not start nagging him again about using office 
 
 he was in such a bad mood by the time he got to divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with professor mcgonagall remembering it only when ron asked him why he in her office he hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath only a few minutes late 
 
 sorry professor he panted as he closed the door i forgot 
 
 no matter potter she said briskly but as she spoke somebody else sniffed from the corner harry looked round 
 
 professor umbridge was sitting there a clipboard on her knee a fussy little around her neck and a small horribly smug smile on her face 
 
 sit down potter said professor mcgonagall tersely her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk 
 
 harry sat down with his back to umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard 
 
 well potter this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years said professor mcgonagall have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave hogwarts 
 
 er said harry 
 
 he was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting 
 
 yes professor mcgonagall prompted harry 
 
 well i thought of maybe being an auror harry mumbled 
 
 need top grades for that said professor mcgonagall extracting a small dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it they ask for a minimum of five newts and nothing under exceeds expectations grade i see then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the auror office a difficult career path potter they only take the best in fact i think anybody has been taken on in the last three years 
 
 at this moment professor umbridge gave a very tiny cough as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it professor mcgonagall ignored her 
 
 want to know which subjects you ought to take i suppose she went on talking a little louder than before 
 
 yes said harry defence against the dark arts i suppose 
 
 naturally said professor mcgonagall crisply i would also advise 
 
 professor umbridge gave another cough a little more audible this time professor mcgonagall closed her eyes for a moment opened them again and continued as though nothing had happened 
 
 i would also advise transfiguration because aurors frequently need to transfigure or untransfigure in their work and i ought to tell you now potter that i do not accept students into my newt classes unless they have achieved exceeds expectations or higher at ordinary wizarding level say averaging acceptable at the moment so need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing then you ought to do charms always useful and potions yes potter potions she added with the merest flicker of a smile poisons and antidotes are essential study for aurors and i must tell you that professor snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than outstanding in their owls so 
 
 professor umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet 
 
 may i offer you a cough drop dolores professor mcgonagall asked curtly without looking at professor umbridge 
 
 oh no thank you very much said umbridge with that simpering laugh harry hated so much i just wondered whether i could make the teensiest interruption minerva 
 
 i daresay find you can said professor mcgonagall through tightly gritted teeth 
 
 i was just wondering whether mr potter has quite the temperament for an auror said professor umbridge sweetly 
 
 were you said professor mcgonagall haughtily well potter she continued as though there had been no interruption if you are serious in this ambition i would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your transfiguration and potions up to scratch i see professor flitwick has graded you between acceptable and exceeds expectations for the last two years so your charmwork seems satisfactory as for defence against the dark arts your marks have been generally high professor lupin in particular thought youare you quite sure you like a cough drop dolores 
 
 oh no need thank you minerva simpered professor umbridge who had just coughed her loudest yet i was just concerned that you might not have most recent defence against the dark arts marks in front of you quite sure i slipped in a note 
 
 what this thing said professor mcgonagall in a tone of revulsion as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of folder she glanced down it her eyebrows slightly raised then placed it back into the folder without comment 
 
 yes as i was saying potter professor lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject and obviously for an auror 
 
 did you not understand my note minerva asked professor umbndge in honeyed tones quite forgetting to cough 
 
 of course i understood it said professor mcgonagall her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled 
 
 well then i am confused afraid i quite understand how you can give mr potter false hope that 
 
 false hope repeated professor mcgonagall still refusing to look round at professor umbridge he has achieved high marks in all his defence against the dark arts tests 
 
 terribly sorry to have to contradict you minerva but as you will see from my note harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me 
 
 i should have made my meaning plainer said professor mcgonagall turning at last to look umbridge directly in the eyes he has achieved high marks in all defence against the dark arts tests set by a competent teacher 
 
 professor smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing she sat back in her chair turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed her bulging eyes rolling from side to side professor mcgonagall turned back to harry her thin nostrils flared her eyes burning 
 
 any questions potter 
 
 yes said harry what sort of character and aptitude tests do the ministry do on you if you get enough newts 
 
 well need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth said professor mcgonagall perseverance and dedication because auror training takes a further three years not to mention very high skills in practical defence it will mean a lot more study even after left school so unless prepared to 
 
 i think also find said umbridge her voice very cold now that the ministry looks into the records of those applying to be aurors their criminal records 
 
 unless prepared to take even more exams after hogwarts you should really look at another 
 
 which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an auror as dumbledore has of ever returning to this school 
 
 a very good chance then said professor mcgonagall 
 
 potter has a criminal record said umbridge loudly 
 
 potter has been cleared of all charges said mcgonagall even more loudly 
 
 professor umbridge stood up she was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference but her fussy simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad flabby face look oddly sinister 
 
 potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an auror 
 
 professor mcgonagall got to her feet too and in her case this was a much more impressive move she towered over professor umbridge 
 
 potter she said in ringing tones i will assist you to become an auror if it is the last thing i do if i have to coach you nightly i will make sure you achieve the required results 
 
 the minister for magic will never employ harry potter said umbridge her voice rising furiously 
 
 there may well be a new minister for magic by the time potter is ready to join shouted professor mcgonagall 
 
 aha shrieked professor umbridge pointing a stubby linger at mcgonagall yes yes yes yes of course what you want it minerva mcgonagall you want cornelius fudge replaced by albus dumbledore you think be where i am you senior undersecretary to the minister and headmistress to boot 
 
 you are raving said professor mcgonagall superbly disdainful potter that concludes our careers consultation 
 
 harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room not daring to look at professor umbridge he could hear her and professor mcgonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor 
 
 professor umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their defence against the dark arts lesson that afternoon 
 
 i hope thought better of what you were planning to do harry hermione whispered the moment they had opened their books to chapter and negotiation umbridge looks like in a really bad mood already 
 
 every now and then umbridge shot glowering looks at harry who kept his head down staring at defensive magical theory his eyes unfocused thinking 
 
 he could just imagine professor reaction if he was caught trespassing in professor office mere hours after she had vouched for him there was nothing to stop him simply going back to gryffindor tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the pensieve nothing except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach and then there was the matter of fred and george whose diversion was already planned not to mention the knife sirius had given him which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his old invisibility cloak 
 
 but the fact remained that if he was caught 
 
 dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school harry whispered hermione raising her book to hide her face from umbridge and if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing 
 
 he could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a day more than twenty years ago 
 
 and then he remembered sirius in the fire upstairs in the gryffindor common room 
 
 less like your father than i thought the risk been what made it fun for james 
 
 but did he want to be like his father any more 
 
 harry do it please do it hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class 
 
 he did not answer he did not know what to do 
 
 ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice he would not look at harry though when hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading harry some more he said in a low voice give it a rest ok he can make up his own mind 
 
 heart beat very fast as he left the classroom he was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakeable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance there were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them people exiting the classrooms all around harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully 
 
 umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her pulling out her wand she hurried off in the opposite direction it was now or never 
 
 harryplease hermione pleaded weakly 
 
 but he had made up his mind hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder he set off at a run weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing 
 
 harry reached the corridor to office and found it deserted dashing behind a large suit of armour whose helmet creaked around to watch him he pulled open his bag seized knife and donned the invisibility cloak he then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armour and along the corridor until he reached door 
 
 he inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down then withdrew it there was a tiny click and the door swung open he ducked inside the office closed the door quickly behind him and looked around 
 
 nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks 
 
 harry pulled off his cloak and striding over to the fireplace found what he was looking for within seconds a small box containing glittering floo powder 
 
 he crouched down in front of the empty grate his hands shaking he had never done this before though he thought he knew how it must work sticking his head into the fireplace he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him they exploded at once into emerald green flames 
 
 number twelve grimmauld place harry said loudly and clearly 
 
 it was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced he had travelled by floo powder before of course but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country this time his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of office and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire 
 
 and then as abruptly as it had begun the spinning stopped feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long wooden table where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment 
 
 sirius 
 
 the man jumped and looked around it was not sirius but lupin 
 
 harry he said looking thoroughly shocked what are happened is everything all right 
 
 yeah said harry i just wonderedi mean i just fancied aa chat with sirius 
 
 call him said lupin getting to his feet still looking perplexed he went upstairs to look for kreacher he seems to be hiding in the attic again 
 
 and harry saw lupin hurry out of the kitchen now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs he wondered why sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with hard stone floor 
 
 lupin returned with sirius at his heels moments later 
 
 what is it said sirius urgently sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire so that he and harry were on a level lupin knelt down too looking very concerned are you all right do you need help 
 
 no said harry nothing like that i just wanted to talk about my dad 
 
 they exchanged a look of great surprise but harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion george had only guaranteed him twenty he therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the pensieve 
 
 when he had finished neither sirius nor lupin spoke for a moment then lupin said quietly i like you to judge your father on what you saw there harry he was only fifteen 
 
 fifteen said harry heatedly 
 
 look harry said sirius placatingly james and snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other it was just one of those things you can understand that you i think james was everything snape wanted to behe was popular he was good at quidditchgood at pretty much everything and snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the dark arts and jameswhatever else he may have appeared to you harryalways hated the dark arts 
 
 yeah said harry but he just attacked snape for no good reason just becausewell just because you said you were bored he finished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice 
 
 i m not proud of it said sirius quickly 
 
 lupin looked sideways at sirius then said look harry what got to understand is that your father and sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did everyone thought they were the height of coolif they sometimes got a bit carried away 
 
 if we were sometimes arrogant little berks you mean said sirius 
 
 lupin smiled 
 
 he kept messing up his hair said harry in a pained voice 
 
 sirius and lupin laughed 
 
 forgotten he used to do that said sirius affectionately 
 
 was he playing with the snitch said lupin eagerly 
 
 yeah said harry watching uncomprehendingly as sirius and lupin beamed reminiscently well i thought he was a bit of an idiot 
 
 of course he was a bit of an idiot said sirius bracingly we were all idiots well not moony so much he said fairly looking at lupin 
 
 but lupin shook his head did i ever tell you to lay off snape he said did i ever have the guts to tell you i thought you were out of order 
 
 yeah well said sirius you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes that was something 
 
 and said harry doggedly determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here he kept looking over at the girls by the lake hoping they were watching him 
 
 oh well he always made a fool of himself whenever lily was around said sirius shrugging he stop himself showing off whenever he got near her 
 
 how come she married him harry asked miserably she hated him 
 
 nah she said sirius 
 
 she started going out with him in seventh year said lupin 
 
 once james had deflated his head a bit said sirius 
 
 and stopped hexing people just for the fun of it said lupin 
 
 even snape said harry 
 
 well said lupin slowly snape was a special case i mean he never lost an opportunity to curse james so you really expect james to take that lying down could you 
 
 and my mum was ok with that 
 
 she know too much about it to tell you the truth said sirius i mean james take snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her did he 
 
 sirius frowned at harry who was still looking unconvinced 
 
 look he said your father was the best friend i ever had and he was a good person a lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen he grew out of it 
 
 yeah ok said harry heavily i just never thought feel sorry for snape 
 
 now you mention it said lupin a faint crease between his eyebrows how did snape react when he found seen all this 
 
 he told me never teach me occlumency again said harry indifferently like a big disappoint 
 
 he what shouted sirius causing harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes 
 
 are you serious harry said lupin quickly stopped giving you lessons 
 
 yeah said harry surprised at what he considered a great but ok i care a bit of a relief to tell you the 
 
 coming up there to have a word with snape said sirius forcefully and he actually made to stand up but lupin wrenched him back down again 
 
 if going to tell snape it will be me he said firmly but harry first of all to go back to snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessonswhen dumbledore hears 
 
 i tell him that kill me said harry outraged you see him when we got out of the pensieve 
 
 harry there is nothing so important as you learning occlumency said lupin sternly do you understand me nothing 
 
 ok ok said harry thoroughly discomposed not to mention annoyed try and say something to him but it be 
 
 he fell silent he could hear distant footsteps 
 
 is that kreacher coming downstairs 
 
 no said sirius glancing behind him it must be somebody your end 
 
 heart skipped several beats 
 
 better go he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the grimmauld place fire for a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders then he found himself kneeling in front of fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die 
 
 quickly quickly he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door ah left it open 
 
 harry dived for the invisibility cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when filch burst into the office he looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room pulled open a drawer in desk and began rifling through the papers inside it 
 
 approval for whipping approval for whipping i can do it at last had it coming to them for years 
 
 he pulled out a piece of parchment kissed it then shuffled rapidly back out of the door clutching it to his chest 
 
 harry leapt to his feet and making sure he had his bag and that the invisibility cloak was completely covering him he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after filch who was hobbling along faster than harry had ever seen him go 
 
 one landing down from office harry thought it was safe to become visible again he pulled off the cloak shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards there was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the entrance hall he ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there 
 
 it was just like the night when trelawney had been sacked students were standing all around the walls in a great ring some of them harry noticed covered in a substance that looked very like stinksap teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd prominent among the onlookers were members of the inquisitorial squad who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves and peeves who was bobbing overhead gazed down at fred and george who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of two people who had just been cornered 
 
 so said umbridge triumphantly harry realised she was standing just a few stairs in front of him once more looking down upon her prey soyou think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp do you 
 
 pretty amusing yeah said fred looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear 
 
 filch elbowed his way closer to umbridge almost crying with happiness 
 
 got the form headmistress he said hoarsely waving the piece of parchment harry had just seen him take from her desk got the form and got the whips waiting oh let me do it now 
 
 very good argus she said you two she went on gazing down at fred and george are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school 
 
 you know what said fred i think we are 
 
 he turned to his twin 
 
 george said fred i think outgrown education 
 
 yeah been feeling that way myself said george lightly 
 
 time to test our talents in the real world reckon asked fred 
 
 definitely said george 
 
 and before umbridge could say a word they raised their wands and said together 
 
 accio brooms 
 
 harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance looking to his left he ducked just in time fred and broomsticks one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which umbridge had fastened them to the wall were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners they turned left streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor 
 
 we be seeing you fred told professor umbridge swinging his leg over his broomstick 
 
 yeah bother to keep in touch said george mounting his own 
 
 fred looked around at the assembled students at the silent watchful crowd 
 
 it anyone fancies buying a portable swamp as demonstrated upstairs come to number diagon wizarding wheezes he said in a loud voice our new premises 
 
 special discounts to students who swear going to use our products to get rid of this old bat added george pointing at professor umbridge 
 
 stop them shrieked umbridge but it was too late as the inquisitorial squad closed in fred and george kicked off from the floor shooting fifteen feet into the air the iron peg swinging dangerously below fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd 
 
 give her hell from us peeves 
 
 and peeves who harry had never seen take an order from a student before swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as fred and george wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset

 harry 
 
 no 
 
 yeh can stay here harry come on now 
 
 no 
 
 he did not want to leave side he did not want to move anywhere hand on his shoulder was trembling then another voice said harry come on 
 
 a much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward he obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize from a trace of flowery scent on the air that it was ginny who was leading him back into the castle incomprehensible voices battered him sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night but harry and ginny walked on back up the steps into the entrance hall faces swam on the edges of vision people were peering at him whispering wondering and gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase 
 
 going to the hospital wing said ginny 
 
 not hurt said harry 
 
 orders said ginny up there ron and hermione and lupin and everyone 
 
 fear stirred in chest again he had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind 
 
 ginny who else is dead 
 
 worry none of us 
 
 but the dark markmalfoy said he stepped over a body 
 
 he stepped over bill but all right alive 
 
 there was something in her voice however that harry knew boded ill 
 
 are you sure 
 
 of course sure aa bit of a mess all greyback attacked him madam pomfrey says he look the same anymore 
 
 voice trembled a little 
 
 we really know what the will be i mean greyback being a werewolf but not transformed at the time 
 
 but the other there were other bodies on the ground 
 
 neville and professor flitwick are both hurt but madam pomfrey says be all right and a death dead he got hit by a killing curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhereharry if we had your felix potion i think all have been killed but everything seemed to just miss us 
 
 they had reached the hospital wing pushing open the doors harry saw neville lying apparently asleep in a bed near the door ron hermione luna tonks and lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward at the sound of the doors opening they all looked up hermione ran to harry and hugged him lupin moved forward too looking anxious 
 
 are you all right harry 
 
 fine bill 
 
 nobody answered harry looked over shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on pillow so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque madam pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some green ointment harry remembered how snape had mended sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand 
 
 you fix them with a charm or something he asked the matron 
 
 no charm will work on these said madam pomfrey tried everything i know but there is no cure for werewolf bites 
 
 but he bitten at the full moon said ron who was gazing down into his face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring greyback transformed so surely bill be aa real 
 
 he looked uncertainly at lupin 
 
 no i think that bill will be a true werewolf said lupin but that does not mean that there be some contamination those are cursed wounds they are unlikely ever to heal fully andand bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on 
 
 dumbledore might know something work though ron said where is he bill fought those maniacs on orders dumbledore owes him he leave him in this state 
 
 dead said ginny 
 
 no lupin looked wildly from ginny to harry as though hoping the latter might contradict her but when harry did nor lupin collapsed into a chair beside bed his hands over his face harry had never seen lupin lose control before he felt as though he was intruding upon something private indecent he turned away and caught eye instead exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what ginny had said 
 
 how did he die whispered tonks how did it happen 
 
 snape killed him said harry i was there i saw it we arrived back on the astronomy tower because where the mark was dumbledore was ill he was weak but i think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs he immobilized me i do anything i was under the invisibility cloakand then malfoy came through the door and disarmed him 
 
 hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and ron groaned mouth trembled 
 
 more death eaters arrivedand then snapeand snape did it the avada kedavra harry go on 
 
 madam pomfrey burst into tears nobody paid her any attention except ginny who whispered shh listen 
 
 gulping madam pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth her eyes wide somewhere out in the darkness a phoenix was singing in a way harry had never heard before a stricken lament of terrible beauty and harry felt as he had felt about phoenix song before that the music was inside him not without it was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows 
 
 how long they all stood there listening he did not know nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and professor mcgonagall entered the ward like all the rest she bore marks of the recent battle there were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped 
 
 molly and arthur are on their way she said and the spell of the music was broken everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances turning again to look at bill or else to rub their own eyes shake their heads harry what happened according to hagrid you were with professor dumbledore when hewhen it happened he says professor snape was involved in some 
 
 snape killed dumbledore said harry 
 
 she stared at him for a moment then swayed alarmingly madam pomfrey who seemed to have pulled herself together ran forward conjuring a chair from thin air which she pushed under mcgonagall 
 
 snape repeated mcgonagall faintly falling into the chair we all wondered but he trusted always snape i believe it 
 
 snape was a highly accomplished occlumens said lupin his voice uncharacteristically harsh we always knew that 
 
 but dumbledore swore he was on our side whispered tonks i always thought dumbledore must know something about snape that we 
 
 he always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting snape muttered professor mcgonagall now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a handkerchief i mean with history of course people were bound to wonder but dumbledore told me explicitly that repentance was absolutely genuine hear a word against him 
 
 love to know what snape told him to convince him said tonks 
 
 i know said harry and they all turned to look at him snape passed voldemort the information that made voldemort hunt down my mum and dad then snape told dumbledore he realized what he was doing he was really sorry done it sorry that they were dead 
 
 they all stared at him 
 
 and dumbledore believed that said lupin incredulously dumbledore believed snape was sorry james was dead snape hated james 
 
 and he think my mother was worth a damn either said harry because she was mudblood he called her 
 
 nobody asked how harry knew this all of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened 
 
 this is all my fault said professor mcgonagall suddenly she looked disoriented twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands my fault i sent filius to fetch snape tonight i actually sent for him to come and help us if i alerted snape to what was going on he might never have joined forces with the death eaters i think he knew they were there before filius told him i think he knew they were coming 
 
 it your fault minerva said lupin firmly we all wanted more help we were glad to think snape was on his way 
 
 so when he arrived at the fight he joined in on the death eaters side asked harry who wanted every detail of duplicity and infamy feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him to swear vengeance 
 
 i know exactly how it happened said professor mcgonagall distractedly all so confusing dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case remus bill and nymphadora were to join us and so we patrolled all seemed quiet every secret passageway out of the school was covered we knew nobody could fly in there were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle i still know how the death eaters can possibly have entered 
 
 i do said harry and he explained briefly about the pair of vanishing cabinets and the magical pathway they formed so they got in through the room of requirement 
 
 almost against his will he glanced from ron to hermione both of whom looked devastated 
 
 i messed up harry said ron bleakly we did like you told us we checked the map and we see malfoy on it so we thought he must be in the room of requirement so me ginny and neville went to keep watch on it but malfoy got past us 
 
 he came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch said ginny he was on his own clutching that awful shriveled arm 
 
 his hand of glory said ron gives light only to the holder remember 
 
 anyway ginny went on he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the death eaters out because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went 
 
 peruvian instant darkness powder said ron bitterly fred and going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products 
 
 we tried everything lumos incendio said ginny nothing would penetrate the darkness all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us obviously malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them but we dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other and by the time reached a corridor that was light gone 
 
 luckily said lupin hoarsely ron ginny and neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened we found the death eaters minutes later heading in the direction of the astronomy tower malfoy obviously expected more people to be on the watch he seemed to have exhausted his supply of darkness powder at any rate a fight broke out they scattered and we gave chase one of them gibbon broke away and headed up the tower stairs 
 
 to set off the mark asked harry 
 
 he must have done yes they must have arranged that before they left the room of requirement said lupin but i think gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for dumbledore because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a killing curse that just missed me 
 
 so if ron was watching the room of requirement with ginny and neville said harry turning to hermione were you 
 
 outside office yes whispered hermione her eyes sparkling with tears with luna we hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened we know what was going on upstairs ron had taken the map it was nearly midnight when professor flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons he was shouting about death eaters in the castle i think he really registered that luna and i were there at all he just burst his way into office and we heard him saying that snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us andand 
 
 what harry urged her 
 
 i was so stupid harry said hermione in a whisper he said professor flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while hewhile he went to help fight the death eaters 
 
 she covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers so that her voice was muffled we went into his office to see if we could help professor flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor and oh so obvious now snape must have stupefied flitwick but we realize harry we realize we just let snape go 
 
 not your fault said lupin firmly hermione had you not obeyed snape and got out of the way he probably would have killed you and luna 
 
 so then he came upstairs said harry who was watching snape running up the marble staircase in his eye his black robes billowing behind him as ever pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended and he found the place where you were all fighting 
 
 we were in trouble we were losing said tonks in a low voice gibbon was down but the rest of the death eaters seemed ready to fight to the death neville had been hurt bill had been savaged by greyback it was all dark curses flying everywhere the malfoy boy had vanished he must have slipped past up the stairs then more of them ran after him but one of them blocked the stairs behind them with some kind of curse neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air 
 
 none of us could break through said ron and that massive death eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us 
 
 and then snape was there said tonks and then he 
 
 i saw him running toward us but that huge death jinx just missed me right afterward and i ducked and lost track of things said ginny 
 
 i saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it there said lupin i tried to follow him but was thrown back just like neville 
 
 he must have known a spell we whispered mcgonagall after allhe was the defense against the dark arts teacher i just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the death eaters escaped up to the tower 
 
 he was said harry savagely but to help them not to stop the and bet you had to have a dark mark to get through that barrierso what happened when he came back down 
 
 well the big death eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in and also broke the curse blocking the stairs said lupin we all ran forwardthose of us who were still standing anywayand then snape and the boy emerged out of the dustobviously none of us attacked them 
 
 we just let them pass said tonks in a hollow voice we thought they were being chased by the death eatersand next thing the other death eaters and greyback were back and we were fighting againi thought i heard snape shout something but i know what 
 
 he shouted over said harry done what meant to do 
 
 they all fell silent lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside as the music reverberated upon the air unbidden unwelcome thoughts slunk into mind had they taken body from the foot of the tower yet what would happen to it next where would it rest he clenched his fists tighdy in his pockets he could feel the small cold lump of the fake horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand 
 
 the doors of the hospital wing burst open making them all jump mr and mrs weasley were striding up the ward fleur just behind them her beautiful face terrified 
 
 mollyarthur said professor mcgonagall jumping up and hurrying to greet them i am so sorry 
 
 bill whispered mrs weasley darting past professor mcgonagall as she caught sight of mangled face oh bill 
 
 lupin and tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that mr and mrs weasley could get nearer to the bed mrs weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead 
 
 you said greyback attacked him mr weasley asked professor mcgonagall distractedly but he transformed so what does that mean what will happen to bill 
 
 we yet know said professor mcgonagall looking helplessly at lupin 
 
 there will probably be some contamination arthur said lupin it is an odd case possibly unique we know what his behavior might be like when he awakens 
 
 mrs weasley took the ointment from madam pomfrey and began dabbing at wounds 
 
 and dumbledore said mr weasley minerva is it true is he really 
 
 as professor mcgonagall nodded harry felt ginny move beside him and looked at her her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon fleur who was gazing down at bill with a frozen expression on her face 
 
 dumbledore gone whispered mr weasley but mrs weasley had eyes only for her eldest son she began to sob tears falling onto mutilated face 
 
 of course it matter how he looks not important but he was a very handsome little always very handsome and he was to be married 
 
 and what do you mean by zat said fleur suddenly and loudly what do you mean he was going to be married 
 
 mrs weasley raised her face looking startled wellonly that 
 
 you theenk bill will not wish to marry me anymore demanded fleur you theenk because of these bites he will not love me 
 
 no not what i 
 
 because e will said fleur drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair it would take more zan a werewolf to stop bill loving me 
 
 well yes sure said mrs weasley but i thought perhapsgiven howhow he 
 
 you thought i would not weesh to marry him or you hoped said fleur her nostrils flaring what do i care how he looks i am enough for both of us i theenk all these scars show is zat my husband is brave and i shall do zat she added fiercely pushing mrs weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her 
 
 mrs weasley fell back against her husband and watched fleur mopping up wounds with a most curious expression upon her face nobody said anything harry did not dare move like everybody else he was waiting for the explosion 
 
 our muriel said mrs weasley after a long pause has a very beautiful i am sure i could persuade her to lend you for the wedding she is very fond of bill you know and it would look lovely with your hair 
 
 thank you said fleur stiffly i am sure zat will be lovely 
 
 and then harry did not quite see how it happened both women were crying and hugging each other completely bewildered wondering whether the world had gone mad he turned around ron looked as stunned as he felt and ginny and hermione were exchanging startled looks 
 
 you see said a strained voice tonks was glaring at lupin she still wants to marry him even though been bitten she care 
 
 different said lupin barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense bill will not be a full werewolf the cases are completely 
 
 but i care either i care said tonks seizing the front of robes and shaking them told you a million times 
 
 and the meaning of patronus and her hair and the reason she had come running to find dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by greyback all suddenly became clear to harry it had not been sirius that tonks had fallen in love with after all 
 
 and told you a million times said lupin refusing to meet her eyes staring at the floor that i am too old for you too poor too dangerous 
 
 said all along taking a ridiculous line on this remus said mrs weasley over shoulder as she patted her on the back 
 
 i am not being ridiculous said lupin steadily tonks deserves somebody young and whole 
 
 but she wants you said mr weasley with a small smile and after all remus young and whole men do not necessarily remain so 
 
 he gestured sadly at his son lying between them 
 
 this is not the moment to discuss it said lupin avoiding eyes as he looked around distractedly dumbledore is dead 
 
 dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world said professor mcgonagall curtly just as the hospital doors opened again and hagrid walked in 
 
 the little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen he was shaking with tears a vast spotted handkerchief in his hand 
 
 done it professor he choked him professor got the kids back in bed professor lyin down but he says be all righ in a jiffy an professor slughorn says the bin informed 
 
 thank you hagrid said professor mcgonagall standing up at once and turning to look at the group around bed i shall have to see the ministry when they get here hagrid please tell the heads of housesslughorn can represent slytherin that i want to see them in my office forthwith i would like you to join us too 
 
 as hagrid nodded turned and shuffled out of the room again she looked down at harry before i meet them i would like a quick word with you harry if come with me 
 
 harry stood up murmured see you in a bit to ron hermione and ginny and followed professor mcgonagall back down the ward the corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song it was several minutes before harry became aware that they were not heading for professor office but for and another few seconds before he realized that of course she had been deputy headmistress apparently she was now headmistress so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers 
 
 in silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office he did not know what he had expected that the room would be draped in black perhaps or even that body might be lying there in fact it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and dumbledore had left it mere hours previously the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle legged tables sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight the sorting hat on a shelf behind the desk the perch stood empty he was still crying his lament to the grounds and a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk his spectacle perched upon his crooked nose looking peaceful and untroubled 
 
 after glancing once at this portrait professor mcgonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself then rounded the desk to look at harry her face taut and lined 
 
 harry she said i would like to know what you and professor dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school 
 
 i tell you that professor said harry he had expected the question and had his answer ready it had been here in this very room that dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but ron and hermione 
 
 harry it might be important said professor mcgonagall 
 
 it is said harry very but he want me to tell anyone 
 
 professor mcgonagall glared at him 
 
 registered the renewed use of his the light of professor death i think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat 
 
 i think so said harry shrugging professor dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died 
 
 but 
 
 one thing you should know before the ministry gets here though madam under the imperius curse she was helping malfoy and the death eaters how the necklace and the poisoned mead 
 
 rosmerta said professor mcgonagall incredulously but before she could go on there was a knock on the door behind them and professors sprout flitwick and slughorn traipsed into the room followed by hagrid who was still weeping copiously his huge frame trembling with grief 
 
 snape ejaculated slughorn who looked the most shaken pale and sweating snape i taught him i thought i knew him 
 
 but before any of them could respond to this a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall a wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas minerva the minister will be here within seconds he has just disapparated from the ministry 
 
 thank you everard said professor mcgonagall and she turned quickly to her teachers 
 
 i want to talk about what happens to hogwarts before he gets here she said quickly personally i am not convinced that the school should reopen next year the death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon hogwarts history it is horrible 
 
 i am sure dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open said professor sprout i feel that if a single pupil wants to come then the school ought to remain open for that pupil 
 
 but will we have a single pupil after this said slughorn now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief parents will want to keep their children at home and i say i blame them personally i think in more danger at hogwarts than we are anywhere else but you expect mothers to think like that want to keep their families together only natural 
 
 i agree said professor mcgonagall and in any case it is not true to say that dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which hogwarts might close when the chamber of secrets reopened he considered the closure of the schooland i must say that professor murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle 
 
 we must consult the governors said professor flitwick in his squeaky little voice he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in office we must follow the established procedures a decision should not be made hastily 
 
 hagrid you said anything said professor mcgonagall what are your views ought hogwarts to remain open 
 
 hagrid who had been weeping silently into his large spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation now raised puffy red eyes and croaked i dunno professor fer the heads of house an the headmistress ter decide 
 
 professor dumbledore always valued your views said professor mcgonagall kindly and so do i 
 
 well stayin said hagrid fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard me home bin me home since i was thirteen an if kids who wan me ter teach em do it but i dunno hogwarts without dumbledore he gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more and there was silence 
 
 very well said professor mcgonagall glancing out of the window at the grounds checking to see whether the minister was yet approaching then i must agree with filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors who will make the final decision 
 
 now as to getting students home there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later we could arrange for the hogwarts express to come tomorrow if necessary 
 
 what about funeral said harry speaking at last 
 
 well said professor mcgonagall losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook ii know that it was wish to be laid to rest here at hogwarts 
 
 then happen it said harry fiercely 
 
 if the ministry thinks it appropriate said professor mcgonagall no other headmaster or headmistress has ever been 
 
 no other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school growled hagrid 
 
 hogwarts should be final resting place said professor flitwick 
 
 absolutely said professor sprout 
 
 and in that case said harry you send the students home until the over want to say 
 
 the last word caught in his throat but professor sprout completed the sentence for him 
 
 goodbye 
 
 well said squeaked professor flitwick well said indeed our students should pay tribute it is fitting we can arrange transport home afterward 
 
 seconded barked professor sprout 
 
 i suppose yes said slughorn in a rather agitated voice while hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent 
 
 coming said professor mcgonagall suddenly gazing down into the grounds the minister and by the looks of it brought a delegation 
 
 can i leave professor said harry at once 
 
 he had no desire at all to see or be interrogated by rufus scrimgeour tonight 
 
 you may said professor mcgonagall and quickly 
 
 she strode toward the door and held it open for him he sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor he had left his invisibility cloak at the top of the astronomy tower but it did not matter there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass not even filch mrs norris or peeves he did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the gryffindor common room 
 
 is it true whispered the fat lady as he approached her it is really true dumbledoredead 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 she let out a wail and without waiting for the password swung forward to admit him 
 
 as harry had suspected it would be the common room was the room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole he saw dean and seamus sitting in a group nearby this meant that the dormitory must be empty or nearly so without speaking to anybody without making eye contact at all harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys dormitories 
 
 as he had hoped ron was waiting for him still fully dressed sitting on his bed harry sat down on his own and for a moment they simply stared at each other 
 
 talking about closing the school said harry 
 
 lupin said they would said ron 
 
 there was a pause 
 
 so said ron in a very low voice as though he thought the furniture might be listening in did you find one did you get it aa horcrux 
 
 harry shook his head all that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now had it really happened and only hours ago 
 
 you get it said ron looking crestfallen it there 
 
 no said harry someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place 
 
 already taken 
 
 wordlessly harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket opened it and passed it to ron the full story could wait it did not matter tonight nothing mattered except the end the end of their pointless adventure the end of life 
 
 whispered ron but who was that 
 
 dunno said harry lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards he felt no curiosity at all about he doubted that he would ever feel curious again as he lay there he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent fawkes had stopped singing 
 
 and he knew without knowing how he knew it that the phoenix had gone had left hogwarts for good just as dumbledore had left the school had left the world had left harry

 neville c what the c how c 
 
 but neville had spotted ron and hermione and with yells of delight was hugging them too the longer harry looked at neville the worse he appeared one of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple there were gouge marks on his face and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living enough nevertheless his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of hermione and said again i knew youd come kept telling seamus it was a matter of time 
 
 neville whats happened to you 
 
 what this neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head this is nothing seamus is worse youll see shall we get going then oh he turned to aberforth ab there might be a couple more people to the way 
 
 couple more repeated aberforth ominously what dyou mean a couple more longbottom theres a curfew and a camwaulding charm on the whole village 
 
 i know thats why theyll be apparating directly into the bar said neville just send them down the passage when they get here will you thanks a lot 
 
 neville held out his hand to hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel ron followed then neville harry addressed aberforth 
 
 i dont know how to thank you youve saved our lives twice 
 
 look after em then said aberforth gruffly i might not be able to save em a third time 
 
 harry chambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind arianas portrait there were smooth stone steps on the other side it looked as though the passageway had been there for years brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth as they walked their shadows rippled fanlike across the wall 
 
 how longs this been here ron asked as they set off it isnt on the marauders map is it harry i thought there were only seven passages in and out of school 
 
 they sealed off all of those before the start of the year said neville theres no chance of getting through any of them now not with the curses over the entrances and death eaters and dementors waiting at the exits he started walking backward beaming drinking them in never mind that stuff is it true did you break into gringotts did you escape on a dragon its everywhere everyones talking about it terry boot got beaten up by carrow for yelling about it in the great hall at dinner 
 
 yeah its true said harry 
 
 neville laughed gleefully 
 
 what did you do with the dragon 
 
 released it into the wild said ron hermione was all for keeping it as a pet 
 
 dont exaggerate ron c 
 
 but what have you been doing people have been saying youve just been on the run harry but i dont think so i think youve been up to something 
 
 youre right said harry but tell us about hogwarts neville we havent heard anything 
 
 its been well its not really like hogwarts anymore said neville the smile fading from his face as he spoke do you know about the carrows 
 
 those two death eaters who teach here 
 
 they do more than teach said neville theyre in charge of all discipline they like punishment the carrows 
 
 like umbridge 
 
 nah they make her look tame the other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the carrows if we do anything wrong they dont though if they can avoid it you can tell they all hate them as much as we do 
 
 amycus the bloke he teaches what used to be defense against the dark arts except now its just the dark arts were supposed to practice the cruciatus curse on people whove earned detentions c 
 
 what 
 
 harry ron and hermiones united voices echoed up and down the passage 
 
 yeah said neville thats how i got this one he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek i refused to do it some people are into it though crabbe and goyle love it first time theyve ever been top in anything i expect 
 
 alecto amycuss sister teaches muggle studies which is compulsory for everyone weve all got to listen to her explain how muggles are like animals stupid and dirty and how they drive wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them and how the natural order is being reestablished i got this one he indicated another slash to his face for asking her how much muggle blood she and her brother have got 
 
 blimey neville said ron theres a time and a place for getting a smart mouth 
 
 you didnt see her said neville you wouldnt have stood it either the thing is it helps when people stand up to them it gives everyone hope i used to notice that when you did it harry 
 
 but theyve used you as a knife sharpener said ron winding slightly as they passed a lamp and nevilles injuries were thrown into even greater relief 
 
 neville shrugged 
 
 doesnt matter they dont want to spill too much pure blood so theyll torture us a bit if were mouthy but they wont actually kill us 
 
 harry did not know what was worse the things that neville was saying or the tone in which he said them 
 
 the only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble they get taken hostage old xeno lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in the quibbler so they dragged luna off the train on the way back for christmas 
 
 neville shes all right weve seen her c 
 
 yeah i know she managed to get a message to me 
 
 from his pocket he pulled a golden coin and harry recognized it as one of the fake galleons that dumbledores army had used to send one another messages 
 
 these have been great said neville beaming at hermione the carrows never rumbled how we were communicating it drove them mad we used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls dumbledores army still recruiting stuff like that snape hated it 
 
 you used to said harry who had noticed the past tense 
 
 well it got more difficult as time went on said neville we lost luna at christmas and ginny never came back after easter and the three of us were sort of the leaders the carrows seemed to know i was behind a lot of it so they started coming down on me hard and then michael corner went and got caught releasing a theyd chained up and they tortured him pretty badly that scared people off 
 
 no kidding muttered ron as the passage began to slope upward 
 
 yeah well i couldnt ask people to go through what michael did so we dropped those kinds of stunts but we were still fighting doing underground stuff right up until a couple of weeks ago thats when they decided there was only one way to stop me i suppose and they went for gran 
 
 they what said harry ron and hermione together 
 
 yeah said neville panting a little now because the passage was climbing so steeply well you can see their thinking it had worked really well kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave i spose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around thing was he faced them and harry was astonished to see that he was grinning they bit off a bit more than they could chew with gran little old witch living alone they probably thought hey didnt need to send anyone particularly powerful anyway neville laughed dawlish is still in st mungos and grans on the run she sent me a letter he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes telling me she was proud of me that im my parents son and to keep it up 
 
 cool said ron 
 
 yea said neville happily only thing was once they realized they had no hold over me they decided hogwarts could do without me after all i dont know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to azkaban either way i knew it was time to disappear 
 
 but said ron looking thoroughly confused arent c arent we heading straight back for hogwarts 
 
 course said neville youll see were here 
 
 they turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage another short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind arianas portrait neville pushed it open and climbed through as harry followed he heard neville call out for unseen people 
 
 look who it is didnt i tell you 
 
 as harry emerged into the room behind the passage there were several screams and yells harry 
 
 its potter its potter 
 
 ron 
 
 hermione 
 
 he had a confused impression of colored hangings of lamps and many faces the next moment he ron and hermione were engulfed hugged pounded on the back their hair ruffled their hands shaken by what seemed to be more than twenty people they might have just won a quidditch final 
 
 okay okay calm down neville called and as the crowd backed away harry was able to take in their surroundings 
 
 he did not recognize the dorm at all it was enormous and looked rather like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house or perhaps a gigantic ships cabin multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from the balcony that ran around the dark and windowless walls which were covered in bright tapestry hangings harry saw the gold gryffindor lion emblazoned on scarlet the black badger of hufflepuff set against yellow and the bronze eagle of ravenclaw on blue the silver and green of slytherin alone were absent there were bulging bookcases a few broomsticks propped against the walls and in the corner a large wireless 
 
 where are we 
 
 room of requirement of course said neville surpassed itself hasnt it the carrows were chasing me and i knew i had just one chance for a hideout i managed to get through the door and this is what i found well it wasnt exactly like this when i arrived it was a load smaller there was only one hammock and just gryffindor hangings but its expanded as more and more of the have arrived 
 
 and the carrows cant get in asked harry looking around for the door 
 
 no said seamus finnigan whom harry had not recognized until he spoke seamuss face was bruised and puffy its a proper hideout as long as one of us stays in here they cant get at us the door wont open its all down to neville he really gets this room youve got to ask for exactly what you need c like i dont want any carrow supporters to be able to get in c and itll do it for you youve just got to make sure you close the loopholes nevilles the man 
 
 its quite straightforward really said neville modestly id been in here about a day and a half and getting really hungry and wishing i could get something to eat and thats when the passage to hogs head opened up i went through it and met aberforth hes been providing us with food because for some reason thats the one thing the room doesnt really do 
 
 yeah well foods one of the five exceptions to gamps law of elemental transfiguration said ron to general astonishment 
 
 so weve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks said seamus and it just makes more hammocks every time we need room and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up c 
 
 c and thought theyd quite like to wash yes supplied lavender brown whom harry had not noticed until that point now that he looked around properly he recognized many familiar faces both patil twins were there as were terry boot ernie macmillan anthony goldstein and michael corner 
 
 tell us what youve been up to though said ernie thereve been so many rumors weve been trying to keep up with you on potterwatch he pointed at the wireless you didnt break into gringotts 
 
 they did said neville and the dragons true too 
 
 there was a smattering of applause and a few whoops ron took a bow 
 
 what were you after asked seamus eagerly 
 
 before any of them could parry the question with one of their own harry felt a terrible scorching pain in the lightning scar as he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces the room of requirement vanished and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole and voldemorts scream of fury vibrated inside his head 
 
 with an enormous effort he pulled out of voldemorts mind again back to where he stood swaying in the room of requirement sweat pouring from his face and ron holding him up 
 
 are you all right harry neville was saying what to sit down i expect youre tired arent c 
 
 no said harry he looked at ron and hermione trying to tell them without words that voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other horcruxes time was running out fast if voldemort chose to visit hogwarts next they would miss their chance 
 
 we need to get going he said and their expressions told him that they understood 
 
 what are we going to do then harry asked seamus whats the plan 
 
 plan repeated harry he was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself succumbing again to voldemorts rage his scar was still burning well theres something we c ron hermione and i c need to do and then well get out of here 
 
 nobody was laughing or whooping anymore neville looked confused 
 
 what dyou mean get out of here 
 
 we havent come back to stay said harry rubbing his scar trying to soothe the pain theres something important we need to do c 
 
 what is it 
 
 i c i cant tell you 
 
 there was a ripple of muttering at this nevilles brows contracted 
 
 why cant you tell us its something to do with fighting right 
 
 well yeah c 
 
 then well help you 
 
 the other members of dumbledores army were nodding some enthusiastically others solemnly a couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action 
 
 you dont understand harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours we c we cant tell you weve got to do it c alone 
 
 why asked neville 
 
 because in his desperation to start looking for the missing horcrux or at least have a private discussion with ron and hermione about where they might commence their search harry found it difficult to gather his thoughts his scar was still searing dumbledore left the three of us a job he said carefully and we werent supposed to tell c i mean he wanted us to do it just the three of us 
 
 were his army said neville dumbledores army we were all in it together weve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own c 
 
 it hasnt exactly been a picnic mate said ron 
 
 i never said it had but i dont see why you cant trust us everyone in this rooms been fighting and theyve been driven in here because the carrows were hunting them down everyone in heres proven theyre loyal to dumbledore c loyal to you 
 
 look harry began without knowing what he was going to say but it did not matter the tunnel door had just opened behind him 
 
 we got your message neville hello you three i thought you must be here 
 
 it was luna and dean seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend 
 
 hi everyone said luna happily oh its great to be back 
 
 luna said harry distractedly what are you doing here how did you c 
 
 i sent for her said neville holding up the fake galleon i promised her and ginny that if you turned up id let them know we all thought that if you came back it would mean revolution that we were going to overthrow snape and the carrows 
 
 of course thats what it means said luna brightly isnt it harry were going to fight them out of hogwarts 
 
 listen said harry with a rising sense of panic im sorry but thats not what we came back for theres something weve got to do and then c 
 
 youre going to leave us in this mess demanded michael cornet 
 
 no said ron what were doing will benefit everyone in the end its all about trying to get rid of c 
 
 then let us help said neville angrily we want to be a part of it 
 
 there was another noise behind them and harry turned his heart seemed to fall ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall closely followed by fred george and lee jordan ginny gave harry a radiant smile he had forgotten he had never fully appreciated how beautiful she was but he had never been less pleased to see her 
 
 aberforths getting a bit annoyed said fred raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting he wants a kip and his bars turned into a railway station 
 
 harrys mouth fell open right behind lee jordan came harrys old girlfriend cho chang she smiled at him 
 
 i got the message she said holding up her own fake galleon and she walked over to sit beside michael corner 
 
 so whats the plan harry said george 
 
 there isnt one said harry still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely 
 
 just going to make it up as we go along are we my favorite kind said fred 
 
 youve got to stop this harry told neville what did you call them all back for this is insane c 
 
 were fighting arent we said dean taking out his fake galleon the message said harry was back and we were going to fight ill have to get a wand though c 
 
 you havent got a wandc began seamus 
 
 ron turned suddenly to harry 
 
 why cant they help 
 
 what 
 
 they can help he dropped his voice and said so that none of them could hear but hermione who stood between them we dont know where it is weve got to find it fast we dont have to tell them its a horcrux 
 
 harry looked from ron to hermione who murmured i think rons right we dont even know what were looking for we need them and when harry looked unconvinced you dont have to do everything alone harry 
 
 harry thought fast his scar still prickling his head threatening to split again dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but ron and hermione about the horcruxes secrets and lies thats how we grew up and albus he was a natural was he turning into dumbledore keeping his secrets clutched to his chest afraid to trust but dumbledore had trusted snape and where had that led to murder at the top of the highest tower 
 
 all right he said quietly to the other two okay he called to the room at large and all noise ceased fred and george who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest fell silent and all of the looked alert excited 
 
 theres something we need to find harry said something c something thatll help us overthrow its here at hogwarts but we dont know where it might have belonged to ravenclaw has anyone heard of an object like that has anyone come across something with her eagle on it for instance 
 
 he looked hopefully toward the little group of ravenclaws to padma michael terry and cho but it was luna who answered perched on the arm of ginnys chair 
 
 well theres her lost diadem i told you about it remember harry the lost diadem of ravenclaw daddys trying to duplicate it 
 
 yeah but the lost diadem said michael corner rolling his eyes is lost luna thats sort of the point 
 
 when was it lost asked harry 
 
 centuries ago they say said cho and harrys heart sank professor flitwick says the diadem vanished with ravenclaw herself people have looked but she appealed to her fellow ravenclaws nobodys ever found a trace of it have them 
 
 they all shook their heads 
 
 sorry but what is a diadem asked ron 
 
 its a kind of crown said terry boot ravenclaws was supposed to have magical properties enhance the wisdom of the wearer 
 
 yes daddys wrackspurt siphons c 
 
 but harry cut across luna 
 
 and none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it 
 
 they all shook their heads again harry looked at ron and hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him an object that had been lost this long and apparently without trace did not seem like a good candidate for the horcrux hidden in the castle before he could formulate a new question however cho spoke again 
 
 if youd like to see what the diadems supposed to look like i could take you up to our common room and show you harry ravenclaws wearing it in her statue 
 
 harrys scar scorched again for a moment the room of requirement swam before him and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders voldemort was flying again whether to the underground lake or here to the castle he did not know either way there was hardly any time left 
 
 hes on the move he said quietly to ron and hermione he glanced at cho and then back at them listen i know its not much of a lead but im going to go look at this statue at least find out what the diadem looks like wait for me here and keep you know c the other one c safe 
 
 cho had got to her feet but ginny said rather fiercely no luna will take harry wont you luna 
 
 oooh yes id like to said luna happily as cho sat down again looking disappointed 
 
 how do we get out harry asked neville 
 
 over here 
 
 he led harry and luna to a corner where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase it comes out somewhere different every day so theyve never been able to find it he said only trouble is we never know exactly where were going to end up when we go out be careful harry theyre always patrolling the corridors at night 
 
 no problem said harry see you in a bit 
 
 he and luna hurried up the staircase which was long lit by torches and turned corners in unexpected places at last they reached what appeared to be solid wall 
 
 get under here harry told luna pulling out the invisibility cloak and throwing it over both of them he gave the wall a little push 
 
 it melted away at his touch and they slipped outside harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once they were standing in a dark corridor harry pulled luna back into the shadows fumbled in the pouch around his neck and took out the marauders map holding it close to his nose he searched and located his and lunas dots at last 
 
 were up on the fifth floor he whispered watching filch moving away from them a corridor ahead come on this way 
 
 they crept off 
 
 harry had prowled the castle at night many times before but never had his heart hammered that fast never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place through squares of moonlight upon the floor past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps around corners beyond which who knew what lurked harry and luna walked checking the marauders map whenever light permitted twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves he expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment his worst fear was peeves and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first telltale signs of the poltergeists approach 
 
 the way harry breathed luna plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral staircase 
 
 they climbed in tight dizzying circles harry had never been up here before at last they reached a door there was no handle and no keyhole nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood and a bronze knocker in the shape an eagle 
 
 luna reached out a pale hand which looked eerie floating in midair unconnected to arm or body she knocked once and in the silence it sounded to harry like a cannon blast at once the beak of the eagle opened but instead of a birds called a soft musical voice said which came first the phoenix or the flame 
 
 hmm what do you think harry said luna looking thoughtful 
 
 what isnt there a password 
 
 oh no youve got to answer a question said luna 
 
 what if you get it wrong 
 
 well you have to wait for somebody who gets it right said luna that way you learn you see 
 
 yeah trouble is we cant really afford to wait for anyone else luna 
 
 no i see what you mean said luna seriously well then i think the answer is that a circle has no beginning 
 
 well reasoned said the voice and the door swung open 
 
 the deserted ravenclaw common room was a wide circular room airier than any harry had ever seen at hogwarts graceful arched windows punctuated the walls which were hung with silks by day the ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains the ceiling was domed and painted with stars which were echoed in the carpet there were tables chairs and bookcases and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble 
 
 harry recognized rowena ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at lunas house the statue stood beside a door that led he guessed to dormitories above he strode right up to the marble woman and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face beautiful yet slightly intimidating a circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head it was not unlike the tiara fleur had worn at her wedding there were tiny words etched into it harry stepped out from under the cloak and climbed up onto ravenclaws plinth to read them 
 
 wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure 
 
 which makes you pretty skint witless said a cackling voice 
 
 harry whirled around slipped off the plinth and landed on the floor the figure of alecto carrow was standing before him and even as harry raised his wand she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 something 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 i mean to be somebody and do something useful in the world 
 said the eldest of five brothers i care how humble my position 
 is so that i can only do some good which will be something i intend 
 to be a brickmaker bricks are always wanted and i shall be really 
 doing something 
 
 your something is not enough for me said the second 
 brother what you talk of doing is nothing at all it is 
 work or might even be done by a machine no i should prefer to be 
 a builder at once there is something real in that a man gains a 
 position he becomes a citizen has his own sign his own house of 
 call for his workmen so i shall be a builder if all goes well in 
 time i shall become a master and have my own journeymen and my 
 wife will be treated as a wife this is what i call 
 something 
 
 i call it all nothing said the third not in reality any 
 position there are many in a town far above a master builder in 
 position you may be an upright man but even as a master you will 
 only be ranked among common men i know better what to do than that i will be an architect which will place me among those who possess riches and intellect and who speculate in art i shall certainly have to rise by my own endeavors from a laborer or as a 
 apprentice a lad wearing a paper cap although i now wear a silk hat i shall have to fetch beer and spirits for the journeymen and they will call me thou which will be an insult i shall 
 endure it however for i shall look upon it all as a mere representation a masquerade a mummery which that is 
 when i myself as a journeyman shall have served my time will vanish and i shall go my way and all that has passed will be nothing to me then i shall enter the academy and get instructed in drawing and be called an architect i may even attain to rank and have 
 something placed before or after my name and i shall build as 
 others have done before me by this there will be always something 
 to make me remembered and is not that worth living for 
 
 not in my opinion said the fourth i will never follow the 
 lead of others and only imitate what they have done i will be a 
 genius and become greater than all of you together i will create a 
 new style of building and introduce a plan for erecting houses 
 suitable to the climate with material easily obtained in the country 
 and thus suit national feeling and the developments of the age 
 besides building a storey for my own genius 
 
 but supposing the climate and the material are not good for 
 much said the fifth brother that would be very unfortunate for 
 you and have an influence over your experiments nationality may 
 assert itself until it becomes affectation and the developments of 
 a century may run wild as youth often does i see clearly that none 
 of you will ever really be anything worth notice however you may 
 now fancy it but do as you like i shall not imitate you i mean to 
 keep clear of all these things and criticize what you do in every 
 action something imperfect may be discovered something not right 
 which i shall make it my business to find out and expose that will be 
 something i fancy and he kept his word and became a critic 
 
 people said of this fifth brother there is something very precise about him he has a good but he does nothing and 
 on that very account they thought he must be something 
 
 now you see this is a little history which will never end as 
 long as the world exists there will always be men like these five 
 brothers and what became of them were they each nothing or 
 something you shall hear it is quite a history 
 
 the eldest brother he who fabricated bricks soon discovered that 
 each brick when finished brought him in a small coin if only a 
 copper one and many copper pieces if placed one upon another can be changed into a shining shilling and at whatever door a person knocks who has a number of these in his hands whether it be the the or the the door flies open and he can get all he wants so you see the value of bricks some of the bricks however crumbled to pieces or were broken but the elder brother found a use for even these 
 
 on the high bank of earth which formed a dyke on the a 
 poor woman named margaret wished to build herself a house so all 
 the imperfect bricks were given to her and a few whole ones with 
 them for the eldest brother was a man although he never achieved anything higher than making bricks the poor woman built herself a little house it was small and narrow and the window was quite crooked the door too low and the straw roof might have been better thatched but still it was a shelter and from within you could look far over the sea which dashed wildly against the on which the little house was built the salt waves sprinkled their white foam over it but it stood firm and remained long after he who had given the bricks to build it was dead and buried 
 
 the second brother of course knew better how to build than poor 
 margaret for he served an apprenticeship to learn it when his time 
 was up he packed up his knapsack and went on his travels singing 
 the song 
 while young i can wander without a care 
 and build new houses everywhere 
 fair and bright are my dreams of home 
 always thought of wherever i roam 
 hurrah for a life of glee 
 a loved one at home who thinks of me 
 home and friends i can forget 
 and i mean to be a master yet 
 and that is what he did on his return home he became a master 
 builder built one house after another in the town till they 
 formed quite a street which when finished became really an ornament to the town these houses built a house for him in return which was to be his own but how can houses build a house if the houses were asked they could not answer but the people would understand and say certainly the street built his house for him it was not very large and the floor was of lime but when he danced with his bride on the floor it was to him white and shining and from every stone in the wall flowers seemed to spring forth and decorate the room as with the richest tapestry it was really a pretty house and in it were a happy pair the flag of the corporation fluttered before it and the journeymen and apprentices shouted hurrah he had gained his position he had made himself something and at last he died which was something too 
 
 now we come to the architect the third brother who had been 
 first a apprentice had worn a cap and served as an 
 errand boy but afterwards went to the academy and risen to be an 
 architect a high and noble gentleman ah yes the houses of the new 
 street which the brother who was a master builder erected may have 
 built his house for him but the street received its name from the 
 architect and the handsomest house in the street became his property 
 
 that was something and he was something for he had a list of 
 titles before and after his name his children were called wellborn 
 and when he died his widow was treated as a lady of position and 
 that was something his name remained always written at the corner 
 of the street and lived in every mouth as its name yes this 
 also was something 
 
 and what about the genius of the family the fourth brother who 
 wanted to invent something new and original he tried to build a lofty 
 storey himself but it fell to pieces and he fell with it and broke 
 his neck however he had a splendid funeral with the city flags 
 and music in the procession flowers were strewn on the pavement 
 and three orations were spoken over his grave each one longer than 
 the other he would have liked this very much during his life as well 
 as the poems about him in the papers for he liked nothing so well 
 as to be talked of a monument was also erected over his grave it was only another storey over him but that was something now he was dead like the three other brothers 
 
 the youngest the critic outlived them all which was quite right 
 for him it gave him the opportunity of having the last word which to 
 him was of great importance people always said he had a good 
 at last his hour came and he died and arrived at the 
 gates of heaven souls always enter these gates in pairs so he 
 found himself standing and waiting for admission with another and who should it be but old dame margaret from the house on the dyke 
 it is evidently for the sake of contrast that i and this wretched soul 
 should arrive here exactly at the same time said the critic pray 
 who are you my good woman said he do you want to get in here 
 too 
 
 and the old woman curtsied as well as she could she thought it 
 must be st peter himself who spoke to her i am a poor old woman 
 
 she said without my family i am old margaret that lived in the 
 house on the dyke 
 
 well and what have you done what great deed have you 
 performed down below 
 
 i have done nothing at all in the world that could give me a 
 claim to have these doors open for me she said it would be only 
 through mercy that i can be allowed to slip in through the gate 
 
 in what manner did you leave the world he asked just for the 
 sake of saying something for it made him feel very weary to stand 
 there and wait 
 
 how i left the world she replied why i can scarcely tell 
 you during the last years of my life i was sick and miserable and 
 i was unable to bear creeping out of bed suddenly into the frost and 
 cold last winter was a hard winter but i have got over it all now 
 there were a few mild days as your honor no doubt knows the ice lay thickly on the lake as far one could see the people came from the town and walked upon it and they say there were dancing and skating upon it i believe and a great feasting the sound of 
 beautiful music came into my poor little room where i lay towards 
 evening when the moon rose beautifully though not yet in her full 
 splendor i glanced from my bed over the wide sea and there just 
 where the sea and sky met rose a curious white cloud i lay looking 
 at the cloud till i observed a little black spot in the middle of 
 it which gradually grew larger and larger and then i knew what it 
 meant i am old and experienced and although this token is not 
 often seen i knew it and a shuddering seized me twice in my life 
 had i seen this same thing and i knew that there would be an awful 
 storm with a spring tide which would overwhelm the poor people who were now out on the ice drinking dancing and making merry 
 young and old the whole city were there who was to warn them if no one noticed the sign or knew what it meant as i did i was so alarmed that i felt more strength and life than i had done for some time i got out of bed and reached the window i could not crawl any 
 farther from weakness and exhaustion but i managed to open the 
 window i saw the people outside running and jumping about on the ice i saw the beautiful flags waving in the wind i heard the boys 
 shouting hurrah and the lads and lasses singing and everything 
 full of merriment and joy but there was the white cloud with the 
 black spot hanging over them i cried out as loudly as i could but no 
 one heard me i was too far off from the people soon would the 
 storm burst the ice break and all who were on it be irretrievably 
 lost they could not hear me and to go to them was quite out of my 
 power oh if i could only get them safe on land then came the 
 thought as if from heaven that i would rather set fire to my bed 
 and let the house be burnt down than that so many people should 
 perish miserably i got a light and in a few moments the red flames 
 leaped up as a beacon to them i escaped fortunately as far as the 
 threshold of the door but there i fell down and remained i could 
 go no farther the flames rushed out towards me flickered on the 
 window and rose high above the roof the people on the ice became 
 aware of the fire and ran as fast as possible to help a poor sick 
 woman who as they thought was being burnt to death there was not one who did not run i heard them coming and i also at the same 
 time was conscious of a rush of air and a sound like the roar of heavy 
 artillery the spring flood was lifting the ice covering which 
 brake into a thousand pieces but the people had reached the where the sparks were flying round i had saved them all but i 
 suppose i could not survive the cold and fright so i came up here 
 to the gates of paradise i am told they are open to poor creatures 
 such as i am and i have now no house left on earth but i do not 
 think that will give me a claim to be admitted here 
 
 then the gates were opened and an angel led the old woman in she 
 had dropped one little straw out of her straw bed when she set it 
 on fire to save the lives of so many it had been changed into the 
 purest gold into gold that constantly grew and expanded into 
 flowers and fruit of immortal beauty 
 
 see said the angel pointing to the wonderful straw this is 
 what the poor woman has brought what dost thou bring i know thou hast accomplished nothing not even made a single brick even if 
 thou couldst return and at least produce so much very likely when 
 made the brick would be useless unless done with a good will 
 which is always something but thou canst not return to earth and i 
 can do nothing for thee 
 
 then the poor soul the old mother who had lived in the house on 
 the dyke pleaded for him she said his brother made all the stone 
 and bricks and sent them to me to build my poor little dwelling 
 which was a great deal to do for a poor woman like me could not all 
 these bricks and pieces be as a wall of stone to prevail for him it 
 is an act of mercy he is wanting it now and here is the very 
 fountain of mercy 
 
 then said the angel thy brother he who has been looked 
 upon as the meanest of you all he whose honest deeds to thee appeared so humble it is he who has sent you this heavenly gift 
 thou shalt not be turned away thou shalt have permission to stand without the gate and reflect and repent of thy life on earth but thou shalt not be admitted here until thou hast performed one good deed of repentance which will indeed for thee be something 
 
 i could have expressed that better thought the critic but he 
 did not say it aloud which for him was something after all

 richard m nixon 
 delivered september 
 my fellow americans 
 i come before you tonight as a candidate for the vice presidency and as a man whose honesty and integrity has been questioned 
 now the usual political thing to do when charges are made against you is to either ignore them or to deny them without giving details i believe had enough of that in the united states particularly with the present administration in washington to me the office of the vice presidency of the united states is a great office and i feel that the people have got to have confidence in the integrity of the men who run for that office and who might obtain it 
 i have a theory too that the best and only answer to a smear or to an honest misunderstanding of the facts is to tell the truth and why i am here tonight i want to tell you my side of the case sure that you have read the charge and heard it that i senator nixon took from a group of my supporters 
 now was that wrong and let me say that it was wrong i am saying it incidentally that it was wrong just not illegal because it a question of whether it was legal or illegal that enough the question is was it morally wrong i say that it was morally wrong if any of that went to senator nixon for my personal use i say that it was morally wrong if it was secretly given and secretly handled and i say that it was morally wrong if any of the contributors got special favors for the contributions that they made 
 and now to answer those questions let me say this not one cent of the or any other money of that type ever went to me for my personal use every penny of it was used to pay for political expenses that i did not think should be charged to the taxpayers of the united states it was not a secret fund as a matter of fact when i was on meet the press some of you may have seen it last sunday peter edson came up to me after the program and he said dick what about is fund we hear about and i said well there is no secret about it go out and see dana smith who was the administrator of the fund and i gave him edson his address and i said you will find that the purpose of the fund simply was to defray political expenses that i did not feel should be charged to the government and third let me point out and i want to make this particularly clear that no contributor to this fund no contributor to any of my campaigns has ever received any consideration that he would not have received as an ordinary constituent 
 i just believe in that and i can say that never while i have been in the senate of the united states as far as the people that contributed to this fund are concerned have i made a telephone call for them to an agency or have i gone down to an agency on their behalf and the records will show that the records which are in the hands of the administration 
 well then some of you will say and rightly well what did you use the fund for senator why did you have to have it let me tell you in just a word how a senate office operates first of all a senator gets a year in salary he gets enough money to pay for one trip a year a round trip that is for himself and his family between his home and washington and then he gets an allowance to handle the people that work in his office to handle his mail and the allowance for my state of california is enough to hire people and let me say incidentally that that allowance is not paid to the senator it is paid directly to the individuals that the senator puts on his pay roll but all of these people and all of these allowances are for strictly official business business for example when a constituent writes in and wants you to go down to the administration and get some information about his gi policy items of that type for example but there are other expenses that are not covered by the government and i think i can best discuss those expenses by asking you some questions 
 do you think that when i or any other senator makes a political speech has it printed should charge the printing of that speech and the mailing of that speech to the taxpayers do you think for example when i or any other senator makes a trip to his home state to make a purely political speech that the cost of that trip should be charged to the taxpayers do you think when a senator makes political broadcasts or political television broadcasts radio or television that the expense of those broadcasts should be charged to the taxpayers well i know what your answer is the same answer that audiences give me whenever i discuss this particular problem the answer is no the taxpayers be required to finance items which are not official business but which are primarily political business 
 well then the question arises you say well how do you pay for these and how can you do it legally and there are several ways that it can be done incidentally and it is done legally in the united states senate and in the congress the first way is to be a rich man i happen to be a rich man so i use that one another way that is used is to put your wife on the pay roll let me say incidentally that my opponent my opposite number for the vice presidency on the democratic ticket does have his wife on the pay roll and has had her on his pay roll for the past ten years now let me just say this that his business and not critical of him for doing that you will have to pass judgment on that particular point 
 but i have never done that for this reason i have found that there are so many deserving stenographers and secretaries in washington that needed the work that i just feel it was right to put my wife on the pay roll my sitting over here she is a wonderful stenographer she used to teach stenography and she used to teach shorthand in high school that was when i met her and i can tell you folks that worked many hours at night and many hours on saturdays and sundays in my office and done a fine job and i am proud to say tonight that in the six years i have been in the house and the senate of the united states pat nixon has never been on the government pay roll 
 what are other ways that these finances can be taken care of some who are lawyers and i happen to be a lawyer continue to practice law but i been able to do that i am so far away from california that i have been so busy with my senatorial work that i have not engaged in any legal practice and also as far as law practice is concerned it seemed to me that the relationship between an attorney and the client was so personal that you possibly represent a man as an attorney and then have an unbiased view when he presented his case to you in the event that he had one before government 
 and so i felt that the best way to handle these necessary political expenses of getting my message to the american people and the speeches i made the speeches i had printed for the most part concerned this one message of exposing this administration the communism in it the corruption in it the only way that i could do that was to accept the aid which people in my home state of california who contributed to my campaign and who continued to make these contributions after i was elected were glad to make 
 and let me say i am proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me for a special favor i am proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me to vote on a bill other than my own conscience would dictate and i am proud of the fact that the taxpayers by subterfuge or otherwise have never paid one dime for expenses which i thought were political and be charged to the taxpayers 
 let me say incidentally that some of you may say well that is all right senator your explanation but have you got any proof and like to tell you this evening that just an hour ago we received an independent audit of this entire fund i suggested to governor sherman adams who is the chief of staff of the dwight eisenhower campaign that an independent audit and legal report be obtained and i have that audit in my hands an audit made by the price waterhouse co firm and the legal opinion by gibson dunn crutcher lawyers in los angeles the biggest law firm and incidentally one of the best ones in los angeles 
 i am proud to be able to report to you tonight that this audit and this legal opinion is being forwarded to general eisenhower and like to read to you the opinion that was prepared by gibson dunn crutcher and based on all the pertinent laws and statutes together with the audit report prepared by the certified public accountants 
 it is our conclusion that senator nixon did not obtain any financial gain from the collection and disbursement of the fund by dana smith that senator nixon did not violate any federal or state law by reason of the operation of the fund and that neither the portion of the fund paid by dana smith directly to third persons nor the portion paid to senator nixon to reimburse him for designated office expenses constituted income to the senator which was either reportable or taxable as income under applicable tax laws

 now that my friends is not nixon speaking but an independent audit which was requested because i want the american people to know all the facts and i am not afraid of having independent people go in and check the facts and that is exactly what they did but then i realized that there are still some who may say and rightly so and let me say that i recognize that some will continue to smear regardless of what the truth may be but that there has been understandably some honest misunderstanding on this matter and there are some that will say well maybe you were able senator to fake the thing how can we believe what you say after all is there a possibility that maybe you got some sums in cash is there a possibility that you might have feathered your own nest and so now that i am going to do and incidentally this is unprecedented in the history of american politics i am going at this time to give to this television and radio audience a complete financial history everything earned everything spent everything i own and i want you to know the facts 
 have to start early i was born in our family was one of modest circumstances and most of my early life was spent in a store out in east whittier it was a grocery store one of those family enterprises the only reason we were able to make it go was because my mother and dad had five boys and we all worked in the store i worked my way through college and to a great extent through law school and then in probably the best thing that ever happened to me happened i married pat who is sitting over here we had a rather difficult time after we were married like so many of the young couples who may be listening to us i practiced law she continued to teach school 
 then in i went into the service let me say that my service record was not a particularly unusual one i went to the south pacific i guess entitled to a couple of battle stars i got a couple of letters of commendation but i was just there when the bombs were falling and then i returned returned to the united states and in i ran for the congress when we came out of the war pat and i pat during the war had worked as a stenographer and in a bank and as an economist for a government agency and when we came out the total of our savings from both my law practice her teaching and all the time i was in the war the total for that entire period was just a little less than every cent of that incidentally was in government bonds well where we start when i go into politics 
 now what have i earned since i went into politics well here it is jotted it down let me read the notes first of all i have had my salary as a congressman and as a senator second i have received a total in this past six years of from estates which were in my law firm at the time that i severed my connection with it and incidentally as i said before i have not engaged in any legal practice and have not accepted any fees from business that came into the firm after i went into politics i have made an average of approximately a year from nonpolitical speaking engagements and lectures 
 and then fortunately we have inherited little money pat sold her interest in her estate for and i inherited from my grandfather we lived rather modestly for four years we lived in an apartment in parkfairfax in alexandria virginia the rent was a month and we saved for the time that we could buy a house now that was what we took in what did we do with this money what do we have today to show for it this will surprise you because it is so little i suppose as standards generally go of people in public life 
 first of all got a house in washington which cost and on which we owe we have a house in whittier california which cost and on which we owe my folks are living there at the present time i have just in life insurance plus my gi policy which never been able to convert and which will run out in two years i have no life insurance whatever on pat i have no life insurance on our two youngsters tricia and julie i own a oldsmobile car we have our furniture we have no stocks and bonds of any type we have no interest of any kind direct or indirect in any business now what we have what do we owe 
 well in addition to the mortgage the mortgage on the house in washington the one on the house in whittier i owe to the riggs bank in washington with interest and percent i owe to my parents and the interest on that loan which i pay regularly because a part of the savings they made through the years they were working so hard i pay regularly percent interest and then i have a loan which i have on my life insurance 
 well about it what we have and what we owe it very much but pat and i have the satisfaction that every dime that got is honestly ours i should say this that pat have a mink coat but she does have a respectable republican cloth coat and i always tell her look good in anything 
 one other thing i probably should tell you because if i probably be saying this about me too we did get something a gift after the election a man down in texas heard pat on the radio mention the fact that our two youngsters would like to have a dog and believe it or not the day before we left on this campaign trip we got a message from union station in baltimore saying they had a package for us we went down to get it you know what it was it was a little cocker spaniel dog in a crate that he had sent all the way from texas black and white spotted and our little girl tricia the six year old named it checkers and you know the kids like all kids love the dog and i just want to say this right now that regardless of what they say about it gonna keep it 
 it easy to come before a nationwide audience and bare your life as done but i want to say some things before i conclude that i think most of you will agree on mr mitchell the chairman of the democratic national committee made this statement that if a man afford to be in the united states senate he run for the senate and i just want to make my position clear i agree with mr mitchell when he says that only a rich man should serve his government in the united states senate or in the congress i believe that represents the thinking of the democratic party and i know that it represent the thinking of the republican party 
 i believe that fine that a man like governor stevenson who inherited a fortune from his father can run for president but i also feel that essential in this country of ours that a man of modest means can also run for president because you know remember abraham lincoln you remember what he said god must have loved the common people he made so many of them 
 and now going to suggest some courses of conduct first of all you have read in the papers about other funds now mr stevenson apparently had a couple one of them in which a group of business people paid and helped to supplement the salaries of state employees here is where the money went directly into their pockets and i think that what mr stevenson should do should be to come before the american people as i have give the names of the people that contributed to that fund give the names of the people who put this money into their pockets at the same time that they were receiving money from their state government and see what favors if any they gave out for that 
 i condemn mr stevenson for what he did but until the facts are in there is a doubt that will be raised and as far as mr sparkman is concerned i would suggest the same thing had his wife on the pay roll i condemn him for that but i think that he should come before the american people and indicate what outside sources of income he has had i would suggest that under the circumstances both mr sparkman and mr stevenson should come before the american people as i have and make a complete financial statement as to their financial history and if they it will be an admission that they have something to hide and i think you will agree with me because folks remember a man to be president of the united states a man to be vice president of the united states must have the confidence of all the people and why doing what doing and why i suggest that mr stevenson and mr sparkman since they are under attack should do what doing 
 now let me say this i know that this is not the last of the smears in spite of my explanation tonight other smears will be made others have been made in the past and the purpose of the smears i know is this to silence me to make me let up well they just know who dealing with going to tell you this i remember in the dark days of the hiss case some of the same columnists some of the same radio commentators who are attacking me now and misrepresenting my position were violently opposing me at the time i was after alger hiss but i continued to fight because i knew i was right and i can say to this great television and radio audience that i have no apologies to the american people for my part in putting alger hiss where he is today and as far as this is concerned i intend to continue to fight 
 why do i feel so deeply why do i feel that in spite of the smears the misunderstanding the necessity for a man to come up here and bare his soul as i have why is it necessary for me to continue this fight and i want to tell you why because you see i love my country and i think my country is in danger and i think the only man that can save america at this time is the man running for president on my ticket dwight eisenhower you say why do i think it is in danger and i say look at the record seven years of the administration and happened six hundred million people lost to communists and a war in korea in which we have lost american casualties and i say to all of you that a policy that results in the loss of million people to the communists and a war that cost us american casualties good enough for america and i say that those in the state department that made the mistakes which caused that war and which resulted in those losses should be kicked out of the state department just as fast as we get them out of there 
 and let me say that i know mr stevenson do that because he defends the truman policy and i know that dwight eisenhower will do that and that he will give america the leadership that it needs take the problem of corruption read about the mess in washington mr stevenson clean it up because he was picked by the man truman under whose administration the mess was made 
 you trust the man who made the mess to clean it up truman and by the same token you trust the man who was picked by the man who made the mess to clean it up and stevenson and so i say eisenhower who owes nothing to truman nothing to the big city bosses he is the man that can clean up the mess in washington take communism i say that as far as that subject is concerned the danger is great to america in the hiss case they got the secrets which enabled them to break the american secret state department code they got secrets in the atomic bomb case which enabled them to get the secret of the atomic bomb five years before they would have gotten it by their own devices and i say that any man who called the alger hiss case a red herring fit to be president of the united states 
 i say that a man who like mr stevenson has and ridiculed the communist threat in the united states he said that they are phantoms among ourselves he has accused us that have attempted to expose the communists of looking for communists in the bureau of fisheries and wildlife i say that a man who says that qualified to be president of the united states and i say that the only man who can lead us in this fight to rid the government of both those who are communists and those who have corrupted this government is eisenhower because eisenhower you can be sure recognizes the problem and he knows how to deal with it 
 now let me that finally this evening i want to read to you just briefly excerpts from a letter which i received a letter which after all this is over no one can take away from us it reads as follows 
 dear senator nixon 
 since i am only years of age i vote in this presidential election but believe me if i could you and general eisenhower would certainly get my vote my husband is in the fleet marines in korea he a corpsman on the front lines and we have a two month old son never seen and i feel confident that with great americans like you and general eisenhower in the white house lonely americans like myself will be united with their loved ones now in korea i only pray to god that you be too late enclosed is a small check to help you in your campaign living on a month it is all i can afford at present but let me know what else i can do 
 folks a check for and one that i will never cash and just let me say this we hear a lot about prosperity these days but i say why we have prosperity built on peace rather than prosperity built on war why we have prosperity and an honest government in washington at the same time believe me we can and eisenhower is the man that can lead this crusade to bring us that kind of prosperity 
 and now finally i know that you wonder whether or not i am going to stay on the republican ticket or resign let me say this i believe that i ought to quit because not a quitter and incidentally not a quitter after all her name was patricia ryan and she was born on st day and you know the irish never quit but the decision my friends is not mine i would do nothing that would harm the possibilities of dwight eisenhower to become president of the united states and for that reason i am submitting to the republican national committee tonight through this television broadcast the decision which it is theirs to make let them decide whether my position on the ticket will help or hurt and i am going to ask you to help them decide wire and write the republican national committee whether you think i should stay on or whether i should get off and whatever their decision is i will abide by it 
 but just let me say this last word regardless of what happens going to continue this fight going to campaign up and down in america until we drive the crooks and the communists and those that defend them out of washington and remember folks eisenhower is a great man believe me a great man and a vote for eisenhower is a vote for good for america

 sergei ivanovich koznishev wanted a rest from mental work and instead of going abroad as he usually did he came toward the end of may to stay in the country with his brother in his judgment the best sort of life was a country life he had come now to enjoy such a life at his konstantin levin was very glad to have him especially as he did not expect his brother nikolai that summer but in spite of his affection and respect for sergei ivanovich konstantin levin was uncomfortable with his brother in the country it made him uncomfortable and it even annoyed him to see his attitude to the country to konstantin levin the country was the background of life that is of pleasures endeavors labor to sergei ivanovich the country meant on one hand rest from work on the other a valuable antidote to laxness an antidote which he took with satisfaction and a sense of its salutariness to konstantin levin the country was good because it afforded a field for labor of the usefulness of which there could be no doubt to sergei ivanovich the country was particularly good because there it was possible and fitting to do nothing moreover sergei attitude toward the people rather piqued konstantin sergei ivanovich used to say that he knew and liked the people and he often talked to the peasants which he knew how to do without affectation or condescension and from every such conversation he would deduce general conclusions in favor of the people and in confirmation of his knowing them konstantin levin did not like such an attitude toward the people to konstantin the people was simply the chief partner in the common labor and in spite of all the respect and the love almost like that of kinship he had for the peasant sucked in probably as he said himself with the milk of his peasant nurse konstantin as a fellow worker with them while sometimes enthusiastic over the vigor gentleness and justice of these men was very often when their common labors called for other qualities exasperated with the peasant for his carelessness slovenliness drunkenness and lying if he had been asked whether he liked or like the people konstantin levin would have been absolutely at a loss what to reply he liked and did not like the people just as he liked and did not like men in general of course being a goodhearted man he liked men more than he disliked them and so too with the people but like or dislike the people as something peculiar he could not not only because he lived with the people and all his interests were bound up with theirs but also because he regarded himself as a part of the people did not see any peculiar qualities or failings distinguishing himself from the people and could not contrast himself with them moreover although he had lived so long in the closest relations with the peasants as farmer and arbitrator and what was more as adviser the peasants trusted him and for forty verstas round they would come to ask his advice he had no definite views of the people and would have been as much at a loss to answer the question whether he knew the people as the question whether he liked them for him to say he knew the people would have been the same as to say he knew men he was continually watching and getting to know people of all sorts and among them peasants whom he regarded as good and interesting people and he was continually observing new points in them altering his former views of them and forming new ones 
 with sergei ivanovich it was quite the contrary just as he liked and praised a country life in comparison with the life he did not like so too he liked the people in contradistinction to the class of men he did not like and so too he knew the people as something distinct from and opposed to men in general in his methodical brain there were distinctly formulated certain aspects of peasant life deduced partly from that life itself but chiefly from contrast with other modes of life he never changed his opinion of the people and his sympathetic attitude toward them 
 in the discussions that arose between the brothers on their views of the people sergei ivanovich always got the better of his brother precisely because sergei ivanovich had definite ideas about the peasant his character his qualities and his tastes konstantin levin had no definite and unalterable idea on the subject and so in their arguments konstantin was readily convicted of contradicting himself 
 in sergei eyes his younger brother was a capital fellow with his heart in the right place as he expressed it in french but with a mind which though fairly quick was too much influenced by the impressions of the moment and consequently filled with contradictions with all the condescension of an elder brother he sometimes explained to him the true import of things but he derived little satisfaction from arguing with him because he got the better of him too easily 
 konstantin levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and culture as generous in the highest sense of the word and possessed of a special faculty for working for the public good but in the depths of his heart the older he became and the more intimately he knew his brother the more and more frequently the thought struck him that this faculty of working for the public good of which he felt himself utterly devoid was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of something not a lack of good honest noble desires and tastes but a lack of vital force of what is called heart of that impulse which drives a man to choose some one out of the innumerable paths of life and to care only for that one the better he knew his brother the more he noticed that sergei ivanovich and many other people who worked for the public welfare were not led by any impulse of the heart to care for the public good but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it was a right thing to take an interest in public affairs and consequently took an interest in them levin was confirmed in this conjecture by observing that his brother did not take questions affecting the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he did chess problems or the ingenious construction of a new machine 
 besides this konstantin levin was not at his ease with his brother because in the country especially in summertime levin was continually busy with work on the land and the long summer day was not long enough for him to get through all he had to do while sergei ivanovich was merely taking a holiday but though he was taking a holiday now that is to say he was doing no writing he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked to put into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him and liked to have someone listen to him his most usual and natural listener was his brother and so in spite of the friendliness and directness of their relations konstantin felt an awkwardness in leaving him alone sergei ivanovich liked to stretch himself on the grass in the sun and to lie so basking and chatting lazily 
 you believe he would say to his brother what a pleasure this rural laziness is to me not an idea in brain as empty as a drum 
 but konstantin levin found it dull sitting and listening to him especially when he knew that while he was away manure would be carted into fields not plowed ready for it and heaped up god knows how and the shares in the plows would not be screwed in so that they would come off and then his men would say the new plows were a silly invention and there was nothing like the old wooden plow and so on 
 come done enough trudging about in the heat sergei ivanovich would say to him 
 no i must just run round to the countinghouse for a minute levin would answer and would run off to the fields

 konstantin levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and culture as generous in the highest sense of the word and possessed of a special faculty for working for the public good but in the depths of his heart the older he became and the more intimately he knew his brother the more and more frequently the thought struck him that this faculty of working for the public good of which he felt himself utterly devoid was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of something not a lack of good honest noble desires and tastes but a lack of vital force of what is called heart of that impulse which drives a man to choose some one out of the innumerable paths of life and to care only for that one the better he knew his brother the more he noticed that sergei ivanovich and many other people who worked for the public welfare were not led by any impulse of the heart to care for the public good but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it was a right thing to take an interest in public affairs and consequently took an interest in them levin was confirmed in this conjecture by observing that his brother did not take questions affecting the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he did chess problems or the ingenious construction of a new machine 
 besides this konstantin levin was not at his ease with his brother because in the country especially in summertime levin was continually busy with work on the land and the long summer day was not long enough for him to get through all he had to do while sergei ivanovich was merely taking a holiday but though he was taking a holiday now that is to say he was doing no writing he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked to put into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him and liked to have someone listen to him his most usual and natural listener was his brother and so in spite of the friendliness and directness of their relations konstantin felt an awkwardness in leaving him alone sergei ivanovich liked to stretch himself on the grass in the sun and to lie so basking and chatting lazily 
 you believe he would say to his brother what a pleasure this rural laziness is to me not an idea in brain as empty as a drum 
 but konstantin levin found it dull sitting and listening to him especially when he knew that while he was away manure would be carted into fields not plowed ready for it and heaped up god knows how and the shares in the plows would not be screwed in so that they would come off and then his men would say the new plows were a silly invention and there was nothing like the old wooden plow and so on 
 come done enough trudging about in the heat sergei ivanovich would say to him 
 no i must just run round to the countinghouse for a minute levin would answer and would run off to the fields

 konstantin levin whose presence was needed in the plowland and the meadows had come to take his brother in the cabriolet 
 it was that time of the year the turning point of summer when the crops of the present year are a certainty when one begins to think of the sowing for next year and the mowing is at hand when the rye is all in ear though its ears are still light not yet full and it waves in billows in the wind when the green oats with tufts of yellow grass scattered here and there among it droop irregularly over the fields when the early buckwheat is already out and hiding the ground when the fallow lands trodden hard as stone by the cattle are over with paths left untouched by the plow when the odor from the dry manure heaps carted into the fields mingles at sunset with the smell of meadowsweet and on the lands the preserved meadows are a thick sea of grass waiting for the mowing with blackened heaps of sorrel stalks among it 
 it was the time when there comes a brief pause in the toil of the fields before the beginning of the labors of harvest every year recurring every year claiming all the thews the crop was a splendid one and bright hot summer days had set in with short dewy nights 
 the brothers had to drive through the woods to reach the meadows sergei ivanovich was all the while admiring the beauty of the woods which were a tangled mass of leaves pointing out to his brother now an old lime tree on the point of flowering dark on the shady side and brightly spotted with yellow stipules now the young shoots of this saplings brilliant with emerald konstantin levin did not like talking and hearing about the beauty of nature words for him took away the beauty of what he saw he assented to what his brother said but could not help thinking of other things when they came out of the woods all his attention was engrossed by the view of the fallow land on the upland in parts yellow with grass in parts trampled and checkered with furrows in parts dotted with ridges of manure and in parts even plowed a string of telegas was moving across it levin counted the telegas and was pleased that all that were wanted had been brought and at the sight of the meadows his thoughts passed to the mowing he always felt something peculiar moving him to the quick at haymaking on reaching the meadow levin stopped the horse 
 the morning dew was still lying on the thick undergrowth of the grass and that he might not get his feet wet sergei ivanovich asked his brother to drive him in the cabriolet up to the willow tree from which the perch were caught sorry as konstantin levin was to crush down his mowing grass he drove him into the meadow the high grass softly turned about the wheels and the legs leaving its seeds clinging to the wet axles and spokes of the wheels 
 his brother seated himself under a bush arranging his tackle while levin led the horse away tied him up and walked into the vast sea of grass unstirred by the wind the silky grass with its ripe seeds came almost to his waist in the riverside spots 
 crossing the meadow konstantin levin came out on the road and met an old man with a swollen eye carrying a swarming basket with bees 
 what taken a stray swarm fomich he asked 
 no indeed konstantin mitrich all we can do to keep our own this is the second new swarm that has flown away luckily the lads caught them they were plowing your field they unyoked the horses and galloped after them 
 well what do you say fomich start mowing or wait a bit 
 well now our to wait till st day but you always mow sooner well to be sure please god the good be plenty for the beasts 
 what do you think about the weather 
 in hands maybe even the weather will favor us 
 levin walked up to his brother 
 sergei ivanovich had caught nothing but he was not bored and seemed in the most cheerful frame of mind levin saw that stimulated by his conversation with the doctor he wanted to talk levin on the other hand would have liked to get home as soon as possible to give orders about getting together the mowers for next day and to set at rest his doubts about the mowing which greatly absorbed him 
 well be going he said 
 why be in such a hurry stay a little but how wet you are even though one catches nothing fine the best thing about every part of sport that one has to do with nature how exquisite this steely water is said sergei ivanovich these riverside banks always remind me of the riddle do you know it the grass says to the river we quiver and we quiver 
 i know the riddle answered levin cheerlessly

 chapter 
 
 do you know been thinking about you said sergei ivanovich beyond everything being done in the district according to what this doctor tells me a very intelligent fellow and as told you before i tell you again not right for you not to go to the meetings and to keep out of the zemstvo affairs entirely if decent people go into it of course bound to go all wrong we pay the money and it all goes in salaries and there are no schools nor district dressers nor midwives nor pharmacies nothing 
 well i did try you know levin said gently and unwillingly i and so no help for it 
 but why you i must own i make it out indifference incapacity i admit surely not simply laziness 
 none of those things tried and i see i can do nothing said levin 
 he had hardly grasped what his brother was saying looking toward the plowland across the river he made out something black but he could not distinguish whether it was a horse or the bailiff on horseback 
 why is it you can do nothing you made an attempt and succeed as you think and you give in how can you have so little ambition 
 ambition said levin stung to the quick by his words i understand if told me at college that other people understood the integral calculus and i then ambition would have come in but in this case one wants first to be convinced that one has certain abilities for this sort of business and especially that all this business is of great importance 
 what do you mean to say not of importance said sergei ivanovich stung to the quick in his turn by his considering of no importance anything that interested him and still more at his obviously paying little attention to what he was saying 
 i think it important it does not take hold of me i help it answered levin making out that what he saw was the bailiff and that the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants go off the plowed land they were turning the plow over can they have finished plowing he wondered 
 come really though said the elder brother with a frown on his handsome clever face a limit to everything very well to be original and genuine and to dislike everything hypocritical i know all about that but really what saying either has no meaning or it has a very wrong meaning how can you think it a matter of no importance whether the people whom you love as you assert 
 i never did assert it thought konstantin levin 
 die without help the ignorant peasant women starve the children and the people stagnate in darkness and are helpless in the hands of every village clerk while you have at your disposal a means of helping them and help them because to your mind of no importance 
 and sergei ivanovich put before him the dilemma either you are so undeveloped that you see all that you can do or you sacrifice your ease your vanity or whatever it is to do it 
 konstantin levin felt that there was no course open to him but to submit or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good and this mortified him and hurt his feelings 
 both he said resolutely i see that it is possible 
 what is it impossible if the money were properly laid out to provide medical aid 
 impossible as it seems to me for the four thousand square verstas of our district what with our undersnow waters and the storms and the work in the fields i see how it is possible to provide medical aid all over and besides i believe in medicine 
 oh well unfair i can quote to you thousands of instances but the schools at least 
 why have schools 
 what do you mean can there be two opinions of the advantage of education if a good thing for you a good thing for everyone 
 konstantin levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall and so he became heated and unconsciously blurted out the chief cause of his indifference to public business 
 perhaps it may all be very good but why should i worry myself about establishing dispensaries which i shall never make use of and schools to which i shall never send my children to which even the peasants want to send their children and to which no very firm faith that they ought to send them said he 
 sergei ivanovich was for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of the subject but he promptly made a new plan of attack 
 he was silent for a little drew out a hook threw it in again and turned to his brother smiling 
 come now in the first place the dispensary is needed we ourselves sent for the district doctor for agathya mikhailovna 
 oh well but i fancy her wrist will never be straight again 
 that remains to be proved next the peasant who can read and write is as a workman of more use and value to you 
 no you can ask anyone you like konstantin levin answered with decision the man that can read and write is much inferior as a workman and mending the highroads is an impossibility and as soon as they put up bridges stolen 
 still not the point said sergei ivanovich frowning he disliked contradiction and still more arguments that were continually skipping from one thing to another introducing new and disconnected points so that there was no knowing to which to reply let me say do you admit that education is a benefit for the people 
 yes i admit it said levin without thinking and he was conscious immediately that he had said what he did not think he felt that if he admitted that it would be proved that he had been talking meaningless rubbish how it would be proved he could not tell but he knew that this would inevitably be logically proved to him and he awaited the proofs 
 the argument turned out to be far simpler than konstantin levin had expected 
 if you admit that it is a benefit said sergei ivanovich then as an honest man you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with the movement and so wishing to work for it 
 but i still do not admit this movement to be good said konstantin levin reddening 
 what but you just said now 
 to say i admit being either good or possible 
 that you tell without making the trial 
 well supposing that is so said levin though he did not suppose so at all supposing that is so still i see all the same why i should worry myself about it 
 how so 
 no since we are talking explain it to me from the philosophical point of view said levin 
 i see where philosophy comes in said sergei ivanovich in a tone levin fancied as though he did not admit his right to talk about philosophy and that irritated levin 
 tell you then he said with heat i imagine the mainspring of all our actions is after all now in the zemstvo institutions i as a nobleman see nothing that could conduce to my prosperity the roads are not better and could not be better my horses carry me well enough over bad ones doctors and dispensaries are of no use to me a justice of the peace is of no use to me i never appeal to him and never shall appeal to him the schools are of no good to me but positively harmful as i told you for me the zemstvo institutions simply mean the liability of paying eighteen kopecks for every dessiatina of driving into the town sleeping with bedbugs and listening to all sorts of idiocy and blather and offers me no inducement 
 excuse me sergei ivanovich interposed with a smile did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs yet we did work for it 
 no konstantin levin broke in with still greater heat the emancipation of the serfs was a different matter there did come in one longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us all the decent people among us but to be a member of the zemstvo and discuss how many street cleaners are needed and how sewers shall be constructed in the town in which i live to serve on a jury and try a peasant who has stolen a flitch of bacon and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution and the president my old simpleton alioshka do you admit prisoner at the bar the fact of the removal of the bacon eh 
 konstantin levin had warmed to his subject and began mimicking the president and the alioshka it seemed to him that it was all to the point 
 but sergei ivanovich shrugged his shoulders 
 well what do you mean to say then 
 i simply mean to say that those rights that touch me my interest i shall always defend to the best of my ability that when raids were made on us students and the police read our letters i was ready to defend those rights to the utmost to defend my rights to education and freedom i can understand compulsory military service which affects my children my brothers and myself i am ready to deliberate on what concerns me but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of money or judging the alioshka that i understand and i do it 
 konstantin levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech had burst open sergei ivanovich smiled 
 but tomorrow be your turn to be tried would it have suited your tastes better to be tried in the old criminal court 
 not going to be tried i murder anybody and no need of it well i tell you what he went on flying off again to a subject quite beside the point our district and all the rest of it just like the birch saplings we stick in the ground as we would do it on trinity day to look like a copse which has grown up of itself in europe and i gush over these birch saplings and believe in them 
 sergei ivanovich merely shrugged his shoulders as though to express his wonder how the birch saplings had come into their argument at that point though he did really understand at once what his brother meant 
 excuse me but you know one really argue in that way he observed 
 but konstantin levin wanted to justify himself for the failing of which he was conscious of a lack of zeal for the public welfare and he went on 
 i imagine konstantin said that no sort of activity is likely to be lasting if it is not founded on a universal principle a philosophical principle he said repeating the word philosophical with determination as though wishing to show that he had as much right as anyone else to talk of philosophy 
 sergei ivanovich smiled he too has a philosophy of his own at the service of his natural tendencies he thought 
 come better let philosophy alone he said the chief problem of the philosophy of all ages consists precisely in finding that indispensable connection which exists between individual and social interests but not to the point what is to the point is a correction i must make in your comparison the birches are not simply stuck in but some are sown and some are planted and one must deal carefully with them only those peoples that have an intuitive sense of of importance and significance in their institutions and know how to value them who have a future before them only those peoples that one can truly call historical 
 and sergei ivanovich carried the subject into the regions of philosophical history where konstantin levin could not follow him and showed him all the incorrectness of his outlook 
 as for your dislike of it excuse my saying so simply our russian sloth and old serfowners ways and convinced that in you a temporary error and will pass 
 konstantin was silent he felt himself vanquished on all sides but he felt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible to his brother only he could not make up his mind whether it was unintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his meaning clearly or because his brother would not or could not understand him but he did not pursue the speculation and without replying he fell to musing on a quite different and personal matter 
 sergei ivanovich wound up the last line unhitched the horse and they drove off

 the personal matter that absorbed levin during his conversation with his brother was this once the year previous he had gone to look at the mowing and being made very angry by the bailiff he had had recourse to his favorite means for regaining his temper he had taken a scythe from a peasant and begun mowing 
 he liked the work so much that he had several times tried his hand at mowing since he had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house and this year ever since the early spring he had cherished a plan for mowing for whole days together with the peasants ever since his arrival he had been in doubt as to whether to mow or not he was loath to leave his brother alone all day long and he was afraid his brother would laugh at him about it but as he drove into the meadow and recalled the sensations of mowing he came near deciding that he would go mowing after the irritating discussion with his brother he pondered over this intention again 
 i must have physical exercise or my certainly be ruined he thought and he determined he would go mowing however awkward he might feel about it with his brother or the peasants 
 toward evening konstantin levin went to his countinghouse gave directions as to the work to be done and sent about the village to summon the mowers for the morrow to cut the hay in kalinov meadow the largest and best of his grasslands 
 and send my scythe please to tit for him to set it and bring it round tomorrow i may do some mowing myself too he said trying not to be embarrassed 
 the bailiff smiled and said 
 yes sir 
 at tea the same evening levin said to his brother too 
 i fancy the fine weather will last said he tomorrow i shall start mowing 
 so fond of that form of field labor said sergei ivanovich 
 awfully fond of it i sometimes mow myself with the peasants and tomorrow i want to try mowing the whole day 
 sergei ivanovich lifted his head and looked with curiosity at his brother 
 how do you mean just like one of the peasants all day long 
 yes very pleasant said levin 
 splendid as exercise only hardly be able to stand it said sergei ivanovich without a shade of irony 
 tried it hard work at first but you get into it i dare say i shall manage to keep it up 
 oh so it but tell me how do the peasants look at it i suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their being such a queer fish 
 no i think so but so delightful and at the same time such hard work that one has no time to think about it 
 but how will you do about dining with them to send you a bottle of lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward 
 no simply come home at the time of their noonday rest 
 next morning konstantin levin got up earlier than usual but he was detained giving directions on the farm and when he reached the mowing grass the mowers were already at their second swath 
 from the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below with the grayish swaths and the black heaps of coats taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had started cutting 
 gradually as he rode toward the meadow the peasants came into sight some in coats some in their shirts mowing one behind another in a long string each swinging his scythe in his own way he counted of them 
 they were mowing slowly over the uneven parts of the meadow where there had been an old dam levin recognized some of his own men here was old iermil in a very long white smock bending forward to swing a scythe there was a young fellow vaska who had been a coachman of taking every swath with a wide sweep here too was tit preceptor in the art of mowing a thin little peasant he went on ahead and cut his wide swath without bending as though playing with his scythe 
 levin got off his mare and fastening her up by the roadside went to meet tit who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it him 
 ready sir like a razor it cuts of itself said tit taking off his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe 
 levin took the scythe and began trying it as they finished their swaths the mowers hot and came out into the road one after another and smirking greeted the master they all stared at him but no one made any remark till a tall old man with a wrinkled beardless face wearing a short sheepskin jacket came out into the road and accosted him 
 now master once take hold of the rope no letting go he said and levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers 
 try not to let it go he said taking his stand behind tit and waiting for the time to begin 
 repeated the old man 
 tit made room and levin started behind him the grass was short close to the road and levin who had not done any mowing for a long while and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him cut badly for the first moments though he swung his scythe vigorously behind him he heard voices 
 not set right too high see how he has to stoop to it said one 
 press more on the heel of the scythe said another 
 never mind get on all right the old man resumed see made a start you swing it too wide tire yourself out the master sure does his best for himself but see the grass missed out for such work us fellows would catch it 
 the grass became lusher and levin listening without answering followed tit trying to do the best he could they moved a hundred paces tit kept moving on without stopping nor showing the slightest weariness but levin was already beginning to fear he would not be able to keep it up so tired was he 
 he felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his strength and was making up his mind to ask tit to stop but at that very moment tit stopped of his own accord and stooping down picked up some grass rubbed his scythe and began whetting it levin straightened himself and drawing a deep breath looked round behind him came a peasant and he too was evidently tired for he stopped at once without waiting to mow up to levin and began whetting his scythe tit sharpened his scythe and and they went on 
 the next time it was just the same tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his scythe without stopping or showing signs of weariness levin followed him trying not to get left behind and he found it harder and harder the moment came when he felt he had no strength left but at that very moment tit stopped and whetted the scythes 
 so they mowed the first row and this long row seemed particularly hard work to levin but when the end was reached and tit shouldering his scythe began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by his heels in the cut grass and levin walked back in the same way over the space he had cut in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over his face and fell in drops down his nose and drenched his back as though he had been soaked in water he felt very happy what delighted him particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out 
 his pleasure was only disturbed by his swath not being well cut i will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body he thought comparing swath which looked as if it had been cut along a cord with his own scattered and irregularly lying grass 
 the first swath as levin noticed tit had mowed especially quickly probably wishing to put his master to the test and the swath happened to be a long one the next swaths were easier but still levin had to strain every nerve not to drop behind the peasants 
 he thought of nothing wished for nothing save not to be left behind the peasants and to do his work as well as possible he heard nothing save the swish of scythes and saw before him upright figure mowing away the curve of the cut grass the grass and flowers slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his scythe and ahead of him the end of the swath where would come the rest 
 suddenly in the midst of his toil without understanding what it was or whence it came he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot moist shoulders he glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the scythes a heavy lowering storm cloud had blown up and big raindrops were falling some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on others just like levin himself merely shrugged their shoulders enjoying the pleasant coolness of it 
 another swath and yet another swath followed long swaths and short swaths with good grass and with poor grass levin lost all sense of time and could not have told whether it were late or early now a change began to come over his work which gave him immense satisfaction in the midst of his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was doing and it all came easy to him and at those same moments his swath was almost as smooth and well cut as but as soon as he recollected what he was doing and began trying to do better he was at once conscious of all the difficulty of his task and the swath was badly mown 
 on finishing yet another swath he would have gone back to the top of the meadow again to begin the next but tit stopped and going up to the old man said something in a low voice to him they both looked at the sun what are they talking about and why he go back thought levin without guessing that the peasants had been mowing no less than four hours without stopping and that it was time for their lunch 
 lunch sir said the old man 
 is it really time lunch it is then 
 levin gave his scythe to tit and together with the peasants who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass slightly sprinkled with rain to get their bread from the heap of coats he went toward his horse only then did he suddenly awake to the fact that he had been wrong about the weather and that the rain was drenching his hay 
 the hay will be spoiled he said 
 not a bit of it sir mow in the rain and rake in fine weather said the old man 
 levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee 
 sergei ivanovich was just getting up when he had drunk his coffee levin rode back again to the mowing before sergei ivanovich had had time to dress and come down to the dining room

 after lunch levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as before but stood between the old man who had accosted him jocosely and now invited him to be his neighbor and a young peasant who had only been married in the autumn and who was mowing this summer for the first time 
 the old man holding himself erect moved in front with his feet turned out taking long regular strides and with a precise and regular action which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging arms in walking as though it were in play he laid down the high even swath of grass it was as though it were not he but the sharp scythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass 
 behind levin came the lad mishka his comely youthful face with a twist of fresh grass bound round his hair was all working with effort but whenever anyone looked at him he smiled he would clearly have died sooner than own it was hard work for him 
 
 levin kept between them in the very heat of the day the mowing did not seem such hard work to him the perspiration with which he was drenched cooled him while the sun that burned his back his head and his arms bare to the elbow gave a vigor and dogged energy to his labor and more and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness when it was possible not to think of what one was doing the scythe cut of itself these were happy moments still more delightful were the moments when they reached the stream where the swaths ended and the old man rubbed his scythe with the wet thick grass rinsed its blade in the fresh water of the stream ladled out a little in a whetstone case and offered levin a drink 
 what do you say to my kvass eh good eh he would say winking 
 and truly levin had never drunk any liquor as good as this warm water with green bits floating in it and a taste of rust from the tin whetstone case and immediately after this came the delicious slow saunter with his hand on the scythe during which he could wipe away the streaming sweat take deep breaths of air and look about at the long string of mowers and at what was happening around in the forest and the field 
 the longer levin mowed the oftener he felt the moments of unconsciousness in which it seemed that it was not his hands which swung the scythe but that the scythe was moving together with itself a body full of life and consciousness of its own and as though by magic without thinking of it the work turned out regular and of itself these were the most blissful moments 
 it was only hard work when he had to break off the motion which had become unconscious and to think when he had to mow round a hummock or an unweeded tuft of sorrel the old man did this easily when a hummock came he changed his action and at one time with the heel and at another with the tip of his scythe clipped the hummock round both sides with short strokes and while he did this he kept looking about and watching what came into his view at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or offered it to levin then he flung away a twig with the blade of the scythe then he looked at a nest from which the bird flew just under the scythe or caught a snake that crossed his path and lifting it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to levin and threw it away 
 for both levin and the young peasant behind him such changes of position were difficult both of them repeating over and over again the same strained movement were in a perfect frenzy of toil and were incapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what was before them 
 levin did not notice how time was passing if he had been asked how long he had been working he would have said half an hour yet it was getting on to dinnertime as they were walking back over the cut grass the old man called attention to the little girls and boys who were coming from different directions hardly visible through the long grass and along the road toward the mowers carrying sacks of bread that stretched their little arms and lugging small pitchers of kvass stopped up with rags 
 at the little doodlebugs crawling he said pointing to them and he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun 
 they mowed two more swaths the old man stopped 
 come master dinnertime he said decidedly and on reaching the stream the mowers moved off across the swaths toward their pile of coats where the children who had brought their dinners were sitting waiting for them the peasants gathered those who came from afar under their telegas those who lived near under a willow bush covered with grass 
 levin sat down by them he felt disinclined to go away 
 all constraint with the master had disappeared long ago the peasants got ready for dinner some washed the young lads bathed in the stream others made a place comfortable for a rest untied their sacks of bread and uncovered the pitchers of kvass the old man crumbled up some bread in a cup stirred it with the handle of a spoon poured water on it from his whetstone case broke up some more bread and having seasoned it with salt he turned to the east to say his prayer 
 come master taste my sop said he kneeling down before the cup 
 the sop was so good that levin gave up the idea of going home for dinner he ate with the old man and talked to him about his family affairs taking the keenest interest in them and told him about his own affairs and all the circumstances that could be of interest to the old man he felt much nearer to him than to his brother and could not help smiling at the affection he felt for this man when the old man got up again said his prayer and lay down under a bush putting some grass under his head for a pillow levin did the same and in spite of the clinging flies that were so persistent in the sunshine and the midges that tickled his hot face and body he fell asleep at once and only waked when the sun had passed to the other side of the bush and reached him the old man had been awake a long while and was sitting up whetting the scythes of the younger lads 
 levin looked about him and hardly recognized the place everything was so changed the immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was sparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance with its lines of already grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun and the bushes about the river mowed around and the river itself not visible before now gleaming like steel in its bends and the moving ascending peasants and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of the meadow and the hawks hovering over the stripped meadow all was perfectly new raising himself levin began considering how much had been cut and how much more could still be done that day 
 the work done was exceptionally great for men they had cut the whole of the big meadow which had in the years of corvee taken thirty scythes two days to mow only the corners remained to do where the swaths were short but levin felt a longing to get as much mowing done that day as possible and was vexed with the sun sinking so quickly in the sky he felt no weariness all he wanted was to get his work done more and more quickly and as much of it as possible 
 could we cut the mashkin upland too what do you think he said to the old man 
 as god wills the not high a little vodka for the lads 
 at the afternoon rest when they were sitting down again and those who smoked had lighted their pipes the old man told the men that the mashkin to be cut be vodka 
 why not cut it come on tit look sharp we can eat at night come on voices cried out and eating up their bread the mowers went back to work 
 come lads keep it up said tit and ran on ahead almost at a trot 
 get along get along said the old man hurrying after him and easily overtaking him mow thee down look out 
 and young and old mowed away as though they were racing with one another but however fast they worked they did not spoil the grass and the swaths were laid just as neatly and exactly the little piece left uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes the last of the mowers were just ending their swaths while the foremost snatched up their coats onto their shoulders and crossed the road toward the mashkin upland 
 the sun was already sinking among the trees when they went with their jingling whetstone cases into the wooded ravine of the mashkin upland the grass was up to their waists in the middle of the hollow lush tender and feathery spotted here and there among the trees with wild heartsease 
 after a brief consultation whether to take the swaths lengthwise or diagonally prokhor iermilin also a doughty mower a huge peasant went on ahead he went up to the top turned back again and started mowing and they all proceeded to form in line behind him going downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge of the forest the sun sank behind the forest the dew was falling by now the mowers were in the sun only on the hillside but below where a mist was rising and on the opposite side they mowed into the fresh dewy shade the work went rapidly 
 the spicily fragrant grass cut with a succulent sound was at once laid in high swaths the mowers from all sides brought closer together in the short swath kept urging one another on to the sound of jingling whetstone cases and clanging scythes and the hiss of the whetstones sharpening them and shouts 
 levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man the old man who had put on his short sheepskin jacket was just as jocose and free in his movements among the trees they were continually cutting with their scythes the birch mushrooms swollen fat in the succulent grass but the old man bent down every time he came across a mushroom picked it up and put it in his bosom another present for my old woman he would say as he did so 
 easy as it was to mow the wet lush grass it was hard work going up and down the steep sides of the ravine but this did not trouble the old man swinging his scythe just as ever and moving his feet in their big plaited bast sandals with firm short steps he climbed slowly up the steep place and though his breeches hanging out below his smock and his whole frame trembled with effort he did not miss one blade of grass or one mushroom on his way and kept making jokes with the peasants and levin levin walked after him and often thought he must fall as he climbed with a scythe up a steep hillock where it would have been hard work to clamber even without the scythe but he climbed up and did what he had to do he felt as though some external force were moving him

 the work done was exceptionally great for men they had cut the whole of the big meadow which had in the years of corvee taken thirty scythes two days to mow only the corners remained to do where the swaths were short but levin felt a longing to get as much mowing done that day as possible and was vexed with the sun sinking so quickly in the sky he felt no weariness all he wanted was to get his work done more and more quickly and as much of it as possible 
 could we cut the mashkin upland too what do you think he said to the old man 
 as god wills the not high a little vodka for the lads 
 at the afternoon rest when they were sitting down again and those who smoked had lighted their pipes the old man told the men that the mashkin to be cut be vodka 
 why not cut it come on tit look sharp we can eat at night come on voices cried out and eating up their bread the mowers went back to work 
 come lads keep it up said tit and ran on ahead almost at a trot 
 get along get along said the old man hurrying after him and easily overtaking him mow thee down look out 
 and young and old mowed away as though they were racing with one another but however fast they worked they did not spoil the grass and the swaths were laid just as neatly and exactly the little piece left uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes the last of the mowers were just ending their swaths while the foremost snatched up their coats onto their shoulders and crossed the road toward the mashkin upland 
 the sun was already sinking among the trees when they went with their jingling whetstone cases into the wooded ravine of the mashkin upland the grass was up to their waists in the middle of the hollow lush tender and feathery spotted here and there among the trees with wild heartsease 
 after a brief consultation whether to take the swaths lengthwise or diagonally prokhor iermilin also a doughty mower a huge peasant went on ahead he went up to the top turned back again and started mowing and they all proceeded to form in line behind him going downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge of the forest the sun sank behind the forest the dew was falling by now the mowers were in the sun only on the hillside but below where a mist was rising and on the opposite side they mowed into the fresh dewy shade the work went rapidly 
 the spicily fragrant grass cut with a succulent sound was at once laid in high swaths the mowers from all sides brought closer together in the short swath kept urging one another on to the sound of jingling whetstone cases and clanging scythes and the hiss of the whetstones sharpening them and shouts 
 levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man the old man who had put on his short sheepskin jacket was just as jocose and free in his movements among the trees they were continually cutting with their scythes the birch mushrooms swollen fat in the succulent grass but the old man bent down every time he came across a mushroom picked it up and put it in his bosom another present for my old woman he would say as he did so 
 easy as it was to mow the wet lush grass it was hard work going up and down the steep sides of the ravine but this did not trouble the old man swinging his scythe just as ever and moving his feet in their big plaited bast sandals with firm short steps he climbed slowly up the steep place and though his breeches hanging out below his smock and his whole frame trembled with effort he did not miss one blade of grass or one mushroom on his way and kept making jokes with the peasants and levin levin walked after him and often thought he must fall as he climbed with a scythe up a steep hillock where it would have been hard work to clamber even without the scythe but he climbed up and did what he had to do he felt as though some external force were moving him

 the mashkin upland was mown the last swaths finished the peasants had put on their coats and were gaily trudging home levin got on his horse and parting regretfully from the peasants rode homeward on the hillside he looked back he could not see them in the mist that had risen from the valley he could only hear their rough voices their laughter and the sound of clanking scythes 
 sergei ivanovich had long ago finished dinner and was drinking iced lemonade in his own room looking through the reviews and papers which he had just received by post when levin rushed into the room talking merrily with his wet and matted hair sticking to his forehead and his back and chest grimed and moist 
 we mowed the whole meadow oh it is fine wonderful and how have you been getting on said levin completely forgetting the disagreeable conversation of the previous day 
 dear me what you look like said sergei ivanovich for the first moment looking round with some dissatisfaction and the door do shut the door he cried you must have let in a dozen at least 
 sergei ivanovich could not endure flies and in his own room he never opened the window except at night and carefully kept the door shut 
 not one on my honor but if i have catch them you believe what a pleasure mowing is how have you spent the day 
 very well but have you really been mowing the whole day i expect as hungry as a wolf kouzma has got everything ready for you 
 no i feel hungry even i had something to eat there but go and wash 
 yes go along go along and come to you directly said sergei ivanovich shaking his head as he looked at his brother go along make haste he added smiling and gathering up his books he prepared to go too he too felt suddenly and disinclined to leave his side but what did you do while it was raining 
 rain why there was scarcely a drop come directly so you had a good day too and levin went off to change his clothes 
 five minutes later the brothers met in the dining room although it seemed to levin that he was not hungry and he sat down to dinner simply so as not to hurt feelings yet when he began to eat the dinner struck him as extraordinarily good sergei ivanovich watched him with a smile 
 oh by the way a letter for you said he kouzma bring it from below please and mind you shut the doors 
 the letter was from oblonsky levin read it aloud oblonsky wrote to him from peterburg i have had a letter from dolly at ergushovo and everything seems going wrong there do ride over and see her please help her with advice you know all about it she will be so glad to see you quite alone poor thing my and all of them are still abroad 
 capital i will certainly ride over to her said levin or go together such a good woman she 
 not far from here then 
 thirty verstas or perhaps forty but a capital road it will be a capital drive 
 i shall be delighted said sergei ivanovich still smiling 
 the sight of his younger appearance had immediately put him in a good humor 
 well you have an appetite he said looking at his sunburned face and neck bent over the plate 
 splendid you imagine what an effective remedy it is for every sort of foolishness i want to enrich medicine with a new word arbeitskur 
 well but you need it i should fancy 
 no but for all sorts of nervous invalids 
 yes it ought to be tried i had meant to come to the mowing to look at you but it was so unbearably hot that i got no further than the forest i sat there a little and went on by the forest to the village met your old nurse and sounded her as to the view of you as far as i can make out they approve of this she said not a work altogether i fancy that in the ideas there are very clear and definite notions of certain as they call it gentlemanly lines of action and they sanction the moving outside bounds clearly laid down in their ideas 
 maybe so but anyway a pleasure such as i have never known in my life and no harm in it you know is there answered levin i help it if they like it though i do believe all right eh 
 altogether pursued sergei ivanovich satisfied with your day 
 quite satisfied we cut the whole meadow and i made friends with such a splendid old man there you fancy how delightful he was 
 well so satisfied with your day and so am i first i solved two chess problems and one a very pretty one a pawn opening show it to you and then i thought over our conversation of yesterday 
 eh our conversation of yesterday said levin blissfully dropping his eyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his dinner and absolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation of yesterday had been about 
 i think you are partly right our difference of opinion amounts to this that you make the mainspring while i contend that interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain degree of advancement possibly you are right too that action founded on material interest would be more desirable you are altogether as the french say too primesautire a nature you must have intense energetic action or nothing 
 levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single word and did not want to understand he was only afraid his brother might ask him some question which would make it evident he had not heard 
 so what i think it is my dear boy said sergei ivanovich touching him on the shoulder 
 yes of course but do you know i stand up for my view answered levin with a guilty childlike smile whatever was it i was disputing about he wondered of course right and right and all only i must go round to the countinghouse and see to things he got up stretching and smiling 
 sergei ivanovich smiled too 
 if you want to go out go together he said disinclined to be parted from his brother who seemed positively breathing out freshness and energy come go to the countinghouse if you have to go there 
 oh heavens shouted levin so loudly that sergei ivanovich was quite frightened 
 what what is the matter 
 agathya hand said levin slapping himself on the head positively forgotten her 
 much better 
 well anyway run down to her before time to get your hat on be back 
 and he ran downstairs clattering with his heels like a spring rattle

 chapter 
 
 toward the end of may when everything had been more or less satisfactorily arranged she received her answer to her complaints of the disorganized state of things in the country he wrote begging her forgiveness for not having thought of everything before and promised to come down at the first chance this chance did not present itself and till the beginning of june darya alexandrovna stayed alone in the country 
 on the sunday in st week darya alexandrovna drove to mass to have all her children take the sacrament darya alexandrovna in her intimate philosophical talks with her sister her mother and her friends very often astonished them by the freedom of her views in regard to religion she had a strange religion all her own of the transmigration of souls in which she had firm faith troubling herself little about the dogmas of the church but in her family she was strict in carrying out all that was required by the church and not merely in order to set an example but with all her heart the fact that the children had not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried her extremely and with the full approval and sympathy of matriona philimonovna she decided that this should take place now in the summer 
 for several days before darya alexandrovna was busily deliberating on how to dress all the children frocks were made or altered and washed seams and flounces were let out buttons were sewn on and ribbons got ready one dress which the english governess had undertaken cost darya alexandrovna much loss of temper the english governess in altering it had made the seams in the wrong place had taken up the sleeves too much and altogether spoiled the dress it was so narrow on shoulders that it was quite painful to look at her but matriona philimonovna had the happy thought of putting in gussets and adding a little the dress was set right but there was nearly a quarrel with the english governess in the morning however all was happily arranged and about nine the time at which they had asked the priest to wait for them for the mass the children in their new dresses stood with beaming faces on the step before the carriage waiting for their mother 
 in the carriage instead of the restive raven they had harnessed thanks to the representations of matriona philimonovna the horse brownie and darya alexandrovna delayed by anxiety over her own attire came out and got in dressed in a white muslin gown 
 darya alexandrovna had done her hair and dressed with care and excitement in the old days she had dressed for her own sake to look pretty and be admired later on as she got older dress became more and more distasteful to her she saw that she was losing her good looks but now she began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again now she did not dress for her own sake nor for the sake of her own beauty but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creatures she might not spoil the general effect and looking at herself for the last time in the looking glass she was satisfied with herself she looked well not as well as she wished to look in the old days at a ball but well for the object she now had in view 
 in the church there was no one but the peasants the servants and their womenfolk but darya alexandrovna saw or fancied she saw the sensation produced by her children and herself the children were not only beautiful to look at in their smart little dresses but they were charming in the way they behaved aliosha it is true did not stand quite correctly he kept turning round trying to look at his little jacket from behind but all the same he was wonderfully sweet tania behaved like a person and looked after the little ones and the smallest lily was bewitching in her naive astonishment at everything and it was difficult not to smile when after taking the sacrament she said in english please some more 
 on the way home the children felt that something solemn had happened and were very sedate 
 everything went happily at home too but at lunch grisha began whistling and what was worse was disobedient to the english governess and was forbidden to have any tart darya alexandrovna would not have let things go as far as the punishment on such a day had she been present but she had to support the english authority and she upheld her decision that grisha should have no tart this rather spoiled the general good humor 
 grisha cried declaring that nikolinka had whistled too yet was not punished and that he crying for the tart he care but at being unjustly treated this was really too tragic and darya alexandrovna made up her mind to persuade the english governess to forgive grisha and she went to speak to her but on her way as she passed the drawing room she beheld a scene filling her heart with such pleasure that the tears came into her eyes and she forgave the delinquent herself 
 the culprit was sitting at the window in the corner of the drawing room beside him was standing tania with a plate on the pretext of wanting to give some dinner to her dolls she had asked the permission to take her share of tart to the nursery and had taken it instead to her brother while still weeping over the injustice of his punishment he was eating the tart and kept saying through his sobs eat yourself eat it together together 
 tania had at first been under the influence of her pity for grisha then of a sense of her noble action and tears were standing in her eyes too but she did not refuse and ate her share 
 on catching sight of their mother they were dismayed but looking into her face they saw they were not doing wrong they burst out laughing and with their mouths full of tart they began wiping their smiling lips with their hands and smearing their radiant faces all over with tears and jam 
 mercy your new white frock tania grisha said their mother trying to save the frock but with tears in her eyes smiling a blissful rapturous smile 
 the new frocks were taken off and orders were given for the little girls to have their blouses put on and the boys their old jackets and the wide droshky to be harnessed with brownie to the annoyance again in the shafts to drive out for mushroom picking and bathing a roar of delighted shrieks arose in the nursery and never ceased till they had set off for the bathing place 
 they gathered a whole basketful of mushrooms even lily found a birch mushroom it had always happened before that miss hoole found them and pointed them out to her but this time she found a big one quite by herself and there was a general scream of delight lily has found a mushroom 
 then they reached the river put the horses under the birch trees and went to the bathing place the coachman terentii hitched the horses who kept whisking away the horseflies to a tree and treading down the grass lay down in the shade of a birch and smoked his shag while the shrieks of delight of the children floated across to him from the bathing place 
 though it was hard work to look after all the children and restrain their pranks though it was difficult too to keep head and not mix up all the stockings little breeches and shoes for the different legs and to undo and to do up again all the tapes and buttons darya alexandrovna who had always liked bathing herself and believed it to be very good for the children enjoyed nothing so much as bathing with all the children to go over all those fat little legs pulling on their stockings to take in her arms and dip those little naked bodies and to hear their screams of delight and alarm to see the breathless faces with scared and happy eyes of all her splashing cherubs was a great pleasure to her 
 when half the children had been dressed some peasant women in holiday dress out picking herbs came up to the bathing shed and stopped shyly matriona philimonovna called one of them and handed her a sheet and a shirt that had dropped into the water for her to dry them and darya alexandrovna began to talk to the women at first they laughed behind their hands and did not understand her questions but soon they grew bolder and began to talk winning darya heart at once by the genuine admiration of the children that they showed

 chapter 
 
 toward the end of may when everything had been more or less satisfactorily arranged she received her answer to her complaints of the disorganized state of things in the country he wrote begging her forgiveness for not having thought of everything before and promised to come down at the first chance this chance did not present itself and till the beginning of june darya alexandrovna stayed alone in the country 
 on the sunday in st week darya alexandrovna drove to mass to have all her children take the sacrament darya alexandrovna in her intimate philosophical talks with her sister her mother and her friends very often astonished them by the freedom of her views in regard to religion she had a strange religion all her own of the transmigration of souls in which she had firm faith troubling herself little about the dogmas of the church but in her family she was strict in carrying out all that was required by the church and not merely in order to set an example but with all her heart the fact that the children had not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried her extremely and with the full approval and sympathy of matriona philimonovna she decided that this should take place now in the summer 
 for several days before darya alexandrovna was busily deliberating on how to dress all the children frocks were made or altered and washed seams and flounces were let out buttons were sewn on and ribbons got ready one dress which the english governess had undertaken cost darya alexandrovna much loss of temper the english governess in altering it had made the seams in the wrong place had taken up the sleeves too much and altogether spoiled the dress it was so narrow on shoulders that it was quite painful to look at her but matriona philimonovna had the happy thought of putting in gussets and adding a little the dress was set right but there was nearly a quarrel with the english governess in the morning however all was happily arranged and about nine the time at which they had asked the priest to wait for them for the mass the children in their new dresses stood with beaming faces on the step before the carriage waiting for their mother 
 in the carriage instead of the restive raven they had harnessed thanks to the representations of matriona philimonovna the horse brownie and darya alexandrovna delayed by anxiety over her own attire came out and got in dressed in a white muslin gown 
 darya alexandrovna had done her hair and dressed with care and excitement in the old days she had dressed for her own sake to look pretty and be admired later on as she got older dress became more and more distasteful to her she saw that she was losing her good looks but now she began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again now she did not dress for her own sake nor for the sake of her own beauty but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creatures she might not spoil the general effect and looking at herself for the last time in the looking glass she was satisfied with herself she looked well not as well as she wished to look in the old days at a ball but well for the object she now had in view 
 in the church there was no one but the peasants the servants and their womenfolk but darya alexandrovna saw or fancied she saw the sensation produced by her children and herself the children were not only beautiful to look at in their smart little dresses but they were charming in the way they behaved aliosha it is true did not stand quite correctly he kept turning round trying to look at his little jacket from behind but all the same he was wonderfully sweet tania behaved like a person and looked after the little ones and the smallest lily was bewitching in her naive astonishment at everything and it was difficult not to smile when after taking the sacrament she said in english please some more

 on the drive home as darya alexandrovna with all her children round her their heads still wet from their baths and a kerchief tied over her own head was getting near the house the coachman said some gentleman coming the master of pokrovskoe i do believe 
 darya alexandrovna peeped out in front and was delighted when she recognized in the gray hat and gray coat the familiar figure of levin walking to meet them she was glad to see him at any time but at this moment she was specially glad he should see her in all her glory no one was better able to appreciate her grandeur than levin 
 seeing her he found himself face to face with one of the pictures of his daydream of family life 
 like a hen with your brood darya alexandrovna 
 ah how glad i am to see you she said holding out her hand to him 
 glad to see me but you let me know my staying with me i got a note from stiva that you were here 
 from stiva darya alexandrovna asked with surprise 
 yes he writes that you are here and that he thinks you might allow me to be of use to you said levin and as he said it he became suddenly embarrassed and stopping abruptly he walked on in silence by the droshky snapping off the buds of the lime trees and nibbling them he was embarrassed through a sense that darya alexandrovna would be annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights have come from her own husband darya alexandrovna certainly did not like this little way of stepan of foisting his domestic duties on others and she was at once aware that levin was aware of this it was just for this fineness of perception for this delicacy that darya alexandrovna liked levin 
 i know of course said levin that this simply means that you would like to see me and exceedingly glad though i can fancy that used to town housekeeping as you are you must feel you are in the wilds here and if anything wanted altogether at your disposal 
 oh no said dolly at first things were rather uncomfortable but now settled everything capitally thanks to my old nurse she said indicating matriona philimonovna who seeing that they were speaking of her smiled brightly and cordially to levin she knew him and knew that he would be a good match for her young lady and was very keen to see the matter settled 
 you get in sir make room on this side she said to him 
 no walk children like to race the horses with me 
 the children knew levin very little and could not remember when they had seen him but they experienced in regard to him none of that strange feeling of shyness and hostility which children so often experience toward hypocritical people and for which they are so often and miserably punished hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the cleverest and most penetrating man but the least of children recognizes it and is revolted by it however ingeniously it may be disguised whatever faults levin had there was not a trace of hypocrisy in him and so the children showed him the same friendliness that they saw in their face on his invitation the two elder ones at once jumped out to him and ran with him as simply as they would have done with their nurse or miss hoole or their mother lily too began begging to go to him and her mother handed her over to him he sat her on his shoulder and ran along with her 
 be afraid be afraid darya alexandrovna he said smiling to the mother no chance of my hurting or dropping her 
 and looking at his strong agile assiduously careful and extremely strained movements the mother felt her mind at rest and smiled gaily and approvingly as she watched him 
 here in the country with children and with darya alexandrovna with whom he was in sympathy levin was in a mood not infrequent with him of childlike lightheartedness that she particularly liked in him as he ran with the children he taught them gymnastic feats set miss hoole laughing with his queer english accent and talked to darya alexandrovna of his pursuits in the country 
 after dinner darya alexandrovna sitting alone with him on the balcony began to speak of kitty 
 you know coming here and is going to spend the summer with me 
 really he said flushing and at once to change the conversation he said then send you two cows shall i if you insist on a bill you shall pay me five roubles a month if you ashamed 
 no thank you we can manage very well now 
 oh well then have a look at your cows and if allow me give directions about their food everything depends on their food 
 and levin to turn the conversation explained to darya alexandrovna the theory of cowkeeping based on the principle that the cow is simply a machine for the transformation of food into milk and so on 
 he talked of this and passionately longed to hear more of kitty and at the same time was afraid of hearing it he dreaded the breaking up of the inward peace he had gained with such effort 
 yes but still all this has to be looked after and who is there to look after it darya alexandrovna responded reluctantly 
 she had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged thanks to matriona philimonovna that she was disinclined to make any change in them besides she had no faith in knowledge of farming general principles as to the cow being a machine for the production of milk she looked on with suspicion it seemed to her that such principles could only be a hindrance in farm management it all seemed to her a far simpler matter all that was needed as matriona philimonovna had explained was to give brindle and whitebreast more food and drink and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to the cow that was clear but general propositions as to feeding on meal and on grass were doubtful and obscure and what was most important she wanted to talk about kitty

 kitty writes to me that nothing she longs for so much as quiet and solitude dolly said after the silence that had followed 
 and how is she better levin asked in agitation 
 thank god quite well again i never believed her lungs were affected 
 oh very glad said levin and dolly fancied she saw something touching helpless in his face as he said this and looked silently into her face 
 let me ask you konstantin dmitrievich said darya alexandrovna smiling her kindly and rather mocking smile why are you angry with kitty 
 i not angry with her said levin 
 yes you are why was it you did not come to see us or them when you were in moscow 
 darya alexandrovna he said blushing up to the roots of his hair i wonder really that with your kind heart you feel this how it is you feel no pity for me if nothing else when you know 
 what do i know 
 you know that i proposed and was refused said levin and all the tenderness he had been feeling for kitty a minute before was replaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he had suffered 
 what makes you suppose i know 
 because everybody knows it 
 just where you are mistaken i did not know it though i had guessed it was so 
 well now you know it 
 all i knew was that something had happened that made her dreadfully miserable and that she begged me never to speak of it and if she would not tell me she would certainly not speak of it to anyone else but what did pass between you tell me 
 i have told you 
 when was it 
 when i was at their house the last time 
 do you know said darya alexandrovna i am awfully awfully sorry for her you suffer only from pride 
 perhaps so said levin but 
 she interrupted him 
 but she poor girl i am awfully awfully sorry for her now i see it all 
 well darya alexandrovna you must excuse me he said getting up darya alexandrovna till we meet again 
 no wait a minute she said clutching him by the sleeve wait a minute sit down 
 please please let us talk of this he said sitting down and at the same time feeling rise up and stir within his heart a hope he had believed to be buried 
 if i did not like you she said and tears came into her eyes if i did not know you as i do know you 
 the feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more rose up and took possession of heart 
 yes i understand it all now said darya alexandrovna you understand it for you men who are free and make your own choice always clear whom you love but a in a position of suspense with all a or modesty a girl who sees you men from afar who takes everything on trust a girl may have and often has such a feeling that she cannot tell what to say 
 yes if the heart does not speak 
 no the heart does speak but just consider you men have views about a girl you come to the house you make friends you criticize you wait to see if you have found what you love and then when you are sure you love her you propose 
 well not quite it 
 anyway you propose when your love is ripe or when the balance has completely turned between the two you are choosing from but a girl is not asked she is expected to make her choice and yet she cannot choose she can only answer yes or no 
 yes to choose between me and vronsky thought levin and the dead thing that had come to life within him died again and only weighed on his heart and set it aching 
 darya alexandrovna he said how one chooses a new dress or some purchase or other not love the choice has been made and so much the better and there can be no repetition 
 ah pride pride said darya alexandrovna as though despising him for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which only women know at the time when you proposed to kitty she was just in a position in which she could not answer she was in doubt doubt between you and vronsky him she was seeing every day and you she had not seen for a long while supposing she had been older i for instance in her place could have felt no doubt i always disliked him and my dislike proved to be justified 
 levin recalled answer she had said no that cannot be 
 darya alexandrovna he said dryly i appreciate your confidence in me i believe you are making a mistake but whether i am right or wrong that pride you so despise makes any thought of katerina alexandrovna out of the question for me you understand utterly out of the question 
 i will only say one thing more you know that i am speaking of my sister whom i love as i love my own children i say she cared for you all i meant to say is that her refusal at that moment proves nothing 
 i know said levin jumping up you only knew how you are hurting me just as if a child of yours were dead and they were to say to you he would have been like this and like that and he might have lived and how happy you would have been in him but dead dead dead 
 how absurd you are said darya alexandrovna looking with mournful tenderness at excitement yes i see it all more and more clearly she went on musingly so you come to see us then when here 
 no i come of course i avoid meeting katerina alexandrovna but as far as i can i will try to save her the annoyance of my presence 
 you are very very absurd repeated darya alexandrovna looking with tenderness into his face very well then let it be as though we had not spoken of this what have you come for tania she said in french to the little girl who had come in 
 my spade mamma 
 i speak french and you must too 
 the little girl tried to say it in french but could not remember the french for spade the mother prompted her and then told her in french where to look for the spade and this made a disagreeable impression on levin 
 everything in darya house and children struck him now as by no means so charming as a little while before 
 and why does she talk french with the children he thought how unnatural and false it is and the children feel it so learning french and unlearning sincerity he thought to himself unaware that darya alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already and yet even at the cost of some loss of sincerity believed it necessary to teach her children french in that way 
 but why are you going do stay a little 
 levin stayed to tea but his good humor had vanished and he felt ill at ease 
 after tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in and when he came back he found darya alexandrovna greatly disturbed with a troubled face and tears in her eyes while levin had been outside an incident had occurred which had all at once shattered all the happiness she had been feeling that day and her pride in her children grisha and tania had been fighting over a ball darya alexandrovna hearing a scream in the nursery ran in and saw a terrible sight tania was pulling hair while he with a face hideous with rage was beating her with his fists wherever he could get at her something snapped in darya heart when she saw this it was as if darkness had swooped down upon her life she felt that these children of hers that she was so proud of were not merely most ordinary but positively bad children with coarse brutal propensities wicked children 
 she could not talk or think of anything else and she could not help speaking to levin of her misery 
 levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her saying that it showed nothing bad that all children fight but even as he said it he was thinking in his heart no i be artificial and talk french with my children but my children be like that all one has to do is not spoil children not to distort their nature and be delightful no my children be like that 
 he said and drove away and she did not try to detain him

 please please let us talk of this he said sitting down and at the same time feeling rise up and stir within his heart a hope he had believed to be buried 
 if i did not like you she said and tears came into her eyes if i did not know you as i do know you 
 the feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more rose up and took possession of heart 
 yes i understand it all now said darya alexandrovna you understand it for you men who are free and make your own choice always clear whom you love but a in a position of suspense with all a or modesty a girl who sees you men from afar who takes everything on trust a girl may have and often has such a feeling that she cannot tell what to say 
 yes if the heart does not speak 
 no the heart does speak but just consider you men have views about a girl you come to the house you make friends you criticize you wait to see if you have found what you love and then when you are sure you love her you propose 
 well not quite it 
 anyway you propose when your love is ripe or when the balance has completely turned between the two you are choosing from but a girl is not asked she is expected to make her choice and yet she cannot choose she can only answer yes or no 
 yes to choose between me and vronsky thought levin and the dead thing that had come to life within him died again and only weighed on his heart and set it aching 
 darya alexandrovna he said how one chooses a new dress or some purchase or other not love the choice has been made and so much the better and there can be no repetition 
 ah pride pride said darya alexandrovna as though despising him for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which only women know at the time when you proposed to kitty she was just in a position in which she could not answer she was in doubt doubt between you and vronsky him she was seeing every day and you she had not seen for a long while supposing she had been older i for instance in her place could have felt no doubt i always disliked him and my dislike proved to be justified 
 levin recalled answer she had said no that cannot be 
 darya alexandrovna he said dryly i appreciate your confidence in me i believe you are making a mistake but whether i am right or wrong that pride you so despise makes any thought of katerina alexandrovna out of the question for me you understand utterly out of the question 
 i will only say one thing more you know that i am speaking of my sister whom i love as i love my own children i say she cared for you all i meant to say is that her refusal at that moment proves nothing 
 i know said levin jumping up you only knew how you are hurting me just as if a child of yours were dead and they were to say to you he would have been like this and like that and he might have lived and how happy you would have been in him but dead dead dead 
 how absurd you are said darya alexandrovna looking with mournful tenderness at excitement yes i see it all more and more clearly she went on musingly so you come to see us then when here 
 no i come of course i avoid meeting katerina alexandrovna but as far as i can i will try to save her the annoyance of my presence 
 you are very very absurd repeated darya alexandrovna looking with tenderness into his face very well then let it be as though we had not spoken of this what have you come for tania she said in french to the little girl who had come in 
 my spade mamma 
 i speak french and you must too 
 the little girl tried to say it in french but could not remember the french for spade the mother prompted her and then told her in french where to look for the spade and this made a disagreeable impression on levin 
 everything in darya house and children struck him now as by no means so charming as a little while before 
 and why does she talk french with the children he thought how unnatural and false it is and the children feel it so learning french and unlearning sincerity he thought to himself unaware that darya alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already and yet even at the cost of some loss of sincerity believed it necessary to teach her children french in that way 
 but why are you going do stay a little 
 levin stayed to tea but his good humor had vanished and he felt ill at ease 
 after tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in and when he came back he found darya alexandrovna greatly disturbed with a troubled face and tears in her eyes while levin had been outside an incident had occurred which had all at once shattered all the happiness she had been feeling that day and her pride in her children grisha and tania had been fighting over a ball darya alexandrovna hearing a scream in the nursery ran in and saw a terrible sight tania was pulling hair while he with a face hideous with rage was beating her with his fists wherever he could get at her something snapped in darya heart when she saw this it was as if darkness had swooped down upon her life she felt that these children of hers that she was so proud of were not merely most ordinary but positively bad children with coarse brutal propensities wicked children 
 she could not talk or think of anything else and she could not help speaking to levin of her misery 
 levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her saying that it showed nothing bad that all children fight but even as he said it he was thinking in his heart no i be artificial and talk french with my children but my children be like that all one has to do is not spoil children not to distort their nature and be delightful no my children be like that 
 he said and drove away and she did not try to detain him

 in the middle of july the elder of the village on estate about twenty verstas from pokrovskoe came to levin to report about the hay and how things were going there the chief source of income on his estate was from the water meadows in former years the hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the dessiatina when levin took over the management of the estate he thought on examining the grasslands that they were worth more and he fixed the price at roubles the dessiatina the peasants would not give that price and as levin suspected kept off other purchasers then levin had driven over himself and arranged to have the grass cut partly by hired labor partly at a payment of a certain proportion of the crop the peasants of this village put every hindrance they could in the way of this new arrangement but it was carried out and the first year the meadows had yielded a profit almost double two years ago and the previous year the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the arrangement and the hay had been cut on the same system this year the peasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop and the village elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut and that fearing rain he had invited the countinghouse clerk over had divided the crop in his presence and had raked together eleven stacks as the share from the vague answers to his question how much hay had been cut on the principal meadow from the hurry of the village elder who had made the division without asking leave from the whole tone of the peasant levin perceived that there was something wrong in the division of the hay and made up his mind to drive over himself to look into the matter 
 arriving by dinnertime at the village and leaving his horse at the cottage of an old friend of his the husband of his wet nurse levin went to see the old man in his beehouse wanting to find out from him the truth about the hay parmenich a talkative comely old man gave levin a very warm welcome showed him all he was doing told him everything about his bees and the swarms of that year but gave vague and unwilling answers to inquiries about the mowing this confirmed levin still more in his suspicions he went to the hayfields and examined the stacks the haystacks could not possibly contain fifty wagonloads each and to convict the peasants levin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be brought up directly to lift one stack and carry it into the barn there turned out to be only loads in the stack in spite of the village assertions about the compressibility of hay and its having settled down in the stacks and his swearing that everything had been done in fear of god levin stuck to his point that the hay had been divided without his orders and that therefore he would not accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack after a prolonged dispute the matter was decided by the peasants taking as their share these eleven stacks reckoning them as fifty loads each and apportioning the share anew the arguments and the division of the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon when the last of the hay had been divided levin entrusting the superintendence of the rest to the countinghouse clerk sat down on a haycock marked off by a stake of willow and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming with peasants 
 in front of him in the bend of the river beyond the little marsh moved a line of peasant women merrily chattering with their ringing voices and the scattered hay was being rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green aftermath after the women came the men with pitchforks and from the gray rows there were growing up broad high soft haycocks to the left telegas were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared and one after another the haycocks vanished flung up in huge forkfuls and in their place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging over the horses hindquarters 
 what weather for haying what hay be said an old man squatting down beside levin tea not hay like scattering grain to the ducks the way they pick it up he added pointing to the growing haycocks since dinnertime carried a good half of it 
 the last load eh he shouted to a young peasant who drove by standing in the front of an empty telega box shaking the reins of hemp 
 the last dad the lad shouted back pulling in the horse and smiling he looked round at a bright peasant girl who sat in the telega box smiling too and drove on 
 that your son asked levin 
 my dear youngest said the old man with a tender smile 
 what a fine fellow 
 the all right 
 married already 
 yes two years last st day 
 any children 
 children indeed why for over a year he was innocent as a babe himself and bashful too answered the old man what hay this is tea indeed he repeated wishing to change the subject 
 levin looked more attentively at vanka parmenov and his wife they were loading a haycock onto the wagon not far from him ivan parmenov was standing on the wagon taking laying in place and stamping down the huge bundles of hay which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to him at first in armfuls and then on the pitchfork the young wife worked easily merrily and deftly the hay did not once break away by her fork first she tedded it stuck the fork into it then with a rapid supple movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she drew herself up and arching her full bosom under the long white apron with a deft turn swung the fork in her arms and flung the bundle of hay high onto the wagon ivan obviously doing his best to save her every minute of unnecessary labor made haste opening wide his arms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the wagon as she raked together what was left of the hay the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had fallen on her neck and arranging the red kerchief that was gone backward baring her white brow not browned by the sun she crept under the wagon to tie up the load ivan directed her how to fasten the cord to the crosspiece and at something she said he laughed aloud in the expressions of both faces was to be seen vigorous young freshly awakened love

 the load was tied on ivan jumped down and took the quiet sleek horse by the bridle the young wife flung the rake up on the load with a bold step swinging her arms she went to join the women who were forming a ring for the haymakers dance ivan drove off to the road and fell into line with the other loaded wagons the peasant women with their rakes on their shoulders gay with bright flowers and chattering with ringing merry voices walked behind the hay wagon one wild untrained female voice broke into a song and sang it alone through a verse and then the same verse was unanimously taken up and repeated by half a hundred strong healthy voices of all sorts coarse and fine 
 the women all singing began to come close to levin and he felt as though a storm were swooping down upon him with a thunder of merriment the storm swooped down enveloped him and the haycock on which he was lying and the other haycocks and wagonloads and the whole meadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the measures of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and clapping levin felt envious of this health and mirthfulness he longed to take part in the expression of this joy of life but he could do nothing and had to lie and look on and listen when the peasants with their singing had vanished out of sight and hearing a weary feeling of despondency at his own isolation his physical inactivity his alienation from this world came over levin 
 some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with him over the hay some whom he had treated with contumely and who had tried to cheat him those very peasants had greeted him and evidently had not were incapable of having any feeling of rancor against him any regret any recollection even of having tried to deceive him all that was drowned in a sea of merry common labor god gave the day god gave the strength and the day and the strength were consecrated to labor and that labor was its own reward for whom the labor what would be its fruits these were idle considerations beside the point 
 often levin had admired this life often he had a sense of envy of the men who led this life but today for the first time especially under the influence of what he had seen in the attitude of ivan parmenov to his young wife the idea presented itself definitely to his mind that it was in his power to exchange the dreary artificial idle and individualistic life he was leading for this laborious pure and generally delightful life 
 the old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home the people had all gone their different ways those who lived near had gone home while those who came from afar were gathered into a group for supper and to spend the night in the meadow levin unobserved by the peasants still lay on the haycock and still looked on and listened and mused the peasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all the short summer night at first there was the sound of merry talk and general laughing over the supper then singing again and laughter 
 all the long day of toil had left no trace in them save lightness of heart before the early dawn all was hushed nothing was to be heard but the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh and the horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before morning rousing himself levin got up from the haycock and looking at the stars he saw that the night was over 
 well what am i going to do how am i to set about it he said to himself trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through in this brief night all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought one was the renunciation of his old life of his utterly useless education this renunciation gave him satisfaction and was easy and simple another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he longed to live now the simplicity the purity the sanity of this life he felt clearly and he was convinced he would find in it its content its peace and its dignity of the lack of which he was so miserably conscious but a third series of ideas turned upon the question of how to effect this transition from the old life to the new and there nothing took clear shape for him a wife work and the necessity of work leave pokrovskoe buy land become a member of a peasant community marry a peasant girl how am i to set about it he asked himself again and could not find an answer i slept all night though and i think it out clearly he said to himself work it out later one certain this night has decided my fate all my old dreams of home life were absurd not the real thing he told himself all ever so much simpler and better 
 how beautiful he thought looking at the strange as it were shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his head in the middle of the sky how exquisite it all is in this exquisite night and when was there time for that cloud shell to form just now i looked at the sky and there was nothing in it only two white streaks yes and so imperceptibly too my views of life changed 
 he went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad toward the village a slight wind arose and the sky looked gray and sullen the gloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn the full triumph of light over darkness 
 shrinking from the cold levin walked rapidly looking at the ground that someone coming he thought catching the tinkle of bells and lifting his head forty paces from him a carriage and four with the luggage on its top was driving toward him along the grassy highroad on which he was walking the shaft horses were tilted against the shafts by the ruts but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held the shaft over the ruts so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of the road 
 this was all levin noticed and without wondering who it could be he gazed absently at the coach 
 in the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner and at the window evidently only just awake sat a young girl holding in both hands the ribbons of a white cap with a face full of light and thought full of a subtle complex inner life that was remote from levin she was gazing from the window at the glow of the sunrise 
 at the very instant when this apparition was vanishing the truthful eyes glanced at him she recognized him and her face lighted up with wondering delight 
 he could not be mistaken there were no other eyes like those in all the world there was only one creature in the world that could concentrate for him all the brightness and meaning of life it was she it was kitty he comprehended that she was driving to ergushovo from the railway station and everything that had been stirring levin during this sleepless night all the resolutions he had made all vanished at once he recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl there only in this carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the road and was rapidly disappearing there only could he find the solution of the riddle of his life which had weighed so agonizingly upon him of late 
 she did not look out again the sound of the carriage springs was no longer audible the bells could scarcely be heard the barking of dogs showed the carriage had reached the village and all that was left was the empty fields all round the village in front and he himself isolated and apart from it all wandering lonely along the deserted highroad 
 he glanced at the sky expecting to find there the cloud shell he had been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of that night there was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell there in the remote heights above a mysterious change had been accomplished there was no trace of a shell and there was stretched over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets the sky had grown blue and bright and with the same softness but with the same remoteness it met his questioning gaze 
 no he said to himself however good that life of simplicity and toil may be i cannot go back to it i love her

 chapter 
 
 none but those who were most intimate with alexei alexandrovich knew that while on the surface the coldest and most rational of men he had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character alexei alexandrovich could not hear or see a child or woman crying without being moved the sight of tears threw him into a state of nervous agitation and he utterly lost all power of reflection the head clerk of his board and the secretary were aware of this and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account to give way to tears if they did not want to ruin their chances he will get angry and will not listen to you they used to say and as a fact in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in alexei alexandrovich by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger i can do nothing kindly leave the room he would usually shout in such cases 
 when returning from the races anna had informed him of her relations with vronsky and immediately afterward had burst into tears hiding her face in her hands alexei alexandrovich for all the fury aroused in him against her was aware at the same time of a rush of that emotional disturbance always produced in him by tears conscious of it and conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would be out of keeping with the situation he tried to suppress every manifestation of life in himself and so neither stirred nor looked at her this was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which had so impressed anna 
 when they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage and making an effort to master himself took leave of her with his usual urbanity and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing he said that tomorrow he would let her know his decision 
 his words confirming his worst suspicions had sent a cruel pang to the heart of alexei alexandrovich that pang was intensified by the strange feeling of physical pity for her engendered by her tears but when he was all alone in the carriage alexei alexandrovich to his surprise and delight felt complete relief both from this pity and from the doubts and agonies of jealousy 
 he experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after suffering long from toothache after a fearful agony and a sense of something huge bigger than the head itself being torn out of his jaw the sufferer hardly able to believe in his own good luck feels all at once that what has so long envenomed his existence and enchained his attention exists no longer and that he can live and think again and take an interest in other things besides his tooth this feeling alexei alexandrovich was experiencing the agony had been strange and terrible but now it was over he felt that he could live again and think of something other than his wife

 daryalov fought a duel 
 the duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of alexei alexandrovich in his youth just because he was physically a fainthearted man and was himself well aware of the fact alexei alexandrovich could not without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed at himself and never made use of any weapon in his life this horror had in his youth set him often pondering on dueling and picturing himself in a position in which he would have to expose his life to danger having attained success and an established position in the world he had long ago forgotten this feeling but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted itself and dread of his own cowardice proved even now so strong that alexei alexandrovich spent a long while thinking over the question of dueling in all its aspects and hugging the idea of a duel though he was fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstances fight one 
 no doubt our society is still so barbarous not the same in england that very many and among these were those whose opinion alexei alexandrovich particularly valued look favorably on the duel but what result is attained by it suppose i call him out alexei alexandrovich went on to himself and vividly picturing the night he would spend after the challenge and the pistol aimed at him he shuddered and knew that he never would do it suppose i call him out suppose i am taught he went on musing i am placed i press the trigger he said to himself closing his eyes and it turns out i have killed him alexei alexandrovich said to himself and he shook his head as though to dispel such silly ideas what sense is there in murdering a man in order to define relation to a guilty wife and son i should still have to decide what i ought to do with her but what is more probable and what would doubtlessly occur i should be killed or wounded i the innocent person should be the victim killed or wounded even more senseless but apart from that a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side i know beforehand that my friends would never allow me to fight a duel would never allow the life of a statesman needed by russia to be exposed to danger what would come of it it would come of it that knowing beforehand that the matter would never come to real danger it would amount to my simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge that would be dishonest that would be false that would be deceiving myself and others a duel is quite impossible and no one expects it of me my aim is simply to safeguard my reputation which is essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties official duties which had always been of great consequence in alexei eyes seemed of special importance to his mind at this moment 
 considering and rejecting the duel alexei alexandrovich turned to divorce another solution selected by several of the husbands he remembered passing in mental review all the instances he knew of divorces there were plenty of them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar alexei alexandrovich could not find a single example in which the object of divorce was that which he had in view in all these instances the husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife and the very party who being in fault had not the right to contract a marriage had formed counterfeit ties with a new husband in his own case alexei alexandrovich saw that a legal divorce that is to say one in which only the guilty wife would be repudiated was impossible of attainment he saw that the complex conditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his guilt required by the law out of the question he saw that a certain refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought forward even if he had them and that to bring forward such proofs would damage him in the public estimation more than it would her 
 an attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal which would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on his high position in society his chief object to define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible would not be attained by divorce either moreover in the event of divorce or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce it was obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover and in spite of the complete as he supposed contempt and indifference he now felt for his wife at the bottom of his heart alexei alexandrovich still had one feeling left in regard to her a disinclination to see her free to throw in her lot with vronsky so that her crime would be to her advantage the mere notion of this so exasperated alexei alexandrovich that directly it rose to his mind he groaned with inward agony and got up and changed his place in the carriage and for a long while after he sat with scowling brows wrapping his numbed and bony legs in the fleecy rug 
 apart from formal divorce one might still do as karibanov paskudin and that good fellow dram did that is separate from wife he went on thinking when he had regained his composure but this step too presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce and what was more a separation quite as much as a regular divorce flung his wife into the arms of vronsky no out of the question out of the question he said aloud twisting his rug about him again i cannot be unhappy but neither she nor he ought to be happy 
 the feeling of jealousy which had tortured him during the period of uncertainty had passed away at the instant when with agony the tooth had been extracted by his words but that feeling had been replaced by another the desire not merely that she should not triumph but that she should get due punishment for her crime he did not acknowledge this feeling but at the bottom of his heart he longed for her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind and having dishonored him and once again going over the conditions inseparable from a duel a divorce a separation and once again rejecting them alexei alexandrovich felt convinced that there was only one solution to keep her with him concealing what had happened from the world and using every measure in his power to break off the intrigue and still more though this he did not admit to himself to punish her i must communicate to her my decision that thinking over the terrible position in which she has placed her family all other solutions will be worse for both sides than an external status quo and that such i agree to retain on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wishes that is to say cessation of all intercourse with her lover when this decision had been finally adopted another weighty consideration occurred to alexei alexandrovich in support of it by such a course only shall i be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion he told himself in adopting this course i am not casting off a guilty wife but giving her a chance of amendment and indeed difficult as the task will be to me i shall devote part of my energies to her reformation and salvation though alexei alexandrovich was perfectly aware that he could not exert any moral influence over his wife that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing but falsity though in passing through these difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking guidance in religion yet now when his conclusion corresponded as it seemed to him with the requirements of religion this religious sanction to his decision gave him complete satisfaction and to some extent restored his peace of mind he was pleased to think that even in such an important crisis in life no one would be able to say that he had not acted in accordance with the principles of that religion whose banner he had always held aloft amid the general coolness and indifference as he pondered over subsequent developments alexei alexandrovich did not see indeed why his relations with his wife should not remain practically the same as before no doubt she could never regain his esteem but there was not and there could not be any sort of reason why his existence should be troubled and why he should suffer because she was a bad and faithless wife yes time will pass time which arranges all things and the old relations will be reestablished alexei alexandrovich told himself so far reestablished that is that i shall not be sensible of a break in the continuity of my life she is bound to be unhappy but i am not to blame and so i cannot be unhappy

 none but those who were most intimate with alexei alexandrovich knew that while on the surface the coldest and most rational of men he had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character alexei alexandrovich could not hear or see a child or woman crying without being moved the sight of tears threw him into a state of nervous agitation and he utterly lost all power of reflection the head clerk of his board and the secretary were aware of this and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account to give way to tears if they did not want to ruin their chances he will get angry and will not listen to you they used to say and as a fact in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in alexei alexandrovich by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger i can do nothing kindly leave the room he would usually shout in such cases 
 when returning from the races anna had informed him of her relations with vronsky and immediately afterward had burst into tears hiding her face in her hands alexei alexandrovich for all the fury aroused in him against her was aware at the same time of a rush of that emotional disturbance always produced in him by tears conscious of it and conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would be out of keeping with the situation he tried to suppress every manifestation of life in himself and so neither stirred nor looked at her this was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which had so impressed anna 
 when they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage and making an effort to master himself took leave of her with his usual urbanity and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing he said that tomorrow he would let her know his decision 
 his words confirming his worst suspicions had sent a cruel pang to the heart of alexei alexandrovich that pang was intensified by the strange feeling of physical pity for her engendered by her tears but when he was all alone in the carriage alexei alexandrovich to his surprise and delight felt complete relief both from this pity and from the doubts and agonies of jealousy 
 he experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after suffering long from toothache after a fearful agony and a sense of something huge bigger than the head itself being torn out of his jaw the sufferer hardly able to believe in his own good luck feels all at once that what has so long envenomed his existence and enchained his attention exists no longer and that he can live and think again and take an interest in other things besides his tooth this feeling alexei alexandrovich was experiencing the agony had been strange and terrible but now it was over he felt that he could live again and think of something other than his wife 
 no honor no heart no religion a corrupt woman i always knew it and always saw it though i tried to deceive myself to spare her he said to himself and it actually seemed to him that he always had seen it he recalled incidents of their past life in which he had never seen anything wrong before now these incidents proved clearly that she had always been a corrupt woman i made a mistake in linking my life to hers but there was nothing wrong in my mistake and so i cannot be unhappy not i who am to blame he told himself but she but i have nothing to do with her she does not exist for me

 i cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman has committed a crime i have only to find the best way out of the difficult position in which she has placed me and i shall find it he said to himself frowning more and more neither the first nor the last and to say nothing of historical instances dating from menelaus recently revived in the memory of all by la belle hlne a whole list of contemporary examples of husbands with unfaithful wives in the highest society rose before alexei imagination daryalov poltavsky prince karibanov count paskudin dram yes even dram such an honest capable fellow semionov chagin sigonin alexei alexandrovich remembered admitting that a certain quite irrational ridicule falls to the lot of these men yet i never saw anything but a misfortune in it and always felt sympathy for it alexei alexandrovich said to himself though indeed this was not the fact and he had never felt sympathy for misfortunes of that kind but the more often he had heard of instances of unfaithful wives betraying their husbands the more highly he had thought of himself it is a misfortune which may befall anyone and this misfortune has befallen me the only thing to be done is to make the best of the situation and he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had been in the same position that he was in

 he read the letter through and felt pleased with it and especially because he had remembered to enclose money there was not a harsh word not a reproach in it nor was there undue indulgence most of all it was a golden bridge for a return folding the letter and smoothing it with a massive ivory knife and putting it in an envelope with the money he rang the bell with the gratification it always afforded him to use the appointments of his writing table

 certainly your excellency is tea to be served in the study 
 alexei alexandrovich ordered tea to be brought to the study and playing with the massive paper knife he moved to his easy chair near which there had been placed ready for him a lamp and the french work on les tables eugubines that he had begun over the easy chair there hung in a gold frame an oval portrait of anna a fine painting by a celebrated artist alexei alexandrovich glanced at it the unfathomable eyes gazed ironically and insolently at him as they did that night of their last explanation insufferably insolent and challenging was the effect in alexei eyes of the black lace about the head admirably touched in by the painter the black hair and handsome white hand the fourth finger of which was covered with rings after looking at the portrait for a minute alexei alexandrovich shuddered so that his lips quivered and produced brrr and turned away he made haste to sit down in his easy chair and opened the book he tried to read but he could not revive the very vivid interest he had felt before in eugubine inscriptions he looked at the book and thought of something else he thought not of his wife but of a complication that had arisen in his official life which at the time constituted the chief interest of it he felt that he had penetrated more deeply than ever before into this intricate affair and that he had originated a leading idea he could say it without calculated to clear up the whole business to strengthen him in his official career to discomfit his enemies and thereby to be of the greatest benefit to the state directly the servant had set the tea and left the room alexei alexandrovich got up and went to the writing table moving into the middle of the table a portfolio of current papers with a scarcely perceptible smile of he took a pencil from a rack and plunged into the perusal of a complex report relating to the present complication the complication was of this nature alexei characteristic quality as a politician that special individual qualification that every rising functionary possesses the qualification that with his unflagging ambition his reserve his honesty and his had made his career was his contempt for red tape his cutting down of correspondence his direct contact wherever possible with the living fact and his economy it happened that the famous commission of the nd of june had set on foot an inquiry into the irrigation of lands in the zaraisky province which fell under alexei department and was a glaring example of fruitless expenditure and paper reforms alexei alexandrovich was aware of the truth of this the irrigation of these lands in the zaraisky province had been initiated by the predecessor of alexei predecessor and vast sums of money had actually been spent and were still being spent on this business and utterly unproductively and the whole business could obviously lead to nothing whatever alexei alexandrovich had perceived this at once on entering office and would have liked to lay hands on the business but at first when he did not yet feel secure in his position he knew it would affect too many interests and would be imprudent later on he had been engrossed in other questions and had simply forgotten this case it went of itself like all such cases by the mere force of inertia many people gained their livelihood by this business especially one highly conscientious and musical family all the daughters played on stringed instruments and alexei alexandrovich knew the family and had stood godfather to one of the elder daughters the raising of this question by a hostile ministry was in alexei opinion a dishonorable proceeding seeing that in every ministry there were things similar and worse which no one inquired into for reasons of official etiquette however now that the gauntlet had been thrown down to him he had boldly picked it up and demanded the appointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the working of the commission of irrigation of the lands in the zaraisky province but in compensation he gave no quarter to the enemy either he demanded also the appointment of another special commission to inquire into the question of the native tribes organization the question of the native tribes had been brought up incidentally in the committee of the nd of june and had been pressed forward actively by alexei alexandrovich as one admitting of no delay on account of the deplorable condition of the native tribes in the committee this question had been a ground of contention between several ministries the ministry hostile to alexei alexandrovich proved that the condition of the native tribes was exceedingly flourishing that the proposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity and that if there were anything wrong it arose mainly from the failure on the part of alexei ministry to carry out the measures prescribed by law now alexei alexandrovich intended to demand first that a new commission should be formed which should be empowered to investigate the condition of the native tribes on the spot secondly if it should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually was such as it appeared to be from the official data in the hands of the committee that another new scientific commission should be appointed to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribes from the a political b administrative c economic d ethnographical e material and f religious points of view thirdly that evidence should be required from the rival ministry of the measures that had been taken during the last ten years by that ministry for averting the disastrous conditions in which the native tribes were now placed and fourthly and finally that that ministry be asked to explain why it had as appeared from the reports submitted before the committee under nos and dated december and june respectively acted in direct contravention of the intention of the basic and organic law t statute and the note to statute a flush of eagerness suffused the face of alexei alexandrovich as he rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for his own benefit having filled a sheet of paper he got up rang and sent a note to the head clerk to look up certain necessary facts for him getting up and walking about the room he glanced again at the portrait frowned and smiled contemptuously after reading a little more of the book on eugubine inscriptions and renewing his interest in it alexei alexandrovich went to bed at eleven and recollecting as he lay in bed the incident with his wife he saw it now in by no

family all the daughters played on stringed instruments and alexei alexandrovich knew the family and had stood godfather to one of the elder daughters the raising of this question by a hostile ministry was in alexei opinion a dishonorable proceeding seeing that in every ministry there were things similar and worse which no one inquired into for reasons of official etiquette however now that the gauntlet had been thrown down to him he had boldly picked it up and demanded the appointment of a special commission to investigate and verify the working of the commission of irrigation of the lands in the zaraisky province but in compensation he gave no quarter to the enemy either he demanded also the appointment of another special commission to inquire into the question of the native tribes organization the question of the native tribes had been brought up incidentally in the committee of the nd of june and had been pressed forward actively by alexei alexandrovich as one admitting of no delay on account of the deplorable condition of the native tribes in the committee this question had been a ground of contention between several ministries the ministry hostile to alexei alexandrovich proved that the condition of the native tribes was exceedingly flourishing that the proposed reconstruction might be the ruin of their prosperity and that if there were anything wrong it arose mainly from the failure on the part of alexei ministry to carry out the measures prescribed by law now alexei alexandrovich intended to demand first that a new commission should be formed which should be empowered to investigate the condition of the native tribes on the spot secondly if it should appear that the condition of the native tribes actually was such as it appeared to be from the official data in the hands of the committee that another new scientific commission should be appointed to investigate the deplorable condition of the native tribes from the a political b administrative c economic d ethnographical e material and f religious points of view thirdly that evidence should be required from the rival ministry of the measures that had been taken during the last ten years by that ministry for averting the disastrous conditions in which the native tribes were now placed and fourthly and finally that that ministry be asked to explain why it had as appeared from the reports submitted before the committee under nos and dated december and june respectively acted in direct contravention of the intention of the basic and organic law t statute and the note to statute a flush of eagerness suffused the face of alexei alexandrovich as he rapidly wrote out a synopsis of these ideas for his own benefit having filled a sheet of paper he got up rang and sent a note to the head clerk to look up certain necessary facts for him getting up and walking about the room he glanced again at the portrait frowned and smiled contemptuously after reading a little more of the book on eugubine inscriptions and renewing his interest in it alexei alexandrovich went to bed at eleven and recollecting as he lay in bed the incident with his wife he saw it now in by no means so gloomy a light

 though anna had obstinately and with exasperation contradicted vronsky when he told her their position was impossible and persuaded her to lay open everything to her husband at the bottom of her heart she regarded her own position as false and dishonorable and she longed with her whole soul to change it on the way home from the races she had told her husband the truth in a moment of excitement and in spite of the agony she had suffered in doing so she was glad of it after her husband had left her she told herself that she was glad that now everything was made clear and at least there would be no more lying and deception it seemed to her beyond doubt that her position was now made clear forever it might be bad this new position but it would be clear there would be no indefiniteness or falsehood about it the pain she had caused herself and her husband in uttering those words would be rewarded now by everything being made clear she thought that evening she saw vronsky but she did not tell him of what had passed between her and her husband though to make the position clear it was necessary to tell him 
 when she woke up next morning the first thing that rose to her mind was what she had said to her husband and those words seemed to her so awful that she could not conceive now how she could have brought herself to utter those strange coarse words and could not imagine what would come of it but the words were spoken and alexei alexandrovich had gone away without saying anything i saw vronsky and did not tell him at the very instant he was going away i would have turned him back and told him but i changed my mind because it was strange that i had not told him the first minute why was it i wanted to tell him and and in answer to this question a burning blush of shame spread over her face she knew what had kept her from it she knew that she had been ashamed her position which had seemed to her simplified the night before suddenly struck her now as not only not simple but as absolutely hopeless she felt terrified at the disgrace of which she had not even thought before directly she thought of what her husband would do the most terrible ideas came to her mind she had a vision of being turned out of the house of her shame being proclaimed to all the world she asked herself where she should go when she was turned out of the house and she could not find an answer 
 when she thought of vronsky it seemed to her that he did not love her that he was already beginning to be tired of her that she could not offer herself to him and she felt bitter against him for it it seemed to her that the words that she had spoken to her husband and had continually repeated in her imagination she had said to everyone and everyone had heard them she could not bring herself to look those of her own household in the face she could not bring herself to call her maid and still less go downstairs and see her son and his governess 
 the maid who had been listening at her door for a long while came into her room of her own accord anna glanced inquiringly into her face and blushed with a scared look the maid begged her pardon for coming in saying that she had fancied the bell rang she brought her clothes and a note the note was from betsy betsy reminded her that liza merkalova and baroness stoltz were coming to play croquet with her that morning with their adorers kaluzhsky and old stremov come if only as a study in characters i shall expect you she finished 
 anna read the note and heaved a deep sigh 
 nothing i need nothing she said to annushka who was rearranging the bottles and brushes on the dressing table you may go dress at once and come down i need nothing nothing 
 annushka went out but anna did not begin dressing and sat in the same position her head and hands hanging listlessly and every now and then she shivered all over was apparently about to make some gesture utter some word and sank back into lifelessness again she repeated continually my god my god but neither god nor my had any meaning to her the idea of seeking help in her difficulty in religion was as remote from her as seeking help from alexei alexandrovich himself although she had never had doubts of the faith in which she had been brought up she knew that the support of religion was possible only upon condition of renouncing what made up for her the whole meaning of life she was not simply miserable she began to feel alarm at the new spiritual condition never experienced before in which she found herself she felt as though everything were beginning to be double in her soul just as objects sometimes appear double to overtired eyes she hardly knew at times what it was she feared and what she hoped for whether she feared or desired what had happened or what was going to happen and exactly what she longed for she could not have said 
 ah what am i doing she said to herself feeling a sudden thrill of pain in both sides of her head when she came to herself she saw that she was holding her hair in both hands each side of her temples and she was pressing them she jumped up and began walking about 
 the coffee is ready and mademoiselle and seriozha are waiting said annushka coming back again and finding anna in the same position 
 seriozha what about seriozha anna asked with sudden eagerness recollecting her existence for the first time that morning 
 been naughty i think answered annushka with a smile 
 in what way 
 some peaches were lying on the table in the corner room i think he ate one of them on the sly 
 the recollection of her son suddenly roused anna from the helpless condition in which she found herself she recalled the partly sincere though greatly exaggerated role of the mother living for her child which she had taken up of late years and she felt with joy that in the plight in which she found herself she had a dominion independent of any position she would be placed in by her relations to her husband or to vronsky this dominion was her son in whatever position she might be placed she could not abandon her son her husband might put her to shame and turn her out vronsky might grow cold to her and go on living his own life apart she thought of him again with bitterness and reproach she could not leave her son she had an aim in life and she must act act to secure the position of her son so that he might not be taken from her quickly indeed as quickly as possible she must take action before he was taken from her she must take her son and go away here was the one thing she had to do now she must be calm and get out of this insufferable position the thought of immediate action binding her to her son of going away somewhere with him gave her this calming 
 she dressed quickly went downstairs and with resolute steps walked into the drawing room where she found as usual waiting for her the coffee seriozha and his governess seriozha all in white with his back and head bent was standing at a table under a looking glass and with an expression of intense concentration which she knew well and in which he resembled his father he was doing something to the flowers he carried 
 the governess had a particularly severe expression seriozha screamed shrilly as he often did ah mamma and stopped hesitating whether to go to greet his mother and put down the flowers or to finish making the wreath and go with the flowers 
 the governess after saying good morning began a long and detailed account of naughtiness but anna did not hear her she was considering whether she would take her with her or not no i take her she decided go alone with my son 
 yes very wrong said anna and taking her son by the shoulder she looked at him not severely but with a timid glance that bewildered and delighted the boy and she kissed him leave him to me she said to the astonished governess and without letting go of her son she sat down at the table where coffee was set ready for her 
 mamma i i he said trying to make out from her expression what was in store for him in regard to the peaches 
 seriozha she said as soon as the governess had left the room that was wrong but never do it again will you you love me 
 she felt that the tears were coming into her eyes can i help loving him she said to herself looking deeply into his scared and at the same time delighted eyes and can he ever join his father in punishing me is it possible he will not feel for me tears were already flowing down her face and to hide them she got up abruptly and almost ran out on the terrace 
 after the thundershowers of the last few days cold bright weather had set in the air was cold in the bright sun that filtered through the freshly washed leaves 
 she shivered both from the cold and from the inward horror which had clutched her with fresh force in the open air 
 run along run along to mariette she said to seriozha who had followed her out and she began walking up and down on the straw matting of the terrace can it be that they forgive me understand how it all could not have been otherwise she said to herself 
 standing still and looking at the tops of the aspen trees waving in the wind with their freshly washed brightly shining leaves in the cold sunshine she knew that they would not forgive her that everyone and everything would be merciless to her now as was that sky that green and again she felt that everything was doubling in her soul i think she said to herself i must get ready to go where when whom to take with me yes to moscow by the evening train annushka and seriozha and only the most necessary things but first i must write to them both she went quickly indoors into her boudoir sat down at the table and wrote to her husband 
 after what has happened i cannot remain any longer in your house i am going away and taking my son with me i know the law and so i know with which of the parents the son should remain but i take him with me because i cannot live without him be generous leave him to me 
 up to this point she wrote rapidly and naturally but the appeal to his generosity a quality she did not recognize in him and the necessity of winding up the letter with something touching pulled her up 
 of my fault and my remorse i cannot speak because 
 she stopped again finding no connection in her ideas no she said to herself no need of anything and tearing up the letter she wrote it again leaving out the allusion to generosity and sealed it up 
 another letter had to be written to vronsky i have told my husband she wrote and she sat a long while unable to write more it was so coarse so unfeminine and what more am i to write him she said to herself again a flush of shame spread over her face she recalled his composure and a feeling of anger against him impelled her to tear the sheet with the phrase she had written into tiny bits no need of anything she said to herself and closing her blotting case she went upstairs told the governess and the servants that she was going that day to moscow and at once set to work to pack up her things

 you can conjecture what awaits you and your son she recalled a part of his letter a threat to take away my child and most likely according to their stupid law he can but i know very well why he says it he believe even in my love for my child or he despises it just as he always used to ridicule it he despises that feeling in me but he knows that i abandon my child that i abandon my child that there could be no life for me without my child even with him whom i love but that if i abandoned my child and ran away from him i should be acting like the most infamous basest of women he knows that and knows that i am incapable of doing that

 the croquet party to which the princess tverskaia had invited anna was to consist of two ladies and their adorers these two ladies were the chief representatives of a select new peterburg circle nicknamed in imitation of some imitation les sept merveilles du monde these ladies belonged to a circle which though of the highest society was utterly hostile to that in which anna moved moreover old stremov one of the most influential people in peterburg and the admirer of liza merkalova was alexei enemy in the political world from all these considerations anna had not meant to go and the hints in princess note referred to her refusal but now anna was eager to go in the hope of seeing vronsky 
 anna arrived at princess earlier than the other guests 
 at the very moment of her entry footman with his side whiskers combed out and looking like a kammerjunker went in too he stopped at the door and taking off his cap let her pass anna recognized him and only then recalled that vronsky had told her the day before that he would not come most likely he was sending a note to say so 
 as she took off her outer garment in the hall she heard the footman say rolling his even like a kammerjunker from the count for the princess as he handed over the note 
 she longed to question him as to where his master was she longed to turn back and send him a letter to come and see her or to go herself to see him but none of the three courses was possible already she heard bells ringing ahead of her to announce her arrival and princess footman was standing at the open door waiting for her to pass into the inner rooms 
 the princess is in the garden she will be informed immediately would you be pleased to walk into the garden announced another footman in another room 
 the position of uncertainty of indecision was still the same as at home worse in fact since it was impossible to take any step impossible to see vronsky and she had to remain here among outsiders in company so uncongenial to her present mood but she was wearing a dress that she knew suited her she was not alone all around was that luxurious setting of idleness that she was used to and she felt less wretched than at home she was not forced to think what she had to do everything would be done of itself on meeting betsy coming toward her in a white gown that struck her by its elegance anna smiled to her just as she always did princess tverskaia was walking with tushkevich and a young lady a relation who to the great joy of her parents in the provinces was spending the summer with the fashionable princess 
 there was probably something unusual about anna for betsy noticed it at once 
 i slept badly answered anna looking intently at the footman who came to meet them and as she supposed brought note 
 how glad i am come said betsy tired and was just longing to have some tea before they come you might go she turned to tushkevich with masha and try the croquet ground over there where been clipping it we shall have time to talk a little over tea have a cozy chat eh she said in english to anna with a smile pressing the hand which held a parasol 
 yes especially as i stay very long with you forced to go on to old madame vrede been promising to go for a century said anna to whom lying alien as it was to her nature had become not merely simple and natural in society but a positive source of satisfaction why she said this which she had not thought of a second before she could not have explained she had said it simply from the reflection that as vronsky would not be here she had better secure her own freedom and try to see him somehow but why she had spoken of old hoffraulein vrede whom she had to go and see as she had to see many other people she could not have explained and yet as it afterward turned out had she cudgeled her brains for the most cunning subterfuge to meet vronsky she could have thought of nothing better 
 no not going to let you go for anything answered betsy looking intently into face really if i were not fond of you i should feel offended one would think you were afraid my society would compromise you tea in the small dining room please she said half closing her eyes as she always did when addressing the footman 
 taking the note from him she read it 
 alexei is playing us false she said in french he writes that he come she added in a tone as simple and natural as though it could never enter her head that vronsky could mean anything more to anna than a game of croquet anna knew that betsy knew everything but hearing how she spoke of vronsky before her she almost felt persuaded for a minute that she knew nothing 
 ah said anna indifferently as though not greatly interested in the matter and she went on smiling how can you or your friends compromise anyone 
 this playing with words this hiding of a secret had a great fascination for anna as indeed it has for all women and it was not the necessity of concealment not the purpose for which the concealment was contrived but the process of concealment itself which attracted her 
 i be more catholic than the pope she said stremov and liza merkalova why the cream of the cream of society besides received everywhere and i she laid special stress on the i have never been strict and intolerant simply that i the time 
 no you care perhaps to meet stremov let him and alexei alexandrovich tilt at each other in the committee no affair of ours but in society the most amiable man i know and an ardent croquet player you shall see and in spite of his absurd position as lovesick swain at his age you ought to see how he carries off the absurd position very nice you know sappho stoltz oh a new type quite new 
 betsy went on with all this chatter yet at the same time from her shrewd glance anna felt that she partly guessed her plight and was hatching something for her benefit they were in the little boudoir 
 i must write to alexei though and betsy sat down to the table scribbled a few lines and put the note in an envelope telling him to come to dinner one lady extra to dinner with me and no man to take her in look what said will that persuade him excuse me i must leave you for a minute would you seal it up please and send it off she said from the door i have to give some directions 
 without a hesitation anna sat down to the table with letter and without reading it wrote below essential for me to see you come to the vrede garden i shall be there at six she sealed it up and betsy coming back in her presence handed the note for transmittal 
 at tea which was brought them on a little tea table in the cool little drawing room a cozy chat promised by princess tverskaia before the arrival of her visitors really did come off between the two women they criticized the people they were expecting and the conversation fell upon liza merkalova 
 very sweet and i always liked her said anna 
 you ought to like her she raves about you yesterday she came up to me after the races and was in despair at not finding you she says a real heroine of romance and that if she were a man she would do all sorts of mad things for your sake stremov says she does that as it is 
 but do tell me please i never could make it out said anna after being silent for some time speaking in a tone that showed she was not asking an idle question but that what she was asking was of greater importance to her than it should have been do tell me please what are her relations with prince kaluzhsky mishka as called met them so little what does it mean 
 betsy smiled with her eyes and looked intently at anna 
 a new mode she said all adopted that mode flung their caps over the windmills but there are ways and ways of flinging them 
 yes but precisely what are her relations with kaluzhsky 
 betsy broke into unexpectedly mirthful and irrepressible laughter a thing which rarely happened with her 
 encroaching on princess special domain now the question of an enfant terrible and betsy obviously tried to restrain herself but could not and went off into peals of that infectious laughter peculiar to people who do not laugh often better ask them she brought out between tears of laughter 
 no you laugh said anna laughing too in spite of herself but i never could understand it i understand the role in it 
 the husband liza husband carries her shawl and is always ready to be of use but no one cares to inquire about what is really going on you know in decent society one talk or think even of certain details of the toilet how it is in this case 
 will you be at madame fete asked anna to change the conversation 
 i think so answered betsy and without looking at her friend she began filling the little transparent cups with fragrant tea putting a cup before anna she took out a thin cigarette and fitting it into a silver holder she lighted it like this you see in a fortunate position she began quite serious now as she took up her cup i understand you and i understand liza liza now is one of those naive natures that like children know good and bad anyway she comprehend it when she was very young and now aware that the lack of comprehension suits her now perhaps she know on purpose said betsy with a subtle smile but anyway it suits her the very same thing you see may be looked at tragically and turned into misery or it may be looked at simply and even humorously possibly you are inclined to look at things too tragically 
 how i should like to know other people just as i know myself said anna seriously and dreamily am i worse than other people or better i think worse

 they heard the sound of steps and a voice then a voice and laughter and immediately thereafter there walked in the expected guests sappho stoltz and a young man beaming with excess of health the vaska it was evident that ample supplies of beefsteak truffles and burgundy were profitable for his health vaska bowed to the two ladies and glanced at them but only for one second he walked after sappho into the drawing room and followed her about as though he were chained to her keeping his sparkling eyes fixed on her as though he wanted to eat her sappho stoltz was a blonde beauty with black eyes she walked with smart little steps in shoes and shook hands with the ladies vigorously like a man 
 anna had never met this new star of fashion and was struck by her beauty the exaggerated extreme to which her dress was carried and the boldness of her manners on her head there was such an echafaudage of soft golden hair her own and false mixed that her head was equal in size to the elegantly rounded bust of which so much was exposed in front the impulsive abruptness of her movements was such that at every step the lines of her knees and the upper part of her legs were distinctly marked under her dress and the question involuntarily rose in mind where in the undulating mountain of material at the back the real body of the woman so small and slender so naked in front and so hidden behind and below really came to an end 
 betsy made haste to introduce her to anna 
 only fancy we all but ran over two soldiers she began telling them at once using her eyes smiling and twitching away her train which she at first threw too much to one side i drove here with vaska ah to be sure you know each other and mentioning his surname she introduced the young man and reddening broke into a ringing laugh at her mistake that is at her having called him vaska before a stranger vaska bowed once more to anna but he said nothing to her he addressed sappho lost your bet we got here first pay up said he smiling 
 sappho laughed still more festively 
 not just now said she 
 all one have it later 
 very well very well oh yes she turned suddenly to princess betsy i am a nice person i positively forgot it brought you a visitor and here he comes 
 the unexpected young visitor whom sappho had brought with her and whom she had forgotten was however a personage of such consequence that in spite of his youth both the ladies rose on his entrance 
 he was a new admirer of like vaska he now dogged her footsteps 
 soon after prince kaluzhsky arrived and liza merkalova with stremov liza merkalova was a thin brunette with an oriental languid type of face and charming as everyone used to say ineffable eyes the tone of her dark dress anna immediately observed and appreciated the fact was in perfect harmony with her style of beauty liza was as soft and loose as sappho was tight and shackled 
 but to taste liza was far more attractive betsy had said to anna that she had adopted the pose of an unsophisticated child but when anna saw her she felt this was not the truth she really was unsophisticated spoiled yet a sweet and irresponsible woman it is true that her tone was the same as that like sappho she had two men one young and one old tacked on to her and devouring her with their eyes but there was something in her higher than her surroundings there was in her the glow of the real diamond among paste this glow shone out in her charming truly ineffable eyes the weary and at the same time passionate glance of those eyes encircled by dark rings impressed one by its perfect sincerity everyone looking into those eyes fancied he knew her wholly and knowing her could not but love her at the sight of anna her whole face lighted up at once with a smile of delight 
 ah how glad i am to see you she said going up to her yesterday at the races i wanted just to get to you but gone away i did so want to see you especially yesterday it awful she said looking at anna with eyes that seemed to lay bare all her soul 
 yes i had no idea it would be so thrilling said anna blushing 
 the company got up at this moment to go into the garden 
 not going said liza smiling and settling herself close to anna you go either will you who wants to play croquet 
 oh i like it said anna 
 there how do you manage never to be bored by things one has but to look at you to be joyful alive but bored 
 how can you be bored why you live among the merriest people in peterburg said anna 
 possibly the people who are not of our set are even more bored but we are not amused ourselves i certainly am not but awfully awfully bored 
 sappho smoking a cigarette went off into the garden with the two young men betsy and stremov remained at the tea table 
 you bored said betsy sappho says they enjoyed themselves tremendously at your house last night 
 ah how dreary it all was said liza merkalova we all drove back to my place after the races and always the same people always the same always the same thing we lounged about on sofas all the evening enjoyable about that no do tell me how you manage never to be bored she said addressing anna again one has but to look at you and one sees a woman who may be happy or unhappy but who bored tell me how do you do it 
 i do nothing answered anna blushing at these searching questions 
 the best way stremov put in 
 stremov was a man of fifty partly gray but still vigorous in appearance very ugly but with a characteristic and intelligent face liza merkalova was his niece and he spent all his leisure hours with her on meeting anna karenina since he was alexei enemy in the government he tried like a shrewd man and a man of the world to be particularly cordial with her the wife of his enemy 
 nothing he put in with a subtle smile the very best way i told you long ago he said turning to liza merkalova that in order not to be bored you think going to be bored just as you be afraid of not being able to fall asleep if afraid of sleeplessness precisely what anna arkadyevna has just said 
 i should be very glad if i had said it for not only clever but true said anna smiling 
 no do tell me why it is one go to sleep and one help being bored 
 to sleep well one should work and to enjoy oneself one should also work 
 what am i to work for when my work is of no use to anybody and i and knowingly make a pretense at it 
 incorrigible said stremov without looking at her and he spoke again to anna 
 as he rarely met anna he could say nothing but banalities to her but he said those banalities when was she returning to peterburg and how fond countess lidia ivanovna was of her with an expression which suggested that he longed with his whole soul to please her and show his regard for her and even more than that 
 tushkevich came in announcing that the party were awaiting the other players to begin croquet 
 no go away please pleaded liza merkalova hearing that anna was going stremov joined in her entreaties 
 too violent a transition he said to go from such company to old madame vrede and besides you will only give her a chance for talking scandal while here you will arouse other feelings of the finest and directly opposed to scandal he said to her 
 anna pondered for an instant in uncertainty this shrewd flattering words the naive childlike affection shown her by liza merkalova and all the worldly atmosphere she was used to it was all so easy while that which was in store for her was so difficult that she was for a minute in uncertainty should she remain should she put off a little longer the painful moment of explanation but remembering what was in store for her when she would be alone at home if she did not come to some decision remembering that gesture terrible even in memory when she had clutched her hair in both hands she said and went away

 chapter 
 
 in spite of apparently frivolous life in society he was a man who hated disorder in early youth in the corps of pages he had experienced the humiliation of a refusal when he had tried being in difficulties to borrow money and since then he had never once put himself in the same position again 
 in order to keep his affairs in some sort of order he was wont about five times a year more or less frequently according to circumstances to shut himself up alone and put all his affairs into definite shape this he would call his day of washing up or faire la lessive 
 on waking up late in the morning after the races vronsky put on a white linen coat and without shaving or taking his bath he distributed about the table money bills and letters and set to work petritsky who knew he was on such occasions on waking up and seeing his comrade at the writing table quietly dressed and went out without getting in his way 
 every man who knows to the minutest details all the complexity of the conditions surrounding him cannot help imagining that the complexity of these conditions and the difficulty of making them clear is something exceptional and personal peculiar to himself and never supposes that others are surrounded by just as complicated an array of personal affairs as he is so indeed it seemed to vronsky and not without inward pride and not without reason he thought that any other man would long ago have been in difficulties and would have been forced to some dishonorable course if he had found himself in such a difficult position but vronsky felt that now especially it was essential for him to clear up and define his position if he were to avoid getting into difficulties 
 what vronsky attacked first as being the easiest was his pecuniary position writing out on note paper in his minute handwriting all that he owed he added up the amount and found that his debts amounted to seventeen thousand and some odd hundreds which he left out for the sake of clearness reckoning up his cash and the balance in his bankbook he found that he had left one thousand eight hundred roubles and nothing coming in before the new year reckoning over again his list of debts vronsky copied it dividing it into three classes in the first class he put the debts which he would have to pay at once or for which he must in any case have the money ready so that on demand for payment there would not be a delay in paying such debts amounted to about four thousand one thousand five hundred for a horse and two thousand five hundred as surety for a young comrade venevsky who had lost that sum to a cardsharper in presence vronsky had wanted to pay the money at the time he had that amount then but venevsky and iashvin had insisted that they would pay and not vronsky who had not played so far so good but vronsky knew that in this dirty business though his only share in it was undertaking by word of mouth to be surety for venevsky it was absolutely necessary for him to have the two thousand five hundred roubles so as to be able to fling it at the cheat and have no more words with him and so for this first and most important division he must have four thousand roubles the second class eight thousand roubles consisted of less important debts these were principally accounts owing in connection with his race horses to the purveyor of oats and hay the englishman the saddler and so on he would have to pay some two thousand roubles on these debts too in order to be quite free from anxiety the last class of debts to shops to hotels to his tailor were such as need not be considered so that he needed at least six thousand roubles and he only had one thousand eight hundred for current expenses for a man with one hundred thousand roubles of revenue which was what everyone fixed as income such debts one would suppose could hardly be embarrassing but the fact was that he was far from having one hundred thousand his immense property which alone yielded a yearly income of two hundred thousand was left undivided between the brothers at the time when the elder brother with a mass of debts had married princess varia chirkova the daughter of a dekabrist without any fortune whatever alexei had given up to his elder brother almost the whole income from his estate reserving for himself only thousand a year from it alexei had said at the time to his brother that the sum would be sufficient for him until he married which he would probably never do and his brother who was in command of one of the most expensive regiments and was only just married could not decline the gift his mother who had her own separate property had allowed alexei every year twenty thousand in addition to the thousand he had reserved and alexei had spent it all of late his mother incensed with him on account of his love affair and his leaving moscow had given up sending him the money and in consequence of this vronsky who had been in the habit of living on the scale of thousand a year having only received twenty thousand that year now found himself in difficulties to get out of these difficulties he could not apply to his mother for money her last letter which he had received the day before had particularly exasperated him by the hints it contained that she was quite ready to help him to succeed in the world and in the army but not to lead a life which scandalized all good society his attempt to buy him stung him to the quick and made him feel colder than ever toward her but he could not draw back from the generous word when it was once uttered even though he felt now vaguely foreseeing certain eventualities in his liaison with madame karenina that his generous word had been spoken thoughtlessly and that even though he were not married he might need all the hundred thousand of income but it was impossible to draw back he had only to recall his wife to remember how that sweet delightful varia sought at every convenient opportunity to remind him that she remembered his generosity and appreciated it to grasp the impossibility of taking back his gift it was as impossible as beating a woman or stealing or lying one thing only could and ought to be done and vronsky determined upon it without an hesitation to borrow money from a moneylender ten thousand roubles a proceeding which presented no difficulty to cut down his expenses generally and to sell his race horses resolving on this he promptly wrote a note to rolandaky who had more than once sent to him with offers to buy horses from him then he sent for the englishman and the moneylender and divided what money he had according to the accounts he intended to pay having finished this business he wrote a cold and cutting answer to his mother then he took out of his notebook three notes of read them again burned them and remembering their conversation on the previous day he sank into deep thought

 in spite of apparently frivolous life in society he was a man who hated disorder in early youth in the corps of pages he had experienced the humiliation of a refusal when he had tried being in difficulties to borrow money and since then he had never once put himself in the same position again

 life was particularly happy in that he had a code of principles which defined with unfailing certitude what he ought and what he ought not to do this code of principles covered only a very small circle of contingencies but then the principles were never doubtful and vronsky as he never went outside that circle had never had a hesitation about doing what he ought to do these principles laid down as invariable rules that one must pay a cardsharper but need not pay a tailor that one must never tell a lie to a man but one may to a woman that one must never cheat anyone but one may a husband that one must never pardon an insult but one may give one and so on these principles were possibly not reasonable and not good but they were of unfailing certainty and so long as he adhered to them vronsky felt that his heart was at peace and he could hold his head up but of late in regard to his relations with anna vronsky had begun to feel that his code of principles did not fully cover all possible contingencies and to foresee in the future difficulties and perplexities for which he could find no guiding clue 
 his present relation to anna and to her husband was to his mind clear and simple it was clearly and precisely defined in the code of principles by which he was guided 
 she was an honorable woman who had bestowed her love upon him and he loved her and therefore she was in his eyes a woman who had a right to the same respect or even more than a lawful wife he would have had his hand chopped off before he would have allowed himself by a word by a hint to humiliate her or even to fall short of the fullest respect a woman could look for 
 his attitude toward society too was clear everyone might know might suspect it but no one might dare to speak of it if any did speak he was ready to force all who might do so to be silent and to respect the nonexistent honor of the woman he loved 
 his attitude to the husband was the clearest of all from the moment that anna loved vronsky he had regarded his own right over her as the one thing unassailable her husband was simply a superfluous and tiresome person no doubt he was in a pitiable position but how could that be helped the one thing the husband had a right to was to demand satisfaction with a weapon in his hand and vronsky was prepared for this at any minute 
 but of late new inner relations had arisen between her and him which frightened vronsky by their indefiniteness only the day before she had told him that she was with child and he felt that this fact and what she expected of him called for something not fully defined in that code of principles by which he had hitherto steered his course in life and he had been indeed caught unawares and at the first moment when she spoke to him of her position his heart had prompted him to beg her to leave her husband he had said that but now thinking things over he saw clearly that it would be better to manage avoiding that and at the same time as he told himself this he was afraid whether such an avoidance were not wrong 
 if i told her to leave her husband it would mean uniting her life with mine am i prepared for that how can i take her away now when i have no money supposing i could arrange but how can i take her away while in the service if i say it i ought to be prepared to do it that is i ought to have the money and to retire from the army 
 and he grew thoughtful the question whether to retire from the service or not brought him to the other and perhaps the chief though hidden interest of his life of which none knew but he 
 ambition was the old dream of his youth and childhood a dream which he did not confess even to himself though it was so strong that now this passion was even doing battle with his love his first steps in the world and in the service had been successful but two years before he had made a great mistake anxious to show his independence and for the sake of advancement he had refused a post that had been offered him hoping that this refusal would heighten his value but it turned out that he had been too bold and he was passed over and having whether he liked or not taken up for himself the position of an independent man he carried it off with great tact and good sense behaving as though he bore no grudge against anyone nor regarding himself as injured in any way and caring for nothing but to be left alone since he was enjoying himself in reality he had ceased to enjoy himself as long ago as the year before when he had gone to moscow he felt that this independent attitude of a man who might have done anything but cared to do nothing was already beginning to pall that many people were beginning to fancy that he was not really capable of anything but being a straightforward fellow his connection with madame karenina by creating so much sensation and attracting general attention had given him a fresh distinction which had soothed his gnawing worm of ambition for a while but a week ago that worm had been roused up again with fresh force the friend of his childhood a man of the same set of the same coterie his comrade in the corps of pages serpukhovskoy who had left school with him and had been his rival in class in gymnastics in their scrapes and their dreams of glory had come back a few days before from central asia where he had gained two steps up in rank and an order rarely bestowed upon generals so young 
 as soon as he arrived in peterburg people began to talk about him as a newly risen star of the first magnitude a schoolfellow of and of the same age he was a general and was expecting a command which might have influence on the course of political events while vronsky though he was independent and brilliant and beloved by a charming woman was simply a cavalry captain who was readily allowed to be as independent as ever he liked of course i envy serpukhovskoy and never could envy him but his advancement shows me that one has only to watch opportunity and the career of a man like me may be very rapidly made three years ago he was in just the same position as i am if i retire i burn my ships if i remain in the army i lose nothing she said herself she did not wish to change her position and with her love i cannot feel envious of serpukhovskoy and slowly twirling his mustaches he got up from the table and walked about the room his eyes shone particularly brightly and he felt in that firm calm and happy frame of mind which always came after he had thoroughly faced his position everything was straight and clear just as after former days of striking balances he shaved took a cold bath dressed and went out

 come to fetch you your lessive lasted a good time today said petritsky well is it over 
 over answered vronsky smiling with his eyes only and twirling the tips of his mustaches as circumspectly as though after the perfect order into which his affairs had been brought any overbold or rapid movement might disturb it 
 always just as if come out of a bath after it said petritsky come from gritzka that was what they called the colonel expected there 
 vronsky without answering looked at his comrade thinking of something else 
 yes is that music at his place he said listening to the familiar bass sounds of trumpets of polkas and waltzes floating across to him the fete 
 come 
 aha said vronsky why i know 
 the smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever 
 having once made up his mind that he was happy in his love that he sacrificed his ambition to it at any rate having taken up this role vronsky was incapable of feeling either envious of serpukhovskoy or vexed at him for not having come to him first upon coming to the regiment serpukhovskoy was a good friend and he was delighted he had come 
 ah very glad 
 the colonel demin had taken a large country house the whole party was on the wide lower balcony in the courtyard the first objects that met eyes were a band of singers in short white linen jackets standing near a barrel of vodka and the robust figure of the colonel surrounded by officers he had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was loudly shouting to drown out the band playing an offenbach quadrille waving his arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing on one side a group of soldiers a quartermaster and several subalterns came up to the balcony with vronsky the colonel returned to the table went out again on the steps with a tumbler in his hand and proposed the toast to the health of our former comrade the gallant general prince serpukhovskoy hurrah 
 the colonel was followed by serpukhovskoy who came out on the steps smiling with a glass in his hand 
 you always get younger bondarenko he said to the sergeant standing just before him still though doing his second term of service 
 it was three years since vronsky had seen serpukhovskoy he looked more robust had let his whiskers grow but was still the same graceful creature whose face and figure were even more striking from their fineness and nobility than their beauty the only change vronsky detected in him was that subdued continual beaming which settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of the recognition of their success by everyone vronsky knew that radiant air and immediately observed it in serpukhovskoy 
 as serpukhovskoy came down the steps he saw vronsky a smile of pleasure lighted up his face he tossed his head upward and waved the glass in his hand greeting vronsky and showing him by the gesture that he could not come to him before kissing the sergeant who stood craning forward his lips ready to be kissed 
 here he is shouted the colonel iashvin told me you were in one of your gloomy tempers 
 serpukhovskoy kissed the moist fresh lips of the brave sergeant and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief walked up to vronsky 
 how glad i am he said squeezing his hand and drawing him to one side 
 you look after him the colonel shouted to iashvin pointing to vronsky and he went down below to the soldiers 
 why you at the races yesterday i expected to see you there said vronsky scrutinizing serpukhovskoy 
 i did go but late i beg your pardon he added and turned to the adjutant please have this distributed from me each man as much as it comes to 
 and he hurriedly took three notes for a hundred roubles each from his pocketbook and blushed 
 vronsky have a bite or a drink asked iashvin hi something for the count to eat there drink that 
 the spree at the lasted a long while 
 there was a great deal of drinking they swung serpukhovskoy and tossed him in the air then they did the same to the colonel then to the accompaniment of the band the colonel himself danced with petritsky then the colonel who began to show signs of weakening sat down on a bench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to iashvin the superiority of russia over prussia especially in cavalry attack and there was a lull in the revelry for a moment serpukhovskoy went into the house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found vronsky there vronsky was sousing his head with water he had taken off his coat and put his red hairy neck under the tap and was rubbing it and his head with his hands when he had finished vronsky sat down by serpukhovskoy they both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge and a conversation began which was very interesting to both of them 
 always been hearing about you through my wife said serpukhovskoy glad been seeing her pretty often 
 friendly with varia and the only women in peterburg i care about seeing answered vronsky smiling he smiled because he foresaw the topic the conversation would turn to and he was glad of it 
 the only ones serpukhovskoy queried smiling 
 yes and i heard news of you but not only through your wife said vronsky checking hint by assuming a stern expression i was greatly delighted to hear of your success but not a bit surprised i expected even more 
 serpukhovskoy smiled such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to him and he did not think it necessary to conceal it 
 well i on the contrary expected less own up frankly but glad very glad ambitious my weakness and i confess to it 
 perhaps you confess to it if you been successful said vronsky 
 i suppose so said serpukhovskoy smiling again i say life be worth living without it but it would be dull of course i may be mistaken but i fancy i have a certain capacity for the line chosen and that if there is to be power of any sort in my hands it will be better than in the hands of a good many people i know said serpukhovskoy with beaming consciousness of success and so the nearer i get to it the better pleased i am 
 perhaps that is true for you but not for everyone i used to think so too but now i see and think life worth living not only for that 
 there it comes there it comes said serpukhovskoy laughing ever since i heard about you about your refusal i began of course i approved of what you did but there are ways of doing everything and i think your action was good in itself but you do it in quite the way you should have done 
 done be undone and you know i never go back on what done and besides very well off 
 very well off for the time but not satisfied with that i say this to your brother a charming child like our host here there he goes he added listening to the roar of a hurrah and happy that does not satisfy you 
 i say it did 
 yes but not the only thing such men as you are wanted 
 by whom 
 by whom by society by russia russia needs men she needs a party or else everything goes and will go to the dogs 
 how do you mean party against the russian communists 
 no said serpukhovskoy frowning with vexation at being suspected of such an absurdity tout a est une blague that has always been and always will be there are no communists but intriguing people have to invent a noxious dangerous party an old trick no wanted is a powerful party of independent men like you and me 
 but why so vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power why they independent men 
 simply because they have not or have not had from birth an independent fortune not had a name they born close to the sun as we were they can be bought either by money or by favor and they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a trend and they bring forward some notion some trend that they believe in that does harm and the whole policy is really only a means to a house at the expense of the crown and so much income cela pas plus fin que a when you get a peep at their cards i may be inferior to them more stupid perhaps though i see why i should be inferior to them but you and i have one important certain advantage over them in being more difficult to buy and such men are more needed than ever 
 vronsky listened attentively but he was not so much interested by the meaning of the words as by the attitude of serpukhovskoy who was already contemplating a struggle with the existing powers and already had his likes and dislikes in that world while his own interest in his service did not go beyond the interests of his squadron vronsky felt too how powerful serpukhovskoy might become through his unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in through his intelligence and gift of eloquence so rarely met with in the world in which he moved and ashamed as he was of the feeling he felt envious 
 still i the one thing of paramount importance for that he answered i the desire for power i had it once but gone 
 excuse me not true said serpukhovskoy smiling 
 yes true true now to be truthful vronsky added 
 yes true now another thing but that now last forever 
 perhaps answered vronsky 
 you say perhaps serpukhovskoy went on as though guessing his thoughts but i say for certain and what i wanted to see you for your action was just what it should have been i see that but you ought not to persevere in it i only ask you to give me carte blanche not going to offer you my protection though indeed why i protect you protected me often enough i should hope our friendship rises above all that sort of thing yes he said smiling to him as tenderly as a woman give me carte blanche retire from the regiment and get you in imperceptibly 
 but you must understand that i want nothing said vronsky except to leave things just as they were 
 serpukhovskoy got up and stood facing him 
 you said leave things just as they were i understand what that means but listen the same age known a greater number of women perhaps than i have smile and gestures told vronsky that he be afraid that he would be tender and careful in touching the sore place but married and believe me in getting to know wife thoroughly if one loves her as someone has said one gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them 
 coming directly vronsky shouted to an officer who looked into the room and called them to the colonel 
 vronsky was longing now to hear serpukhovskoy to the end and know what he would say to him 
 and my opinion for you women are the chief stumbling block in a career hard to love a woman and do anything only one way of having love conveniently without its being a hindrance marriage now how am i to tell you what i mean said serpukhovskoy who liked similes wait wait a minute yes just as you can only carry a fardeau yet do something with your hands when the fardeau is tied on your back and marriage and what i felt when i was married my hands were suddenly set free but if you drag that fardeau about with you without marriage your hands will always be so full that you can do nothing look at mazankov at krupov ruined their careers for the sake of women 
 what women said vronsky recalling the frenchwoman and the actress with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected 
 the firmer the footing in society the worse it is much the same as not merely carrying the fardeau in your arms but tearing it away from someone else 
 you have never loved vronsky said softly looking straight before him and thinking of anna

 come to fetch you your lessive lasted a good time today said petritsky well is it over 
 over answered vronsky smiling with his eyes only and twirling the tips of his mustaches as circumspectly as though after the perfect order into which his affairs had been brought any overbold or rapid movement might disturb it 
 always just as if come out of a bath after it said petritsky come from gritzka that was what they called the colonel expected there 
 vronsky without answering looked at his comrade thinking of something else 
 yes is that music at his place he said listening to the familiar bass sounds of trumpets of polkas and waltzes floating across to him the fete 
 come 
 aha said vronsky why i know 
 the smile in his eyes gleamed more brightly than ever 
 having once made up his mind that he was happy in his love that he sacrificed his ambition to it at any rate having taken up this role vronsky was incapable of feeling either envious of serpukhovskoy or vexed at him for not having come to him first upon coming to the regiment serpukhovskoy was a good friend and he was delighted he had come 
 ah very glad 
 the colonel demin had taken a large country house the whole party was on the wide lower balcony in the courtyard the first objects that met eyes were a band of singers in short white linen jackets standing near a barrel of vodka and the robust figure of the colonel surrounded by officers he had gone out as far as the first step of the balcony and was loudly shouting to drown out the band playing an offenbach quadrille waving his arms and giving some orders to a few soldiers standing on one side a group of soldiers a quartermaster and several subalterns came up to the balcony with vronsky the colonel returned to the table went out again on the steps with a tumbler in his hand and proposed the toast to the health of our former comrade the gallant general prince serpukhovskoy hurrah 
 the colonel was followed by serpukhovskoy who came out on the steps smiling with a glass in his hand 
 you always get younger bondarenko he said to the sergeant standing just before him still though doing his second term of service 
 it was three years since vronsky had seen serpukhovskoy he looked more robust had let his whiskers grow but was still the same graceful creature whose face and figure were even more striking from their fineness and nobility than their beauty the only change vronsky detected in him was that subdued continual beaming which settles on the faces of men who are successful and are sure of the recognition of their success by everyone vronsky knew that radiant air and immediately observed it in serpukhovskoy 
 as serpukhovskoy came down the steps he saw vronsky a smile of pleasure lighted up his face he tossed his head upward and waved the glass in his hand greeting vronsky and showing him by the gesture that he could not come to him before kissing the sergeant who stood craning forward his lips ready to be kissed 
 here he is shouted the colonel iashvin told me you were in one of your gloomy tempers 
 serpukhovskoy kissed the moist fresh lips of the brave sergeant and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief walked up to vronsky 
 how glad i am he said squeezing his hand and drawing him to one side 
 you look after him the colonel shouted to iashvin pointing to vronsky and he went down below to the soldiers 
 why you at the races yesterday i expected to see you there said vronsky scrutinizing serpukhovskoy 
 i did go but late i beg your pardon he added and turned to the adjutant please have this distributed from me each man as much as it comes to 
 and he hurriedly took three notes for a hundred roubles each from his pocketbook and blushed 
 vronsky have a bite or a drink asked iashvin hi something for the count to eat there drink that 
 the spree at the lasted a long while 
 there was a great deal of drinking they swung serpukhovskoy and tossed him in the air then they did the same to the colonel then to the accompaniment of the band the colonel himself danced with petritsky then the colonel who began to show signs of weakening sat down on a bench in the courtyard and began demonstrating to iashvin the superiority of russia over prussia especially in cavalry attack and there was a lull in the revelry for a moment serpukhovskoy went into the house to the bathroom to wash his hands and found vronsky there vronsky was sousing his head with water he had taken off his coat and put his red hairy neck under the tap and was rubbing it and his head with his hands when he had finished vronsky sat down by serpukhovskoy they both sat down in the bathroom on a lounge and a conversation began which was very interesting to both of them 
 always been hearing about you through my wife said serpukhovskoy glad been seeing her pretty often 
 friendly with varia and the only women in peterburg i care about seeing answered vronsky smiling he smiled because he foresaw the topic the conversation would turn to and he was glad of it 
 the only ones serpukhovskoy queried smiling 
 yes and i heard news of you but not only through your wife said vronsky checking hint by assuming a stern expression i was greatly delighted to hear of your success but not a bit surprised i expected even more 
 serpukhovskoy smiled such an opinion of him was obviously agreeable to him and he did not think it necessary to conceal it 
 well i on the contrary expected less own up frankly but glad very glad ambitious my weakness and i confess to it 
 perhaps you confess to it if you been successful said vronsky 
 i suppose so said serpukhovskoy smiling again i say life be worth living without it but it would be dull of course i may be mistaken but i fancy i have a certain capacity for the line chosen and that if there is to be power of any sort in my hands it will be better than in the hands of a good many people i know said serpukhovskoy with beaming consciousness of success and so the nearer i get to it the better pleased i am 
 perhaps that is true for you but not for everyone i used to think so too but now i see and think life worth living not only for that 
 there it comes there it comes said serpukhovskoy laughing ever since i heard about you about your refusal i began of course i approved of what you did but there are ways of doing everything and i think your action was good in itself but you do it in quite the way you should have done 
 done be undone and you know i never go back on what done and besides very well off 
 very well off for the time but not satisfied with that i say this to your brother a charming child like our host here there he goes he added listening to the roar of a hurrah and happy that does not satisfy you 
 i say it did 
 yes but not the only thing such men as you are wanted 
 by whom 
 by whom by society by russia russia needs men she needs a party or else everything goes and will go to the dogs 
 how do you mean party against the russian communists 
 no said serpukhovskoy frowning with vexation at being suspected of such an absurdity tout a est une blague that has always been and always will be there are no communists but intriguing people have to invent a noxious dangerous party an old trick no wanted is a powerful party of independent men like you and me 
 but why so vronsky mentioned a few men who were in power why they independent men 
 simply because they have not or have not had from birth an independent fortune not had a name they born close to the sun as we were they can be bought either by money or by favor and they have to find a support for themselves in inventing a trend and they bring forward some notion some trend that they believe in that does harm and the whole policy is really only a means to a house at the expense of the crown and so much income cela pas plus fin que a when you get a peep at their cards i may be inferior to them more stupid perhaps though i see why i should be inferior to them but you and i have one important certain advantage over them in being more difficult to buy and such men are more needed than ever 
 vronsky listened attentively but he was not so much interested by the meaning of the words as by the attitude of serpukhovskoy who was already contemplating a struggle with the existing powers and already had his likes and dislikes in that world while his own interest in his service did not go beyond the interests of his squadron vronsky felt too how powerful serpukhovskoy might become through his unmistakable faculty for thinking things out and for taking things in through his intelligence and gift of eloquence so rarely met with in the world in which he moved and ashamed as he was of the feeling he felt envious 
 still i the one thing of paramount importance for that he answered i the desire for power i had it once but gone 
 excuse me not true said serpukhovskoy smiling 
 yes true true now to be truthful vronsky added 
 yes true now another thing but that now last forever 
 perhaps answered vronsky 
 you say perhaps serpukhovskoy went on as though guessing his thoughts but i say for certain and what i wanted to see you for your action was just what it should have been i see that but you ought not to persevere in it i only ask you to give me carte blanche not going to offer you my protection though indeed why i protect you protected me often enough i should hope our friendship rises above all that sort of thing yes he said smiling to him as tenderly as a woman give me carte blanche retire from the regiment and get you in imperceptibly 
 but you must understand that i want nothing said vronsky except to leave things just as they were 
 serpukhovskoy got up and stood facing him 
 you said leave things just as they were i understand what that means but listen the same age known a greater number of women perhaps than i have smile and gestures told vronsky that he be afraid that he would be tender and careful in touching the sore place but married and believe me in getting to know wife thoroughly if one loves her as someone has said one gets to know all women better than if one knew thousands of them 
 coming directly vronsky shouted to an officer who looked into the room and called them to the colonel 
 vronsky was longing now to hear serpukhovskoy to the end and know what he would say to him 
 and my opinion for you women are the chief stumbling block in a career hard to love a woman and do anything only one way of having love conveniently without its being a hindrance marriage now how am i to tell you what i mean said serpukhovskoy who liked similes wait wait a minute yes just as you can only carry a fardeau yet do something with your hands when the fardeau is tied on your back and marriage and what i felt when i was married my hands were suddenly set free but if you drag that fardeau about with you without marriage your hands will always be so full that you can do nothing look at mazankov at krupov ruined their careers for the sake of women 
 what women said vronsky recalling the frenchwoman and the actress with whom the two men he had mentioned were connected 
 the firmer the footing in society the worse it is much the same as not merely carrying the fardeau in your arms but tearing it away from someone else 
 you have never loved vronsky said softly looking straight before him and thinking of anna 
 perhaps but you remember what said to you and another thing women are all more materialistic than men we make something immense out of love but they are always 
 directly directly he cried to a footman who came in but the footman had not come to call them again as he supposed the footman brought vronsky a note 
 a man brought it from princess tverskaia 
 vronsky opened the letter and flushed crimson 
 my begun to ache going home he said to serpukhovskoy 
 oh then you give me carte blanche 
 talk about it later on look you up in peterburg

 it was six already and so in order to be there quickly and at the same time not to drive with his own horses known to everyone vronsky got into hackney coach and told the coachman to drive as quickly as possible it was a roomy coach with seats for four he sat in one corner stretched his legs out on the front seat and sank into deep thought 
 a vague sense of the clearness to which his affairs had been brought a vague recollection of the friendliness and flattery of serpukhovskoy who had considered him a man who was needed and most of all the anticipation of the meeting before him all blended into a general joyous sense of life this feeling was so strong that he could not help smiling he dropped his legs crossed one leg over the other knee and taking it in his hand felt the springy muscle of the calf where it had been grazed the day before by his fall and leaning back he drew several deep breaths 
 happy very happy he said to himself he had often before had this sense of physical joy in his own body but he had never felt so fond of himself of his own body as at that moment he enjoyed the slight ache in his strong leg he enjoyed the muscular sensation of movement in his chest as he breathed the bright cold august day which had made anna feel so hopeless seemed to him keenly stimulating and refreshed his face and neck that still tingled from the cold water the scent of brilliantine on his mustaches struck him as particularly pleasant in the fresh air everything he saw from the carriage window everything in that cold pure air in the pale light of the sunset was as fresh and gay and strong as he was himself the roofs of the houses shining in the rays of the setting sun the sharp outlines of fences and angles of buildings the figures of and carriages that met him now and then the motionless green of the trees and grass the fields with evenly drawn furrows of potatoes and the slanting shadows that fell from the houses and trees and bushes and even from the rows of potatoes everything was bright like a pretty landscape freshly painted and varnished 
 get on get on he said to the driver putting his head out of the window and pulling a note out of his pocket he handed it to the man as he looked round the hand fumbled with something at the lamp the whip cracked and the coach rolled rapidly along the smooth highroad 
 i want nothing nothing but this happiness he thought staring at the bone button of the bell in the space between the windows and picturing to himself anna just as he had seen her last time and as i go on i love her more and more the garden of the crown villa whereabouts will she be where how why did she fix on this place to meet me and why does she write in letter he thought now for the first time wondering at it but there was now no time for wonder he called to the driver to stop before reaching the avenue and opening the door jumped out of the carriage as it was moving and went up the avenue that led to the house there was no one in the avenue but looking round to the right he caught sight of her her face was hidden by a veil but he drank in with glad eyes the special movement in walking peculiar to her alone the slope of her shoulders and the setting of her head and at once a sort of electric shock ran all over him with fresh force he felt conscious of himself from the springy movements of his legs to the movements of his lungs as he breathed and something set his lips twitching 
 joining him she pressed his hand tightly 
 not angry because i sent for you i absolutely had to see you she said and the serious and set line of her lips which he saw under the veil transformed his mood at once 
 i angry but how have you come where 
 never mind she said laying her hand on his arm come along i must talk to you 
 he saw that something had happened and that the interview would not be a joyous one in her presence he had no will of his own without knowing the grounds of her distress he already felt the same distress unconsciously passing over him 
 what is it what he asked her squeezing her hand with his elbow and trying to read her thoughts in her face 
 she walked on a few steps in silence gathering up her courage then suddenly she stopped 
 i did not tell you yesterday she began breathing quickly and painfully that coming home with alexei alexandrovich i told him everything told him i could not be his wife that and told him everything 
 he heard her unconsciously bending his whole figure down to her as though hoping in this way to soften the hardness of her position for her but directly she had said this he suddenly drew himself up and a proud and hard expression came over his face 
 
 yes yes better a thousand times better i know how painful it was he said but she was not listening to his words she was reading his thoughts from the expression of his face she could not guess that that arose from the first idea that presented itself to vronsky that a duel was now inevitable the idea of a duel had never crossed her mind and so she put a different interpretation on this passing expression of hardness 
 when she got her letter she knew then at the bottom of her heart that everything would go on in the old way that she would not have the strength of will to forego her position to abandon her son and to join her lover the morning spent at princess had confirmed her still more in this but this interview was still of the utmost gravity for her she hoped that this interview would transform her position and save her if on hearing this news he were to say to her resolutely passionately without an wavering throw up everything and come with me she would give up her son and go away with him but this news had not produced on him the effect she had expected he simply seemed resentful of some affront 
 it was not in the least painful for me it happened of itself she said irritably and see she pulled her letter out of her glove 
 i understand i understand he interrupted her taking the letter but not reading it and trying to soothe her the one thing i longed for the one thing i prayed for was to cut short this position so as to devote my life to your happiness 
 why do you tell me that she said do you suppose i can doubt it if i doubted 
 that coming said vronsky suddenly pointing to two ladies walking toward them perhaps they know us and he hurriedly turned off drawing her after him into a side path 
 oh i care she said her lips were quivering and he fancied that her eyes looked with strange fury at him from under her veil i tell you not the point i doubt that but see what he writes me read it she stood still again 
 again just as at the first moment of hearing of her rupture with her husband vronsky on reading the letter was unconsciously carried away by the natural sensation aroused in him by his own relation to the injured husband now while he held his letter in his hands he could not help picturing the challenge which he would most likely find at home today or tomorrow and the duel itself in which with the same cold and haughty expression that his face was assuming at this moment he would await the injured shot after having himself fired into the air and at that instant there flashed across his mind the thought of what serpukhovskoy had just said to him and what he had himself been thinking in the morning that it was better not to bind himself and he knew that he could not tell her this thought 
 having read the letter he raised his eyes to her and there was no firmness in them she saw at once that he had been thinking about it before by himself she knew that whatever he might say to her he would not say all he thought and she knew that her last hope had failed her this was not what she had been looking for 
 you see the sort of man he is she said with a shaking voice he 
 forgive me but i rejoice at it vronsky interrupted for sake let me finish he added his eyes imploring her to give him time to explain his words i rejoice because things cannot cannot possibly remain as he supposes 
 why they anna said restraining her tears and obviously attaching no sort of consequence to what he said she felt that her fate was sealed 
 vronsky meant that after the duel inevitable he thought things could not go on as before but he said something different 
 it go on i hope that now you will leave him i hope he was confused and reddened that you will let me arrange and plan our life tomorrow he was beginning 
 she did not let him go on 
 but my child she shrieked you see what he writes i should have to leave him and i and do that 
 but for sake which is better to leave your child or keep up this degrading situation 
 to whom is it degrading 
 to all and most of all to you 
 you say degrading say that these words have no meaning for me she said in a shaking voice she did not want him now to say what was untrue she had nothing left her but his love and she wanted to love him you understand that from the day i loved you everything has changed for me for me there is one thing and one thing only your love if mine i feel so exalted so strong that nothing can be degrading to me i am proud of my position because proud of being proud she could not say what she was proud of tears of shame and despair choked her utterance she stood still and sobbed 
 he felt too something swelling in his throat and twitching in his nose and for the first time in his life he felt on the point of weeping he could not have said exactly what it was touched him so he felt sorry for her and he felt he could not help her and with that he knew that he was to blame for her wretchedness and that he had done something wrong 
 a divorce possible he said feebly she shook her head without answering you take your son and still leave him 
 yes but it all depends on him now i must go to him she said shortly her presentiment that all would again go on in the old way had not deceived her 
 on tuesday i shall be in peterburg and everything can be settled 
 yes she said but let us talk any more of it 
 carriage which she had sent away and ordered to come back to the little gate of the vrede garden drove up anna said to vronsky and drove home

 chapter 
 
 on monday there was the usual session of the commission of the nd of june alexei alexandrovich walked into the hall where the session was held greeted the members and the president as usual and sat down in his place putting his hand on the papers laid ready before him among those papers lay the necessary evidence and a rough outline of the speech he intended to make but he did not really need these documents he remembered every point and did not think it necessary to go over in his memory what he would say he knew that when the time came and when he saw his enemy facing him and studiously endeavoring to assume an expression of indifference his speech would flow of itself better than he could prepare it now he felt that the import of his speech was of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight meantime as he listened to the usual report he had the most innocent and inoffensive air no one looking at his white hands with their swollen veins and long fingers so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay before him and at the air of weariness with which his head drooped on one side would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words would flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm set the members shouting and attacking one another and force the president to call for order when the report was over alexei alexandrovich announced in his subdued delicate voice that he had several points to bring before the meeting in regard to the organization of the native tribes all attention was turned upon him alexei alexandrovich cleared his throat and without looking at his opponent but selecting as he always did while he was delivering his speeches the first person sitting opposite him an inoffensive little old man who never had an opinion of any sort in the commission began to expound his views when he reached the point about the basic and organic law his opponent jumped up and began to protest stremov who was also a member of the commission and was also stung to the quick began defending himself and an altogether stormy session followed but alexei alexandrovich triumphed and his motion was carried three new commissions were appointed and the next day in a certain peterburg circle nothing else was talked of but this session alexei success had been even greater than he had anticipated 
 next morning tuesday alexei alexandrovich on awaking recollected with pleasure his triumph of the previous day and he could not help smiling though he tried to appear indifferent when the head clerk anxious to flatter him informed him of the rumors that had reached him concerning what had happened in the commission 
 absorbed in business with the head clerk alexei alexandrovich had completely forgotten that it was tuesday the day fixed by him for the return of anna arkadyevna and he was surprised and received a shock of annoyance when a servant came in to inform him of her arrival 
 anna had arrived in peterburg early in the morning the carriage had been sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram and so alexei alexandrovich might have known of her arrival but when she arrived he did not meet her she was told that he had not yet gone out but was busy with the head clerk she sent word to her husband that she had come went to her own room and occupied herself in sorting out her things expecting he would come to her but an hour passed he did not come she went into the dining room on the pretext of giving some directions and spoke loudly on purpose expecting him to come out there but he did not come though she heard him go to the door of his study as he parted from the head clerk she knew that he should before long go out to his office as usual and she wanted to see him before that so that their attitude to one another might be defined 
 she walked across the drawing room and went resolutely to him when she went into his study he was in official uniform obviously ready to go out sitting at a little table on which he rested his elbows looking dejectedly before him she saw him before he saw her and she knew that he was thinking of her 
 on seeing her he would have risen but changed his mind then his face flushed hotly a thing anna had never seen before and he got up quickly and went to meet her looking not at her eyes but above them at her forehead and hair he went up to her took her by the hand and asked her to sit down 
 i am very glad you have come he said sitting down beside her and obviously wishing to say something he stuttered several times he attempted to speak but stopped in spite of the fact that in preparing herself for meeting him she had schooled herself to despise and accuse him she did not know what to say to him and she felt pity for him and so the silence lasted rather long is seriozha quite well he said and without waiting for an answer he added i be dining at home today and i must go out directly 
 i had thought of going to moscow she said 
 no you did quite quite right to come he said and was silent again 
 seeing that he was powerless to begin the conversation she began herself 
 alexei alexandrovich she said looking at him and without dropping her eyes under his persistent gaze at her hair a guilty woman a bad woman yet i am the same as i was as i told you then and i have come to tell you that i can change nothing 
 i asked you about that he said all at once resolutely and with hatred looking her straight in the face that was as i had supposed under the influence of anger he apparently regained complete possession of all his faculties but as i told you then and have written to you he said in a thin shrill voice i repeat now that i am not bound to know this i ignore it not all wives are so kind as you to be in such a hurry to communicate such agreeable news to their husbands he laid special emphasis on the word agreeable i shall ignore it so long as the world knows nothing of it so long as my name is not disgraced and so i simply inform you that our relations must be just as they have always been and that only in the event of your compromising yourself i shall be obliged to take steps to secure my honor 
 but our relations cannot be the same as always anna began in a timid voice looking at him with dismay 
 when she saw once more those composed gestures heard that shrill childlike and sarcastic voice her aversion for him extinguished her pity for him and she felt only afraid but at all costs she wanted to make clear her position 
 i cannot be your wife while i she began 
 he laughed a cold and malignant laugh 
 the manner of life you have chosen is reflected i suppose in your ideas i have so much of both respect and contempt i respect your past and despise your present that i was far from the interpretation you put on my words 
 anna sighed and bowed her head 
 though indeed i fail to comprehend how with the independence you show he went on getting hot announcing your infidelity to your husband and seeing nothing reprehensible in it apparently you can see anything reprehensible in performing a duties in relation to your husband 
 alexei alexandrovich what is it you want of me 
 i want never to meet that man here and i want you to conduct yourself so that neither society nor the servants could possibly reproach you i want you not to see him not much i think and in return you will enjoy all the privileges of a faithful wife without fulfilling her duties all i have to say to you now time for me to go not dining at home he got up and moved toward the door 
 anna got up too bowing in silence he let her pass before him

 on monday there was the usual session of the commission of the nd of june alexei alexandrovich walked into the hall where the session was held greeted the members and the president as usual and sat down in his place putting his hand on the papers laid ready before him among those papers lay the necessary evidence and a rough outline of the speech he intended to make but he did not really need these documents he remembered every point and did not think it necessary to go over in his memory what he would say he knew that when the time came and when he saw his enemy facing him and studiously endeavoring to assume an expression of indifference his speech would flow of itself better than he could prepare it now he felt that the import of his speech was of such magnitude that every word of it would have weight meantime as he listened to the usual report he had the most innocent and inoffensive air no one looking at his white hands with their swollen veins and long fingers so softly stroking the edges of the white paper that lay before him and at the air of weariness with which his head drooped on one side would have suspected that in a few minutes a torrent of words would flow from his lips that would arouse a fearful storm set the members shouting and attacking one another and force the president to call for order when the report was over alexei alexandrovich announced in his subdued delicate voice that he had several points to bring before the meeting in regard to the organization of the native tribes all attention was turned upon him alexei alexandrovich cleared his throat and without looking at his opponent but selecting as he always did while he was delivering his speeches the first person sitting opposite him an inoffensive little old man who never had an opinion of any sort in the commission began to expound his views when he reached the point about the basic and organic law his opponent jumped up and began to protest stremov who was also a member of the commission and was also stung to the quick began defending himself and an altogether stormy session followed but alexei alexandrovich triumphed and his motion was carried three new commissions were appointed and the next day in a certain peterburg circle nothing else was talked of but this session alexei success had been even greater than he had anticipated 
 next morning tuesday alexei alexandrovich on awaking recollected with pleasure his triumph of the previous day and he could not help smiling though he tried to appear indifferent when the head clerk anxious to flatter him informed him of the rumors that had reached him concerning what had happened in the commission 
 absorbed in business with the head clerk alexei alexandrovich had completely forgotten that it was tuesday the day fixed by him for the return of anna arkadyevna and he was surprised and received a shock of annoyance when a servant came in to inform him of her arrival 
 anna had arrived in peterburg early in the morning the carriage had been sent to meet her in accordance with her telegram and so alexei alexandrovich might have known of her arrival but when she arrived he did not meet her she was told that he had not yet gone out but was busy with the head clerk she sent word to her husband that she had come went to her own room and occupied herself in sorting out her things expecting he would come to her but an hour passed he did not come she went into the dining room on the pretext of giving some directions and spoke loudly on purpose expecting him to come out there but he did not come though she heard him go to the door of his study as he parted from the head clerk she knew that he should before long go out to his office as usual and she wanted to see him before that so that their attitude to one another might be defined 
 she walked across the drawing room and went resolutely to him when she went into his study he was in official uniform obviously ready to go out sitting at a little table on which he rested his elbows looking dejectedly before him she saw him before he saw her and she knew that he was thinking of her 
 on seeing her he would have risen but changed his mind then his face flushed hotly a thing anna had never seen before and he got up quickly and went to meet her looking not at her eyes but above them at her forehead and hair he went up to her took her by the hand and asked her to sit down

 the night spent by levin on the haycock did not pass without an effect upon him the way in which he had been managing his land revolted him and lost all attraction for him in spite of the magnificent harvest never had there been or at least it had never seemed so to him so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the peasants as that year and the origin of these failures and this hostility was now perfectly comprehensible to him the delight he had experienced in the work itself and the consequent greater intimacy with the peasants the envy he felt of them of their life the desire to adopt that life which had been to him that night not a dream but an intention the execution of which he had thought out in detail all this had so transformed his view of the farming of the land as he had managed it that he could not take his former interest in it and could not help seeing that unpleasant relation between him and the workpeople which was the foundation of it all the herd of improved cows such as pava the whole land plowed over and enriched the nine level fields surrounded with willow fences the ninety dessiatinas heavily manured drill plows and all the rest of it it was all splendid if only the work had been done by himself or by himself and his comrades by people in sympathy with him but he saw clearly now his work on a book of agriculture in which the chief element in husbandry was to have been the laborer greatly assisted him in this that the sort of farming he was carrying on was nothing but a cruel and stubborn struggle between him and the laborers in which there was on one side his side a continual intense effort to change everything to a pattern he considered better on the other side the natural order of things and in this struggle he saw that with immense expenditure of force on his side and with no effort or even intention on the other side the sole attainment was that the work did not go to the liking of either side and that splendid tools splendid cattle and land were spoiled with no good to anyone worst of all the energy expended on this work was not merely wasted he could not help feeling now since the meaning of his system had become clear to him that the aim of his energy was a most unworthy one in reality what was the struggle about he was struggling for every groat and he could not help it for he had only to relax his efforts and he would not have had the money to pay his laborers wages while they were only struggling to be able to do their work easily and agreeably that is to say as they were used to doing it it was for his interests that every laborer should work as hard as possible and that while doing so he should keep his wits about him so as to try not to break the winnowing machines the horse rakes the threshing machines that he should attend to what he was doing what the laborer wanted was to work as pleasantly as possible with rests and above all carelessly and heedlessly without thinking that summer levin saw this at every step he sent the men to mow some clover for hay picking out the worst patches where the clover was overgrown with grass and weeds and of no use for seed again and again they mowed his best dessiatinas of seed clover justifying themselves by the pretext that the bailiff had told them to and trying to pacify him with the assurance that it would make splendid hay but he knew that it was because those dessiatinas were so much easier to mow he sent out a hay machine for pitching the hay it was broken at the first row because it was dull work for a peasant to sit on the seat in front with the great wings waving above him and he was told trouble sure the womenfolks will pitch it quick enough the plows were practically useless because it never occurred to the laborer to raise the colter when he turned the plow and in forcing it round he tortured the horse and spoiled the ground and then begged levin not to mind it the horses were allowed to stray into the wheat because not a single laborer wanted to be night watchman and in spite of orders to the contrary the laborers insisted on taking turns for night duty about the horses and when vanka after working all day long fell asleep he would say very penitent for his fault do what you will to me 
 three of the best heifers were allowed to overeat themselves to death by letting them into the clover aftermath without care as to drenching them and nothing would make the men believe that they had been blown out by the clover but they told levin by way of consolation that one of his neighbors had lost a hundred and twelve head of cattle in three days all this happened not because anyone felt ill will to levin or to his farming on the contrary he knew that they liked him thinking him a simple gentleman their highest praise but it happened simply because all they wanted was to work merrily and carelessly and his interests were not only remote and incomprehensible to them but fatally opposed to their most just claims long before levin had felt dissatisfaction with his own position in regard to the land he saw that his boat leaked but he did not look for the leak perhaps purposely deceiving himself but now he could deceive himself no longer the farming of the land as he was managing it had become not merely unattractive but revolting to him and he could take no further interest in it

 chapter 
 
 in the surovsky district there was neither railway nor mail coach and levin drove there with his own horses in his tarantass 
 he stopped halfway at a to feed his horses a bald old man with a broad red beard grizzled on his cheeks opened the gate squeezing against the gatepost to let the troika pass directing the coachman to a place under the shed in the big clean tidy new yard with charred wooden plows in it the old man asked levin to come into the room a cleanly dressed young housewife with clogs on her bare feet was scrubbing the floor in the new outer room she was frightened by the dog that ran in after levin and uttered a shriek but began laughing at her own fright at once when she was told the dog would not hurt her pointing out to levin with her bare arm the door into the room she bent down again hiding her handsome face and went on scrubbing 
 would you like a samovar she asked 
 yes please 
 the room was a big one with a tile stove and a partition dividing it into two under the icons stood a table painted in patterns a bench and two chairs near the entrance was a dresser full of crockery the shutters were closed there were few flies and it was so clean that levin was anxious that laska who had been running along the road and bathing in puddles should not muddy the floor and ordered her to a place in the corner by the door after looking round the room levin went out in the back yard the comely young housewife in clogs swinging the empty pails on the yoke ran on before him to the well for water 
 look sharp my girl the old man shouted after her and he walked up to levin well sir are you going to nikolai ivanovich sviiazhsky he comes to us too he began chatting leaning his elbows on the railing of the steps in the middle of the old account of his acquaintance with sviiazhsky the gates creaked again and laborers came into the yard from the fields with wooden plows and harrows the horses harnessed to the plows and harrows were sleek and fat the laborers were obviously of the household two were young men in shirts and caps the two others were hired laborers in homespun shirts one an old man the other a young fellow 
 moving off from the steps the old man went up to the horses and began unharnessing them 
 what have they been plowing asked levin 
 plowing up the potatoes we rent a bit of land too fedot let out the gelding but take it to the trough and put another in harness 
 oh father about the plowshares i ordered has he brought them along asked the big robust fellow obviously the old son 
 there in the sledge answered the old man rolling up the reins he had taken off and flinging them on the ground you can put them right while they have dinner 
 the comely young housewife came into the outer room with the full pails dragging at her shoulders more women came on the scene from somewhere young and handsome old and ugly with children and without children 
 the samovar was beginning to sing the laborers and the family having disposed of the horses came in to dinner levin getting his provisions out of his carriage invited the old man to take tea with him 
 well i have had some today already said the old man obviously accepting the invitation with pleasure well be it so for company 
 over their tea levin heard all about the old farming ten years before the old man had rented a hundred and twenty dessiatinas from the lady who owned them and a year ago he had bought them and rented another three hundred from a neighboring landowner a small part of the land the worst part he let out for rent while some forty dessiatinas of arable land he cultivated himself with his family and two hired laborers the old man complained that things were going badly but levin saw that he simply did so from a feeling of propriety and that his farm was in a flourishing condition if it had been unsuccessful he would not have bought land at a hundred and five roubles the dessiatina he would not have married off his three sons and a nephew he would not have rebuilt twice after fires and each time on a larger scale in spite of the old complaints it was evident that he was proud and justly proud of his prosperity proud of his sons his nephew his sons wives his horses and his cows and especially of the fact that he was keeping all this farming going from his conversation with the old man levin realized he was not averse to new methods either he had planted a great many potatoes and his potatoes as levin had seen driving past were already past flowering and beginning to ripen whereas were only just coming into flower he plowed the ground for his potatoes with a modern plow borrowed from a neighboring landowner he sowed wheat the trifling fact that thinning out his rye the old man used the rye he thinned out for his horses struck levin especially how many times had levin seen this splendid fodder wasted and tried to get it saved but always it had turned out to be impossible this peasant had done so and he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beasts 
 what have the wenches to do they carry it out in bundles to the roadside and the cart brings it away 
 well we landowners manage well with our laborers said levin handing him a glass of tea 
 thanks said the old man and he took the glass but refused sugar pointing to a bit he had left no getting along with them said he simple waste look at sviiazhsky for instance we know what the like yet not much of a crop to boast of not looked after enough all it is 
 but you work your land with hired laborers 
 all peasants together we go into everything ourselves if a no use he can go and we can manage by ourselves 
 father finogen wants some tar said the young woman in the clogs coming in 
 yes yes how it is sir said the old man getting up and crossing himself lingeringly he thanked levin and went out 
 when levin went in the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the whole family of men at dinner the women were standing up waiting on them the young robust son was telling something funny with his mouth full of buckwheat porridge and they were all laughing the woman in the clogs who was pouring cabbage soup into a bowl laughing most merrily of all 
 very probably the comely face of the young woman in the clogs had a good deal to do with the impression of this peasant household made upon levin but the impression was so strong that levin could never get rid of it and all the way from the old to he kept recalling this peasant farm as though there were something in this impression demanding his special attention

 over their tea levin heard all about the old farming ten years before the old man had rented a hundred and twenty dessiatinas from the lady who owned them and a year ago he had bought them and rented another three hundred from a neighboring landowner a small part of the land the worst part he let out for rent while some forty dessiatinas of arable land he cultivated himself with his family and two hired laborers the old man complained that things were going badly but levin saw that he simply did so from a feeling of propriety and that his farm was in a flourishing condition if it had been unsuccessful he would not have bought land at a hundred and five roubles the dessiatina he would not have married off his three sons and a nephew he would not have rebuilt twice after fires and each time on a larger scale in spite of the old complaints it was evident that he was proud and justly proud of his prosperity proud of his sons his nephew his sons wives his horses and his cows and especially of the fact that he was keeping all this farming going from his conversation with the old man levin realized he was not averse to new methods either he had planted a great many potatoes and his potatoes as levin had seen driving past were already past flowering and beginning to ripen whereas were only just coming into flower he plowed the ground for his potatoes with a modern plow borrowed from a neighboring landowner he sowed wheat the trifling fact that thinning out his rye the old man used the rye he thinned out for his horses struck levin especially how many times had levin seen this splendid fodder wasted and tried to get it saved but always it had turned out to be impossible this peasant had done so and he could not say enough in praise of it as food for the beasts 
 what have the wenches to do they carry it out in bundles to the roadside and the cart brings it away 
 well we landowners manage well with our laborers said levin handing him a glass of tea 
 thanks said the old man and he took the glass but refused sugar pointing to a bit he had left no getting along with them said he simple waste look at sviiazhsky for instance we know what the like yet not much of a crop to boast of not looked after enough all it is 
 but you work your land with hired laborers 
 all peasants together we go into everything ourselves if a no use he can go and we can manage by ourselves 
 father finogen wants some tar said the young woman in the clogs coming in 
 yes yes how it is sir said the old man getting up and crossing himself lingeringly he thanked levin and went out 
 when levin went in the kitchen to call his coachman he saw the whole family of men at dinner the women were standing up waiting on them the young robust son was telling something funny with his mouth full of buckwheat porridge and they were all laughing the woman in the clogs who was pouring cabbage soup into a bowl laughing most merrily of all 
 very probably the comely face of the young woman in the clogs had a good deal to do with the impression of this peasant household made upon levin but the impression was so strong that levin could never get rid of it and all the way from the old to he kept recalling this peasant farm as though there were something in this impression demanding his special attention

 sviiazhsky was the marshal of his district he was five years older than levin and had long been married his a young girl levin liked very much lived in his house and levin knew that sviiazhsky and his wife would have greatly liked to marry the girl to him he knew this with certainty as eligible young men always know it though he could never have brought himself to speak of it to anyone and he also knew that although he wanted to get married and although by every token this very attractive girl would make an excellent wife he could no more have married her even if he had not been in love with kitty shcherbatskaia than he could have flown up to the sky and this knowledge poisoned the pleasure he had hoped to find in the visit to sviiazhsky 
 on getting letter with the invitation for shooting levin had immediately thought of this but in spite of it he had made up his mind that having such views for him was simply his own groundless supposition and so he would go notwithstanding besides at the bottom of his heart he had a desire to try himself to put himself to the test in regard to this girl the sviiazhskys home life was exceedingly pleasant and sviiazhsky himself the best type of zemstvo man that levin knew was very interesting to him 
 sviiazhsky was one of those people always a source of wonder to levin whose convictions very logical though never original go one way by themselves while their life exceedingly definite and firm in its course goes its way quite apart and almost always in direct contradiction to their convictions sviiazhsky was an extremely advanced man he despised the nobility and believed the mass of the nobility to be secretly in favor of serfdom and only concealing their views out of cowardice he regarded russia as a ruined country rather after the style of turkey and the government of russia as so bad that he never permitted himself to criticize its doings seriously and yet he was a functionary of that government and a model marshal of nobility and when he drove about he always wore his cap with the cockade and red band he considered human life only tolerable abroad and went abroad to stay at every opportunity and at the same time he carried on a complex and improved system of agriculture in russia and with extreme interest followed everything and knew everything that was being done in russia he considered the russian peasant as occupying a stage of development intermediate between the ape and the man and at the same time in the days of zemstvo election no one was readier to shake hands with the peasants and listen to their opinion he believed neither in god nor the devil but was much concerned about the question of the improvement of the clergy and the maintenance of their revenues and took special trouble to keep up the church in his village 
 on the woman question he was on the side of the extreme advocates of complete liberty for women and especially their right to labor but he lived with his wife on such terms that their affectionate childless home life was the admiration of everyone and arranged his life so that she did nothing and could do nothing but share her preoccupations in spending their time as happily and as agreeably as possible 
 if it had not been a characteristic of levin to put the most favorable interpretation on people character would have presented no doubt or difficulty to him he would have said to himself a fool or a knave and everything would have seemed clear but he could not say a fool because sviiazhsky was unmistakably clever and moreover a highly cultivated man who was exceptionally modest over his culture there was not a subject he knew nothing of but he did not display his knowledge except when he was compelled to do so still less could levin say that he was a knave as sviiazhsky was unmistakably an honest goodhearted sensible man who worked keenly and perseveringly at his work which was held in high honor by everyone about him and certainly he had never consciously done and was indeed incapable of doing anything base 
 levin tried to understand him and could not understand him and looked at him and his life as at a living enigma 
 levin and he were very friendly and so levin used to venture to sound sviiazhsky to try to get at the very foundation of his view of life but it was always in vain every time levin tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of mind which were hospitably open to all he noticed that sviiazhsky was slightly disconcerted faint signs of alarm were visible in his eyes as though he were afraid levin would understand him and he would give him a kindly rebuff 
 just now since his disenchantment with farming levin was particularly glad to stay with sviiazhsky apart from the fact that the sight of this happy and affectionate couple so pleased with themselves and everyone else and their home had always a cheering effect on levin he felt a longing now that he was so dissatisfied with his own life to get at that secret in sviiazhsky which gave him such clarity definiteness and good courage in life moreover levin knew that at he would meet the landowners of the neighborhood and it was particularly interesting for him just now to hear and take part in those rural conversations concerning crops laborers wages and so on which levin was aware are conventionally regarded as something very low but which seemed to him just now to constitute the one subject of importance it was not perhaps of importance in the days of serfdom and it may not be of importance in england in both cases the conditions of agriculture are firmly established but among us now when everything has been turned and is only just taking shape the question what form these conditions will take is the one question of importance in russia thought levin 
 the shooting turned out to be poorer than levin expected the marsh was dry and there were no snipe at all he walked about the whole day and only brought back three birds but to make up for that he brought back as he always did from shooting an excellent appetite excellent spirits and that keen intellectual mood which with him always accompanied violent physical exertion and while out shooting when he seemed to be thinking of nothing at all the old man and his family would time and again come to mind and the impression of them seemed to claim not merely his attention but the solution of some question connected with them 
 in the evening at tea two landowners who had come about some business connected with a wardship were of the party and the interesting conversation levin had been looking forward to sprang up 
 levin was sitting beside his hostess at the tea table and was obliged to keep up a conversation with her and her sister who was sitting opposite him madame sviiazhsky was a rather short woman all smiles and dimples levin tried through her to get at a solution of the weighty enigma her husband presented to his mind but he had not complete freedom of ideas because he was in an agony of embarrassment this agony of embarrassment was due to the fact that the was sitting opposite to him in a dress specially put on as he fancied for his benefit cut particularly open in the shape of a trapeze at her white bosom this quadrangular opening in spite of the being very white or just because it was very white deprived levin of the full use of his faculties he imagined probably mistakenly that this bodice had been made on his account and felt that he had no right to look at it and tried not to look at it but he felt that he was to blame for the very fact of the bodice having been made it seemed to levin that he had imposed upon someone that he ought to explain something but that to explain it was impossible and for that reason he was continually blushing was ill at ease and awkward his awkwardness infected the pretty too but their hostess appeared not to observe this and kept purposely drawing her into the conversation 
 you say she said pursuing the subject that had been started that my husband cannot be interested in russian quite the contrary he is in cheerful spirits abroad but never in such as he is here here he feels in his proper place he has so much to do and he has the faculty of interesting himself in everything oh not been to see our school have you 
 seen it the little house covered with ivy it 
 yes work she said indicating her sister 
 you teach in it yourself asked levin trying to look above the open neck but feeling that no matter where he looked in that direction he should see it 
 yes i used to teach in it myself and do teach still but we have a schoolmistress now and started gymnastic exercises 
 no thank you i have any more tea said levin and conscious of doing a rude thing but incapable of continuing the conversation he got up blushing i hear a very interesting conversation he added and walked to the other end of the table where sviiazhsky was sitting with the two gentlemen of the neighborhood sviiazhsky was sitting sideways with one elbow on the table and a cup in one hand while with the other hand he gathered up his beard held it to his nose and let it drop again as though he were smelling it his brilliant black eyes were looking directly at the excited country gentleman with gray mustaches and apparently he derived amusement from his remarks the gentleman was complaining of the peasants it was evident to levin that sviiazhsky knew the answer to this complaints which would at once demolish his whole contention but that in his position he could not give utterance to this answer and listened not without pleasure to the comic talk 
 the gentleman with the gray mustaches was obviously an inveterate adherent of serfdom and a devoted agriculturist who had lived all his life in the country levin saw proofs of this in his dress in his threadbare coat obviously not his everyday attire in his shrewd eyes in his coherent russian in the imperious tone that had become habitual from long use and in the resolute gestures of his large beautiful sunburned hands with a single old wedding ring on his fourth finger

 if only the heart to throw up been set going such a lot of trouble wasted turn my back on the whole business sell out go off like nikolai ivanovich to hear la belle hlne said the landowner a pleasant smile lighting up his shrewd old face 
 but you see you throw it up said nikolai ivanovich sviiazhsky so there must be something gained 
 the only gain is that i live in my own house neither bought nor hired besides one keeps hoping the people will learn sense though instead of that believe it or not there is such drunkenness such immorality they keep making partition of their bits of land there a horse or a cow the dying of hunger but just go and take him on as a laborer do his best to do you a mischief and then bring you up before the justice of the peace 
 but then you make complaints to the justice too said sviiazhsky 
 i lodge complaints not for anything in the world so much talk springs up that one is sorry ever to have complained at the works for instance they pocketed the advance money and made off what did the justice do why acquitted them nothing keeps them in order but their own communal court and their village elder flog them in the good old style but for that be nothing for it but to give it all up and run away 
 obviously the landowner was chaffing sviiazhsky who far from resenting it was apparently amused by it 
 but you see we manage our land without such extreme measures said he smiling levin and i and this gentleman 
 he indicated the other landowner 
 yes the done at mikhail but ask him how done do you call that a rational system said the landowner obviously rather proud of the word rational 
 my very simple said mikhail petrovich thank god all my management rests on getting the money ready for the autumn taxes the peasants come to me father master help us well the peasants are all neighbors one feels for them so one advances them a third but one says remember lads i have helped you and you must help me when i need it whether the sowing of the oats or the hay cutting or the harvest and well one agrees so much for each taxpayer though there are dishonest ones among them too true 
 levin who had long been familiar with these patriarchal methods exchanged glances with sviiazhsky and interrupted mikhail petrovich turning again to the gentleman with the gray mustaches 
 well what do you think he asked what system is one to adopt nowadays 
 why manage like mikhail petrovich or let the land for half the crop or for rent to the peasants one can do that only just how the general prosperity of the country is being ruined where the land with serf labor and good management gave a yield of nine to one on the metayage system it yields three to one russia has been ruined by the emancipation 
 sviiazhsky looked with smiling eyes at levin and even made a faint gesture of irony to him but levin did not think the words absurd he understood them better than he did sviiazhsky a great deal more of what the landowner said to show in what way russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very true new to him and quite incontestable the landowner unmistakably spoke his own individual thought a thing that rarely happens and a thought to which he had been brought not by a desire of finding some exercise for an idle brain but a thought which had grown up out of the conditions of his life which he had brooded over in the solitude of his village and had considered in every aspect 
 the point is you see that progress of every sort is only made by the use of authority he said evidently wishing to show he was not without culture take the reforms of peter of catherine of alexander take european history and progress in agriculture more than anything else the potato for instance that was introduced among us by force the wooden plow too always used it was introduced in the days of appanaged princes perhaps but it was probably brought in by force now in our own day we landowners in the serf times used various improvements in our husbandry drying machines and threshing machines and carting manure and all the modern implements all these we brought into use by our authority and the peasants opposed it at first and ended by imitating us now by the abolition of serfdom we have been deprived of our authority and so our husbandry where it had been raised to a high level is bound to sink to the most savage primitive condition how i see it 
 
 but why so if rational be able to keep up the same system with hired labor said sviiazhsky 
 no power over them with whom am i going to work the system allow me to ask 
 there it is the labor force the chief element in agriculture thought levin 
 with laborers 
 the laborers work well and work with good implements our laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a swine and then ruin everything you give him he spoils the horses by watering unseasonably he cuts good harness barters the tires of the wheels for drink drops bits of iron into the threshing machine so as to break it he loathes the sight of anything not after his fashion and how the whole level of husbandry has fallen lands gone out of cultivation overgrown with weeds or divided among the peasants and where millions of chetverts were raised you get a hundred thousand the wealth of the country has decreased if the same thing had been done but with consideration for 
 and he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of which these drawbacks might have been avoided 
 this did not interest levin but when he had finished levin went back to his first position and addressing sviiazhsky and trying to draw him into expressing his serious opinion said 
 perfectly true that the standard of culture is falling and that with our present relations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a rational system to yield a profit said he 
 i believe it sviiazhsky replied quite seriously all i see is that we know how to cultivate the land and that our system of agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high but too low we have no machines no good stock no efficient supervision we even know how to keep accounts ask any landowner he be able to tell you which profitable and which 
 italian bookkeeping said the landowner ironically you may keep your books as you like but if they spoil everything for you there be any profit 
 why do they spoil things a poor threshing machine or your russian presser they will break but my steam press they break a wretched russian nag ruin but keep good percherons or the russian wagon horses they ruin them and so it is all round we must raise our farming to a higher level 
 oh if one only had the means to do it nikolai ivanovich all very well for you but for me with a son to keep at the university lads to be educated at the high school how am i going to buy these percherons 
 well what the banks are for 
 to get whatever i have left sold by auction no thank you 
 i agree that necessary or possible to raise the level of agriculture still higher said levin i devote myself to it and i have means but i can do nothing as to the banks i know to whom any good for my part anyway whatever spent money on in the way of husbandry has been a loss stock a loss machinery a loss 
 true enough the gentleman with the gray mustaches chimed in even laughing with satisfaction 
 and not the only one pursued levin i mix with all the neighboring landowners who are cultivating their land on a rational system they all with rare exceptions are doing so at a loss come tell us how does your land do does it pay said levin and at once in eyes he detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he had noticed whenever he had tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of mind 
 moreover this question on part was not quite in good faith madame sviiazhsky had just told him at tea that they had that summer invited a german expert accountant from moscow who for a consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management of their property and found that it was costing them a loss of three thousand odd roubles she did not remember the precise sum but it appeared that the german had worked it out to the fraction of a kopeck 
 the landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of farming obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal was likely to be making 
 possibly it does not pay answered sviiazhsky that merely proves that either a bad manager or that sunk my capital for the increase of my rents 
 oh rent levin cried with horror rent there may be in europe where land has been improved by the labor put into it but with us all the land is deteriorating from the labor put into it in other words working it out so no question of rent 
 how no rent a law 
 then outside the law rent explains nothing for us but simply muddles us no tell me how there can be a theory of rent 
 will you have some curded milk masha pass us some curded milk or raspberries he turned to his wife the raspberries are lasting extraordinarily late this year 
 and in the happiest frame of mind sviiazhsky got up and walked off apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point when to levin it seemed that it was only just beginning 
 having lost his antagonist levin continued the conversation with the landowner trying to prove to him that all the difficulty arises from the fact that we find out the peculiarities and habits of our laborer but the landowner like all men who think independently and in isolation was slow in taking in any other thought and particularly partial to his own he stuck to it that the russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness and that to get him out of his swinishness one must have authority and there is none one must have the stick and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand years with lawyers and model prisons where the worthless stinking peasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of air 
 what makes you think said levin trying to get back to the question that impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive 
 that never could be so with the russian people no authority answered the landowner 
 how can new conditions be found said sviiazhsky having eaten some curded milk and lighted a cigarette he came back to the discussion all possible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied he said the relic of barbarism the primitive commune with a guarantee for all will disappear of itself serfdom has been abolished there remains nothing but free labor and its forms are fixed and ready made and must be adopted permanent hands day laborers farmers you get out of those forms 
 but europe is dissatisfied with these forms 
 dissatisfied and seeking new ones and will find them in all probability 
 just what i meant answered levin why we seek them for ourselves 
 because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for constructing railways they are ready invented 
 but if they suit us if stupid said levin 
 and again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of sviiazhsky 
 oh yes bury the world under our caps found the secret europe was seeking for heard all that but excuse me do you know all been done in europe on the question of the organization of labor 
 no very little 
 that question is now absorbing the best minds in europe the movement and then all this enormous literature of the labor question the most liberal lassalle movement the mulhausen experiment a fact by now as probably aware 
 i have some idea of it but very vague 
 no you only say that no doubt you know all about it as well as i do no professor of sociology of course but it interested me and really if it interests you you ought to study it 
 but what conclusion have they come to 
 excuse me 
 the two neighbors had risen and sviiazhsky once more checking levin in his inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer chambers of his mind went to see his guests out

 sviiazhsky looked with smiling eyes at levin and even made a faint gesture of irony to him but levin did not think the words absurd he understood them better than he did sviiazhsky a great deal more of what the landowner said to show in what way russia was ruined by the emancipation struck him indeed as very true new to him and quite incontestable the landowner unmistakably spoke his own individual thought a thing that rarely happens and a thought to which he had been brought not by a desire of finding some exercise for an idle brain but a thought which had grown up out of the conditions of his life which he had brooded over in the solitude of his village and had considered in every aspect 
 the point is you see that progress of every sort is only made by the use of authority he said evidently wishing to show he was not without culture take the reforms of peter of catherine of alexander take european history and progress in agriculture more than anything else the potato for instance that was introduced among us by force the wooden plow too always used it was introduced in the days of appanaged princes perhaps but it was probably brought in by force now in our own day we landowners in the serf times used various improvements in our husbandry drying machines and threshing machines and carting manure and all the modern implements all these we brought into use by our authority and the peasants opposed it at first and ended by imitating us now by the abolition of serfdom we have been deprived of our authority and so our husbandry where it had been raised to a high level is bound to sink to the most savage primitive condition how i see it 
 
 but why so if rational be able to keep up the same system with hired labor said sviiazhsky 
 no power over them with whom am i going to work the system allow me to ask 
 there it is the labor force the chief element in agriculture thought levin 
 with laborers 
 the laborers work well and work with good implements our laborer can do nothing but get drunk like a swine and then ruin everything you give him he spoils the horses by watering unseasonably he cuts good harness barters the tires of the wheels for drink drops bits of iron into the threshing machine so as to break it he loathes the sight of anything not after his fashion and how the whole level of husbandry has fallen lands gone out of cultivation overgrown with weeds or divided among the peasants and where millions of chetverts were raised you get a hundred thousand the wealth of the country has decreased if the same thing had been done but with consideration for 
 and he proceeded to unfold his own scheme of emancipation by means of which these drawbacks might have been avoided 
 this did not interest levin but when he had finished levin went back to his first position and addressing sviiazhsky and trying to draw him into expressing his serious opinion said 
 perfectly true that the standard of culture is falling and that with our present relations to the peasants there is no possibility of farming on a rational system to yield a profit said he 
 i believe it sviiazhsky replied quite seriously all i see is that we know how to cultivate the land and that our system of agriculture in the serf days was by no means too high but too low we have no machines no good stock no efficient supervision we even know how to keep accounts ask any landowner he be able to tell you which profitable and which 
 italian bookkeeping said the landowner ironically you may keep your books as you like but if they spoil everything for you there be any profit 
 why do they spoil things a poor threshing machine or your russian presser they will break but my steam press they break a wretched russian nag ruin but keep good percherons or the russian wagon horses they ruin them and so it is all round we must raise our farming to a higher level 
 oh if one only had the means to do it nikolai ivanovich all very well for you but for me with a son to keep at the university lads to be educated at the high school how am i going to buy these percherons 
 well what the banks are for 
 to get whatever i have left sold by auction no thank you 
 i agree that necessary or possible to raise the level of agriculture still higher said levin i devote myself to it and i have means but i can do nothing as to the banks i know to whom any good for my part anyway whatever spent money on in the way of husbandry has been a loss stock a loss machinery a loss 
 true enough the gentleman with the gray mustaches chimed in even laughing with satisfaction 
 and not the only one pursued levin i mix with all the neighboring landowners who are cultivating their land on a rational system they all with rare exceptions are doing so at a loss come tell us how does your land do does it pay said levin and at once in eyes he detected that fleeting expression of alarm which he had noticed whenever he had tried to penetrate beyond the outer chambers of mind 
 moreover this question on part was not quite in good faith madame sviiazhsky had just told him at tea that they had that summer invited a german expert accountant from moscow who for a consideration of five hundred roubles had investigated the management of their property and found that it was costing them a loss of three thousand odd roubles she did not remember the precise sum but it appeared that the german had worked it out to the fraction of a kopeck 
 the landowner smiled at the mention of the profits of farming obviously aware how much gain his neighbor and marshal was likely to be making 
 possibly it does not pay answered sviiazhsky that merely proves that either a bad manager or that sunk my capital for the increase of my rents 
 oh rent levin cried with horror rent there may be in europe where land has been improved by the labor put into it but with us all the land is deteriorating from the labor put into it in other words working it out so no question of rent 
 how no rent a law 
 then outside the law rent explains nothing for us but simply muddles us no tell me how there can be a theory of rent 
 will you have some curded milk masha pass us some curded milk or raspberries he turned to his wife the raspberries are lasting extraordinarily late this year 
 and in the happiest frame of mind sviiazhsky got up and walked off apparently supposing the conversation to have ended at the very point when to levin it seemed that it was only just beginning 
 having lost his antagonist levin continued the conversation with the landowner trying to prove to him that all the difficulty arises from the fact that we find out the peculiarities and habits of our laborer but the landowner like all men who think independently and in isolation was slow in taking in any other thought and particularly partial to his own he stuck to it that the russian peasant is a swine and likes swinishness and that to get him out of his swinishness one must have authority and there is none one must have the stick and we have become so liberal that we have all of a sudden replaced the stick that served us for a thousand years with lawyers and model prisons where the worthless stinking peasant is fed on good soup and has a fixed allowance of cubic feet of air 
 what makes you think said levin trying to get back to the question that impossible to find some relation to the laborer in which the labor would become productive 
 that never could be so with the russian people no authority answered the landowner 
 how can new conditions be found said sviiazhsky having eaten some curded milk and lighted a cigarette he came back to the discussion all possible relations to the labor force have been defined and studied he said the relic of barbarism the primitive commune with a guarantee for all will disappear of itself serfdom has been abolished there remains nothing but free labor and its forms are fixed and ready made and must be adopted permanent hands day laborers farmers you get out of those forms 
 but europe is dissatisfied with these forms 
 dissatisfied and seeking new ones and will find them in all probability 
 just what i meant answered levin why we seek them for ourselves 
 because it would be just like inventing afresh the means for constructing railways they are ready invented 
 but if they suit us if stupid said levin 
 and again he detected the expression of alarm in the eyes of sviiazhsky 
 oh yes bury the world under our caps found the secret europe was seeking for heard all that but excuse me do you know all been done in europe on the question of the organization of labor 
 no very little 
 that question is now absorbing the best minds in europe the movement and then all this enormous literature of the labor question the most liberal lassalle movement the mulhausen experiment a fact by now as probably aware 
 i have some idea of it but very vague 
 no you only say that no doubt you know all about it as well as i do no professor of sociology of course but it interested me and really if it interests you you ought to study it 
 but what conclusion have they come to 
 excuse me 
 the two neighbors had risen and sviiazhsky once more checking levin in his inconvenient habit of peeping into what was beyond the outer chambers of his mind went to see his guests out

 levin was insufferably bored that evening with the ladies he was stirred as he had never been before by the idea that the dissatisfaction he was feeling with his system of managing his land was not an exceptional case but the general condition of things in russia that the evolving of some relation of the laborers to the soil which they would work as with the peasant he had met halfway to the sviiazhskys was not a dream but a problem which must be solved and it seemed to him that the problem could be solved and that he ought to try to solve it 
 after saying good night to the ladies and promising to stay the whole of the next day so as to make an expedition on horseback with them to see an interesting gap in the crown forest levin went before going to bed into his study to get the books on the labor question that sviiazhsky had offered him study was a huge room by bookcases and with two tables in it one a massive writing table standing in the middle of the room and the other a round table covered with recent numbers of reviews and journals in different languages ranged like the rays of a star round a lamp on the writing table was a stand of drawers marked with gold labels and full of papers of various sorts 
 sviiazhsky took out the books and sat down in a rocking chair 
 what are you looking at there he said to levin who was standing at the round table looking through the reviews oh yes a very interesting article here said sviiazhsky pointing to the review levin was holding in his hand it appears he went on with eager interest that friedrich was not after all the person chiefly responsible for the partition of poland it is proved 
 and with his characteristic clearness he summed up those new very important and interesting revelations although levin was engrossed at the moment by his ideas about the problem of the land he wondered as he heard sviiazhsky what is there inside of him and why why is he interested in the partition of poland when sviiazhsky had finished levin could not help asking well and what then but there was nothing to follow it was simply interesting that such and such had been proved but sviiazhsky did not explain and saw no need of explaining why it was interesting to him 
 yes but i was very much interested by your irritable neighbor said levin sighing a clever fellow and said a lot that was true 
 oh get along with you an inveterate supporter of serfdom at heart like all of them said sviiazhsky 
 whose marshal you are 
 yes only i marshal them in the other direction said sviiazhsky laughing 
 tell you what interests me very much said levin right that our system that is to say of rational farming answer that the only thing that answers is the moneylender system like that or else the very simplest whose fault is it 
 our own of course besides not true that it answer it answers with vassilchikov 
 a factory 
 but i really know what it is you are surprised at the people are at such a low stage of material and moral development that obviously bound to oppose everything necessary to them in europe a rational system answers because the people are educated it follows that we must educate the people all 
 but how are we to educate the people 
 to educate the people three things are needed schools and schools and schools 
 but you said yourself the people are at such a low stage of material development what help are schools for that 
 do you know you remind me of the story of the advice given to the sick man you should try purgative medicine taken it worse try leeches tried them worse well then nothing left but to pray to god tried it worse just how it is with us i say political economy you say worse i say socialism worse education worse 
 but how do schools help matters 
 they give the peasant fresh wants 
 well a thing never understood levin replied with heat in what way are schools going to help the people to improve their material position you say schools education will give them fresh wants so much the worse since they be capable of satisfying them and in what way a knowledge of addition and subtraction and the catechism is going to improve their material condition i never could make out the day before yesterday i met a peasant woman in the evening with a little baby and asked her where she was going she said she was going to the wisewoman her boy had screaming fits so she was taking him to be doctored i asked why how does the wisewoman cure screaming fits she puts the child on the hen roost and repeats some charm 
 well saying it yourself wanted to prevent her taking her child to the hen roost to cure it of screaming fits is just sviiazhsky said smiling 
 oh no said levin with annoyance that method of doctoring i merely meant as a simile for doctoring the people with schools the people are poor and ignorant that we see as surely as the peasant woman sees the baby has fits because it screams but in what way this trouble of poverty and ignorance is to be cured by schools is as incomprehensible as how the hen roost affects the screaming what has to be cured is what makes him poor 
 well in that at least in agreement with spencer whom you dislike so much he says too that education may be the consequence of greater prosperity and comfort of more frequent washing as he says but not of being able to read and write 
 well then very glad or the contrary very sorry that in agreement with spencer only known it a long while schools can do no good what will do good is an economic organization in which the people will become richer will have more leisure and then there will be schools 
 still all over europe now schools are obligatory 
 and how far do you agree with spencer yourself about it asked levin 
 but there was a gleam of alarm in eyes and he said smiling 
 no that screaming story is positively capital did you really hear it yourself 
 levin saw that he was not to discover the connection between this life and his thoughts obviously he did not care in the least what his reasoning led him to all he wanted was the process of reasoning and he did not like it when the process of reasoning brought him into a blind alley that was the only thing he disliked and avoided by changing the conversation to something agreeable and amusing 
 all the impressions of the day beginning with the impression made by the old peasant which served as it were as the thorough bass of all the conceptions and ideas of the day threw levin into violent excitement this dear good sviiazhsky keeping a stock of ideas simply for public purposes and obviously having some other principles hidden from levin while with the crowd whose name is legion he guided public opinion by ideas he did not share that irascible country gentleman perfectly correct in the conclusions that he had been worried into by life but wrong in his exasperation against a whole class and that the best class in russia his own dissatisfaction with the work he had been doing and the vague hope of finding a remedy for all this all was blended in a sense of inward turmoil and the anticipation of some solution near at hand 
 left alone in the room assigned him lying on a spring mattress that yielded unexpectedly at every movement of his arm or his leg levin did not fall asleep for a long while not one conversation with sviiazhsky though he had said a great deal that was clever had interested levin but the conclusions of the irascible landowner required consideration levin could not help recalling every word he had said and in imagination amending his own replies 
 yes i ought to have said to him you say that our husbandry does not answer because the peasant hates improvements and that they must be forced on him by authority if no system of husbandry answered at all without these improvements you would be quite right but the only system that does answer is when the laborer is working in accordance with his habits just as on the old land halfway here your and our general dissatisfaction with the system shows that either we are to blame or the laborers we have gone our way the european way a long while without asking ourselves about the qualities of our labor force let us try to look upon the labor force not as an abstract force but as the russian mouzhik with his instincts and let us arrange our system of agriculture in accordance with that imagine i ought to have said to him that you have the same system as the old peasant has that you have found means of making your laborers take an interest in the success of the work and have found the happy mean in the way of improvements which they will admit and you will without exhausting the soil get twice or three times the yield you got before divide it in halves give half as the share of labor the surplus left you will be greater and share will be greater too and to do this one must lower the standard of husbandry and interest the laborers in its success how to do this a matter of detail but undoubtedly it can be done 
 this idea threw levin into a great excitement he did not sleep half the night thinking over in detail the putting of his idea into practice he had not intended to go away next day but he now determined to go home early in the morning besides the with her bodice aroused in him a feeling akin to shame and remorse for some utterly base action most important of all he must get back without delay he would have to make haste to put his new project to the peasants before the sowing of the winter wheat so that the sowing might be undertaken on a new basis he had made up his mind to revolutionize his whole system

 chapter 
 
 the carrying out of plan presented many difficulties but he struggled on doing his utmost and attained a result which though not what he desired was enough to enable him without to believe that the attempt was worth the trouble one of the chief difficulties was that the process of cultivating the land was in full swing that it was impossible to stop everything and begin it all again from the beginning and the machine had to be mended while in motion 
 when on the evening of his arrival home he informed the bailiff of his plans the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he said so long as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time was stupid and useless the bailiff said that he had said so a long while ago but no heed had been paid him but as for the proposal made by levin to take a part as shareholder with his laborers in each agricultural undertaking at this the bailiff simply expressed a profound despondency and offered no definite opinion but began immediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining sheaves of rye the next day and of sending the men out for the second plowing so that levin felt that this was not the time for discussing it 
 on beginning to talk to the peasants about it and making a proposition to cede them the land on new terms he came into collision with the same great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current work of the day that they had not time to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scheme 
 the simplehearted ivan the cowherd seemed to grasp proposal fully that he should with his family take a share of the profits of the cattle yard and he was in complete sympathy with the plan but when levin hinted at the future advantages face expressed alarm and regret that he could not hear all he had to say and he made haste to find himself some task that would admit of no delay he either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pens or ran to get water or to clear out the manure 
 another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasants that a object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze all he could out of them they were firmly convinced that his real aim whatever he might say to them would always be in what he did not say to them and they themselves in giving their opinion said a great deal but never said what was their real object moreover levin felt that the irascible landowner had been right the peasants made their first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatsoever that they should not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind nor to use new implements they agreed that the modern plow plowed better that the scarifier did the work more quickly but they found thousands of reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of them and though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to lower the standard of cultivation he felt sorry to give up improved methods the advantages of which were so obvious but in spite of all these difficulties he got his way and by autumn the system was working or at least so it seemed to him 
 at first levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land just as it was to the peasants the laborers and the bailiff on new conditions of partnership but he was very soon convinced that this was impossible and determined to divide it up the cattle yard the garden hayfields and arable land divided into several parts had to be made into separate lots the simplehearted cowherd ivan who levin fancied understood the matter better than any of them collecting together a gang of workers to help him principally of his own family became a partner in the cattle yard a distant part of the estate a tract of wasteland that had lain fallow for eight years was with the help of the clever carpenter fiodor rezunov taken by six families of peasants on new conditions of partnership and the peasant shuraev took the management of all the vegetable gardens on the same terms the remainder of the land was still worked on the old system but these three items were the first step to a new organization of the whole and they completely engrossed levin 
 it is true that in the cattle yard things went no better than before and ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made of fresh cream affirming that cows require less food if kept cold and that butter is more profitable made from sour cream and he asked for wages just as under the old system and took not the slightest interest in the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out of his future share in the profits 
 it is true that fiodor company did not plow over the ground twice before sowing as had been agreed justifying themselves on the plea that the time was too short it is true that the peasants of the same company though they had agreed to work the land on new conditions always spoke of the land not as held in partnership but as rented for half the crop and more than once the peasants and rezunov himself said to levin if you would take a rent for the land it would save you trouble and we should be more free moreover the same peasants kept putting off on various excuses the building of a cattle yard and threshing barn on the land as agreed upon and delayed doing it till the winter 
 it is true that shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens he had undertaken in small lots to the peasants he evidently quite misunderstood and apparently intentionally misunderstood the conditions upon which the land had been given to him 
 often too talking to the peasants and explaining to them all the advantages of the plan levin felt that the peasants heard nothing but the sound of his voice and were firmly resolved whatever he might say not to let themselves be taken in he felt this especially when he talked to the cleverest of the peasants rezunov and detected that gleam in eyes which showed so plainly both ironical amusement at levin and the firm conviction that if anyone were to be taken in it would not be he rezunov 
 but in spite of all this levin thought the system worked and that by keeping accounts strictly and insisting on his own way he would prove to them in the future the advantages of the arrangement and then the system would go of itself 
 these matters together with the management of the land still left on his hands and the indoor work over his book so engrossed levin the whole summer that he scarcely ever went out shooting at the end of august he heard that the oblonskys had gone away to moscow from their servant who brought back the sidesaddle he felt that in not answering darya letter he had by his rudeness of which he could not think without a flush of shame burned his ships and that he would never go to see them again he had been just as rude with the sviiazhskys leaving them without saying but he would never go to see them again either he did not care about that now the business of reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely as though there would never be anything else in his life he read the books lent him by sviiazhsky and ordering from moscow what he had not had he read both the economic and socialistic books on the subject but as he had anticipated found nothing bearing on the scheme he had undertaken in the books on political economy in mill for instance whom he studied first with great ardor hoping every minute to find an answer to the questions that were engrossing him he found laws deduced from the condition of land culture in europe but he did not see why these laws which did not apply in russia must be general he saw just the same thing in the socialistic books either they were the beautiful but impracticable fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student or they were attempts at improving at rectifying the economic position in which europe was placed with which the system of land tenure in russia had nothing in common political economy told him that the laws by which the wealth of europe had been developed and was developing were universal and unvarying socialism told him that development along these lines leads to ruin and neither of them gave an answer or even a hint in reply to the question as to what he levin and all the russian peasants and landowners were to do with their millions of hands and millions of dessiatinas to make them as productive as possible for the common weal 
 having once taken the subject up he read conscientiously everything bearing on it and intended in the autumn to go abroad to study land systems on the spot in order that he might not on this question be confronted with what so often met him on various subjects often just as he was beginning to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he was talking to and was beginning to explain his own he would suddenly be told but kauffmann but jones but dubois but michelli you read them do read thrashed that question out thoroughly 
 he saw now distinctly that kauffmann and michelli had nothing to tell him he knew what he wanted he saw that russia had splendid land splendid laborers and that in certain cases as at the on the way to the produce raised by the laborers and the land is great in the majority of cases when capital is applied in the european way the produce is small and that this simply arises from the fact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their own peculiar way and that this antagonism is not incidental but invariable and has its roots in the national spirit he thought that the russian people whose task it was to colonize and cultivate vast tracts of unoccupied land consciously adhered till all their land was occupied to the methods suitable to their purpose and that their methods were by no means so bad as was generally supposed and he wanted to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his land

 when on the evening of his arrival home he informed the bailiff of his plans the latter with visible pleasure agreed with what he said so long as he was pointing out that all that had been done up to that time was stupid and useless the bailiff said that he had said so a long while ago but no heed had been paid him but as for the proposal made by levin to take a part as shareholder with his laborers in each agricultural undertaking at this the bailiff simply expressed a profound despondency and offered no definite opinion but began immediately talking of the urgent necessity of carrying the remaining sheaves of rye the next day and of sending the men out for the second plowing so that levin felt that this was not the time for discussing it 
 on beginning to talk to the peasants about it and making a proposition to cede them the land on new terms he came into collision with the same great difficulty that they were so much absorbed by the current work of the day that they had not time to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scheme 
 the simplehearted ivan the cowherd seemed to grasp proposal fully that he should with his family take a share of the profits of the cattle yard and he was in complete sympathy with the plan but when levin hinted at the future advantages face expressed alarm and regret that he could not hear all he had to say and he made haste to find himself some task that would admit of no delay he either snatched up the fork to pitch the hay out of the pens or ran to get water or to clear out the manure 
 another difficulty lay in the invincible disbelief of the peasants that a object could be anything else than a desire to squeeze all he could out of them they were firmly convinced that his real aim whatever he might say to them would always be in what he did not say to them and they themselves in giving their opinion said a great deal but never said what was their real object moreover levin felt that the irascible landowner had been right the peasants made their first and unalterable condition of any agreement whatsoever that they should not be forced to any new methods of tillage of any kind nor to use new implements they agreed that the modern plow plowed better that the scarifier did the work more quickly but they found thousands of reasons that made it out of the question for them to use either of them and though he had accepted the conviction that he would have to lower the standard of cultivation he felt sorry to give up improved methods the advantages of which were so obvious but in spite of all these difficulties he got his way and by autumn the system was working or at least so it seemed to him 
 at first levin had thought of giving up the whole farming of the land just as it was to the peasants the laborers and the bailiff on new conditions of partnership but he was very soon convinced that this was impossible and determined to divide it up the cattle yard the garden hayfields and arable land divided into several parts had to be made into separate lots the simplehearted cowherd ivan who levin fancied understood the matter better than any of them collecting together a gang of workers to help him principally of his own family became a partner in the cattle yard a distant part of the estate a tract of wasteland that had lain fallow for eight years was with the help of the clever carpenter fiodor rezunov taken by six families of peasants on new conditions of partnership and the peasant shuraev took the management of all the vegetable gardens on the same terms the remainder of the land was still worked on the old system but these three items were the first step to a new organization of the whole and they completely engrossed levin 
 it is true that in the cattle yard things went no better than before and ivan strenuously opposed warm housing for the cows and butter made of fresh cream affirming that cows require less food if kept cold and that butter is more profitable made from sour cream and he asked for wages just as under the old system and took not the slightest interest in the fact that the money he received was not wages but an advance out of his future share in the profits 
 it is true that fiodor company did not plow over the ground twice before sowing as had been agreed justifying themselves on the plea that the time was too short it is true that the peasants of the same company though they had agreed to work the land on new conditions always spoke of the land not as held in partnership but as rented for half the crop and more than once the peasants and rezunov himself said to levin if you would take a rent for the land it would save you trouble and we should be more free moreover the same peasants kept putting off on various excuses the building of a cattle yard and threshing barn on the land as agreed upon and delayed doing it till the winter 
 it is true that shuraev would have liked to let out the kitchen gardens he had undertaken in small lots to the peasants he evidently quite misunderstood and apparently intentionally misunderstood the conditions upon which the land had been given to him 
 often too talking to the peasants and explaining to them all the advantages of the plan levin felt that the peasants heard nothing but the sound of his voice and were firmly resolved whatever he might say not to let themselves be taken in he felt this especially when he talked to the cleverest of the peasants rezunov and detected that gleam in eyes which showed so plainly both ironical amusement at levin and the firm conviction that if anyone were to be taken in it would not be he rezunov 
 but in spite of all this levin thought the system worked and that by keeping accounts strictly and insisting on his own way he would prove to them in the future the advantages of the arrangement and then the system would go of itself 
 these matters together with the management of the land still left on his hands and the indoor work over his book so engrossed levin the whole summer that he scarcely ever went out shooting at the end of august he heard that the oblonskys had gone away to moscow from their servant who brought back the sidesaddle he felt that in not answering darya letter he had by his rudeness of which he could not think without a flush of shame burned his ships and that he would never go to see them again he had been just as rude with the sviiazhskys leaving them without saying but he would never go to see them again either he did not care about that now the business of reorganizing the farming of his land absorbed him as completely as though there would never be anything else in his life he read the books lent him by sviiazhsky and ordering from moscow what he had not had he read both the economic and socialistic books on the subject but as he had anticipated found nothing bearing on the scheme he had undertaken in the books on political economy in mill for instance whom he studied first with great ardor hoping every minute to find an answer to the questions that were engrossing him he found laws deduced from the condition of land culture in europe but he did not see why these laws which did not apply in russia must be general he saw just the same thing in the socialistic books either they were the beautiful but impracticable fantasies which had fascinated him when he was a student or they were attempts at improving at rectifying the economic position in which europe was placed with which the system of land tenure in russia had nothing in common political economy told him that the laws by which the wealth of europe had been developed and was developing were universal and unvarying socialism told him that development along these lines leads to ruin and neither of them gave an answer or even a hint in reply to the question as to what he levin and all the russian peasants and landowners were to do with their millions of hands and millions of dessiatinas to make them as productive as possible for the common weal 
 having once taken the subject up he read conscientiously everything bearing on it and intended in the autumn to go abroad to study land systems on the spot in order that he might not on this question be confronted with what so often met him on various subjects often just as he was beginning to understand the idea in the mind of anyone he was talking to and was beginning to explain his own he would suddenly be told but kauffmann but jones but dubois but michelli you read them do read thrashed that question out thoroughly 
 he saw now distinctly that kauffmann and michelli had nothing to tell him he knew what he wanted he saw that russia had splendid land splendid laborers and that in certain cases as at the on the way to the produce raised by the laborers and the land is great in the majority of cases when capital is applied in the european way the produce is small and that this simply arises from the fact that the laborers want to work and work well only in their own peculiar way and that this antagonism is not incidental but invariable and has its roots in the national spirit he thought that the russian people whose task it was to colonize and cultivate vast tracts of unoccupied land consciously adhered till all their land was occupied to the methods suitable to their purpose and that their methods were by no means so bad as was generally supposed and he wanted to prove this theoretically in his book and practically on his land

 at the end of september the timber had been carted for building the cattle yard on the land that had been allotted to the association of peasants and the butter from the cows was sold and the profits divided in practice the system worked capitally or at least so it seemed to levin in order to work out the whole subject theoretically and to complete his book which in daydreams was not merely to effect a revolution in political economy but to annihilate that science entirely and to lay the foundation of a new science of the relation of the people to the soil all that was left to do was to make a tour abroad and to study on the spot all that had been done in the same direction and to collect conclusive evidence that all that had been done there was not what was wanted levin was only waiting for the delivery of his wheat to receive the money for it and go abroad but the rains began preventing the harvesting of the corn and potatoes left in the fields and putting a stop to all work even to the delivery of the wheat the mud was impassable along the roads two mills were carried away by the spate and the weather got worse and worse 
 on the th of september the sun came out in the morning and hoping for fine weather levin began making final preparations for his journey he gave orders for the wheat to be delivered sent the bailiff to the merchant to get the money owing him and went out himself to give some final directions on the estate before setting off 
 having finished all his business soaked through with the streams of water which kept running into his leather coat and down his neck and his boot tops but in the keenest and most confident temper levin turned homeward in the evening the weather had become worse than ever toward evening the hail lashed the drenched mare so cruelly that she went along sideways shaking her head and ears but levin was all right under his hood and he looked cheerfully about him at the muddy streams running under the wheels at the drops hanging on every bare twig at the whiteness of the patch of unmelted hailstones on the planks of the bridge at the thick layer of still succulent fleshy leaves that lay heaped up about the stripped elm tree in spite of the gloominess of nature around him he felt peculiarly eager the talks he had been having with the peasants in the farther village had shown that they were beginning to get used to their new position the innkeeper an old man to whose inn he had gone to get dry evidently approved of plan and of his own accord proposed to enter the partnership for purchasing of cattle 
 i have only to go on stubbornly toward my aim and i shall attain my end thought levin and something to work and take trouble for this is not a matter of myself individually the question of the public welfare comes into it the whole system of agriculture the chief element in the condition of the people must be completely transformed instead of poverty general prosperity and content instead of hostility harmony and unity of interests in short a bloodless revolution but a revolution of the greatest magnitude beginning in the little circle of our district then the province then russia and the whole world because a just idea cannot but be fruitful yes an aim worth working for and the fact that it is i kostia levin who went to a ball in a black tie and was refused by the shcherbatsky girl and who is intrinsically such a pitiful worthless creature to himself that proves nothing i feel sure franklin felt just as worthless and he too had no faith in himself thinking of himself as a whole that means nothing and he too most likely had an agathya mikhailovna to whom he confided his secrets 
 musing on such thoughts levin reached home in the darkness 
 the bailiff who had been to the merchant had come back and brought part of the money for the wheat an agreement had been made with the old innkeeper and on the road the bailiff had learned that everywhere the corn was still standing in the fields so that his one hundred and sixty shocks that had not been carried were nothing in comparison with the losses of others 
 after dinner levin was sitting as he usually did in an easy chair with a book and as he read he went on thinking of the journey before him in connection with his book today all the significance of his book rose before him with special distinctness and whole periods ranged themselves in his mind in illustration of his theories i must write that down he thought that ought to form a brief introduction which i thought unnecessary before he got up to go to his writing table and laska lying at his feet got up too stretching and looking at him as though to inquire where to go but he had not time to write it down for the overseers had come for receiving orders and levin went out into the hall to meet them 
 after giving orders that is to say directions about the labors of the next day and seeing all the peasants who had business with him levin went back to his study and sat down to work laska lay under the table agathya mikhailovna settled herself in her place with her stocking 
 after writing for a little while levin suddenly thought with exceptional vividness of kitty her refusal and their last meeting he got up and began walking about the room 
 the use of being downhearted said agathya mikhailovna come why do you stay on at home you ought to go to some warm springs especially now that ready for the journey 
 well i am going away the day after tomorrow agathya mikhailovna i must finish my work 
 there there your work you say as if you done enough for the peasants why as tis saying your master will be getting some honor from the czar for it indeed tis a strange thing why need you worry about the peasants 
 not worrying about them doing it for my own good 
 agathya mikhailovna knew every detail of plans for his land levin often put his views before her in all their complexity and not uncommonly he argued with her and did not agree with her comments but on this occasion she entirely misinterpreted what he had said 
 of salvation we all know and must think before all else she said with a sigh parfion denissich now for all he was no scholar died a death whose like may god grant to every one of us she said referring to a servant who had died recently took the sacrament and all 
 not what i mean said he i mean that acting for my own advantage all the better for me if the peasants do their work better 
 well whatever you do if a lazy be at sixes and sevens if he has a conscience work and if not no doing anything 
 oh come you say yourself ivan has begun looking after the cattle better 
 all i say is answered agathya mikhailovna evidently not speaking at random but in strict sequence of ideas that you ought to get married what i say 
 agathya allusion to the very subject he had only just been thinking about hurt and stung him levin scowled and without answering her he sat down again to his work repeating to himself all that he had been thinking of the real significance of that work only at intervals he listened in the stillness to the click of agathya needles and recollecting what he did not want to remember he would frown again 
 at nine they heard the bell and the faint vibration of a carriage over the mud 
 well visitors come to us and you be dull said agathya mikhailovna getting up and going to the door but levin overtook her his work was not going well now and he was glad of a visitor whoever it might be

 running halfway down the staircase levin caught a sound he knew a familiar cough in the hall but he heard it indistinctly through the sound of his own footsteps and hoped he was mistaken then he caught sight of a long bony familiar figure and now it seemed there was no possibility of mistake and yet he still went on hoping that this tall man taking off his fur cloak and coughing was not his brother nikolai 
 levin loved his brother but being with him was always a torture just now when levin under the influence of the thoughts that had come to him and agathya hint was in a troubled and uncertain humor this meeting with his brother which he had to face seemed particularly difficult instead of a lively healthy visitor some outsider who would he hoped cheer him up in his uncertain humor he had to see his brother who knew him through and through who would call forth all the thoughts nearest his heart would force him to show himself fully and that he was not disposed to do 
 angry with himself for so base a feeling levin ran into the hall as soon as he had seen his brother close this feeling of selfish disappointment vanished instantly and was replaced by pity terrible as his brother nikolai had been before in his emaciation and sickliness now he looked still more emaciated still more wasted he was a skeleton covered by skin 
 he stood in the hall jerking his long thin neck and pulling the scarf off it and smiled a strange and pitiful smile when he saw that smile submissive and humble levin felt something clutching at his throat 
 you see come to you said nikolai in a thick voice never for one second taking his eyes off his face been meaning to a long while but been constantly unwell now ever so much better he said rubbing his beard with his big thin hands 
 yes yes answered levin and he felt still more frightened when kissing him he felt with his lips the dryness of his skin and saw close to him his big eyes full of a strange light 
 a few weeks before konstantin levin had written to his brother that through the sale of the small part of the property that had remained undivided there was a sum of about two thousand roubles to come to him as his share 
 nikolai said that he had come now to take his money and what was more important to stay a while in the old nest to get in touch with the earth so as to renew his strength like the heroes of old for the work that lay before him in spite of his exaggerated stoop and the emaciation that was so striking from his height his movements were as rapid and abrupt as ever levin led him into his study 
 his brother dressed with particular care a thing he never used to do combed his scanty lank hair and smiling went upstairs 
 he was in the most affectionate and mood just as levin often remembered him in childhood he even referred to sergei ivanovich without rancor when he saw agathya mikhailovna he joked with her and asked after the old servants the news of the death of parfion denissich made a painful impression on him a look of fear crossed his face but he regained his serenity immediately 
 of course he was quite old he said and changed the subject well spend a month or two with you and then off to moscow do you know miaghkov has promised me a place there and going into the service now going to arrange my life quite differently he went on you know i got rid of that woman 
 marya nikolaevna why what for 
 oh she was a horrid woman she caused me all sorts of annoyances but he did not say what the annoyances were he could not say that he had driven off marya nikolaevna because the tea was weak and above all because she would look after him as though he were an invalid besides i want to turn over a new leaf completely now done silly things of course like everyone else but the last consideration i regret it so long as health and my health thank god is quite restored 
 levin listened and racked his brains but could think of nothing to say nikolai probably felt the same he began questioning his brother about his affairs and levin was glad to talk about himself because then he could speak without hypocrisy he told his brother of his plans and his doings 
 his brother listened but evidently he was not interested 
 these two men were so akin so near each other that the slightest gesture the tone of voice told both more than could be said in words 
 both of them now had only one thought the illness of nikolai and the nearness of his death which stifled all else but neither of them dared speak of it and so whatever they said without uttering the one thought that filled their minds was all falsehood never had levin been so glad when the evening was over and it was time to go to bed never with any outside person never on any official visit had he been so unnatural and false as he was that evening and the consciousness of this unnaturalness and the remorse he felt at it made him even more unnatural he wanted to weep over his dying dearly loved brother and he had to listen and keep on talking of how he meant to live 
 as the house was damp and only the one bedroom had been kept heated levin put his brother to sleep in his own bedroom behind a partition 
 his brother got into bed and whether he slept or did not sleep tossed about like a sick man coughed and when he could not get his throat clear mumbled something sometimes when his breathing was painful he said oh my god sometimes when he was choking he muttered angrily ah the devil levin could not sleep for a long while hearing him his thoughts were of the most various kinds but the end of all his thoughts was the same death 
 death the inevitable end of all for the first time presented itself to him with irresistible force and death which was here in this loved brother groaning and from habit calling without distinction on god and the devil was not so remote as it had hitherto seemed to him it was in himself too that he felt this if not today tomorrow if not tomorrow in thirty years it all the same and what was this inevitable death he did not know had never thought about it and what was more had not the power had not the courage to think about it 
 i work i want to do something but i had forgotten it must all end i had forgotten death 
 he sat on his bed in the darkness crouched up hugging his knees and holding his breath from the strain of thought he pondered but the more intensely he thought the clearer it became to him that it was indubitably so that in reality looking upon life he had forgotten one little fact that death will come and all ends that nothing was even worth beginning and that there was no helping it anyway yes it was awful but it was so 
 but i am alive still to be done now to be done he asked in despair he lighted a candle got up cautiously went to the looking glass and began looking at his face and hair yes there were gray hairs about his temples he opened his mouth his back teeth were beginning to decay he bared his muscular arms yes there was strength in them but nikolenka who lay there breathing with what was left of his lungs had had a strong healthy body too and suddenly he recalled how they used to go to bed together as children and how they only waited till fiodor bogdanich was out of the room to fling pillows at each other and laugh laugh irrepressibly so that even their awe of fiodor bogdanich could not check the effervescing overbrimming sense of life and happiness and now that warped hollow chest and i not knowing what will become of me or wherefore 
 damnation why do you keep fidgeting why you go to sleep his voice called to him 
 oh i know not sleepy 
 i have had a good sleep not in a sweat now just see feel my shirt no sweat is there 
 levin felt it withdrew behind the partition and put out the candle but for a long while he could not sleep the question how to live had hardly begun to grow a little clearer to him when a new insolvable question presented itself death 
 why dying yes die in the spring and how is one to help him what can i say to him what do i know about it even forgotten the very fact of it

 death the inevitable end of all for the first time presented itself to him with irresistible force and death which was here in this loved brother groaning and from habit calling without distinction on god and the devil was not so remote as it had hitherto seemed to him it was in himself too that he felt this if not today tomorrow if not tomorrow in thirty years it all the same and what was this inevitable death he did not know had never thought about it and what was more had not the power had not the courage to think about it 
 i work i want to do something but i had forgotten it must all end i had forgotten death 
 he sat on his bed in the darkness crouched up hugging his knees and holding his breath from the strain of thought he pondered but the more intensely he thought the clearer it became to him that it was indubitably so that in reality looking upon life he had forgotten one little fact that death will come and all ends that nothing was even worth beginning and that there was no helping it anyway yes it was awful but it was so 
 but i am alive still to be done now to be done he asked in despair he lighted a candle got up cautiously went to the looking glass and began looking at his face and hair yes there were gray hairs about his temples he opened his mouth his back teeth were beginning to decay he bared his muscular arms yes there was strength in them but nikolenka who lay there breathing with what was left of his lungs had had a strong healthy body too and suddenly he recalled how they used to go to bed together as children and how they only waited till fiodor bogdanich was out of the room to fling pillows at each other and laugh laugh irrepressibly so that even their awe of fiodor bogdanich could not check the effervescing overbrimming sense of life and happiness and now that warped hollow chest and i not knowing what will become of me or wherefore 
 damnation why do you keep fidgeting why you go to sleep his voice called to him 
 oh i know not sleepy 
 i have had a good sleep not in a sweat now just see feel my shirt no sweat is there 
 levin felt it withdrew behind the partition and put out the candle but for a long while he could not sleep the question how to live had hardly begun to grow a little clearer to him when a new insolvable question presented itself death 
 why dying yes die in the spring and how is one to help him what can i say to him what do i know about it even forgotten the very fact of it

 levin had long before made the observation that when one is uncomfortable with people from their being excessively amenable and meek one is apt very soon after to find things intolerable from their pretensions and irritability he felt that this was how it would be with his brother and his brother gentleness did not in fact last out for long the very next morning he began to be irritable and seemed doing his best to find fault with his brother attacking him on his tenderest points 
 levin felt himself to blame and could not set things right he felt that if they had both not kept up appearances but had spoken as it is called from the heart that is to say had said only just what they were thinking and feeling they would simply have looked into each faces and konstantin could only have said dying dying and nikolai could only have answered i know dying but afraid afraid afraid and they could have said nothing more if they had said only what was in their hearts but life like that was impossible and so konstantin tried to do what he had been trying to do all his life and never could learn to do though as far as he could observe many people knew so well how to do it and without it there was no living at all he tried to say what he was not thinking but he felt continually that it had a ring of falsehood that his brother detected him in it and was exasperated at it 
 the third day nikolai induced his brother to explain his plan to him again and began not merely attacking it but intentionally confounding it with communism 
 simply borrowed an idea not your own but distorted it and are trying to apply it where not applicable 
 but i tell you nothing in common they deny the justice of property of capital of inheritance while i do not deny this chief stimulus levin felt disgusted himself at using such expressions but ever since he had been engrossed by his work he had unconsciously come more and more frequently to use words all i want is to regulate labor 
 which means borrowed an idea stripped it of all that gave it its force and want to make believe that something new said nikolai angrily tugging at his necktie 
 but my idea has nothing in common 
 the other at any rate said nikolai levin with an ironical smile his eyes flashing malignantly has the charm of one to call it geometrical symmetry of clearness of definiteness it may be a utopia if one once allows the possibility of making all the past a tabula rasa no property no family then labor would organize itself but you have nothing 
 why do you mix things up never been a communist 
 but i have and i consider premature but rational and it has a future just like christianity in its first ages 
 all that i maintain is that the labor force ought to be investigated from the point of view of natural science that is to say it ought to be studied its qualities ascertained 
 but an utter waste of time that force finds a certain form of activity of itself according to the stage of its development there have been slaves first everywhere then metayers and we have the metayage system rent and day laborers what are you trying to find 
 levin suddenly lost his temper at these words because at the bottom of his heart he was afraid that it was true true that he was trying to hold the balance even between communism and the familiar forms and that this was hardly possible 
 i am trying to find means of working productively for myself and for the laborers i want to organize he answered hotly 
 you want to organize anything simply the same as been all your life you want to be original to pose as not simply exploiting the peasants but with some idea in view 
 oh all right what you think and let me alone answered levin feeling the muscles of his left cheek twitching uncontrollably 
 never had and never have convictions all you want is to please your vanity 
 oh very well let me alone then 
 and i will let you alone and high time i did and go to the devil with you and very sorry i ever came 
 in spite of all efforts to soothe his brother afterward nikolai would listen to nothing he said declaring that it was better to part and konstantin saw that it was simply a case of life being unbearable to him 
 nikolai was just getting ready to go when konstantin went in to him again and begged him rather unnaturally to forgive him if he had hurt his feelings in any way 
 ah generosity said nikolai and he smiled if you want to be right i can give you that satisfaction in the right but going all the same 
 it was only just at parting that nikolai kissed him and said looking with sudden strangeness and seriousness at his brother 
 anyway remember evil against me kostia and his voice quavered 
 these were the only words that had been spoken sincerely between them levin knew that those words meant you see and you know that in a bad way and maybe we shall never see each other again levin knew this and the tears gushed from his eyes he kissed his brother once more but he could not speak and knew not what to say 
 two days after his departure levin too set off for his foreign tour happening to meet shcherbatsky cousin in the railway train levin greatly astonished him by his depression 
 the matter with you shcherbatsky asked him 
 oh nothing not much happiness in life 
 not much you come with me to paris instead of to mulhouse you shall see how to be happy 
 no done with it all time i was dead 
 well a good one said shcherbatsky laughing why only just getting ready to begin 
 yes i thought the same not long ago but now i know i shall soon be dead 
 levin said what he had genuinely been thinking of late he saw nothing but death or an approach to death in everything but his cherished scheme only engrossed him the more life had to be got through somehow till death did come darkness had fallen upon everything for him but just because of this darkness he felt that the one guiding clue in the darkness was his work and he clutched it and clung to it with all his strength

 book rue de arme 
 chapter ii 
 
 the street urchin an enemy of light 
 how long did he remain thus 
 what was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation 
 did he straighten up 
 did he remain bowed had he been bent to breaking 
 could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid 
 he probably would not have been able to tell himself 
 the street was deserted 
 a few uneasy bourgeois who were rapidly returning home hardly saw him 
 each one for himself in times of peril 
 the came as usual to light the lantern which was situated precisely opposite the door of no and then went away 
 jean valjean would not have appeared like a living man to any one who had examined him in that shadow he sat there on the post of his door motionless as a form of ice there is congealment in despair 
 the alarm bells and a vague and stormy uproar were audible 
 in the midst of all these convulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt the clock of struck eleven gravely and without haste for the tocsin is man the hour is god 
 the passage of the hour produced no effect on jean valjean jean valjean did not stir 
 still at about that moment a brusque report burst forth in the direction of the halles a second yet more violent followed it was probably that attack on the barricade in the rue de la chanvrerie which we have just seen repulsed by marius 
 at this double discharge whose fury seemed augmented by the stupor of the night jean valjean started he rose turning towards the quarter whence the noise proceeded then he fell back upon the post again folded his arms and his head slowly sank on his bosom again 
 he resumed his gloomy dialogue with himself 
 all at once he raised his eyes some one was walking in the street he heard steps near him 
 he looked and by the light of the lanterns in the direction of the street which ran into the he perceived a young livid and beaming face 
 gavroche had just arrived in the rue arme 
 gavroche was staring into the air apparently in search of something he saw jean valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him 
 gavroche after staring into the air stared below he raised himself on tiptoe and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor they were all shut bolted and padlocked 
 after having authenticated the fronts of five or six barricaded houses in this manner the urchin shrugged his shoulders and took himself to task in these terms 
 pardi 
 then he began to stare into the air again 
 jean valjean who an instant previously in his then state of mind would not have spoken to or even answered any one felt irresistibly impelled to accost that child 
 what is the matter with you my little fellow he said 
 the matter with me is that i am hungry replied gavroche frankly and he added 
 little fellow yourself 
 jean valjean fumbled in his fob and pulled out a piece 
 but gavroche who was of the wagtail species and who skipped vivaciously from one gesture to another had just picked up a stone he had caught sight of the lantern 
 see here said he you still have your lanterns here you are disobeying the regulations my friend 
 this is disorderly smash that for me 
 and he flung the stone at the lantern whose broken glass fell with such a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains in the opposite house cried 
 there is come again 
 the lantern oscillated violently and went out 
 the street had suddenly become black 
 right old street ejaculated gavroche put on your 
 and turning to jean valjean 
 what do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end of the street 
 the archives it 
 i must crumble up those big stupids of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them 
 jean valjean stepped up to gavroche 
 poor creature he said in a low tone and speaking to himself he is hungry 
 and he laid the piece in his hand 
 gavroche raised his face astonished at the size of this sou he stared at it in the darkness and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him 
 he knew pieces by hearsay their reputation was agreeable to him he was delighted to see one close to he said 
 let us contemplate the tiger 
 he gazed at it for several minutes in ecstasy then turning to jean valjean he held out the coin to him and said majestically to him 
 bourgeois i prefer to smash lanterns 
 take back your ferocious beast you bribe me 
 that has got five claws but it scratch me 
 have you a mother asked jean valjean 
 gavroche replied 
 more than you have perhaps 
 well returned jean valjean keep the money for your mother 
 gavroche was touched 
 moreover he had just noticed that the man who was addressing him had no hat and this inspired him with confidence 
 truly said he so it to keep me from breaking the lanterns 
 break whatever you please 
 a fine man said gavroche 
 and he put the piece into one of his pockets 
 his confidence having increased he added 
 do you belong in this street 
 yes why 
 can you tell me where no is 
 what do you want with no 
 here the child paused he feared that he had said too much he thrust his nails energetically into his hair and contented himself with replying 
 ah 
 here it is 
 an idea flashed through jean mind 
 anguish does have these gleams 
 he said to the lad 
 are you the person who is bringing a letter that i am expecting 
 you said gavroche 
 you are not a woman 
 the letter is for mademoiselle cosette is it not 
 cosette muttered gavroche 
 yes i believe that is the queer name 
 well resumed jean valjean i am the person to whom you are to deliver the letter 
 give it here 
 in that case you must know that i was sent from the barricade 
 of course said jean valjean 
 gavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a paper folded in four 
 then he made the military salute 
 respect for despatches said he 
 it comes from the provisional government 
 give it to me said jean valjean 
 gavroche held the paper elevated above his head 
 go and fancy a love letter 
 it is for a woman but for the people 
 we men fight and we respect the fair sex we are not as they are in fine society where there are lions who send chickens to camels 
 love letters 
 give it to me 
 after all continued gavroche you have the air of an honest man 
 give it to me quick 
 catch hold of it 
 and he handed the paper to jean valjean 
 and make haste monsieur for mamselle cosette is waiting 
 gavroche was satisfied with himself for having produced this remark 
 jean valjean began again 
 is it to that the answer is to be sent 
 there you are making some of those bits of pastry vulgarly called brioches blunders this letter comes from the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie and going back there 
 good evening citizen 
 that said gavroche took himself off or to describe it more exactly fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like that of an escaped bird 
 he plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it with the rigid rapidity of a projectile the alley of arme became silent and solitary once more in a twinkling that strange child who had about him something of the shadow and of the dream had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses and was lost there like smoke in the dark and one might have thought that he had dissipated and vanished had there not taken place a few minutes after his disappearance a startling shiver of glass and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois 
 it was gavroche upon his way through the rue du chaume

 book fourteen 
 chapter ii 
 
 one of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed together in a mass such action always occurs in wars that take on a national character in such actions instead of two crowds opposing each other the men disperse attack singly run away when attacked by stronger forces but again attack when opportunity offers this was done by the guerrillas in spain by the mountain tribes in the caucasus and by the russians in 
 people have called this kind of war guerrilla warfare and assume that by so calling it they have explained its meaning but such a war does not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a rule of tactics which is accepted as infallible that rule says that an attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict 
 guerrilla war always successful as history shows directly infringes that rule 
 this contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers military science says that the more troops the greater the strength les gros bataillons ont toujours raison 
 large battalions are always victorious 
 for military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics by reference to the mass only stating that momenta are equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal 
 momentum quantity of motion is the product of mass and velocity 
 in military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass and some unknown x 
 military science seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones obscurely admits the existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover it now in a geometric formation now in the equipment employed now and most usually in the genius of the commanders but the assignment of these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic facts 
 yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to gratify the heroes of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by commanders in order to find this unknown quantity 
 that unknown quantity is the spirit of the army that is to say the greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men composing an army quite independently of whether they are or are not fighting under the command of a genius in two or formation with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous conditions for fighting 
 the spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives the resulting force to define and express the significance of this unknown factor the spirit of an army is a problem for science 
 this problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes apparent such as the commands of the general the equipment employed and so on mistaking these for the real significance of the factor and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger only then expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor can we hope to define the unknown 
 ten men battalions or divisions fighting fifteen men battalions or divisions conquer that is kill or take captive all the others while themselves losing four so that on the one side four and on the other fifteen were lost consequently the four were equal to the fifteen and therefore x y consequently this equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two unknowns and by bringing variously selected historic units battles campaigns periods of war into such equations a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered 
 the tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking and in smaller groups in retreat unconsciously confirms the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit to lead men forward under fire more discipline obtainable only by movement in masses is needed than is needed to resist attacks but this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of the troops occurs as in all national wars 
 the french retreating in though according to tactics they should have separated into detachments to defend themselves congregated into a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass held the army together the russians on the contrary ought according to tactics to have attacked in mass but in fact they split up into small units because their spirit had so risen that separate individuals without orders dealt blows at the french without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers

 while cosette and toussaint are asleep 
 jean valjean went into the house with marius letter 
 he groped his way up the stairs as pleased with the darkness as an owl who grips his prey opened and shut his door softly listened to see whether he could hear any sure that to all appearances cosette and toussaint were asleep and plunged three or four matches into the bottle of the fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark so greatly did his hand tremble what he had just done smacked of theft 
 at last the candle was lighted he leaned his elbows on the table unfolded the paper and read 
 in violent emotions one does not read one flings to the earth so to speak the paper which one holds one clutches it like a victim one crushes it one digs into it the nails of wrath or of joy one hastens to the end one leaps to the beginning attention is at fever heat it takes up in the gross as it were the essential points it seizes on one point and the rest disappears in marius note to cosette jean valjean saw only these words 
 i die 
 when thou readest this my soul will be near thee 
 in the presence of these two lines he was horribly dazzled he remained for a moment crushed as it were by the change of emotion which was taking place within him he stared at marius note with a sort of intoxicated amazement he had before his eyes that splendor the death of a hated individual 
 he uttered a frightful cry of inward joy 
 so it was all over the catastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope the being who obstructed his destiny was disappearing 
 that man had taken himself off of his own accord freely willingly 
 this man was going to his death and he jean valjean had had no hand in the matter and it was through no fault of his 
 perhaps even he is already dead 
 here his fever entered into calculations no he is not dead yet 
 the letter had evidently been intended for cosette to read on the following morning after the two discharges that were heard between eleven and midnight nothing more has taken place the barricade will not be attacked seriously until daybreak but that makes no difference from the moment when that man is concerned in this war he is lost he is caught in the gearing 
 jean valjean felt himself delivered so he was about to find himself alone with cosette once more the rivalry would cease the future was beginning again 
 he had but to keep this note in his pocket 
 cosette would never know what had become of that man 
 all that there requires to be done is to let things take their own course 
 this man cannot escape if he is not already dead it is certain that he is about to die what good fortune 
 having said all this to himself he became gloomy 
 then he went down stairs and woke up the porter 
 about an hour later jean valjean went out in the complete costume of a national guard and with his arms 
 the porter had easily found in the neighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment he had a loaded gun and a filled with cartridges 
 he strode off in the direction of the markets

 chapter iii 
 
 the partisan war began with the entry of the french into smolensk 
 before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the government thousands of enemy stragglers marauders and foragers had been destroyed by the cossacks and the peasants who killed them off as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death denis davydov with his russian instinct was the first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science destroyed the french and to him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare 
 on august first partisan detachment was formed and then others were recognized the further the campaign progressed the more numerous these detachments became 
 the irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal they gathered the fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree the french army and sometimes shook that tree itself by october when the french were fleeing toward smolensk there were hundreds of such companies of various sizes and characters there were some that adopted all the army methods and had infantry artillery staffs and the comforts of life others consisted solely of cossack cavalry there were also small scratch groups of foot and horse and groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown a sacristan commanded one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month and there was vasilisa the wife of a village elder who slew hundreds of the french 
 the partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of october its first period had passed when the partisans themselves amazed at their own boldness feared every minute to be surrounded and captured by the french and hid in the forests without unsaddling hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued by the end of october this kind of warfare had taken definite shape it had become clear to all what could be ventured against the french and what could not now only the commanders of detachments with staffs and moving according to rules at a distance from the french still regarded many things as impossible the small bands that had started their activities long before and had already observed the french closely considered things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare to contemplate the cossacks and peasants who crept in among the french now considered everything possible 
 on october denisov who was one of the irregulars was with his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm since early morning he and his party had been on the move all day long he had been watching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large french convoy of cavalry baggage and russian prisoners separated from the rest of the army which as was learned from spies and prisoners was moving under a strong escort to smolensk besides denisov and dolokhov who also led a small party and moved in vicinity the commanders of some large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and as denisov expressed it were sharpening their teeth for it two of the commanders of large parties one a pole and the other a german sent invitations to denisov almost simultaneously requesting him to join up with their divisions to attack the convoy 
 no bwother i have gwown mustaches myself said denisov on reading these documents and he wrote to the german that despite his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command of the polish general to the polish general he replied to the same effect informing him that he was already under the command of the german 
 having arranged matters thus denisov and dolokhov intended without reporting matters to the higher command to attack and seize that convoy with their own small forces on october it was moving from the village of mikulino to that of shamshevo to the left of the road between mikulino and shamshevo there were large forests extending in some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back from it through these forests denisov and his party rode all day sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very edge but never losing sight of the moving french that morning cossacks of party had seized and carried off into the forest two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles which had stuck in the mud not far from mikulino where the forest ran close to the road since then and until evening the party had the movements of the french without attacking it was necessary to let the french reach shamshevo quietly without alarming them and then after joining dolokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a hut in the forest less than a mile from shamshevo to surprise the french at dawn falling like an avalanche on their heads from two sides and rout and capture them all at one blow 
 in their rear more than a mile from mikulino where the forest came right up to the road six cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of french should show themselves 
 beyond shamshevo dolokhov was to observe the road in the same way to find out at what distance there were other french troops they reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men denisov had two hundred and dolokhov might have as many more but the disparity of numbers did not deter denisov all that he now wanted to know was what troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a tongue that is a man from the enemy column that attack on the wagons had been made so hastily that the frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed only a little drummer boy had been taken alive and as he was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column 
 denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of putting the whole column on the alert so he sent tikhon shcherbaty a peasant of his party to shamshevo to try and seize at least one of the french quartermasters who had been sent on in advance

 excess of zeal 
 in the meantime gavroche had had an adventure 
 gavroche after having conscientiously stoned the lantern in the rue du chaume entered the rue des and not seeing even a cat there he thought the opportunity a good one to strike up all the song of which he was capable 
 his march far from being retarded by his singing was accelerated by it 
 he began to sow along the sleeping or terrified houses these incendiary couplets 
 
 medit dans les charmilles 
 et pretend atala 
 avec un russe alla 
 ou vont les belles filles

 mon ami pierrot tu babilles 
 parce que jour mila 
 cogna sa vitre et

 in former days when i saw the mantillas of suzette and of zeila my soul mingled with their folds

 one fine day my heart flew forth i think that it is jeanne who has it 
 at night when i come from the quadrilles i show stella to the stars and i say to them behold her 
 where fair maids go lon la 
 gavroche as he sang was lavish of his pantomime 
 gesture is the strong point of the refrain 
 his face an inexhaustible repertory of masks produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a cloth torn in a high gale 
 unfortunately as he was alone and as it was night this was neither seen nor even visible such wastes of riches do occur 
 all at once he stopped short 
 let us interrupt the romance said he 
 his feline eye had just descried in the recess of a carriage door what is called in painting an ensemble that is to say a person and a thing the thing was a the person was a man from auvergene who was sleeping therein 
 the shafts of the cart rested on the pavement and the head was supported against the front of the cart 
 his body was coiled up on this inclined plane and his feet touched the ground 
 gavroche with his experience of the things of this world recognized a drunken man 
 he was some corner who had drunk too much and was sleeping too much 
 there now thought gavroche what the summer nights are good for 
 take the cart for the republic and leave the auvergnat for the monarchy 
 his mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light 
 how bully that cart would look on our barricade 
 the auvergnat was snoring 
 gavroche gently tugged at the cart from behind and at the auvergnat from the front that is to say by the feet and at the expiration of another minute the imperturbable auvergnat was reposing flat on the pavement 
 the cart was free 
 gavroche habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters had everything about him 
 he fumbled in one of his pockets and pulled from it a scrap of paper and a bit of red pencil filched from some carpenter 
 he wrote 
 french republic 
 received thy cart 
 and he signed it 
 gavroche 
 that done he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring velvet vest seized the cart shafts in both hands and set off in the direction of the halles pushing the cart before him at a hard gallop with a glorious and triumphant uproar 
 this was perilous 
 there was a post at the royal printing establishment gavroche did not think of this 
 this post was occupied by the national guards of the suburbs 
 the squad began to wake up and heads were raised from camp beds 
 two street lanterns broken in succession that ditty sung at the top of the lungs this was a great deal for those cowardly streets which desire to go to sleep at sunset and which put the extinguisher on their candles at such an early hour 
 for the last hour that boy had been creating an uproar in that peaceable arrondissement the uproar of a fly in a bottle 
 the sergeant of the banlieue lent an ear he waited 
 he was a prudent man 
 the mad rattle of the cart filled to overflowing the possible measure of waiting and decided the sergeant to make a reconnaisance 
 a whole band of them there said he let us proceed gently 
 it was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its box and that it was stalking abroad through the quarter 
 and the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread 
 all at once gavroche pushing his cart in front of him and at the very moment when he was about to turn into the rue des found himself face to face with a uniform a shako a plume and a gun 
 for the second time he stopped short 
 hullo said he him 
 good day public order 
 amazement was always brief and speedily thawed 
 where are you going you rascal shouted the sergeant 
 citizen retorted gavroche i called you bourgeois yet why do you insult me 
 where are you going you rogue 
 monsieur retorted gavroche perhaps you were a man of wit yesterday but you have degenerated this morning 
 i ask you where are you going you villain 
 gavroche replied 
 you speak prettily 
 really no one would suppose you as old as you are 
 you ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece that would yield you five hundred francs 
 where are you going 
 where are you going 
 where are you going bandit 
 gavroche retorted again 
 what villainous words 
 you must wipe your mouth better the first time that they give you suck 
 the sergeant lowered his bayonet 
 will you tell me where you are going you wretch 
 general said gavroche on my way to look for a doctor for my wife who is in labor 
 to arms shouted the sergeant 
 the of strong men consists in saving themselves by the very means that have ruined them gavroche took in the whole situation at a glance 
 it was the cart which had told against him it was the place to protect him 
 at the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent on gavroche the cart converted into a projectile and launched with all the might rolled down upon him furiously and the sergeant struck full in the stomach tumbled over backwards into the gutter while his gun went off in the air 
 the men of the post had rushed out at the shout the shot brought on a general random discharge after which they reloaded their weapons and began again 
 this musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour and killed several panes of glass 
 in the meanwhile gavroche who had retraced his steps at full speed halted five or six streets distant and seated himself panting on the stone post which forms the corner of the 
 he listened 
 after panting for a few minutes he turned in the direction where the fusillade was raging lifted his left hand to a level with his nose and thrust it forward three times as he slapped the back of his head with his right hand an imperious gesture in which parisian has condensed french irony and which is evidently efficacious since it has already lasted half a century 
 this gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection 
 yes said he splitting with laughter twisting with delight i abound in joy but losing my way i shall have to take a roundabout way 
 if i only reach the barricade in season 
 thereupon he set out again on a run 
 and as he ran 
 ah by the way where was i said he 
 and he resumed his ditty as he plunged rapidly through the streets and this is what died away in the gloom 
 
 mais il reste encore des bastilles 
 et je vais mettre le hola 
 dans public que voila 
 ou vont les belles filles 
 lon la 
 
 jouer aux quilles 
 tout monde 
 quand la grosse boule roula 
 ou vont les belles filles 
 lon la 
 
 vieux bon peuple a coups de bequilles 
 cassons ce louvre ou 
 la monarchie en falbala 
 ou vont les belles filles 
 lon la 
 
 nous en avons force les grilles 
 le roi ce jour la 
 tenait mal et se decolla 
 ou vont les belles filles 
 lon la 
 but some prisons still remain and i am going to put a stop to this sort of public order 
 does any one wish to play at skittles the whole ancient world fell in ruin when the big ball rolled good old folks let us smash with our crutches that louvre where the monarchy displayed itself in furbelows 
 we have forced its gates on that day king charles x did not stick well and came unglued 
 the recourse to arms was not without result 
 the cart was conquered the drunken man was taken prisoner 
 the first was put in the pound the second was later on somewhat harassed before the councils of war as an accomplice 
 the public ministry of the day proved its indefatigable zeal in the defence of society in this instance 
 adventure which has lingered as a tradition in the quarters of the temple is one of the most terrible souvenirs of the elderly bourgeois of the marais and is entitled in their memories the nocturnal attack by the post of the royal printing establishment

 book fourteen 
 chapter iv 
 
 it was a warm rainy autumn day the sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water at times a sort of mist descended and then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down 
 denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides like his horse which turned its head and laid its ears back he shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him his thin face with its short thick black beard looked angry 
 beside denisov rode an esaul fellow worker also in felt cloak and sheepskin cap and riding a large sleek don horse 
 a captain of cossacks 
 esaul lovayski the third was a tall man as straight as an arrow with narrow light eyes and with calm in his face and bearing though it was impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay yet at first glance at the esaul and denisov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse while looking at the esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse but a man who was one with his horse a being consequently possessed of twofold strength 
 a little ahead of them walked a peasant guide wet to the skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap 
 a little behind on a poor small lean kirghiz mount with an enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth rode a young officer in a blue french overcoat 
 beside him rode an hussar with a boy in a tattered french uniform and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse the boy held on to the hussar with cold red hands and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise this was the french drummer boy captured that morning 
 behind them along the narrow sodden cutup forest road came hussars in threes and fours and then cossacks some in felt cloaks some in french greatcoats and some with horsecloths over their heads the horses being drenched by the rain all looked black whether chestnut or bay their necks with their wet manes looked strangely thin steam rose from them clothes saddles reins were all wet slippery and sodden like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed the road the men sat huddled up trying not to stir so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold water that was leaking in under their seats their knees and at the back of their necks in the midst of the outspread line of cossacks two wagons drawn by french horses and by saddled cossack horses that had been hitched on in front rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the water that lay in the ruts 
 horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped his knee against a tree 
 oh the devil exclaimed denisov angrily and showing his teeth he struck his horse three times with his whip splashing himself and his comrades with mud 
 denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger none of them had eaten anything since morning and yet more because he still had no news from dolokhov and the man sent to capture a tongue had not returned 
 hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today too risky to attack them by oneself and if we put it off till another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey from under our noses thought denisov continually peering forward hoping to see a messenger from dolokhov 
 on coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the right denisov stopped 
 someone coming said he 
 the esaul looked in the direction denisov indicated 
 there are two an officer and a cossack but it is not presupposable that it is the lieutenant colonel himself said the esaul who was fond of using words the cossacks did not know 
 the approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer visible but they reappeared a few minutes later in front at a weary gallop and using his leather whip rode an officer disheveled and drenched whose trousers had worked up to above his knees behind him standing in the stirrups trotted a cossack the officer a very young lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes galloped up to denisov and handed him a sodden envelope 
 from the general said the officer please excuse its not being quite dry 
 denisov frowning took the envelope and opened it 
 there they kept telling us dangerous dangerous said the officer addressing the esaul while denisov was reading the dispatch but komarov and i he pointed to the cossack were prepared we have each of us two pistols but this he asked noticing the french drummer boy a prisoner already been in action may i speak to him 
 wostov petya exclaimed denisov having run through the dispatch why you say who you were and turning with a smile he held out his hand to the lad 
 the officer was petya rostov 
 all the way petya had been preparing himself to behave with denisov as befitted a grownup man and an officer without hinting at their previous acquaintance but as soon as denisov smiled at him petya brightened up blushed with pleasure forgot the official manner he had been rehearsing and began telling him how he had already been in a battle near vyazma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there 
 well i am glad to see you denisov interrupted him and his face again assumed its anxious expression 
 michael feoklitych said he to the esaul this is again fwom that german you know he he indicated petya is serving under him 
 and denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a repetition of the german demand that he should join forces with him for an attack on the transport 
 if we take it tomowwow snatch it fwom under our noses he added 
 while denisov was talking to the esaul petya abashed by cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his trousers furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so that no one should notice it while maintaining as martial an air as possible 
 will there be any orders your honor he asked denisov holding his hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for which he had prepared himself or shall i remain with your honor 
 orders denisov repeated thoughtfully but can you stay till tomowwow 
 oh please may i stay with you cried petya 
 but just what did the genewal tell you to weturn at once asked denisov 
 petya blushed 
 he gave me no instructions i think i could he returned inquiringly 
 well all wight said denisov 
 and turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place arranged near the hut in the forest and told the officer on the kirghiz horse who performed the duties of an adjutant to go and find out where dolokhov was and whether he would come that evening denisov himself intended going with the esaul and petya to the edge of the forest where it reached out to shamshevo to have a look at the part of the french bivouac they were to attack next day 
 well old fellow said he to the peasant guide lead us to shamshevo 
 denisov petya and the esaul accompanied by some cossacks and the hussar who had the prisoner rode to the left across a ravine to the edge of the forest

 book war between four walls 
 chapter i 
 
 the charybdis of the faubourg saint antoine and the scylla of the faubourg du temple 
 the two most memorable barricades which the observer of social maladies can name do not belong to the period in which the action of this work is laid 
 these two barricades both of them symbols under two different aspects of a redoubtable situation sprang from the earth at the time of the fatal insurrection of june the greatest war of the streets that history has ever beheld 
 it sometimes happens that even contrary to principles even contrary to liberty equality and fraternity even contrary to the universal vote even contrary to the government by all for all from the depths of its anguish of its discouragements and its destitutions of its fevers of its distresses of its miasmas of its ignorances of its darkness that great and despairing body the rabble protests against and that the populace wages battle against the people 
 beggars attack the common right the ochlocracy rises against demos 
 these are melancholy days for there is always a certain amount of night even in this madness there is suicide in this duel and those words which are intended to be insults beggars canaille ochlocracy alas rather the fault of those who reign than the fault of those who suffer rather the fault of the privileged than the fault of the disinherited 
 for our own part we never pronounce those words without pain and without respect for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which they correspond it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries athens was an ochlocracy the beggars were the making of holland the populace saved rome more than once and the rabble followed jesus christ 
 there is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificences of the lower classes 
 it was of this rabble that saint jerome was thinking no doubt and of all these poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserable people whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs when he uttered this mysterious saying 
 fex urbis lex orbis the dregs of the city the law of the earth 
 the exasperations of this crowd which suffers and bleeds its violences contrary to all sense directed against the principles which are its life its masterful deeds against the right are its popular coups and should be repressed 
 the man of probity sacrifices himself and out of his very love for this crowd he combats it 
 but how excusable he feels it even while holding out against it 
 how he venerates it even while resisting it this is one of those rare moments when while doing that which it is duty to do one feels something which disconcerts one and which would dissuade one from proceeding further one persists it is necessary but conscience though satisfied is sad and the accomplishment of duty is complicated with a pain at the heart 
 june let us hasten to say was an exceptional fact and almost impossible of classification in the philosophy of history all the words which we have just uttered must be discarded when it becomes a question of this extraordinary revolt in which one feels the holy anxiety of toil claiming its rights 
 it was necessary to combat it and this was a duty for it attacked the republic but what was june at bottom 
 a revolt of the people against itself 
 where the subject is not lost sight of there is no digression may we then be permitted to arrest the attention for a moment on the two absolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and which characterized this insurrection 
 one blocked the entrance to the faubourg saint antoine the other defended the approach to the faubourg du temple those before whom these two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the brilliant blue sky of june will never forget them 
 the barricade was tremendous it was three stories high and seven hundred feet wide 
 it barred the vast opening of the faubourg that is to say three streets from angle to angle ravined jagged cut up divided crenelated with an immense rent buttressed with piles that were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there powerfully backed up by two great promontories of houses of the faubourg it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the formidable place which had seen the th of july nineteen barricades were ranged one behind the other in the depths of the streets behind this principal barricade 
 at the very sight of it one felt the agonizing suffering in the immense faubourg which had reached that point of extremity when a distress may become a catastrophe 
 of what was that barricade made 
 of the ruins of three houses demolished expressly said some of the prodigy of all wraths said others 
 it wore the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred ruin 
 it might be asked who built this 
 it might also be said 
 who destroyed this it was the improvisation of the ebullition 
 hold take this door this grating this penthouse this this broken brazier this cracked pot 
 give all cast away all push this roll dig dismantle overturn ruin everything it was the collaboration of the pavement the block of stone the beam the bar of iron the rag the scrap the broken pane the unseated chair the the tatter the rag and the malediction 
 it was grand and it was petty 
 it was the abyss parodied on the public place by hubbub 
 the mass beside the atom the strip of ruined wall and the broken fraternization of every sort of rubbish 
 sisyphus had thrown his rock there and job his potsherd 
 terrible in short 
 it was the acropolis of the barefooted 
 overturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope an immense dray was spread out there crossways its axle pointing heavenward and seemed a scar on that tumultuous facade an omnibus hoisted gayly by main force to the very summit of the heap as though the architects of this bit of savagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their terror presented its horseless unharnessed pole to no one knows what horses of the air 
 this gigantic heap the alluvium of the revolt figured to the mind an ossa on pelion of all revolutions on the th of thermidor on the th of august the th of brumaire on the th of january vendemiaire on prairial on the situation deserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very spot whence the bastille had disappeared if the ocean made dikes it is thus that it would build the fury of the flood was stamped upon this shapeless mass what flood 
 the crowd 
 one thought one beheld hubbub petrified one thought one heard humming above this barricade as though there had been over their hive enormous dark bees of violent progress was it a thicket 
 was it a bacchanalia 
 was it a fortress vertigo seemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings there was something of the in that redoubt and something olympian in that confusion 
 one there beheld in a full of despair the rafters of roofs bits of garret windows with their figured paper window sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting the cannon wrecks of chimneys cupboards tables benches howling topsyturveydom and those thousand things the very refuse of the mendicant which contain at the same time fury and nothingness 
 one would have said that it was the tatters of a people rags of wood of iron of bronze of stone and that the faubourg saint antoine had thrust it there at its door with a colossal flourish of the broom making of its misery its barricade 
 blocks resembling blocks dislocated chains pieces of woodwork with brackets having the form of gibbets horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the old tortures endured by the people 
 the barricade saint antoine converted everything into a weapon everything that civil war could throw at the head of society proceeded thence it was not combat it was a paroxysm the carbines which defended this redoubt among which there were some blunderbusses sent bits of earthenware bones even the casters from dangerous projectiles on account of the brass 
 this barricade was furious it hurled to the clouds an inexpressible clamor at certain moments when provoking the army it was covered with throngs and tempest a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads crowned it a swarm filled it it had a thorny crest of guns of sabres of cudgels of axes of pikes and of bayonets a vast red flag flapped in the wind shouts of command songs of attack the roll of drums the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving were to be heard there 
 it was huge and living and like the back of an electric beast there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning the spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where rumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of god a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish it was a heap of filth and it was sinai 
 as we have said previously it attacked in the name of the 
 the revolution 
 barricade chance hazard disorder terror misunderstanding the unknown had facing it the constituent assembly the sovereignty of the people universal suffrage the nation the republic and it was the carmagnole bidding defiance to the marseillaise 
 immense but heroic defiance for the old faubourg is a hero 
 the faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance 
 the faubourg shouldered the redoubt the redoubt took its stand under cover of the faubourg 
 the vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which the strategy of the african generals dashed itself 
 its caverns its excrescences its warts its gibbosities grimaced so to speak and grinned beneath the smoke 
 the mitraille vanished in shapelessness the bombs plunged into it bullets only succeeded in making holes in it what was the use of cannonading chaos and the regiments accustomed to the fiercest visions of war gazed with uneasy eyes on that species of redoubt a wild beast in its bristling and a mountain by its enormous size 
 a quarter of a league away from the corner of the rue du temple which debouches on the boulevard near the if one thrust head bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the dallemagne shop one perceived in the distance beyond the canal in the street which mounts the slopes of belleville at the culminating point of the rise a strange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left as though the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order to close itself abruptly this wall was built of it was straight correct cold perpendicular levelled with the square laid out by rule and line cement was lacking of course but as in the case of certain roman walls without interfering with its rigid architecture the entablature was mathematically parallel with the base from distance to distance one could distinguish on the gray surface almost invisible loopholes which resembled black threads these loopholes were separated from each other by equal spaces the street was deserted as far as the eye could reach 
 all windows and doors were closed 
 in the background rose this barrier which made a blind thoroughfare of the street a motionless and tranquil wall no one was visible nothing was audible not a cry not a sound not a breath 
 a sepulchre 
 the dazzling sun of june inundated this terrible thing with light 
 it was the barricade of the faubourg of the temple 
 as soon as one arrived on the spot and caught sight of it it was impossible even for the boldest not to become thoughtful before this mysterious apparition 
 it was adjusted jointed imbricated rectilinear symmetrical and funereal 
 science and gloom met there 
 one felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre 
 one looked at it and spoke low 
 from time to time if some soldier an officer or representative of the people chanced to traverse the deserted highway a faint sharp whistle was heard and the fell dead or wounded or if he escaped the bullet sometimes a biscaien was seen to ensconce itself in some closed shutter in the interstice between two blocks of stone or in the plaster of a wall 
 for the men in the barricade had made themselves two small cannons out of two lengths of plugged up at one end with tow and there was no waste of useless powder 
 nearly every shot told there were corpses here and there and pools of blood on the pavement i remember a white butterfly which went and came in the street summer does not abdicate 
 in the neighborhood the spaces beneath the portes cocheres were encumbered with wounded 
 one felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see and one understood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street 
 massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal forms at the entrance to the faubourg du temple the soldiers of the attacking column gravely and thoughtfully watched this dismal redoubt this immobility this passivity whence sprang death some crawled flat on their faces as far as the crest of the curve of the bridge taking care that their shakos did not project beyond it 
 the valiant colonel monteynard admired this barricade with a that is built he said to a representative not one projects beyond its neighbor 
 it is made of that moment a bullet broke the cross on his breast and he fell 
 the cowards people said 
 let them show themselves 
 let us see them 
 they dare not 
 they are hiding 
 the barricade of the faubourg du temple defended by eighty men attacked by ten thousand held out for three days 
 on the fourth they did as at zaatcha as at constantine they pierced the houses they came over the roofs the barricade was taken 
 not one of the eighty cowards thought of flight all were killed there with the exception of the leader barthelemy of whom we shall speak presently 
 the barricade was the tumult of thunders the barricade of the temple was silence 
 the difference between these two redoubts was the difference between the formidable and the sinister one seemed a maw the other a mask 
 admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of june was composed of a wrath and of an enigma one divined in the first barricade the dragon and behind the second the sphinx 
 these two fortresses had been erected by two men named the one cournet the other barthelemy 
 cournet made the barricade barthelemy the barricade of the temple each was the image of the man who had built it 
 cournet was a man of lofty stature he had broad shoulders a red face a crushing fist a bold heart a loyal soul a sincere and terrible eye intrepid energetic irascible stormy the most cordial of men the most formidable of combatants 
 war strife conflict were the very air he breathed and put him in a good humor 
 he had been an officer in the navy and from his gestures and his voice one divined that he sprang from the ocean and that he came from the tempest he carried the hurricane on into battle 
 with the exception of the genius there was in cournet something of danton as with the exception of the divinity there was in danton something of hercules 
 barthelemy thin feeble pale taciturn was a sort of tragic street urchin who having had his ears boxed by a policeman lay in wait for him and killed him and at seventeen was sent to the galleys 
 he came out and made this barricade 
 later on fatal circumstance in london proscribed by all barthelemy slew cournet 
 it was a funereal duel 
 some time afterwards caught in the gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion plays a part a catastrophe in which french justice sees extenuating circumstances and in which english justice sees only death barthelemy was hanged 
 the sombre social construction is so made that thanks to material destitution thanks to moral obscurity that unhappy being who possessed an intelligence certainly firm possibly great began in france with the galleys and ended in england with the gallows 
 barthelemy on occasion flew but one flag the black flag

 book fourteen 
 chapter v 
 
 the rain had stopped and only the mist was falling and drops from the trees denisov the esaul and petya rode silently following the peasant in the knitted cap who stepping lightly with outturned toes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves silently led them to the edge of the forest 
 he ascended an incline stopped looked about him and advanced to where the screen of trees was less dense on reaching a large oak tree that had not yet shed its leaves he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them with his hand 
 denisov and petya rode up to him from the spot where the peasant was standing they could see the french immediately beyond the forest on a downward slope lay a field of spring rye to the right beyond a steep ravine was a small village and a house with a broken roof in the village in the house in the garden by the well by the pond over all the rising ground and all along the road uphill from the bridge leading to the village not more than five hundred yards away crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist their shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the carts and their calls to one another could be clearly heard 
 bwing the prisoner here said denisov in a low voice not taking his eyes off the french 
 a cossack dismounted lifted the boy down and took him to denisov pointing to the french troops denisov asked him what these and those of them were the boy thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and lifting his eyebrows looked at denisov in affright but in spite of an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers merely assenting to everything denisov asked him denisov turned away from him frowning and addressed the esaul conveying his own conjectures to him 
 petya rapidly turning his head looked now at the drummer boy now at denisov now at the esaul and now at the french in the village and along the road trying not to miss anything of importance 
 whether dolokhov comes or not we must seize it eh said denisov with a merry sparkle in his eyes 
 it is a very suitable spot said the esaul 
 send the infantwy down by the swamps denisov continued cweep up to the garden wide up fwom there with the cossacks he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village and i with my hussars fwom here and at the signal shot 
 the hollow is impassable a swamp there said the esaul the horses would sink we must ride round more to the left 
 while they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded from the low ground by the pond a puff of white smoke appeared then another and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry french voices shouting together came up from the slope for a moment denisov and the esaul drew back they were so near that they thought they were the cause of the firing and shouting but the firing and shouting did not relate to them down below a man wearing something red was running through the marsh the french were evidently firing and shouting at him 
 why our tikhon said the esaul 
 so it is it is 
 the wascal said denisov 
 get away said the esaul screwing up his eyes 
 the man whom they called tikhon having run to the stream plunged in so that the water splashed in the air and having disappeared for an instant scrambled out on all fours all black with the wet and ran on the french who had been pursuing him stopped 
 smart that said the esaul 
 what a beast said denisov with his former look of vexation what has he been doing all this time 
 who is he asked petya 
 our plastun i sent him to capture a tongue 
 oh yes said petya nodding at the first words denisov uttered as if he understood it all though he really did not understand anything of it 
 tikhon shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their band he was a peasant from pokrovsk near the river gzhat when denisov had come to pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the french the elder as though shielding himself had replied as all village elders did that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them but when denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the french and asked if no french had strayed that way the elder replied that some had really been at their village but that tikhon shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters denisov had tikhon called and having praised him for his activity said a few words in the presence about loyalty to the tsar and the country and the hatred of the french that all sons of the fatherland should cherish 
 we do the french any harm said tikhon evidently frightened by words we only fooled about with the lads for fun you know we killed a score or so of but we did no harm else 
 next day when denisov had left pokrovsk having quite forgotten about this peasant it was reported to him that tikhon had attached himself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it denisov gave orders to let him do so 
 tikhon who at first did rough work laying campfires fetching water flaying dead horses and so on soon showed a great liking and aptitude for partisan warfare at night he would go out for booty and always brought back french clothing and weapons and when told to would bring in french captives also denisov then relieved him from drudgery and began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled among the cossacks 
 tikhon did not like riding and always went on foot never lagging behind the cavalry he was armed with a musketoon which he carried rather as a joke a pike and an ax which latter he used as a wolf uses its teeth with equal case picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at length or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons in party he held a peculiar and exceptional position when anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be done to push a cart out of the mud with shoulders pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail skin it slink in among the french or walk more than thirty miles in a day everybody pointed laughingly at tikhon 
 it hurt that devil as strong as a horse they said of him 
 once a frenchman tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and shot him in the fleshy part of the back that wound which tikhon treated only with internal and external applications of vodka was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment jokes in which tikhon readily joined 
 hallo mate never again gave you a twist the cossacks would banter him and tikhon purposely writhing and making faces pretended to be angry and swore at the french with the funniest curses the only effect of this incident on tikhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners 
 he was the bravest and most useful man in the party no one found more opportunities for attacking no one captured or killed more frenchmen and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role now he had been sent by denisov overnight to shamshevo to capture a tongue but whether because he had not been content to take only one frenchman or because he had slept through the night he had crept by day into some bushes right among the french and as denisov had witnessed from above had been detected by them

 chapter ii 
 
 what is to be done in the abyss if one does not converse 
 sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection and june knew a great deal more about it than june so the barricade of the rue de la chanvrerie was only an outline and an embryo compared to the two colossal barricades which we have just sketched but it was formidable for that epoch 
 the insurgents under the eye of enjolras for marius no longer looked after anything had made good use of the night 
 the barricade had been not only repaired but augmented 
 they had raised it two feet bars of iron planted in the pavement resembled lances in rest all sorts of rubbish brought and added from all directions complicated the external confusion 
 the redoubt had been cleverly made over into a wall on the inside and a thicket on the outside 
 the staircase of which permitted one to mount it like the wall of a citadel had been reconstructed 
 the barricade had been put in order the disencumbered the kitchen appropriated for the ambulance the dressing of the wounded completed the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been gathered up bullets run cartridges manufactured lint scraped the fallen weapons the interior of the redoubt cleaned the rubbish swept up corpses removed 
 they laid the dead in a heap in the mondetour lane of which they were still the masters 
 the pavement was red for a long time at that spot among the dead there were four national guardsmen of the suburbs enjolras had their uniforms laid aside 
 enjolras had advised two hours of sleep 
 advice from enjolras was a command 
 still only three or four took advantage of it 
 feuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription on the wall which faced the tavern 
 long live the peoples 
 these four words hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail could be still read on the wall in 
 the three women had profited by the respite of the night to vanish definitely which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely 
 they had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house 
 the greater part of the wounded were able and wished to fight still on a litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen which had been converted into an ambulance there were five men gravely wounded two of whom were municipal guardsmen 
 the municipal guardsmen were attended to first 
 in the there remained only mabeuf under his black cloth and javert bound to his post 
 this is the hall of the dead said enjolras 
 in the interior of this hall barely lighted by a candle at one end the mortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar a sort of vast vague cross resulted from javert erect and mabeuf lying prone 
 the pole of the omnibus although snapped off by the fusillade was still sufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag to it 
 enjolras who possessed that quality of a leader of always doing what he said attached to this staff the and bloody coat of the old 
 no repast had been possible 
 there was neither bread nor meat the fifty men in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty provisions of the during the sixteen hours which they had passed there 
 at a given moment every barricade inevitably becomes the raft of la meduse 
 they were obliged to resign themselves to hunger they had then reached the first hours of that spartan day of the th of june when in the barricade jeanne surrounded by the insurgents who demanded bread replied to all combatants crying something to eat with 
 why 
 it is three at four we shall be dead 
 as they could no longer eat enjolras forbade them to drink he interdicted wine and portioned out the brandy 
 they had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed enjolras and combeferre examined them 
 combeferre when he came up again the old stock of father hucheloup who began business as a must be real wine observed bossuet 
 lucky that grantaire is asleep 
 if he were on foot there would be a good deal of difficulty in saving those in spite of all murmurs placed his veto on the fifteen bottles and in order that no one might touch them he had them placed under the table on which father mabeuf was lying 
 about two in the morning they reckoned up their strength there were still of them 
 the day began to dawn 
 the torch which had been replaced in its cavity in the pavement had just been extinguished 
 the interior of the barricade that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from the street was bathed in shadows and resembled athwart the vague twilight horror the deck of a disabled ship 
 the combatants as they went and came moved about there like black forms above that terrible of gloom the stories of the mute houses were lividly outlined at the very top the chimneys stood palely out 
 the sky was of that charming undecided hue which may be white and may be blue 
 birds flew about in it with cries of joy 
 the lofty house which formed the back of the barricade being turned to the east had upon its roof a rosy reflection the morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head of the dead man at the window 
 i am delighted that the torch has been extinguished said courfeyrac to feuilly 
 that torch flickering in the wind annoyed me it had the appearance of being afraid 
 the light of torches resembles the wisdom of cowards it gives a bad light because it trembles 
 dawn awakens minds as it does the birds all began to talk 
 joly perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter extracted philosophy from it 
 what is the cat he exclaimed 
 it is a corrective 
 the good god having made the mouse said 
 hullo i have committed a blunder and so he made the cat 
 the cat is the erratum of the mouse the mouse plus the cat is the proof of creation revised and corrected 
 combeferre surrounded by students and artisans was speaking of the dead of jean prouvaire of bahorel of mabeuf and even of cabuc and of enjolras sad severity 
 he said 
 harmodius and aristogiton brutus chereas stephanus cromwell charlotte corday sand have all had their moment of agony when it was too late 
 our hearts quiver so and human life is such a mystery that even in the case of a civic murder even in a murder for liberation if there be such a thing the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the joy of having served the human race 
 and such are the windings of the exchange of speech that a moment later by a transition brought about through jean verses combeferre was comparing the translators of the georgics raux with cournand cournand with delille pointing out the passages translated by malfilatre particularly the prodigies of death and at that word caesar the conversation reverted to brutus 
 caesar said combeferre fell justly 
 cicero was severe towards caesar and he was right 
 that severity is not diatribe 
 when zoilus insults homer when maevius insults virgil when vise insults moliere when pope insults shakspeare when frederic insults voltaire it is an old law of envy and hatred which is being carried out genius attracts insult great men are always more or less barked at but zoilus and cicero are two different persons 
 cicero is an arbiter in thought just as brutus is an arbiter by the sword 
 for my own part i blame that last justice the blade but antiquity admitted it caesar the violator of the rubicon conferring as though they came from him the dignities which emanated from the people not rising at the entrance of the senate committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant regia ac pene tyrannica he was a great man so much the worse or so much the better the lesson is but the more exalted 
 his wounds touch me less than the spitting in the face of jesus christ caesar is stabbed by the senators christ is cuffed by lackeys one feels the god through the greater outrage 
 bossuet who towered above the interlocutors from the summit of a heap of exclaimed rifle in hand 
 oh cydathenaeum oh myrrhinus oh probalinthus oh graces of the aeantides 
 oh 
 who will grant me to pronounce the verses of homer like a greek of laurium or of edapteon

 after talking for some time with the esaul about next attack which now seeing how near they were to the french he seemed to have definitely decided on denisov turned his horse and rode back 
 now my lad go and get dwy he said to petya 
 as they approached the watchhouse denisov stopped peering into the forest among the trees a man with long legs and long swinging arms wearing a short jacket bast shoes and a kazan hat was approaching with long light steps he had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle when he espied denisov he hastily threw something into the bushes removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim and approached his commander it was tikhon his wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with merriment he lifted his head high and gazed at denisov as if repressing a laugh 
 well where did you disappear to inquired denisov 
 where did i disappear to i went to get frenchmen answered tikhon boldly and hurriedly in a husky but melodious bass voice 
 why did you push yourself in there by daylight you ass well why you taken one 
 oh i took one all right said tikhon 
 where is he 
 you see i took him first thing at dawn tikhon continued spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes i took him into the forest then i see no good and think go and fetch a likelier one 
 you see what a wogue just as i thought said denisov to the esaul why you bwing that one 
 what was the good of bringing him tikhon interrupted hastily and angrily that one have done for you as if i know what sort you want 
 what a bwute you are well 
 i went for another one tikhon continued and i crept like this through the wood and lay down he suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple movement to show how he had done it one turned up and i grabbed him like this he jumped up quickly and lightly come along to the colonel i said he starts yelling and suddenly there were four of them they rushed at me with their little swords so i went for them with my ax this way what are you up to says i christ be with you shouted tikhon waving his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest 
 yes we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the puddles said the esaul screwing up his glittering eyes 
 petya badly wanted to laugh but noticed that they all refrained from laughing he turned his eyes rapidly from face to the and unable to make out what it all meant 
 play the fool said denisov coughing angrily why you bwing the first one 
 tikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming foolish grin disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth that was why he was called shcherbaty the denisov smiled and petya burst into a peal of merry laughter in which tikhon himself joined 
 oh but he was a regular said tikhon the clothes on him poor stuff how could i bring him and so rude your honor why he says a son myself i go he says 
 you are a bwute said denisov i wanted to question 
 but i questioned him said tikhon he said he know much there are a lot of us he says but all poor stuff only soldiers in name he says shout loud at them he says and take them all tikhon concluded looking cheerfully and resolutely into eyes 
 give you a hundwed sharp lashes teach you to play the fool said denisov severely 
 but why are you angry remonstrated tikhon just as if never seen your frenchmen only wait till it gets dark and fetch you any of them you want three if you like 
 well go said denisov and rode all the way to the watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily 
 tikhon followed behind and petya heard the cossacks laughing with him and at him about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes 
 when the fit of laughter that had seized him at words and smile had passed and petya realized for a moment that this tikhon had killed a man he felt uneasy he looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt a pang in his heart but this uneasiness lasted only a moment he felt it necessary to hold his head higher to brace himself and to question the esaul with an air of importance about undertaking that he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself 
 the officer who had been sent to inquire met denisov on the way with the news that dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him 
 denisov at once cheered up and calling petya to him said well tell me about yourself

 light and shadow 
 enjolras had been to make a reconnaissance 
 he had made his way out through mondetour lane gliding along close to the houses 
 the insurgents we will remark were full of hope 
 the manner in which they had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to almost disdain in advance the attack at dawn 
 they waited for it with a smile 
 they had no more doubt as to their success than as to their cause 
 moreover succor was evidently on the way to them they reckoned on it 
 with that facility of triumphant prophecy which is one of the sources of strength in the french combatant they divided the day which was at hand into three distinct phases at six in the morning a regiment which had been labored with would turn at noon the insurrection of all paris at sunset revolution 
 they heard the alarm bell of which had not been silent for an instant since the night before a proof that the other barricade the great one still held out 
 all these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a sort of gay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike hum of a hive of bees 
 enjolras reappeared 
 he returned from his sombre eagle flight into outer darkness 
 he listened for a moment to all this joy with folded arms and one hand on his mouth 
 then fresh and rosy in the growing whiteness of the dawn he said 
 the whole army of paris is to strike 
 a third of the army is bearing down upon the barricades in which you now are 
 there is the national guard in addition 
 i have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the line and the of the sixth legion 
 in one hour you will be attacked 
 as for the populace it was seething yesterday it is not stirring 
 there is nothing to expect nothing to hope for neither from a faubourg nor from a regiment 
 you are abandoned 
 these words fell upon the buzzing of the groups and produced on them the effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm a moment of indescribable silence ensued in which death might have been heard flitting by 
 this moment was brief 
 a voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to enjolras 
 so be it 
 let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet and let us all remain in it 
 citizens let us offer the protests of corpses 
 let us show that if the people abandon the republicans the republicans do not abandon the people 
 these words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of individual anxieties 
 it was hailed with an enthusiastic acclamation 
 no one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus he was some unknown a stranger a man forgotten a passing hero that great anonymous always mingled in human crises and in social geneses who at a given moment utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word and who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute in a lightning flash the people and god 
 this inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air of the th of june that almost at the very same hour on the barricade the insurgents were raising that clamor which has become a matter of history and which has been consigned to the documents in the matters it whether they come to our assistance or not 
 let us get ourselves killed here to the very last man 
 as the reader sees the two barricades though materially isolated were in communication with each other

 chapter vii 
 
 petya having left his people after their departure from moscow joined his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a large guerrilla detachment from the time he received his commission and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the battle of vyazma petya had been in a constant state of blissful excitement at being and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any chance to do something really heroic he was highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army but at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be and he was always in a hurry to get where he was not 
 when on the of october his general expressed a wish to send somebody to detachment petya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse but when dispatching him he recalled mad action at the battle of vyazma where instead of riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent he had galloped to the advanced line under the fire of the french and had there twice fired his pistol so now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever of that was why petya had blushed and grown confused when denisov asked him whether he could stay before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest petya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once but when he saw the french and saw tikhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack that night he decided with the rapidity with which young people change their views that the general whom he had greatly respected till then was a rubbishy german that denisov was a hero the esaul a hero and tikhon a hero too and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a moment of difficulty 
 it was already growing dusk when denisov petya and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse in the twilight saddled horses could be seen and cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the french could not see the smoke in the passage of the small watchhouse a cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton in the room three officers of band were converting a door into a tabletop petya took off his wet clothes gave them to be dried and at once began helping the officers to fix up the dinner table 
 in ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it on the table were vodka a flask of rum white bread roast mutton and salt 
 sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton with his hands down which the grease trickled petya was in an ecstatic childish state of love for all men and consequently of confidence that others loved him in the same way 
 so then what do you think vasili dmitrich said he to denisov all right my staying a day with you and not waiting for a reply he answered his own question you see i was told to find out well i am finding out only do let me into the very into the chief i want a reward but i want 
 petya clenched his teeth and looked around throwing back his head and flourishing his arms 
 into the vewy chief denisov repeated with a smile 
 only please let me command something so that i may really command petya went on what would it be to you oh you want a knife he said turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton 
 and he handed him his clasp knife the officer admired it 
 please keep it i have several like it said petya blushing heavens i was quite forgetting he suddenly cried i have some raisins fine ones you know seedless ones we have a new sutler and he has such capital things i bought ten pounds i am used to something sweet would you like some and petya ran out into the passage to his cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins have some gentlemen have some 
 you want a coffeepot you he asked the esaul i bought a capital one from our sutler he has splendid things and very honest the chief thing be sure to send it to you or perhaps your flints are giving out or are worn out that happens sometimes you know i have brought some with me here they are and he showed a bag a hundred flints i bought them very cheap please take as many as you want or all if you like 
 then suddenly dismayed lest he had said too much petya stopped and blushed 
 he tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was foolish and running over the events of the day he remembered the french drummer boy capital for us here but what of him where have they put him have they fed him they hurt his feelings he thought but having caught himself saying too much about the flints he was now afraid to speak out 
 i might ask he thought but say a boy himself and so he pities the boy show them tomorrow whether a boy will it seem odd if i ask petya thought well never mind and immediately blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared ironical he said 
 may i call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to eat perhaps 
 yes a poor little fellow said denisov who evidently saw nothing shameful in this reminder call him in his name is vincent bosse have him fetched 
 call him said petya 
 yes yes call him a poor little fellow denisov repeated 
 petya was standing at the door when denisov said this he slipped in between the officers came close to denisov and said 
 let me kiss you dear old fellow oh how fine how splendid 
 and having kissed denisov he ran out of the hut 
 bosse vincent petya cried stopping outside the door 
 who do you want sir asked a voice in the darkness 
 petya replied that he wanted the french lad who had been captured that day 
 ah vesenny said a cossack 
 vincent the name had already been changed by the cossacks into vesenny vernal and into vesenya by the peasants and soldiers in both these adaptations the reference to spring vesna matched the impression made by the young lad 
 he is warming himself there by the bonfire ho vesenya vesenya vesenny laughing voices were heard calling to one another in the darkness 
 a smart lad said an hussar standing near petya we gave him something to eat a while ago he was awfully hungry 
 the sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the darkness and the drummer boy came to the door 
 ah vous said petya manger pas peur on ne vous fera pas de mal he added shyly and affectionately touching the hand entrez entrez 
 ah you do you want something to eat be afraid they hurt you 
 come in come in 
 merci monsieur said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish voice and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold 
 thank you sir 
 there were many things petya wanted to say to the drummer boy but did not dare to he stood irresolutely beside him in the passage then in the darkness he took the hand and pressed it 
 come in come in he repeated in a gentle whisper oh what can i do for him he thought and opening the door he let the boy pass in first 
 when the boy had entered the hut petya sat down at a distance from him considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him but he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy

 minus five plus one 
 after the man who decreed the protest of corpses had spoken and had given this formula of their common soul there issued from all mouths a strangely satisfied and terrible cry funereal in sense and triumphant in tone 
 long live death 
 let us all remain here 
 why all said enjolras 
 all 
 all 
 enjolras resumed 
 the position is good the barricade is fine 
 thirty men are enough why sacrifice forty 
 they replied 
 because not one will go away 
 citizens cried enjolras and there was an almost irritated vibration in his voice this republic is not rich enough in men to indulge in useless expenditure of them 
 is waste if the duty of some is to depart that duty should be fulfilled like any other 
 enjolras the had over his that sort of omnipotent power which emanates from the absolute 
 still great as was this omnipotence a murmur arose 
 a leader to the very enjolras seeing that they murmured insisted 
 he resumed haughtily 
 let those who are afraid of not numbering more than thirty say so 
 the murmurs redoubled 
 besides observed a voice in one group it is easy enough to talk about leaving 
 the barricade is hemmed in 
 not on the side of the halles said enjolras 
 the rue mondetour is free and through the rue des precheurs one can reach the marche des innocents 
 and there went on another voice you would be captured you would fall in with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs they will spy a man passing in blouse and cap 
 whence come you you belong to the barricade 
 and they will look at your hands you smell of powder 
 shot 
 enjolras without making any reply touched shoulder and the two entered the 
 they emerged thence a moment later 
 enjolras held in his outstretched hands the four uniforms which he had laid aside combeferre followed carrying the and the shakos 
 with this uniform said enjolras you can mingle with the ranks and escape here is enough for four 
 and he flung on the ground deprived of its pavement the four uniforms 
 no wavering took place in his stoical audience 
 combeferre took the word 
 come said he you must have a little pity 
 do you know what the question is here 
 it is a question of women 
 see here 
 are there women or are there not 
 are there children or are there not are there mothers yes or no who rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot of little ones around them 
 let that man of you who has never beheld a breast raise his hand 
 ah you want to get yourselves killed so do who am speaking to you but i do not want to feel the phantoms of women wreathing their arms around me 
 die if you will but make others die suicides like that which is on the brink of accomplishment here are sublime but suicide is narrow and does not admit of extension and as soon as it touches your neighbors suicide is murder think of the little blond heads think of the white locks listen enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of the rue du cygne a lighted casement a candle in a poor window on the fifth floor and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head of an old woman who had the air of having spent the night in watching perhaps she is the mother of some one of you 
 well let that man go and make haste to say to his mother 
 here i am mother 
 let him feel at ease the task here will be performed all the same when one supports relatives by toil one has not the right to sacrifice self 
 that is deserting family and those who have daughters what are you thinking of 
 you get yourselves killed you are dead that is well 
 and tomorrow 
 young girls without is a terrible thing 
 man begs woman sells ah those charming and gracious beings so gracious and so sweet who have bonnets of flowers who fill the house with purity who sing and prattle who are like a living perfume who prove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth that jeanne that lise that mimi those adorable and honest creatures who are your blessings and your pride ah good god they will suffer hunger what do you want me to say to you 
 there is a market for human flesh and it is not with your shadowy hands shuddering around them that you will prevent them from entering it 
 think of the street think of the pavement covered with think of the shops past which women go and come with necks all bare and through the mire these women too were pure once 
 think of your sisters those of you who have them 
 misery prostitution the police that is what those beautiful delicate girls those fragile marvels of modesty gentleness and loveliness fresher than lilacs in the month of may will come to 
 ah you have got yourselves killed you are no longer on hand 
 that is well you have wished to release the people from royalty and you deliver over your daughters to the police 
 friends have a care have mercy 
 women unhappy women we are not in the habit of bestowing much thought on them we trust to the women not having received a education we prevent their reading we prevent their thinking we prevent their occupying themselves with politics will you prevent them from going to the this evening and recognizing your bodies let us see those who have families must be tractable and shake hands with us and take themselves off and leave us here alone to attend to this affair 
 i know well that courage is required to leave that it is hard but the harder it is the more meritorious you say 
 i have a gun i am at the barricade so much the worse i shall remain there 
 so much the worse is easily said 
 my friends there is a morrow you will not be here but your families will and what sufferings 
 see here is a pretty healthy child with cheeks like an apple who babbles prattles chatters who laughs who smells sweet beneath your do you know what becomes of him when he is abandoned 
 i have seen one a very small creature no taller than that 
 his father was dead 
 poor people had taken him in out of charity but they had bread only for themselves the child was always hungry 
 it was winter 
 he did not cry you could see him approach the stove in which there was never any fire and whose pipe you know was of mastic and yellow clay his breathing was hoarse his face livid his limbs flaccid his belly prominent 
 he said nothing 
 if you spoke to him he did not answer 
 he is dead 
 he was taken to the necker hospital where i saw him 
 i was in that hospital 
 now if there are any fathers among you fathers whose happiness it is to stroll on sundays holding their tiny hand in their robust hand let each one of those fathers imagine that this child is his own that poor brat i remember and i seem to see him now when he lay nude on the dissecting table how his ribs stood out on his skin like the graves beneath the grass in a cemetery 
 a sort of mud was found in his stomach 
 there were ashes in his teeth 
 come let us examine ourselves conscientiously and take counsel with our heart statistics show that the mortality among abandoned children is per cent 
 i repeat it is a question of women it concerns mothers it concerns young girls it concerns little children 
 who is talking to you of yourselves 
 we know well what you are we know well that you are all brave parbleu we know well that you all have in your souls the joy and the glory of giving your life for the great cause we know well that you feel yourselves elected to die usefully and magnificently and that each one of you clings to his share in the triumph 
 very well 
 but you are not alone in this world there are other beings of whom you must think 
 you must not be egoists 
 all dropped their heads with a gloomy air 
 strange contradictions of the human heart at its most sublime moments 
 combeferre who spoke thus was not an orphan he recalled the mothers of other men and forgot his own he was about to get himself killed 
 he was an egoist 
 marius fasting fevered having emerged in succession from all hope and having been stranded in grief the most sombre of shipwrecks and saturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end was near had plunged deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor which always precedes the fatal hour voluntarily accepted 
 a physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms of that febrile absorption known to and classified by science and which is to suffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure despair also has its ecstasy 
 marius had reached this point he looked on at everything as from without as we have said things which passed before him seemed far away he made out the whole but did not perceive the details 
 he beheld men going and coming as through a flame 
 he heard voices speaking as at the bottom of an abyss 
 but this moved him 
 there was in this scene a point which pierced and roused even him 
 he had but one idea now to die and he did not wish to be turned aside from it but he reflected in his gloomy somnambulism that while destroying himself he was not prohibited from saving some one else 
 he raised his voice 
 enjolras and combeferre are right said he no unnecessary sacrifice i join them and you must make haste 
 combeferre has said convincing things to you 
 there are some among you who have families mothers sisters wives children 
 let such leave the ranks 
 no one stirred 
 married men and the supporters of families step out of the ranks repeated marius 
 his authority was great 
 enjolras was certainly the head of the barricade but marius was its savior 
 i order it cried enjolras 
 i entreat you said marius 
 then touched by words shaken by enjolras order touched by marius entreaty these heroic men began to denounce each is true said one young man to a full grown man you are the father of a family 
 is your duty rather retorted the man you have two sisters whom you maintain and an unprecedented controversy broke forth 
 each struggled to determine which should not allow himself to be placed at the door of the tomb 
 make haste said courfeyrac in another quarter of an hour it will be too late 
 citizens pursued enjolras this is the republic and universal suffrage reigns 
 do you yourselves designate those who are to go 
 they obeyed 
 after the expiration of a few minutes five were unanimously selected and stepped out of the ranks 
 there are five of them exclaimed marius 
 there were only four uniforms 
 well began the five one must stay behind 
 and then a struggle arose as to who should remain and who should find reasons for the others not remaining 
 the generous quarrel began afresh 
 you have a wife who loves have your aged mother you have neither father nor mother and what is to become of your three little are the father of five have a right to live you are only seventeen it is too early for you to die 
 these great revolutionary barricades were assembling points for heroism the improbable was simple there 
 these men did not astonish each other 
 be quick repeated courfeyrac 
 men shouted to marius from the groups 
 do you designate who is to remain 
 yes said the five choose 
 we will obey you 
 marius did not believe that he was capable of another emotion still at this idea that of choosing a man for death his blood rushed back to his heart 
 he would have turned pale had it been possible for him to become any paler 
 he advanced towards the five who smiled upon him and each with his eyes full of that grand flame which one beholds in the depths of history hovering over thermopylae cried to him 
 me me me 
 and marius stupidly counted them there were still five of them then his glance dropped to the four uniforms 
 at that moment a fifth uniform fell as if from heaven upon the other four 
 the fifth man was saved 
 marius raised his eyes and recognized m fauchelevent 
 jean valjean had just entered the barricade 
 he had arrived by way of mondetour lane whither by dint of inquiries made or by instinct or chance 
 thanks to his dress of a national guardsman he had made his way without difficulty 
 the sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the rue mondetour had no occasion to give the alarm for a single national guardsman and he had allowed the latter to entangle himself in the street saying to himself 
 probably it is a reinforcement in any case it is a prisoner 
 the moment was too grave to admit of the sentinel abandoning his duty and his post of observation 
 at the moment when jean valjean entered the redoubt no one had noticed him all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms 
 jean valjean also had seen and heard and he had silently removed his coat and flung it on the pile with the rest 
 the emotion aroused was indescribable 
 who is this man demanded bossuet 
 he is a man who saves others replied combeferre 
 marius added in a grave voice 
 i know him 
 this guarantee satisfied every one 
 enjolras turned to jean valjean 
 welcome citizen 
 and he added 
 you know that we are about to die 
 jean valjean without replying helped the insurgent whom he was saving to don his uniform

 book fourteen 
 chapter viii 
 
 the arrival of dolokhov diverted attention from the drummer boy to whom denisov had had some mutton and vodka given and whom he had had dressed in a russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners petya had heard in the army many stories of extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the french so from the moment he entered the hut petya did not take his eyes from him but braced himself up more and more and held his head high that he might not be unworthy even of such company 
 appearance amazed petya by its simplicity 
 denisov wore a cossack coat had a beard had an icon of nicholas the on his breast and his way of speaking and everything he did indicated his unusual position but dolokhov who in moscow had worn a persian costume had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the guards he was and wore a padded coat with an order of st george at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head he took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room and without greeting anyone went up to denisov and began questioning him about the matter in hand denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had on the transport of the message petya had brought and his own replies to both generals then he told him all he knew of the french detachment 
 so but we must know what troops they are and their numbers said dolokhov it will be necessary to go there we start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are i like to work accurately here now one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the french camp with me i have brought a spare uniform 
 i i go with you cried petya 
 no need for you to go at all said denisov addressing dolokhov and as for him i let him go on any account 
 i like that exclaimed petya why i go 
 because useless 
 well you must excuse me because because i shall go and all take me you he said turning to dolokhov 
 why not dolokhov answered absently scrutinizing the face of the french drummer boy have you had that youngster with you long he asked denisov 
 he was taken today but he knows nothing keeping him with me 
 yes and where do you put the others inquired dolokhov 
 where i send them away and take a weceipt for them shouted denisov suddenly flushing and i say boldly that i have not a single life on my conscience would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort instead of staining i speak bluntly staining the honor of a soldier 
 that kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of sixteen said dolokhov with cold irony but time for you to drop it 
 why not said anything i only say that certainly go with you said petya shyly 
 but for you and me old fellow time to drop these amenities continued dolokhov as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated denisov now why have you kept this lad he went on swaying his head because you are sorry for him we know those receipts of yours you send a hundred men away and thirty get there the rest either starve or get killed so it all the same not to send them 
 the esaul screwing up his eyes nodded approvingly 
 not the point not going to discuss the matter i do not wish to take it on my conscience you say die all wight only not by my fault 
 dolokhov began laughing 
 who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over but if they did catch me string me up to an aspen tree and with all your chivalry just the same he paused however we must get to work tell the cossack to fetch my kit i have two french uniforms in it well are you coming with me he asked petya 
 i yes yes certainly cried petya blushing almost to tears and glancing at denisov 
 while dolokhov had been disputing with denisov what should be done with prisoners petya had once more felt awkward and restless but again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about if distinguished men think so it must be necessary and right thought he but above all denisov must not dare to imagine that obey him and that he can order me about i will certainly go to the french camp with dolokhov if he can so can i 
 and to all persuasions petya replied that he too was accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow and that he never considered personal danger 
 for admit that if we know for sure how many of them there are hundreds of lives may depend on it while there are only two of us besides i want to go very much and certainly will go so hinder me said he it will only make things worse

 book war between four walls 
 chapter v 
 
 the horizon which one beholds from the summit of a barricade 
 the situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place had as result and culminating point enjolras supreme melancholy 
 enjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution he was incomplete however so far as the absolute can be so he had too much of about him and not enough of anacharsis cloots still his mind in the society of the friends of the a b c had ended by undergoing a certain polarization from ideas for some time past he had been gradually emerging from the narrow form of dogma and had allowed himself to incline to the broadening influence of progress and he had come to accept as a definitive and magnificent evolution the transformation of the great french republic into the immense human republic as far as the immediate means were concerned a violent situation being given he wished to be violent on that point he never varied and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which is summed up in the words 
 enjolras was standing erect on the staircase of one elbow resting on the stock of his gun 
 he was engaged in thought he quivered as at the passage of prophetic breaths places where death is have these effects of tripods 
 a sort of stifled fire darted from his eyes which were filled with an inward look 
 all at once he threw back his head his blond locks fell back like those of an angel on the sombre quadriga made of stars they were like the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo and enjolras cried 
 citizens do you picture the future to yourselves 
 the streets of cities inundated with light green branches on the thresholds nations sisters men just old men blessing children the past loving the present thinkers entirely at liberty believers on terms of full equality for religion heaven god the direct priest human conscience become an altar no more hatreds the fraternity of the workshop and the school for sole penalty and recompense fame work for all right for all peace over all no more bloodshed no more wars happy mothers 
 to conquer matter is the first step to realize the ideal is the second 
 reflect on what progress has already accomplished 
 formerly the first human races beheld with terror the hydra pass before their eyes breathing on the waters the dragon which vomited flame the griffin who was the monster of the air and who flew with the wings of an eagle and the talons of a tiger fearful beasts which were above man man nevertheless spread his snares consecrated by intelligence and finally conquered these monsters 
 we have vanquished the hydra and it is called the locomotive we are on the point of vanquishing the griffin we already grasp it and it is called the balloon on the day when this promethean task shall be accomplished and when man shall have definitely harnessed to his will the triple chimaera of antiquity the hydra the dragon and the griffin he will be the master of water fire and of air and he will be for the rest of animated creation that which the ancient gods formerly were to him 
 courage and onward 
 citizens whither are we going 
 to science made government to the force of things become the sole public force to the natural law having in itself its sanction and its penalty and promulgating itself by evidence to a dawn of truth corresponding to a dawn of day 
 we are advancing to the union of peoples we are advancing to the unity of man no more fictions no more parasites 
 the real governed by the true that is the goal 
 civilization will hold its assizes at the summit of europe and later on at the centre of continents in a grand parliament of the intelligence 
 something similar has already been seen 
 the amphictyons had two sittings a year one at delphos the seat of the gods the other at thermopylae the place of heroes 
 europe will have her amphictyons the globe will have its amphictyons 
 france bears this sublime future in her breast 
 this is the gestation of the nineteenth century that which greece sketched out is worthy of being finished by france listen to me you feuilly valiant artisan man of the people i revere you 
 yes you clearly behold the future yes you are right you had neither father nor mother feuilly you adopted humanity for your mother and right for your father 
 you are about to die that is to say to triumph here 
 citizens whatever happens through our defeat as well as through our victory it is a revolution that we are about to create 
 as conflagrations light up a whole city so revolutions illuminate the whole human race and what is the revolution that we shall cause 
 i have just told you the revolution of the true 
 from a political point of view there is but a single principle the sovereignty of man over himself this sovereignty of myself over myself is called liberty 
 where two or three of these sovereignties are combined the state begins but in that association there is no abdication 
 each sovereignty concedes a certain quantity of itself for the purpose of forming the common right 
 this quantity is the same for all of us this identity of concession which each makes to all is called equality common right is nothing else than the protection of all beaming on the right of each 
 this protection of all over each is called fraternity 
 the point of intersection of all these assembled sovereignties is called society 
 this intersection being a junction this point is a knot 
 hence what is called the social bond some say social contract which is the same thing the word contract being etymologically formed with the idea of a bond let us come to an understanding about equality for if liberty is the summit equality is the base 
 equality citizens is not wholly a surface vegetation a society of great blades of grass and tiny oaks a proximity of jealousies which render each other null and void legally speaking it is all aptitudes possessed of the same opportunity politically it is all votes possessed of the same weight religiously it is all consciences possessed of the same right equality has an organ 
 gratuitous and obligatory instruction the right to the alphabet that is where the beginning must be made 
 the primary school imposed on all the secondary school offered to all that is the law 
 from an identical school an identical society will spring 
 yes instruction light light everything comes from light and to it everything returns citizens the nineteenth century is great but the twentieth century will be happy 
 then there will be nothing more like the history of old we shall no longer as have to fear a conquest an invasion a usurpation a rivalry of nations arms in hand an interruption of civilization depending on a marriage of kings on a birth in hereditary tyrannies a partition of peoples by a congress a dismemberment because of the failure of a dynasty a combat of two religions meeting face to face like two bucks in the dark on the bridge of the infinite we shall no longer have to fear famine farming out prostitution arising from distress misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the sword and battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events one might almost say 
 there will be no more events 
 we shall be happy 
 the human race will accomplish its law as the terrestrial globe accomplishes its law harmony will be between the soul and the star the soul will gravitate around the truth as the planet around the light 
 friends the present hour in which i am addressing you is a gloomy hour but these are terrible purchases of the future 
 a revolution is a toll 
 oh the human race will be delivered raised up consoled 
 we affirm it on this barrier whence should proceed that cry of love if not from the heights of sacrifice 
 oh my brothers this is the point of junction of those who think and of those who suffer this barricade is not made of nor of joists nor of bits of iron it is made of two heaps a heap of ideas and a heap of woes here misery meets the ideal 
 the day embraces the night and says to it 
 i am about to die and thou shalt be born again with me 
 from the embrace of all desolations faith leaps forth sufferings bring hither their agony and ideas their immortality this agony and this immortality are about to join and constitute our death 
 brothers he who dies here dies in the radiance of the future and we are entering a tomb all flooded with the dawn 
 enjolras paused rather than became silent his lips continued to move silently as though he were talking to himself which caused them all to gaze attentively at him in the endeavor to hear more there was no applause but they whispered together for a long time speech being a breath the rustling of intelligences resembles the rustling of leaves

 chapter ix 
 
 having put on french greatcoats and shakos petya and dolokhov rode to the clearing from which denisov had reconnoitered the french camp and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow on reaching the bottom dolokhov told the cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge petya his heart in his mouth with excitement rode by his side 
 if caught i be taken alive i have a pistol whispered he 
 talk russian said dolokhov in a hurried whisper and at that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge qui vive and the click of a musket 
 who goes there 
 the blood rushed to face and he grasped his pistol 
 lanciers du me replied dolokhov neither hastening nor slackening his pace 
 lancers of the th regiment 
 the black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge 
 mot 
 password 
 dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk 
 dites donc le colonel gerard est ici he asked 
 tell me is colonel gerard here 
 mot repeated the sentinel barring the way and not replying 
 quand un officier fait sa ronde les sentinelles ne demandent pas le mot cried dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight at the sentinel je vous demande si le colonel est ici 
 when an officer is making his round sentinels ask him for the password i am asking you if the colonel is here 
 and without waiting for an answer from the sentinel who had stepped aside dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk 
 noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road dolokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were the man a soldier with a sack over his shoulder stopped came close up to horse touched it with his hand and explained simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm as he called the house 
 having ridden up the road on both sides of which french talk could be heard around the campfires dolokhov turned into the courtyard of the house having ridden in he dismounted and approached a big blazing campfire around which sat several men talking noisily something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat lit up by the fire was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod 
 oh a hard nut to crack said one of the officers who was sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire 
 make them get a move on those fellows said another laughing 
 both fell silent peering out through the darkness at the sound of and steps as they advanced to the fire leading their horses 
 bonjour messieurs said dolokhov loudly and clearly 
 good day gentlemen 
 there was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire and one tall officer walking round the fire came up to dolokhov 
 is that you clement he asked where the devil but noticing his mistake he broke off short and with a frown greeted dolokhov as a stranger asking what he could do for him 
 dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their regiment and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew anything of the th regiment none of them knew anything and petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and dolokhov with hostility and suspicion for some seconds all were silent 
 if you were counting on the evening soup you have come too late said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh 
 dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that night 
 he handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long neck that officer did not take his eyes from dolokhov and again asked to what regiment he belonged dolokhov as if he had not heard the question did not reply but lighting a short french pipe which he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them was safe from cossacks 
 those brigands are everywhere replied an officer from behind the fire 
 dolokhov remarked that the cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such as his companion and himself but probably they would not dare to attack large detachments he added inquiringly no one replied 
 well now come away petya thought every moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk 
 but dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion how many battalions and how many prisoners asking about the russian prisoners with that detachment dolokhov said 
 a horrid business dragging these corpses about with one it would be better to shoot such rabble and burst into loud laughter so strange that petya thought the french would immediately detect their disguise and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire 
 no one replied a word to laughter and a french officer whom they could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat rose and whispered something to a companion dolokhov got up and called to the soldier who was holding their horses 
 will they bring our horses or not thought petya instinctively drawing nearer to dolokhov 
 the horses were brought 
 good evening gentlemen said dolokhov 
 petya wished to say good night but could not utter a word the officers were whispering together dolokhov was a long time mounting his horse which would not stand still then he rode out of the yard at a footpace petya rode beside him longing to look round to see whether or no the french were running after them but not daring to 
 coming out onto the road dolokhov did not ride back across the open country but through the village at one spot he stopped and listened do you hear he asked petya recognized the sound of russian voices and saw the dark figures of russian prisoners round their campfires when they had descended to the bridge petya and dolokhov rode past the sentinel who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it then they descended into the hollow where the cossacks awaited them 
 well now tell denisov at the first shot at daybreak said dolokhov and was about to ride away but petya seized hold of him 
 really he cried you are such a hero oh how fine how splendid how i love you 
 all right all right said dolokhov but petya did not let go of him and dolokhov saw through the gloom that petya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him dolokhov kissed him laughed turned his horse and vanished into the darkness

 chapter vi 
 
 marius haggard javert laconic 
 let us narrate what was passing in marius thoughts 
 let the reader recall the state of his soul 
 we have just recalled it everything was a vision to him now 
 his judgment was disturbed marius let us insist on this point was under the shadow of the great dark wings which are spread over those in the death agony he felt that he had entered the tomb it seemed to him that he was already on the other side of the wall and he no longer beheld the faces of the living except with the eyes of one dead 
 how did m fauchelevent come there 
 why was he there 
 what had he come there to do 
 marius did not address all these questions to himself 
 besides since our despair has this peculiarity that it envelops others as well as ourselves it seemed logical to him that all the world should come thither to die 
 only he thought of cosette with a pang at his heart 
 however m fauchelevent did not speak to him did not look at him and had not even the air of hearing him when marius raised his voice to say 
 i know him 
 as far as marius was concerned this attitude of m fauchelevent was comforting and if such a word can be used for such impressions we should say that it pleased him 
 he had always felt the absolute impossibility of addressing that enigmatical man who was in his eyes both equivocal and imposing 
 moreover it had been a long time since he had seen him and this still further augmented the impossibility for marius timid and reserved nature 
 the five chosen men left the barricade by way of mondetour lane they bore a perfect resemblance to members of the national guard one of them wept as he took his leave 
 before setting out they embraced those who remained 
 when the five men sent back to life had taken their departure enjolras thought of the man who had been condemned to death 
 he entered the javert still bound to the post was engaged in meditation 
 do you want anything 
 enjolras asked him 
 javert replied 
 when are you going to kill me 
 wait 
 we need all our cartridges just at present 
 then give me a drink said javert 
 enjolras himself offered him a glass of water and as javert was pinioned he helped him to drink 
 is that all inquired enjolras 
 i am uncomfortable against this post replied javert you are not tender to have left me to pass the night here bind me as you please but you surely might lay me out on a table like that other man 
 and with a motion of the head he indicated the body of m mabeuf 
 there was as the reader will remember a long broad table at the end of the room on which they had been running bullets and making cartridges 
 all the cartridges having been made and all the powder used this table was free 
 at enjolras command four insurgents unbound javert from the post while they were loosing him a fifth held a bayonet against his breast 
 leaving his arms tied behind his back they placed about his feet a slender but stout as is done to men on the point of mounting the scaffold which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches in length and made him walk to the table at the end of the room where they laid him down closely bound about the middle of the body 
 by way of further security and by means of a rope fastened to his neck they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt at escape impossible that sort of bond which is called in prisons a martingale which starting at the neck forks on the stomach and meets the hands after passing between the legs 
 while they were binding javert a man standing on the threshold was surveying him with singular attention 
 the shadow cast by this man made javert turn his head 
 he raised his eyes and recognized jean valjean 
 he did not even start but dropped his lids proudly and confined himself to the remark 
 it is perfectly simple

 book fourteen 
 chapter x 
 
 having returned to the hut petya found denisov in the passage he was awaiting return in a state of agitation anxiety and for having let him go 
 thank god he exclaimed yes thank god he repeated listening to rapturous account but devil take you i slept because of you well thank god now lie down we can still get a nap before morning 
 but no said petya i want to sleep yet besides i know myself if i fall asleep finished and then i am used to not sleeping before a battle 
 he sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day 
 then noticing that denisov was asleep he rose and went out of doors 
 it was still quite dark outside the rain was over but drops were still falling from the trees near the hut the black shapes of the cossacks shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red not all the cossacks and hussars were asleep here and there amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by could be heard low voices which seemed to be whispering 
 petya came out peered into the darkness and went up to the wagons someone was snoring under them and around them stood saddled horses munching their oats in the dark petya recognized his own horse which he called karabakh though it was of ukranian breed and went up to it 
 well karabakh do some service tomorrow said he sniffing its nostrils and kissing it 
 why you asleep sir said a cossack who was sitting under a wagon 
 no ah likhachev that your name do you know i have only just come back been into the french camp 
 and petya gave the cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but also of his object and why he considered it better to risk his life than to act just anyhow 
 well you should get some sleep now said the cossack 
 no i am used to this said petya i say the flints in your pistols worn out i brought some with me you want any you can have some 
 the cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at petya 
 because i am accustomed to doing everything accurately said petya some fellows do things just anyhow without preparation and then sorry for it afterwards i like that 
 just so said the cossack 
 oh yes another thing please my dear fellow will you sharpen my saber for me got bl petya feared to tell a lie and the saber never had been sharpened can you do it 
 of course i can 
 likhachev got up rummaged in his pack and soon petya heard the warlike sound of steel on whetstone he climbed onto the wagon and sat on its edge the cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon 
 i say are the lads asleep asked petya 
 some are and some like us 
 well and that boy 
 vesenny oh thrown himself down there in the passage fast asleep after his fright he was that glad 
 after that petya remained silent for a long time listening to the sounds he heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared 
 what are you sharpening asked a man coming up to the wagon 
 why this saber 
 right said the man whom petya took to be an hussar was the cup left here 
 there by the wheel 
 the hussar took the cup 
 it must be daylight soon said he yawning and went away 
 petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with guerrilla band less than a mile from the road sitting on a wagon captured from the french beside which horses were tethered that under it likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him that the big dark blotch to the right was the hut and the red blotch below to the left was the dying embers of a campfire that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all this he was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality the big dark blotch might really be the hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the earth perhaps the red spot was a fire or it might be the eye of an enormous monster perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower from which if he fell he would have to fall for a whole day or a whole month or go on falling and never reach the bottom perhaps it was just the cossack likhachev who was sitting under the wagon but it might be the kindest bravest most wonderful most splendid man in the world whom no one knew of it might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow but perhaps he had simply vanished disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness 
 nothing petya could have seen now would have surprised him he was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible 
 he looked up at the sky and the sky was a fairy realm like the earth it was clearing and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing and a clear black sky appeared sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high high overhead and then it seemed to sink so low that one could touch it with hand 
 eyes began to close and he swayed a little 
 the trees were dripping quiet talking was heard the horses neighed and jostled one another someone snored 
 hissed the saber against the whetstone and suddenly petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown sweetly solemn hymn petya was as musical as natasha and more so than nicholas but had never learned music or thought about it and so the melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive the music became more and more audible the melody grew and passed from one instrument to another and what was played was a fugue though petya had not the least conception of what a fugue is each instrument now resembling a violin and now a horn but better and clearer than violin or horn played its own part and before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the same air and then with a third and a fourth and they all blended into one and again became separate and again blended now into solemn church music now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant 
 oh why that was in a dream petya said to himself as he lurched forward in my ears but perhaps music of my own well go on my music now 
 he closed his eyes and from all sides as if from a distance sounds fluttered grew into harmonies separated blended and again all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn oh this is delightful as much as i like and as i like said petya to himself he tried to conduct that enormous orchestra 
 now softly softly die away and the sounds obeyed him now fuller more joyful still more and more joyful and from an unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds now voices join in ordered petya and at first from afar he heard voices and then the voices grew in harmonious triumphant strength and petya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe and joy 
 with a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song the drip from the trees and the hissing of the saber and again the horses jostled one another and neighed not disturbing the choir but joining in it 
 petya did not know how long this lasted he enjoyed himself all the time wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to share it he was awakened by kindly voice 
 ready your honor you can split a frenchman in half with it 
 petya woke up 
 getting light really getting light he exclaimed 
 the horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their very tails and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches petya shook himself jumped up took a ruble from his pocket and gave it to likhachev then he flourished the saber tested it and sheathed it the cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle girths 
 and the commander said likhachev 
 denisov came out of the hut and having called petya gave orders to get ready

 book war between four walls 
 chapter vii 
 
 the situation becomes aggravated 
 the daylight was increasing rapidly 
 not a window was opened not a door stood ajar it was the dawn but not the awaking the end of the rue de la chanvrerie opposite the barricade had been evacuated by the troops as we have stated it seemed to be free and presented itself to with a sinister tranquillity the rue was as dumb as the avenue of sphinxes at thebes not a living being in the which gleamed white in the light of the sun 
 nothing is so mournful as this light in deserted streets nothing was to be seen but there was something to be heard a mysterious movement was going on at a certain distance it was evident that the critical moment was approaching 
 as on the previous evening the sentinels had come in but this time all had come 
 the barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack since the departure of the five they had increased its height still further 
 on the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of the halles enjolras for fear of a surprise in the rear came to a serious decision 
 he had the small gut of the mondetour lane which had been left open up to that time barricaded 
 for this purpose they tore up the pavement for the length of several houses more in this manner the barricade walled on three streets in front on the rue de la chanvrerie to the left on the rues du cygne and de la petite truanderie to the right on the rue mondetour was really almost impregnable it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there it had three fronts but no fortress but a rat hole too said courfeyrac with a laugh 
 enjolras had about thirty torn up in excess said bossuet piled up near the door of the 
 the silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack must needs come that enjolras had each man resume his post of battle 
 an allowance of brandy was doled out to each 
 nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault each man selects his place as though at the theatre 
 they jostle and elbow and crowd each other 
 there are some who make stalls of here is a corner of the wall which is in the way it is removed here is a redan which may afford protection they take shelter behind it 
 men are precious they take the places that are inconvenient to the rest 
 many arrange to fight in a sitting posture 
 they wish to be at ease to kill and to die comfortably 
 in the sad war of june an insurgent who was a formidable marksman and who was firing from the top of a terrace upon a roof had a brought there for his use a charge of found him out there 
 as soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks for action all disorderly movements cease there is no more pulling from one another there are no more coteries no more asides there is no more holding aloof everything in their spirits converges in and changes into a waiting for the assailants 
 a barricade before the arrival of danger is chaos in danger it is discipline itself peril produces order 
 as soon as enjolras had seized his rifle and had placed himself in a sort of embrasure which he had reserved for himself all the rest held their peace 
 a series of faint sharp noises resounded confusedly along the wall of it was the men cocking their guns 
 moreover their attitudes were prouder more confident than ever the excess of sacrifice strengthens they no longer cherished any hope but they had despair last weapon which sometimes gives victory virgil has said so 
 supreme resources spring from extreme resolutions 
 to embark in death is sometimes the means of escaping a shipwreck and the lid of the coffin becomes a plank of safety 
 as on the preceding evening the attention of all was directed we might almost say leaned upon the end of the street now lighted up and visible 
 they had not long to wait 
 a stir began distinctly in the quarter but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack a clashing of chains the uneasy jolting of a mass the click of brass skipping along the pavement a sort of solemn uproar announced that some sinister construction of iron was approaching there arose a tremor in the bosoms of these peaceful old streets pierced and built for the fertile circulation of interests and ideas and which are not made for the horrible rumble of the wheels of war 
 the fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity of the street became ferocious 
 a cannon made its appearance 
 were pushing the piece it was in firing trim the had been detached two upheld the four were at the wheels others followed with the caisson they could see the smoke of the burning 
 fire shouted enjolras 
 the whole barricade fired the report was terrible an avalanche of smoke covered and effaced both cannon and men after a few seconds the cloud dispersed and the cannon and men the had just finished rolling it slowly correctly without haste into position facing the barricade 
 not one of them had been struck then the captain of the piece bearing down upon the breech in order to raise the muzzle began to point the cannon with the gravity of an astronomer levelling a telescope 
 bravo for the cannoneers cried bossuet 
 and the whole barricade clapped their hands 
 a moment later squarely planted in the very middle of the street astride of the gutter the piece was ready for action 
 a formidable pair of jaws yawned on the barricade 
 come merrily now ejaculated courfeyrac 
 the brutal part of it 
 after the fillip on the nose the blow from the fist the army is reaching out its big paw to us 
 the barricade is going to be severely shaken up 
 the fusillade tries the cannon takes 
 it is a piece of eight new model brass added combeferre those pieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten parts of tin to one hundred of brass is exceeded 
 the excess of tin renders them too tender 
 then it comes to pass that they have caves and chambers when looked at from the vent hole 
 in order to obviate this danger and to render it possible to force the charge it may become necessary to return to the process of the fourteenth century hooping and to encircle the piece on the outside with a series of unwelded steel bands from the breech to the trunnions in the meantime they remedy this defect as best they may they manage to discover where the holes are located in the vent of a cannon by means of a searcher 
 but there is a better method with movable star 
 in the sixteenth century remarked bossuet they used to rifle cannon 
 yes replied combeferre that augments the projectile force but diminishes the accuracy of the firing 
 in firing at short range the trajectory is not as rigid as could be desired the parabola is exaggerated the line of the projectile is no longer sufficiently rectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects which is nevertheless a necessity of battle the importance of which increases with the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge this defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the rifled cannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charge small charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic necessities such for instance as the preservation of the in short that despot the cannon cannot do all that it desires force is a great weakness 
 a only travels six hundred leagues an hour light travels seventy thousand leagues a second 
 such is the superiority of jesus christ over napoleon 
 reload your guns said enjolras 
 how was the casing of the barricade going to behave under the would they effect a breach 
 that was the question while the insurgents were reloading their guns the were loading the cannon 
 the anxiety in the redoubt was profound 
 the shot sped the report burst forth 
 present shouted a joyous voice 
 and gavroche flung himself into the barricade just as the ball dashed against it 
 he came from the direction of the rue du cygne and he had nimbly climbed over the auxiliary barricade which fronted on the labyrinth of the rue de la petite truanderie 
 gavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than the 
 the ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish 
 at the most there was an omnibus wheel broken and the old anceau cart was demolished on seeing this the barricade burst into a laugh 
 go on shouted bossuet to the artillerists

 book fourteen 
 chapter xi 
 
 the men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness tightened their saddle girths and formed companies denisov stood by the hut giving final orders the infantry of the detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early dawn hundreds of feet splashing through the mud the esaul gave some orders to his men petya held his horse by the bridle impatiently awaiting the order to mount his face having been bathed in cold water was all aglow and his eyes were particularly brilliant cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically 
 well is weady asked denisov bwing the horses 
 the horses were brought denisov was angry with the cossack because the saddle girths were too slack reproved him and mounted petya put his foot in the stirrup his horse by habit made as if to nip his leg but petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him rode up to denisov 
 vasili dmitrich entrust me with some commission please for sake said he 
 denisov seemed to have forgotten very existence he turned to glance at him 
 i ask one thing of you he said sternly to obey me and not shove yourself forward anywhere 
 he did not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the way when they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing light over the field denisov talked in whispers with the esaul and the cossacks rode past petya and denisov when they had all ridden by denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill slipping onto their haunches and sliding the horses descended with their riders into the ravine petya rode beside denisov the pulsation of his body constantly increasing it was getting lighter and lighter but the mist still hid distant objects having reached the valley denisov looked back and nodded to a cossack beside him 
 the signal said he 
 the cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out in an instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard shouts came from various sides and then more shots 
 at the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting petya lashed his horse and loosening his rein galloped forward not heeding denisov who shouted at him it seemed to petya that at the moment the shot was fired it suddenly became as bright as noon he galloped to the bridge cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him on the bridge he collided with a cossack who had fallen behind but he galloped on in front of him soldiers probably frenchmen were running from right to left across the road one of them fell in the mud under his feet 
 cossacks were crowding about a hut busy with something from the midst of that crowd terrible screams arose petya galloped up and the first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchman clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him 
 hurrah lads ours shouted petya and giving rein to his excited horse he galloped forward along the village street 
 he could hear shooting ahead of him cossacks hussars and ragged russian prisoners who had come running from both sides of the road were shouting something loudly and incoherently a frenchman in a blue overcoat capless and with a frowning red face had been defending himself against the hussars when petya galloped up the frenchman had already fallen too late again flashed through mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be heard the shots came from the yard of the house he had visited the night before with dolokhov the french were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the cossacks who crowded at the gateway through the smoke as he approached the gate petya saw dolokhov whose face was of a tint shouting to his men go round wait for the infantry he exclaimed as petya rode up to him 
 wait shouted petya and without pausing a moment galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the smoke was thickest 
 a volley was heard and some bullets whistled past while others plashed against something the cossacks and dolokhov galloped after petya into the gateway of the courtyard in the dense wavering smoke some of the french threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the cossacks while others ran down the hill toward the pond petya was galloping along the courtyard but instead of holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and strangely slipping farther and farther to one side in his saddle his horse having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the morning light stopped suddenly and petya fell heavily on to the wet ground the cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless a bullet had pierced his skull 
 after speaking to the senior french officer who came out of the house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that they surrendered dolokhov dismounted and went up to petya who lay motionless with outstretched arms 
 done for he said with a frown and went to the gate to meet denisov who was riding toward him 
 killed cried denisov recognizing from a distance the unmistakably lifeless attitude very familiar to him in which body was lying 
 done for repeated dolokhov as if the utterance of these words afforded him pleasure and he went quickly up to the prisoners who were surrounded by cossacks who had hurried up we take them he called out to denisov 
 denisov did not reply he rode up to petya dismounted and with trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained face which had already gone white 
 i am used to something sweet raisins fine ones take them all he recalled words and the cossacks looked round in surprise at the sound like the yelp of a dog with which denisov turned away walked to the wattle fence and seized hold of it 
 among the russian prisoners rescued by denisov and dolokhov was pierre bezukhov

 of regiment of health 
 there is a wisdom in this beyond the rules of physic a own observation what he finds good of and what he finds hurt of is the best physic to preserve health 
 
 but it is a safer conclusion to say this agreeth not well with me therefore i will 
 not continue it than this i fmd no offence of this therefore i may use it for 
 strength of nature in youth passeth over many excesses which are owing a man till 
 his age discern of the coming on of years and think not to do the same things still for age will not be defied beware of sudden change in any great point of diet and if necessity enforce it fit the rest to it for it is a secret both in nature and 
 state that it is safer to change many things than one examine thy customs of diet 
 sleep exercise apparel and the like and try in anything thou shall judge hurtful 
 to discontinue it by little and little but so as if thou doest fmd any inconvenience 
 by the change thou come back to it again for it is hard to distinguish that which 
 is generally held good and wholesome from that which is good particularly and 
 fit for thine own body 
 to be free minded and cheerfully disposed at hours of meat and of sleep and of exercise is one of the best precepts of long lasting as for the passions and studies of the mind avoid envy anxious fears anger fretting inwards subtle and knotty inquisitions joys and exhilarations in excess sadness not communicated entertain hopes mirth rather than joy variety of delights rather than surfeit of them wonder and admiration and therefore novelties studies that fill the mind with splendid and illustrious objects as histories fables and contemplations of nature if you fly physic in health altogether it will be too strange for your body when you shall need it if you make it too familiar it will work no extraordinary effect when sickness cometh i commend rather some diet for certain seasons than frequent use of physic except it be grown into a custom 
 for those diets alter the body more and trouble it less despise no new accident in your body but ask opinion of it in sickness respect health principally and in health action 
 for those that put their bodies to endure in health may in most sickness 
 which are not very sharp be cured only with diet and tendering celsus could never have spoken it as a physician had he not been a wise man withal when he giveth it for one of the great precepts of health and lasting that a man do vary and interchange contraries but with an inclination to the more benign extreme use fasting and full eating but rather full eating watching and sleep but rather sleep 
 sitting and exercise but rather exercise and the like 
 so shall nature be cherished and yet taught masteries physicians are some of them so pleasing and conformable to the humour of the patient as they press not the true cure of the disease and some other are so regular in proceeding according to art for the disease as they respect not sufficiently the condition of the patient take one of a middle temper or if it may not be found in one man combine two of either sort and forget not to call as well the best acquainted with your body as the best reputed of for his faculty

 book the year 
 chapter ii 
 
 a double quartette 
 these parisians came one from toulouse another from limoges the third from cahors and the fourth from montauban but they were students and when one says student one says study in paris is to be born in paris 
 these young men were insignificant every one has seen such faces four specimens of humanity taken at random neither good nor bad neither wise nor ignorant neither geniuses nor fools handsome with that charming april which is called twenty years 
 they were four oscars for at that epoch arthurs did not yet for him the perfumes of araby exclaimed advances 
 oscar i shall behold him 
 people had just emerged from ossian elegance was scandinavian and caledonian the pure english style was only to prevail later and the first of the arthurs wellington had but just won the battle of waterloo 
 these oscars bore the names one of felix tholomyes of toulouse the second listolier of cahors the next fameuil of limoges the last blachevelle of montauban 
 naturally each of them had his mistress 
 blachevelle loved favourite so named because she had been in england listolier adored dahlia who had taken for her nickname the name of a flower fameuil idolized zephine an abridgment of josephine tholomyes had fantine called the blonde because of her beautiful sunny hair 
 favourite dahlia zephine and fantine were four ravishing young women perfumed and radiant still a little like and not yet entirely divorced from their needles somewhat disturbed by intrigues but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fall in woman 
 one of the four was called the young because she was the youngest of them and one was called the old the old one was not to conceal anything the three first were more experienced more heedless and more emancipated into the tumult of life than fantine the blonde who was still in her first illusions 
 dahlia zephine and especially favourite could not have said as had already been more than one episode in their romance though hardly begun and the lover who had borne the name of adolph in the first chapter had turned out to be alphonse in the second and gustave in the third 
 poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors one scolds and the other flatters and the beautiful daughters of the people have both of them whispering in their ear each on its own side 
 these badly guarded souls listen 
 hence the falls which they accomplish and the stones which are thrown at are overwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible 
 alas what if the jungfrau were hungry 
 favourite having been in england was admired by dahlia and had had an establishment of her own very early in father was an old unmarried professor of mathematics a brutal man and a braggart who went out to give lessons in spite of his professor when he was a young man had one day seen a gown catch on a fender he had fallen in love in consequence of this accident 
 the result had been favourite 
 she met her father from time to time and he bowed to her 
 one morning an old woman with the air of a devotee had entered her apartments and had said to her you do not know me mamemoiselle 
 no i am your the old woman opened the sideboard and ate and drank had a mattress which she owned brought in and installed cross and pious old mother never spoke to favourite remained hours without uttering a word breakfasted dined and supped for four and went down to the quarters for company where she spoke ill of her daughter 
 it was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn dahlia to listolier to others perhaps to idleness 
 how could she make such nails work 
 she who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands 
 as for zephine she had conquered fameuil by her roguish and caressing little way of saying yes sir 
 the young men were comrades the young girls were loves are always accompanied by such friendships 
 goodness and philosophy are two distinct things the proof of this is that after making all due allowances for these little irregular households favourite zephine and dahlia were philosophical young women while fantine was a good girl 
 good some one will exclaim and tholomyes 
 solomon would reply that love forms a part of wisdom 
 we will confine ourselves to saying that the love of fantine was a first love a sole love a faithful love 
 she alone of all the four was not called thou by a single one of them 
 fantine was one of those beings who blossom so to speak from the dregs of the people 
 though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths of social shadow she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the unknown 
 she was born at m sur m of what parents 
 who can say 
 she had never known father or was called fantine 
 why fantine 
 she had never borne any other name 
 at the epoch of her birth the directory still had no family name she had no family no baptismal name the church no longer existed 
 she bore the name which pleased the first random who had encountered her when a very small child running in the street 
 she received the name as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it was called little fantine 
 no one knew more than that 
 this human creature had entered life in just this way 
 at the age of ten fantine quitted the town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood 
 at fifteen she came to paris to seek her was beautiful and remained pure as long as she was a lovely blonde with fine teeth 
 she had gold and pearls for her dowry but her gold was on her head and her pearls were in her mouth 
 she worked for her living then still for the sake of her living for the heart also has its loved 
 she loved tholomyes 
 an amour for him passion for her 
 the streets of the latin quarter filled with throngs of students and grisettes saw the beginning of their dream 
 fantine had long evaded tholomyes in the mazes of the hill of the pantheon where so many adventurers twine and untwine but in such a way as constantly to encounter him is a way of avoiding which resembles seeking 
 in short the eclogue took place 
 blachevelle listolier and fameuil formed a sort of group of which tholomyes was the head 
 it was he who possessed the wit 
 tholomyes was the antique old student he was rich he had an income of four thousand francs four thousand francs a splendid scandal on mount tholomyes was a fast man of thirty and badly preserved 
 he was wrinkled and toothless and he had the beginning of a bald spot of which he himself said with sadness the skull at thirty the knee at forty 
 his digestion was mediocre and he had been attacked by a watering in one eye 
 but in proportion as his youth disappeared gayety was kindled he replaced his teeth with buffooneries his hair with mirth his health with irony his weeping eye laughed incessantly 
 he was dilapidated but still in youth which was packing up for departure long before its time beat a retreat in good order bursting with laughter and no one saw anything but fire 
 he had had a piece rejected at the made a few verses now and then 
 in addition to this he doubted everything to the last degree which is a vast force in the eyes of the weak 
 being thus ironical and bald he was the is an english word 
 is it possible that irony is derived from it 
 one day tholomyes took the three others aside with the gesture of an oracle and said to them 
 fantine dahlia zephine and favourite have been teasing us for nearly a year to give them a surprise 
 we have promised them solemnly that we would 
 they are forever talking about it to us to me in particular just as the old women in naples cry to saint januarius faccia gialluta fa o miracolo yellow face perform thy miracle so our beauties say to me incessantly tholomyes when will you bring forth your surprise 
 at the same time our parents keep writing to on both sides 
 the moment has arrived it seems to me let us discuss the question 
 thereupon tholomyes lowered his voice and articulated something so mirthful that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four mouths simultaneously and blachevelle exclaimed that is an idea 
 a smoky presented itself they entered and the remainder of their confidential colloquy was lost in shadow 
 the result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which took place on the following sunday the four young men inviting the four young girls

 return of the jedi 
 i 
 
 outside the small adobe hut the sandstorm wailed like a beast in agony refusing todie inside the sounds were muted 
 it was cooler in this shelter more hushed and darker while the beast withouthowled in this place of nuance and shadow a shrouded figure worked 
 tanned hands holding arcane tools extended from the sleeves of a caftanlikerobe the figure crouched on the ground working before him lay a discoiddevice of strange design wires trailing from it at one end symbols etched into its flatsurface he connected the wires end to a tubular smooth handle pulled through connector locked it in place with another tool he motioned to ashadow in the corner the shadow moved toward him 
 tentatively the obscure form rolled closer to the robed figure the little r unit questioned timidly as it approached pausing when it wasjust a foot from the shrouded man with the strange device 
 the shrouded man motioned the droid nearer still scooted the lastdistance blinking and the hands raised toward his domed little head 
 the fine sand blew hard over the dunes of tatooine the wind seemed to comefrom everywhere at once typhooning in spots swirling in here hoveringin stillness there without pattern or meaning 
 a road wound across the desert plain it nature changed constantly at onemoment obscured by drifts of ochre sand the next moment swept clean or distortedby the heat of the shimmering air above it a road more ephemeral than a road to be followed all the same for it was the only way to reach the palaceof jabba the hut 
 jabba was the vilest gangster in the galaxy he had his fingers in murder his minions scattered across the stars he both collected andinvented atrocities and his court was a den of unparalleled decay it was said bysome that jabba had chosen tatooine as his place of residence because only in thisarid crucible of a planet could he hope to keep his soul from rotting the parched sun might bake his humor to festering brine 
 in any case it was a place few of kind spirit even knew of let alone was a place of evil where even the most courageous felt their powers wilt under thefoul gaze of corruption 
 bedoo gung ooble deep vocalized 
 of course worried fussed and you should be too poorlando calrissian never returned from this place can you imagine what to him 
 artoo whistled timidly 
 the golden droid waded stiffly through a shifting sand hill then stopped short palace suddenly loomed suddenly dark in the near distance artoo almostbumped into him quickly skidding to the side of the road 
 watch where going artoo resumed walking but moreslowly his little friend rolling along at his side and as they went he chattered chewbacca have delivered this message no whenever animpossible mission they turn to us no one worries about droids sometimes iwonder why we put up with it all 
 on and on he rambled over the desolate final stretch of road until at last theyreached the gates to the palace massive iron doors taller than threepio of a series of stone and iron walls forming several gigantic cylindricaltowers that seemed to rise out of a mountain of packed sand 
 the two droids fearfully looked around the ominous door for signs of life orwelcome or some sort of signaling device with which to make their presence nothing in any of those categories mustered his resolve whichfunction had been programmed into him quite a long time earlier knocked softlythree times on the thick metal gate then quickly turned around and announced toartoo there seem to be anyone here go back and tell master luke 
 suddenly a small hatch opened in the center of the door a spindly mechanicalarm popped out affixed to which a large electronic eyeball peered unabashedly at thetwo droids the eyeball spoke 
 tee chuta hhat yudd 
 threepio stood erect proud though his circuits quivered a bit he faced the to artoo and then to himself artoo detoowha bo seethreepoiosha eytoota odd mischka jabba du hutt 
 the eye looked quickly from one robot to the other then retracted back throughthe little window and slammed the hatch shut 
 ganoong whispered artoo with concern 
 threepio nodded i think going to let us in artoo bettergo he turned to leave as artoo beeped a reluctant 
 at that a horrific grinding screech erupted and the massive iron door slowlybegan to rise the two droids looked at each other skeptically and then into theyawning black cavity that faced them they waited afraid to enter afraid to retreat 
 from the shadow the strange voice of the eye screamed at them nudd chaa 
 artoo beeped and rolled forward into the gloom threepio hesitated thenrushed after his stubby companion with a start artoo wait for me they stoppedtogether in a gaping passageway as threepio scolded get lost 
 the great door slammed shut behind them with a monumental crash that echoedthrough the dark cavern for a moment the two frightened robots stood therewithout moving then haltingly they stepped forward 
 they were immediately joined by three large gamorrean brutes whose racial hatred of robots was well known the guards usheredthe two droids down the dark corridor without so much as a nod when they reachedthe first hallway one of them grunted an order artoo beeped a nervousquery at threepio 
 you want to know the golden droid responded apprehensively justdeliver master message and get us out of here quick 
 before they could take another step a form approached them from the obscurityof a bib fortuna the inelegant of degeneratecourt he was a tall humanoid creature with eyes that saw only what was a robot that hid all protruding from the back of his skull were two appendages that exhibited prehensile sensual and cognitive functions atvarious he wore either draped over his shoulders for decorative effector when the situation called for balance hanging straight down behind him as if theywere twin tails 
 he smiled thinly as he stopped before the two robots die wanna wanga 
 threepio spoke up officially die wanna wanga we bring a message to yourmaster jabba the hutt artoo beeped a postscript upon which threepio noddedand added and a gift he thought about this a moment looked as puzzled as itwas possible for a droid to look and whispered loudly to artoo gift what gift 
 bib shook his head emphatically nee jabba no badda me chaade sugoodie he held out his hand toward artoo 
 the small droid backed up meekly but his protest was lengthy bdooo eengwrrr op dboodeeop 
 artoo give it to him threepio insisted sometimes artoo could be sobinary 
 at this though artoo became positively defiant beeping and tooting at fortunaand threepio as if both had their programs erased 
 threepio nodded finally hardly happy with answer he smiledapologetically at bib he says our instructions are to give it only to jabbahimself bib considered the problem a moment as threepio went on terribly sorry afraid ever so stubborn about these things hemanaged to throw a disparaging yet loving tone into his voice as he tilted his headtoward his small associate 
 bib gestured for them to follow nudd chaa he walked back into thedarkness the droids following close behind the three gamorrean guards lumberingalong at the rear 
 as descended into the belly of the shadow he muttered quietly tothe silent r unit artoo i have a bad feeling about this 
 and stood at the entrance of the throne room lookingin doomed whimpered threepio wishing for the thousandth time that hecould close his eyes 
 the room was filled wall to cavernous wall with the animate dregs of theuniverse grotesque creatures from the lowest star systems drunk on spiced liquorand their own fetid vapors gamorreans twisted humans reveling inbase pleasures or raucously comparing mean feats and at the front of the on a dais that overlooked the debauchery was jabba the hutt 
 his head was three times human size perhaps four his eyes were skin was like a as well except covered with a fine layer ofgrease he had no neck but only a series of chins that expanded finally into a greatbloated body engorged to bursting with stolen morsels stunted almost uselessarms sprouted from his upper torso the sticky fingers of his left hand languidlywrapped around the of his he had no had fallenout from a combination of diseases he had no trunk simply taperedgradually to a long plump that stretched along the length of the platformlike a tube of yeasty dough his lipless mouth was wide almost ear to ear and hedrooled continuously he was quite thoroughly disgusting 
 chained to him chained at the neck was a sad pretty a member species with two dry shapely tentacles sprouting from the back of her suggestively down her bare muscled back her name was oola lookingforlorn she sat as far away as her chain would allow at the other end of the dais 
 and sitting near belly was a small monkeylike reptile named salaciouscrumb who caught all the food and ooze that spilled out of hands or mouthand ate it with a nauseating cackle 
 shafts of light from above partially illuminated the drunken courtiers as bibfortuna crossed the floor to the dais the room was composed of an endless seriesof alcoves within alcoves so that much of what went on was in any case visible onlyas shadow and movement when fortuna reached the throne he delicately leanedforward and whispered into the slobbering ear eyes becameslitsthen with a maniacal laugh he motioned for the two terrified droids to bebrought in 
 bo shuda wheezed the hutt and lapsed into a fit of coughing although heunderstood several languages as a point of honor he only spoke huttese his onlysuch point 
 the quaking robots scooted forward to stand before the repulsive ruler thoughhe grossly violated their most deeply programmed sensibilities the the message threepio urged 
 artoo whistled once and a beam of light projected from his domed a hologram of luke skywalker that stood before them on the floor quicklythe image grew to over ten feet tall until the young jedi warrior towered over theassembled throng al at once the room grew quiet as giant presence madeitself felt 
 greetings exalted one the hologram said to jabba allow me to introducemyself i am luke skywalker jedi knight and friend of captain solo i seek anaudience with your greatness to bargain for his life at this the entire room burstinto laughter which jabba instantly stopped with a hand motion luke pauselong i know that you are powerful mighty jabba and that your anger with solomust be equally powerful but sure we can work out an arrangement which willbe mutually beneficial as a token of my good will i present to you a droids 
 threepio jumped back as if stung what what did he said 
 luke continued both are hardworking and will serve you will with hologram disappeared 
 threepio wagged his head in despair oh no this be artoo you musthave played the wrong message jabba laughed and drooled 
 bib spoke in huttese bargain rather than fight he is no jedi 
 jabba nodded in agreement still grinning he rasped at threepio there willbe no bargain i have no intention of giving up my favorite decoration with ahideous chuckle he looked toward the dimly lit alcove beside the throne flat against the wall was the carbonized form of han solo his face andhands emerging out of the cold hard slab like a statue reaching from a sea of stone 
 artoo and threepio marched dismally through the dank passageway at theprodding of a gamorrean guard dungeon cells lined both walls the unspeakablecries of anguish that emanated from within as the droids passed echoed off the stoneand down the endless catacombs periodically a hand or claw or tentacle wouldreach through the bars of a door to grab at the hapless robots 
 artoo beeped pitifully threepio only shook his head what could havepossibly come over master luke was it something i did he never expressed anyunhappiness with my work 
 they approached a door at the end of the corridor it slid open the gamorrean shoved them forward inside their ears were assaulted bydeafening machine creaking slamming a continuously shifting haze of steam made visibility short thiswas either the boiler room or programmed hell 
 an agonized electronic scream like the sound of stripping gears drew theirattention to the corner of the room from out of the mist walked a thinhumanlike robot with some disturbingly human appetites in the dimness behindninedenine threepio could see the legs being pulled off a droid on a torture a second droid hanging upside down was having irons applied to itsfeet it had emitted the electronic scream threepio heard a few moments earlier as thesensor circuits in its metal skin melted in agony threepio cringed at the sound hisown wiring sympathetically crackling with static electricity 
 ninedenine stopped in front of threepio raising her pincer hands new acquisitions she said with great satisfaction i am of cyborg operations a protocol droid you 
 i am re 
 yes or no will do ninedenine said icily 
 well yes threepio replied this robot was going to be trouble that muchwas of those droids who always had to prove she 
 how many languages do you speak ninedenine continued 
 well two can play that game thought threepio he ran his most introductory tape i am fluent in over six million forms of can 
 splendid ninedenine interrupted gleefully we have been without aninterpreter since the master got angry with something our last protocol droid said anddisintegrated him 
 disintegrated threepio wailed any semblance of protocol left him 
 ninedenine spoke to a pig guard who suddenly appeared this one will bequite useful fit him with a restraining bolt then take him back up to the mainaudience chamber 
 the guard grunted and roughly shoved threepio toward the door 
 artoo leave me threepio called out but the guard grabbed him andpulled him away and he was gone 
 artoo let out a long plaintive cry as threepio was removed then he turned toninedenine and beeped in outrage and at length 
 ninedenine laughed a feisty little one but soon learn somerespect i have need for you on the sail barge several of our astrodroidshave been disappearing for spare parts most likely i think in nicely 
 the droid on the torture rack emitted a wail then sparked brieflyand was silent 
 the court of jabba the hutt roiled in malignant ecstasy oola the beautifulcreature chained to jabba danced in the center of the floor as the inebriated monsterscheered and heckled threepio hovered warily near the back of the throne trying tokeep the lowest profile possible periodically he had to duck to avoid a fruit hurledin his direction or to sidestep a rolling body mostly he just stayed low what elsewas a protocol droid to do in a place of so little protocol 
 jabba leered through the smoke of his hooka and beckoned the creature oola tocome sit beside him she stopped dancing instantly a fearful look in her eye andbacked up shaking her head apparently she had suffered such invitations before 
 jabba became angry he pointed unmistakably to a spot beside him on the eitha he growled 
 oola shook her head more violently her face a mask of terror na chubanegatorie na na natoota 
 jabba became livid furiously he motioned to oola boscka 
 jabba pushed a button as he released chain before she could flee agrating trap door in the floor dropped open and she tumbled into the pit below thedoor snapped shut instantly a moment of silence followed by a low rumbling by a terrified shriek was followed once more by silence 
 jabba laughed until he slobbered a dozen revelers hurried over to peerthrough the grate to observe the demise of the nubile dancer 
 threepio shrank even lower and looked for support to the carbonite form of hansolo suspended in bas relief above the floor now there was a human without asense of protocol thought threepio wistfully 
 his reverie was interrupted by an unnatural quiet that suddenly fell over theroom he looked up to see bib fortuna making his way through the by two gamorrean guards and followed by a bounty hunter who led his captive prize on a leash wookiee 
 threepio gasped stunned oh no chewbacca the future was lookingvery bleak indeed 
 bib muttered a few words into ear pointing to the bounty hunter and hiscaptive jabba listened intently the bounty hunter was humanoid small and belt of cartridges was slung across his jerkin and an in his gavethe impression of his being able to see through things he bowed low then spoke influent ubese greeting majestic one i am boushh it was a metalliclanguage to the rarefied atmosphere of the home planet from which thisnomadic species arose 
 jabba answered in the same tongue though his ubese was stilted and slow atlast someone has brought me the mighty chewbacca he tried to continue butstuttered on the word he wanted with a roaring laugh he turned toward my talkdroid he boomed motioning threepio to come the courtly robot obeyed 
 jabba ordered him congenially welcome our mercenary friend and ask hisprice for the wookiee 
 threepio translated the message to the bounty hunter boushh listened studying the feral creatures around the room possible exits possiblehostages vulnerable points he particularly noticed boba near mercenary who had caught han solo 
 boushh assessed this all in a moment then spoke evenly in his nativetongue to threepio i will take fifty thousand no less 
 threepio quietly translated for jabba who immediately became enraged andknocked the golden droid off the raised throne with a sweep of his massive clattered in a heap on the floor where he rested momentarily uncertain ofthe correct protocol in this situation 
 jabba raved on in guttural huttese boushh shifted his weapon to a more usableposition threepio sighed struggled back onto the throne composed himself andtranslated for jabba was saying 
 thousand is all pay threepio instructed 
 jabba motioned his pig guards to take chewbacca as two jawas covered fett also raised his weapon jabba added to translation twentyfive thousand plus his life 
 threepio translated the room was silent tense uncertain finally boushhspoke softly to threepio 
 tell that swollen garbage bag have to do better than that or bepicking his smelly hide out of every crack in this room holding a thermaldetonator 
 threepio suddenly focused on the small silver ball boushh held partiallyconcealed in his left hand it could be heard humming a quiet ominous looked nervously at jabba then back at boushh 
 jabba barked at the droid well what did he say 
 threepio cleared his throat your grandness he uhhe 
 out with it droid jabba roared 
 oh dear threepio fretted he inwardly prepared himself for the worst thenspoke to jabba in flawless huttese boushh respectfully disagrees with yourexaltedness and begs you to reconsider the amountor he will release the thermaldetonator he is holding 
 instantly a disturbed murmuring circled in the room everyone backed upseveral feet as if that would help jabba stared at the ball clenched in the hand it was beginning to glow another tense hush came over theonlookers 
 jabba stared malevolently at the bounty hunter for several long seconds a satisfied grin crept over his vast ugly mouth from the bilious pit of hisbelly a laugh rose like gas in a mire this bounty hunter is my kind of and inventive tell him no warn him not to press hisluck 
 threepio felt greatly relieved by this turn of events he translated for studied the bounty hunter closely for his reaction guns were readied 
 then boushh released a switch on the thermal detonator and it went he nodded 
 he agrees threepio said to jabba 
 the crowd cheered jabba relaxed come my friend join our celebration imay find other work for you threepio translated as the party resumed in thedepraved revelry 
 chewbacca growled under his breath as he was led away by the might have cracked their heads just for being so ugly or to remind everyonepresent what a wookiee was made near the door he spotted a familiar behind a of teeth was a human in the uniform of a calrissian chewbacca gave no sign of recognition nor did he resistthe guard who now escorted him from the room 
 lando had managed to infiltrate this nest of maggots earlier to see if itwas possible to free solo from imprisonment done this for severalreasons 
 first because he felt correctly that it was his fault han was in this he wanted to make of course he could do so without gettinghurt blending in here like just one of the pirates was no problem for identity was a way of life with him 
 second he wanted to join forces with buddies at the top of the rebelalliance they were out to beat the empire and he wanted nothing more in his lifenow than to do just that the imperial police had moved in on his action once toooften so this was a grudge match now besides lando liked being part of since they seemed to be right up at the business end of all the action againstthe empire 
 third princess leia had asked him to help and he just never could refuse aprincess asking for help besides you never knew how she might thank you someday 
 finally lando would have bet anything that han simply could not be rescuedfrom this lando just plain resist a bet 
 so he spent his days watching a lot watching and calculating what hedid now as chewie was led watched and then he faded into the stonework 
 the band started playing led by a blue named max flooded the floor the courtiers hooted and brewed their brains a bit more 
 boushh leaned against a column surveying the scene his gaze swept coollyover the court taking in the dancers the smokers the rollers the gamblersuntil itcame to rest squarely on an equally unflappable stare from across the room bobafett was watching him 
 boushh shifted slightly posturing with his weapon cradled like a loving fett remained motionless an arrogant sneer all but visible behind his ominousmask 
 pig guards led chewbacca though the unlit dungeon corridor a tentacle coiledout one of the doors to touch the brooding wookiee 
 rheeaaahhr he screamed and the tentacle shot back into its cell 
 the next door was open before chewie fully realized what was happening hewas hurled forcefully into the cell by all the guards the door slammed shut lockinghim in darkness 
 he raised his head and let out a long pitiful howl that carried through the entiremountain of iron and sand up to the infinitely patient sky 
 the throne room was quiet dark and empty as right filled its littered wine and saliva stained the floor shreds of tattered clothing hung from thefixtures unconscious bodies curled under broken furniture the party was over 
 a dark figure moved silently among the shadows pausing behind a column statue there he made his way stealthily along the perimeter of the room steppingonce over a snoring yak face he never made a sound this was boushh thebounty hunter 
 he reached the curtained alcove beside which the slab that was han solo hungsuspended by a force field on the wall boushh looked around furtively then flippeda switch near the side of the carbonite coffin the humming of the force field wounddown and the heavy monolith slowly lowered to the floor 
 boushh stepped up and studied the frozen face of the space pirate he carbonized cheek curiously as if it were a rare precious stone cold andhard as diamond 
 for a few seconds he examined the controls at the side of the slab then activateda series of switches finally after one last hesitant glance at the living statue beforehim he slid the decarbonization lever into place 
 the casing began to emit in a sound anxiously boushh peered allaround again making certain no one heard slowly the hard shell that was coveringthe contours of face started to melt away soon the coating was gone fromthe entire front of body freeing his upraised long frozen fall slackly to his sides his face relaxed into what looked like nothingso much as a boushh extracted the lifeless body from its casing andlowered it gently to the floor 
 he leaned his gruesome helmet close to face listening closely for signs oflife no breath no pulse with a start eyes suddenly snapped open andhe began to cough boushh steadied him tried to quiet were still guardswho might hear 
 quiet he whispered just relax 
 han squinted up at the dim form above him i was understandably disoriented after having been in suspended animation for sixof this desert period that was to him timeless it had been agrim if for an eternity been trying to draw breath to move toscream every moment in conscious painful now suddenly he wasdumped into a loud black cold pit 
 his senses assaulted him all at once the air bit at his skin with a thousand icyteeth the opacity of his sight was impenetrable wind seemed to rush around his earsat hurricane volumes he feel which way was up the myriad smells filling hisnose made him nauseous he stop salivating all his bones thencame the visions 
 visions from his childhood from his last breakfast from if all the images and memories of his life had been crammed into aballoon and the balloon popped and they all came bursting out now randomly in asingle moment it was nearly overwhelming it was sensory overload or moreprecisely memory overload men had gone mad in these first minutes followingdecarbonization hopelessly utterly ever again to reorganize kind of coherent selective order 
 solo that susceptible he rode the surge of this tide of impressions untilit settled down to a churning backwash submerging the bulk of his memories leavingonly the most recent flotsam to foam on the surface his betrayal by lando once called friend his ailing ship his last view of leia his capture by bobafett the bounty hunter who 
 where was he now what had happened his last image was of boba fettwatching him turn into carbonite was this fett again now come to thaw him formore abuse the air roared in his ears his breathing felt irregular unnatural hebatted his hand in front of his face 
 boushh tried to reassure him free of the carbonite and havehibernation sickness your eyesight will return in time come we must hurry to leave this place 
 reflexively han grabbed the bounty hunter felt at the grated thendrew back i am not going even know where i am he begansweating profusely as his heart once again churned blood and his mind groped foranswers who are you anyway he demanded suspiciously perhaps it was fettafter all 
 the bounty hunter reached up and pulled the helmet away from his headrevealing underneath the beautiful face of princess leia 
 one who loves you she whispered taking his face tenderly in her still glovedhands and kissing him long on the lips

 book two 
 chapter ii 
 
 coming shouted the signaler at that moment 
 the regimental commander flushing ran to his horse seized the stirrup with trembling hands threw his body across the saddle righted himself drew his saber and with a happy and resolute countenance opening his mouth awry prepared to shout the regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless 
 shouted the regimental commander in a voice which expressed joy for himself severity for the regiment and welcome for the approaching chief 
 along the broad country road edged on both sides by trees came a high light blue viennese caleche slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot behind the caleche galloped the suite and a convoy of croats beside kutuzov sat an austrian general in a white uniform that looked strange among the russian black ones the caleche stopped in front of the regiment kutuzov and the austrian general were talking in low voices and kutuzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist 
 the word of command rang out and again the regiment quivered as with a jingling sound it presented arms then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard the regiment roared health to your ex len len lency and again all became silent at first kutuzov stood still while the regiment moved then he and the general in white accompanied by the suite walked between the ranks 
 from the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others that had reached braunau at the same time was in splendid condition there were only sick and stragglers everything was in good order except the boots 
 kutuzov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war sometimes also to the soldiers looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly pointing them out to the austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was the regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion fearing to miss a single word of the commander in regarding the regiment behind kutuzov at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard followed some twenty men of his suite these gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant this was prince bolkonski beside him was his comrade nesvitski a tall staff officer extremely stout with a kindly smiling handsome face and moist eyes nesvitski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him this hussar with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes watched the regimental back and mimicked his every movement each time the commander started and bent forward the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner nesvitski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag 
 kutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief on reaching the third company he suddenly stopped his suite not having expected this involuntarily came closer to him 
 ah timokhin said he recognizing the captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat 
 one would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him and so kutuzov who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good quickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puffy face 
 another ismail comrade said he a brave officer are you satisfied with him he asked the regimental commander 
 and the latter unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glass started moved forward and answered highly satisfied your excellency 
 we all have our weaknesses said kutuzov smiling and walking away from him he used to have a predilection for bacchus 
 the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the captain and his stomach and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that nesvitski could not help laughing kutuzov turned round the officer evidently had complete control of his face and while kutuzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious deferential and innocent expression 
 the third company was the last and kutuzov pondered apparently trying to recollect something prince andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in french 
 you told me to remind you of the officer dolokhov reduced to the ranks in this regiment 
 where is dolokhov asked kutuzov 
 dolokhov who had already changed into a gray greatcoat did not wait to be called the shapely figure of the soldier with his clear blue eyes stepped forward from the ranks went up to the commander in chief and presented arms 
 have you a complaint to make kutuzov asked with a slight frown 
 this is dolokhov said prince andrew 
 ah said kutuzov i hope this will be a lesson to you do your duty the emperor is gracious and i forget you if you deserve well 
 the clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a private 
 one thing i ask of your excellency dolokhov said in his firm ringing deliberate voice i ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russia 
 kutuzov turned away the same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from captain timokhin again flitted over his face he turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything dolokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted he turned away and went to the carriage 
 the regiment broke up into companies which went to their appointed quarters near braunau where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches 
 you bear me a grudge prokhor ignatych said the regimental commander overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to captain timokhin who was walking in front the regimental face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight in the service it be helped one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade i am the first to apologize you know me he was very pleased and he held out his hand to the captain 
 mention it general as if be so bold replied the captain his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at ismail 
 and tell mr dolokhov that i forget him he may be quite easy and tell me please been meaning to ask how is to ask how is he behaving himself and in general 
 as far as the service goes he is quite punctilious your excellency but his character said timokhin 
 and what about his character asked the regimental commander 
 different on different days answered the captain one day he is sensible well educated and and the next a wild beast in poland if you please he nearly killed a jew 
 oh well well remarked the regimental commander still one must have pity on a young man in misfortune you know he has important connections well then you just 
 i will your excellency said timokhin showing by his smile that he understood his wish 
 well of course of course 
 the regimental commander sought out dolokhov in the ranks and reining in his horse said to him 
 after the next affair epaulettes 
 dolokhov looked round but did not say anything nor did the mocking smile on his lips change 
 well all right continued the regimental commander a cup of vodka for the men from me he added so that the soldiers could hear i thank you all god be praised and he rode past that company and overtook the next one 
 well really a good fellow one can serve under him said timokhin to the subaltern beside him 
 in a word a hearty one said the subaltern laughing the regimental commander was nicknamed king of hearts 
 the cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the soldiers the company marched on gaily the soldiers voices could be heard on every side 
 and they said kutuzov was blind of one eye 
 and so he is quite blind 
 no friend he is than you are boots and leg bands he noticed everything 
 when he looked at my feet friend well thinks i 
 and that other one with him the austrian looked as if he were smeared with chalk as white as flour i suppose they polish him up as they do the guns 
 i say fedeshon did he say when the battles are to begin you were near him everybody said that buonaparte himself was at braunau 
 buonaparte himself just listen to the fool what he know the prussians are up in arms now the austrians you see are putting them down when been put down the war with buonaparte will begin and he says buonaparte is in braunau shows a fool better listen more carefully 
 what devils these quartermasters are see the fifth company is turning into the village already they will have their buckwheat cooked before we reach our quarters 
 give me a biscuit you devil 
 and did you give me tobacco yesterday just it friend ah well never mind here you are 
 they might call a halt here or have to do another four miles without eating 
 it fine when those germans gave us lifts you just sit still and are drawn along 
 and here friend the people are quite beggarly there they all seemed to be poles all under the russian crown but here all regular germans 
 singers to the front came the order 
 and from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front a drummer their leader turned round facing the singers and flourishing his arm began a soldiers song commencing with the words morning dawned the sun was rising and concluding on then brothers on to glory led by father kamenski this song had been composed in the turkish campaign and now being sung in austria the only change being that the words father kamenski were replaced by father kutuzov 
 having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground the drummer a lean handsome soldier of forty looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and holding it there for some seconds suddenly flung it down and began 
 oh my bower oh my bower 
 oh my bower new chimed in twenty voices and the castanet player in spite of the burden of his equipment rushed out to the front and walking backwards before the company jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone the soldiers swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously marched with long steps behind the company the sound of wheels the creaking of springs and the tramp of horses hoofs were heard kutuzov and his suite were returning to the town the commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men in the second file from the right flank beside which the carriage passed the company a soldier involuntarily attracted notice it was dolokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company the hussar cornet of suite who had mimicked the regimental commander fell back from the carriage and rode up to dolokhov 
 hussar cornet zherkov had at one time in petersburg belonged to the wild set led by dolokhov zherkov had met dolokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him but now that kutuzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend 
 my dear fellow how are you said he through the singing making his horse keep pace with the company 
 how am i dolokhov answered coldly i am as you see 
 the lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which zherkov spoke and to the intentional coldness of reply 
 and how do you get on with the officers inquired zherkov 
 all right they are good fellows and how have you wriggled onto the staff 
 i was attached on duty 
 both were silent 
 she let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went the song arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song 
 is it true that austrians have been beaten asked dolokhov 
 the devil only knows they say so 
 glad answered dolokhov briefly and clearly as the song demanded 
 i say come round some evening and have a game of faro said zherkov 
 why have you too much money 
 do come 
 i sworn not to i drink and play till i get reinstated 
 well only till the first engagement 
 we shall see 
 they were again silent 
 come if you need anything one can at least be of use on the staff 
 dolokhov smiled trouble if i want anything i beg take it 
 well never mind i only 
 and i only 
 
 good health 
 a long long way 
 to my native land 
 zherkov touched his horse with the spurs it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start then settled down galloped past the company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the song

 chapter 
 
 i have paid a visit to the heights but i have not seen her since she left joseph held the door in his hand when i called to ask after her and let me pass he said mrs linton was thrang and the master was not in zillah has told me something of the way they go on otherwise i should hardly know who was dead and who living she thinks catherine haughty and does not like her i can guess by her talk my young lady asked some aid of her when she first came but mr heathcliff told her to follow her own business and let his look after herself and zillah willingly acquiesced being a selfish woman catherine evinced a annoyance at this neglect repaid it with contempt and thus enlisted my informant among her enemies as securely as if she had done her some great wrong i had a long talk with zillah about six weeks ago a little before you came one day when we foregathered on the moor and this is what she told me 
 the first thing mrs linton did she said on her arrival at the heights was to run upstairs without even wishing good evening to me and joseph she shut herself into room and remained till morning then while the master and earnshaw were at breakfast she entered the house and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent for her cousin was very ill 
 we know that answered heathcliff but his life is not worth a farthing and i spend a farthing on him 
 but i cannot tell how to do she said and if nobody will help me die 
 walk out of the room cried the master and let me never hear a word more about him none here care what becomes of him if you do act the nurse if you do not lock him up and leave him 
 then she began to bother me and i said had enough plague with the tiresome thing we each had our tasks and hers was to wait on linton mr heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her 
 how they managed together i tell i fancy he fretted a great deal and moaned hisseln night and day and she had precious little rest one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes she sometimes came into the kitchen all wildered like and looked as if she would fain beg assistance but i was not going to disobey the master i never dare disobey him mrs dean and though i thought it wrong that kenneth should not be sent for it was no concern of mine either to advise or complain and i always refused to meddle once or twice after we had gone to bed happened to open my door again and seen her sitting crying on the stairs top and then shut myself in quick for fear of being moved to interfere i did pity her then sure still i wish to lose my place you know 
 at last one night she came boldly into my chamber and frightened me out of my wits by saying 
 tell mr heathcliff that his son is sure he is this time get up instantly and tell him 
 having uttered this speech she vanished again i lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling nothing house was quiet 
 mistaken i said to myself got over it i disturb them and i began to doze but my sleep was marred a second time by a sharp ringing of the only bell we have put up on purpose for linton and the master called to me to see what was the matter and inform them that he have that noise repeated 
 i delivered message he cursed to himself and in a few minutes came out with a lighted candle and proceeded to their room i followed mrs heathcliff was seated by the bedside with her hands folded on her knees her went up held the light to face looked at him and touched him afterwards he turned to her 
 he said how do you feel she was dumb how do you feel catherine he repeated 
 safe and free she answered i should feel she continued with a bitterness she conceal you have left me so long to struggle against death alone that i feel and see only death i feel like death 
 and she looked like it too i gave her a little wine hareton and joseph who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet and heard our talk from outside now entered joseph was fain i believe of the removal hareton seemed a thought bothered though he was more taken up with staring at catherine than thinking of linton but the master bid him get off to bed again we want his help he afterwards made joseph remove the body to his chamber and told me to return to mine and mrs heathcliff remained by herself 
 in the morning he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast she had undressed and appeared going to sleep and said she was ill at which i hardly wondered i informed mr heathcliff and he replied 
 well let her be till after the funeral and go up now and then to get her what is needful and as soon as she seems better tell me 
 cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight according to zillah who visited her twice a day and would have been rather more friendly but her attempts at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled 
 heathcliff went up once to show her will he had bequeathed the whole of his and what had been her movable property to his father the poor creature was threatened or coaxed into that act during her absence when his uncle died the lands being a minor he could not meddle with however mr heathcliff has claimed and kept them in his right and his also i suppose legally at any rate catherine destitute of cash and friends cannot disturb his possession 
 nobody said zillah ever approached her door except that once but i and nobody asked anything about her the first occasion of her coming down into the house was on a sunday afternoon she had cried out when i carried up her dinner that she bear any longer being in the cold and i told her the master was going to thrushcross grange and earnshaw and i hinder her from descending so as soon as she heard horse trot off she made her appearance donned in black and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a quaker she comb them out 
 joseph and i generally go to chapel on sundays the kirk you know has no minister now explained mrs dean and they call the methodists or baptists place i say which it is at gimmerton a chapel joseph had gone she continued but i thought proper to bide at home young folks are always the better for an overlooking and hareton with all his bashfulness a model of nice behaviour i let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us and she had been always used to see the sabbath respected so he had as good leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone while she stayed he coloured up at the news and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes the and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute i saw he meant to give her his company and i guessed by his way he wanted to be presentable so laughing as i durst not laugh when the master is by i offered to help him if he would and joked at his confusion he grew sullen and began to swear 
 now mrs dean zillah went on seeing me not pleased by her manner you happen think your young lady too fine for mr hareton and happen right but i own i should love well to bring her pride a peg lower and what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her now as poor as you or i poorer be bound saving and doing my little all that allowed zillah to give him her aid and she flattered him into a good humour so when catherine came half forgetting her former insults he tried to make himself agreeable by the account 
 missis walked in she said as chill as an icicle and as high as a princess i got up and offered her my seat in the armchair no she turned up her nose at my civility earnshaw rose too and bid her come to the settle and sit close by the fire he was sure she was starved 
 been starved a month and more she answered resting on the word as scornful as she could 
 and she got a chair for herself and placed it at a distance from both of us having sat till she was warm she began to look round and discovered a number of books in the dresser she was instantly upon her feet again stretching to reach them but they were too high up her cousin after watching her endeavours a while at last summoned courage to help her she held her frock and he filled it with the first that came to hand 
 that was a great advance for the lad she thank him still he felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance and ventured to stand behind as she examined them and even to stoop and point out what struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained nor was he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her instead of the book she continued reading or seeking for something to read his attention became by degrees quite centred in the study of her thick silky curls her face he see and she see him and perhaps not quite awake to what he did but attracted like a child to a candle at last he proceeded from staring to touching he put out his hand and stroked one curl as gently as if it were a bird he might have stuck a knife into her neck she started round in such a taking 
 get away this moment how dare you touch me why are you stopping there she cried in a tone of disgust i endure you go upstairs again if you come near me 
 mr hareton recoiled looking as foolish as he could do he sat down in the settle very quiet and she continued turning over her volumes another finally earnshaw crossed over and whispered to me 
 will you ask her to read to us zillah stalled of doing naught and i do could like to hear her dunnot say i wanted it but ask of yourseln 
 mr hareton wishes you would read to us i said immediately take it very be much obliged 
 she frowned and looking up answered 
 mr hareton and the whole set of you will be good enough to understand that i reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy to offer i despise you and will have nothing to say to any of you when i would have given my life for one kind word even to see one of your faces you all kept off but i complain to you driven down here by the cold not either to amuse you or enjoy your society 
 what could i ha done began earnshaw how was i to blame 
 oh you are an exception answered mrs heathcliff i never missed such a concern as you 
 but i offered more than once and asked he said kindling up at her pertness i asked mr heathcliff to let me wake for you be silent go out of doors or anywhere rather than have your disagreeable voice in my ear said my lady 
 hareton muttered she might go to hell for him and unslinging his gun restrained himself from his sunday occupations no longer he talked now freely enough and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude but the frost had set in and in spite of her pride she was forced to condescend to our company more and more however i took care there should be no further scorning at my good nature ever since been as stiff as herself and she has no lover or liker among us and she does not deserve one for let them say the least word to her and curl back without respect of anyone snap at the master himself and as good as dares him to thrash her and the more hurt she gets the more venomous she grows 
 at first on hearing this account from zillah i determined to leave my situation take a cottage and get catherine to come and live with me but mr heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up hareton in an independent house and i can see no remedy at present unless she could marry again and that scheme it does not come within my province to arrange 
 thus ended mrs story notwithstanding the prophecy i am rapidly recovering strength and though it be only the second week in january i propose getting out on horseback in a day or two and riding over to wuthering heights to inform my landlord that i shall spend the next six months in london and if he likes he may look out for another tenant to take the place after october i would not pass another winter here for much

 chapter thirty 
 
 
 mrs fair was so very elegant and select that it was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood to be invited to take a table and everyone was much interest in the matter amy was asked but jo was not which was fortunate for all parties as her elbows were decidedly akimbo at this period of her life and it took a good many hard knocks to teach her how to get on easily the haughty uninteresting creature was let severely alone but talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art table and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it 
 everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid when some women old and young with all their private piques and prejudices try to work together 
 may chester was rather jealous of amy because the latter was a greater favorite than herself and just at this time several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling dainty work entirely eclipsed painted was one thorn then the all conquering tudor had danced four times with amy at a late party and only once with was thorn number two but the chief grievance that rankled in her soul and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her that the march girls had made fun of her at the lambs all the blame of this should have fallen upon jo for her naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection and the frolicsome lambs had permitted the joke to escape no hint of this had reached the culprits however and dismay can be imagined when the very evening before the fair as she was putting the last touches to her pretty table mrs chester who of course resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter said in a bland tone but with a cold look 
 i find dear that there is some feeling among the young ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls as this is the most prominent and some say the most attractive table of all and they are the chief of the fair it is thought best for them to take this place sorry but i know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a little personal disappointment and you shall have another table if you like 
 mrs chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech but when the time came she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally with unsuspicious eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble 
 amy felt that there was something behind this but would not guess what and said quietly feeling hurt and showing that she did perhaps you had rather i took no table at all 
 now my dear have any ill feeling i beg merely a matter of expediency you see my girls will naturally take the lead and this table is considered their proper place i think it very appropriate to you and feel very grateful for your efforts to make it so pretty but we must give up our private wishes of course and i will see that you have a good place elsewhere you like the flower table the little girls undertook it but they are discouraged you could make a charmingthing of it and the flower table is always attractive you know 
 especially to gentlemen added may with a look which enlightened amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor she colored angrily but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm and answered with unexpected amiability 
 it shall be as you please mrs chester give up my place here at once and attend to the flowers if you like 
 you can put your own things on your own table if you prefer began may feeling a little as she looked at the pretty racks the painted shells and quaint illuminations amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged she meant it kindly but amy mistook her meaning and said quickly 
 oh certainly if they are in your way and sweeping her contributions into her apron she walked off feeling that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness 
 now mad oh dear i wish i asked you to speak mama said may looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table 
 girls quarrels are soon over returned her mother feeling a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one as well she might 
 the little girls hailed amy and her treasures with delight which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit and she fell to work determined to succeed florally if she could not artistically but everything seemed against her it was late and she was tired everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her and the little girls were only hindrances for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order the evergreen arch stay firm after she got it up but wiggled and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets were filled her best tile got a splash of water which left a sephia tear on the cheek she bruised her hands with hammering and got cold working in a draft which last affliction filled her with apprehensions for the morrow any girl reader who has suffered like afflictions will sympathize with poor amy and wish her well through her task 
 there was great indignation at home when she told her story that evening her mother said it was a shame but told her she had done right beth declared she go to the fair at all and jo demanded why she take all her pretty things and leave those mean people to get on without her 
 because they are mean is no reason why i should be i hate such things and though i think a right to be hurt i intend to show it they will feel that more than angry speeches or huffy actions they marmee 
 the right spirit my dear a kiss for a blow is always best though not very easy to give it sometimes said her mother with the air of one who had learned the difference between preaching and practicing 
 in spite of various very natural temptations to resent and retaliate amy adhered to her resolution all the next day bent on conquering her enemy by kindness she began well thanks to a silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly but most opportunely as she arranged her table that morning while the little girls were in the anteroom filling the baskets she took up her pet production a little book the antique cover of which her father had found among his treasures and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully illuminated different texts as she turned the pages rich in dainty devices with very pardonable pride her eye fell upon one verse that made her stop and think framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet blue and gold with little spirits of good will helping one another up and down among the thorns and flowers were the words thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself 
 i ought but i thought amy as her eye went from the bright page to discontented face behind the big vases that could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled amy stood a minute turning the leaves in her hand reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious ministers in street school office or home even a fair table may become a pulpit if it can offer the good and helpful words which are never out of season conscience preached her a little sermon from that text then and there and she did what many of us do not always do took the sermon to heart and straightway put it in practice 
 a group of girls were standing about table admiring the pretty things and talking over the change of saleswomen they dropped their voices but amy knew they were speaking of her hearing one side of the story and judging accordingly it was not pleasant but a better spirit had come over her and presently a chance offered for proving it she heard may say sorrowfully 
 too bad for there is no time to make other things and i want to fill up with odds and ends the table was just complete then now spoiled 
 i dare say put them back if you asked her suggested someone 
 how could i after all the fuss began may but she did not finish for voice came across the hall saying pleasantly 
 you may have them and welcome without asking if you want them i was just thinking offer to put them back for they belong to your table rather than mine here they are please take them and forgive me if i was hasty in carrying them away last night 
 as she spoke amy returned her contribution with a nod and a smile and hurried away again feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it 
 now i call that lovely of her you cried one girl 
 answer was inaudible but another young lady whose temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade added with a disagreeable laugh very lovely for she knew she sell them at her own table 
 now that was hard when we make little sacrifices we like to have them appreciated at least and for a minute amy was sorry she had done it feeling that virtue was not always its won reward but it is as she presently discovered for her spirits began to rise and her table to blossom under her skillful hands the girls were very kind and that one little act seemed to have cleared the atmosphere amazingly 
 it was a very long day and a hard one for amy as she sat behind her table often quite alone for the little girls deserted very soon few cared to buy flowers in summer and her bouquets began to droop long before night 
 the art table was the most attractive in the room there was a crowd about it all day long and the tenders were constantly flying to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes amy often looked wistfully across longing to be there where she felt at home and happy instead of in a corner with nothing to do it might seem no hardship to some of us but to a pretty blithe young girl it was not only tedious but very trying and the thought of laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom 
 she did not go home till night and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one though she made no complaint and did not even tell what she had done her mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea beth helped her made a charming little wreath for her hair while jo astonished her family by getting herself up with unusual care and hinting darkly that the tables were about to be turned 
 do anything rude pray jo i have any fuss made so let it all pass and behave yourself begged amy as she departed early hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little table 
 i merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to ever one i know and to keep them in your corner as long as possible teddy and his boys will lend a hand and have a good time yet returned jo leaning over the gate to watch for laurie presently the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk and she ran out to meet him 
 is that my boy 
 as sure as this is my girl and laurie tucked her hand under his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified 
 oh teddy such doings and jo told wrongs with sisterly zeal 
 a flock of our fellows are going to drive over and be hanged if i make them buy every flower got and camp down before her table afterward said laurie espousing her cause with warmth 
 the flowers are not at all nice amy says and the fresh ones may not arrive in time i wish to be unjust or suspicious but i wonder if they never came at all when people do one mean thing they are very likely to do another observed jo in a disgusted tone 
 hayes give you the best out of our gardens i told him to 
 i know that he forgot i suppose and as your grandpa was poorly i like to worry him by asking though i did want some 
 now jo how could you think there was any need of asking they are just as much yours as mine we always go halves in everything began laurie in the tone that always made jo turn thorny 
 gracious i hope not half of some of your things suit me at all but we stand philandering here got to help amy so you go and make yourself splendid and if be so very kind as to let hayes take a few nice flowers up to the hall bless you forever 
 you do it now asked laurie so suggestively that jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste and called through the bars go away teddy busy 
 thanks to the conspirators the tables were turned that night for hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers with a loverly basket arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece then the march family turned out en masse and jo exerted herself to some purpose for people not only came but stayed laughing at her nonsense admiring taste and apparently enjoying themselves very much laurie and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach bought up the bouquets encamped before the table and made that corner the liveliest spot in the room amy was in her element now and out of gratitude if nothing more was as spritely and gracious as possible coming to the conclusion about that time that virtue was own reward after all 
 jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety and when amy was happily surrounded by her guard of honor jo circulated about the hall picking up various bits of gossip which enlightened her upon the subject of the chester change of base she reproached herself for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate amy as soon as possible she also discovered what amy had done about the things in the morning and considered her a model of magnanimity as she passed the art table she glanced over it for her things but saw no sign of them tucked away out of sight i dare say thought jo who could forgiver her own wrongs but hotly resented any insult offered her family 
 good evening miss jo how does amy get on asked may with a conciliatory air for she wanted to show that she also could begenerous 
 she has sold everything she had that was worth selling and now she is enjoying herself the flower table is always attractive you know especially to gentlemen 
 jo resist giving that little slap but may took it so meekly she regretted it a minute after and fell to praising the great vases which still remained unsold 
 is illumination anywhere about i took a fancy to buy that for father said jo very anxious to learn the fate of her work 
 everything of sold long ago i took care that the right people saw them and they made a nice little sum of money for us returned may who had overcome sundry small temptations as well as amy had that day 
 much gratified jo rushed back to tell the good news and amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of word and manner 
 now gentlemen i want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by mine especially the art table she said ordering out own as the girls called the college friends 
 charge chester charge is the motto for that table but do your duty like men and get your worth of art in every sense of the word said the irrepressible jo as the devoted phalanx prepared to take the field 
 to hear is to obey but march is fairer far than may said little parker making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender and getting promptly quenched by laurie who said 
 very well my son for a small boy and walked him off with a paternal pat on the head 
 buy the vases whispered amy to laurie as a final heaping of coals of fire on her head 
 to great delight mr laurence not only bought the vases but pervaded the hall with one under each arm the other gentlemen speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles and wandered helplessly about afterward burdened with wax flowers painted fans filigree portfolios and other useful and appropriate purchases 
 aunt carrol was there heard the story looked pleased and said something to mrs march in a corner which made the latter lady beam with satisfaction and watch amy with a face full of mingled pride and anxiety though she did not betray the cause of her pleasure till several days later 
 the fair was pronounced a success and when may bade amy goodnight she did not gush as usual but gave her an affectionate kiss and a look which said forgive and forget that satisfied amy and when she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each the reward of merit for a magnanimous march as laurie announced with a flourish 
 a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness of character than i ever gave you credit for amy behaved sweetly and i respect you with all my heart said jo warmly as they brushed their hair together late that night 
 yes we all do and love her for being so ready to forgive it must have been dreadfully hard after working so long and setting your heart on selling your own pretty things i believe i could have done it as kindly as you did added beth from her pillow 
 why girls you praise me so i only did as be done by you laugh at me when i say i want to be a lady but i mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners and i try to do it as far as i know how i explain exactly but i want to be above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil so many women far from it now but i do my best and hope in time to be what mother is 
 amy spoke earnestly and jo said with a cordial hug i understand now what you mean and never laugh at you again you are getting on faster than you think and take lessons of you in true politeness for learned the secret i believe try away deary get your reward some day and no one will be more delighted than i shall 
 a week later amy did get her reward and poor jo found it hard to be delighted a letter came from aunt carrol and mrs face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it that jo and beth who were with her demanded what the glad tiding were 
 aunt carrol is going abroad next month and wants 
 me to go with her burst in jo flying out of her chair in an uncontrollable rapture 
 no dear not you amy 
 oh mother too young my turn first wanted it so long it would do me so much good and be so altogether splendid i must go 
 afraid impossible jo aunt says amy decidedly and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor 
 always so amy has all the fun and i have all the work it fair oh it fair cried jo passionately 
 afraid partly your own fault dear when aunt spoke to me the other day she regretted your blunt manners and too independent spirit and here she writes as if quoting something you had planned at first to ask jo but as favors burden her and she hates french i think i venture to invite her amy is more docile will make a good companion for flo and receive gratefully any help the trip may give her 
 oh my tongue my abominable tongue why i learn to keep it quiet groaned jo remembering words which had been her undoing when she had heard the explanation of the quoted phrases mrs march said sorrowfully 
 i wish you could have gone but there is no hope of it this time so try to bear it cheerfully and sadden pleasure by reproaches or regrets 
 try said jo winking hard as she knelt down to pick up the basket she had joyfully upset take a leaf out of her book and try not only to seem glad but to be so and not grudge her one minute of happiness but it be easy for it is a dreadful disappointment and poor jo bedewed the little fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears jo dear very selfish but i spare you and glad you are not going quite yet whispered beth embracing her basket and all with such a clinging touch and loving face that jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her want to box her own ears and humbly beg aunt carrol to burden her with this favor and see how gratefully she would bear it 
 by the time amy came in jo was able to take her part in the family jubilation not quite as heartily as usual perhaps but without repinings at good fortune the young lady herself received the news as tidings of great joy went about in a solemn sort of rapture and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening leaving such trifles as clothes money and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself 
 it a mere pleasure trip to me girls she said impressively as she scraped her best palette it will decide my career for if i have any genius i shall find it out in rome and will do something to prove it 
 suppose you said jo sewing away with red eyes at the new collars which were to be handed over to amy 
 then i shall come home and teach drawing for my living replied the aspirant for fame with philosophic composure but she made a wry face at the prospect and scratched away at her palette as if bent on vigorous measures before she gave up her hopes 
 no you you hate hard work and marry some rich man and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your days said jo 
 your predictions sometimes come to pass but i believe that one will sure i wish it would for if i be an artist myself i should like to be able to help those who are said amy smiling as if the part of lady bountiful would suit her better than that of a poor drawing teacher 
 hum said jo with a sigh if you wish it have it for your wishes are always never 
 would you like to go asked amy thoughtfully patting her nose with her knife 
 rather 
 well in a year or two send for you and dig in the forum for relics and carry out all the plans made so many times 
 thank you remind you of your promise when that joyful day comes if it ever does returned jo accepting the vague but magnificent offer as gratefully as she could there was not much time for preparation and the house was in a ferment till amy was off jo bore up very well till the last flutter of blue ribbon vanished when she retired to her refuge the garret and cried till she cry any more amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed then just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn it suddenly came over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her and those who loved her best and she clung to laurie the last lingerer saying with a sob 
 oh take care of them for me and if anything should happen 
 i will dear i will and if anything happens come and comfort you whispered laurie little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word 
 so amy sailed away to find the old world which is always new and beautiful to young eyes while her father and friend watched her from the shore fervently hoping that none but gentle fortunes would befall the girl who waved her hand to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling on the sea

lionfish nov chapter thirty the pensievecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the door of the office opened 
 
 hello potter said moody come in then 
 
 harry walked inside he had been inside office once before it was a very beautiful circular room lined with pictures of previous headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts all of whom were fast asleep their chests rising and falling gently 
 
 cornelius fudge was standing beside desk wearing his usual pinstriped cloak and holding his bowler hat 
 
 harry said fudge jovially moving forward how are you 
 
 fine harry lied 
 
 we were just talking about the night when mr crouch turned up on the grounds said fudge it was you who found him was it not 
 
 yes said harry then feeling it was pointless to pretend that he overheard what they had been saying he added i see madame maxime anywhere though and have a job hiding she 
 
 dumbledore smiled at harry behind back his eyes twinkling 
 
 yes well said fudge looking embarrassed about to go for a short walk on the grounds harry if excuse usperhaps if you just go back to your class 
 
 i wanted to talk to you professor harry said quickly looking at dumbledore who gave him a swift searching look 
 
 wait here for me harry he said our examination of the grounds will not take long 
 
 they trooped out in silence past him and closed the door after a minute or so harry heard the clunks of wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor below he looked around 
 
 hello fawkes he said 
 
 fawkes professor phoenix was standing on his golden perch beside the door the size of a swan with magnificent plumage he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at harry 
 
 harry sat down in a chair in front of desk for several minutes he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames thinking about what he had just heard and running his fingers over his scar it had stopped hurting now 
 
 he felt much calmer somehow now that he was in office knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream harry looked up at the walls behind the desk the patched and ragged sorting hat was standing on a shelf a glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt which harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the sorting hat in his second year the sword had once belonged to godric gryffindor founder of house he was gazing at it remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost when he noticed a patch of silvery light dancing and shimmering on the glass case he looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him whose door had not been closed properly harry hesitated glanced at fawkes then got up walked across the office and pulled open the cabinet door 
 
 a shallow stone basin lay there with odd carvings around the edge runes and symbols that harry did not recognize the silvery light was coming from the contents which were like nothing harry had ever seen before he could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas it was a bright whitish silver and it was moving ceaselessly the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind and then like clouds separated and swirled smoothly it looked like light made liquid or like wind made solid harry make up his mind 
 
 he wanted to touch it to find out what it felt like but nearly four years experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do he therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes cast a nervous look around the office looked back at the contents of the basin and prodded them 
 
 the surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast 
 
 harry bent closer his head right inside the cabinet the silvery substance had become transparent it looked like glass he looked down into it expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling 
 
 the room was dimly lit he thought it might even be underground for there were no windows merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of hogwarts lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels an empty chair stood in the very center of the room there was something about the chair that gave harry an ominous feeling chains encircled the arms of it as though its occupants were usually tied to it 
 
 where was this place it surely hogwarts he had never seen a room like that here in the castle moreover the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults and harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at hogwarts they seemed he thought to be waiting for something even though he could only see the tops of their hats all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction and none of them were talking to one another 
 
 the basin being circular and the room he was observing square harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it he leaned even closer tilting his head trying to see 
 
 the tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he was staring 
 
 office gave an almighty lurch harry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin 
 
 but his head did not hit the stone bottom he was falling through something and black it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool 
 
 and suddenly harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin a bench raised high above the others he looked up at the high stone ceiling expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been staring but there was nothing there but dark solid stone 
 
 breathing hard and fast harry looked around him not one of the witches and wizards in the room and there were at least two hundred of them was looking at him not one of them seemed to have noticed that a boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room 
 
 he was sitting right next to albus dumbledore 
 
 professor harry said in a kind of strangled whisper sorry i mean to i was just looking at that basin in your cabinet i where are we 
 
 but dumbledore move or speak he ignored harry completely like every other wizard on the benches he was staring into the far corner of the room where there was a door 
 
 harry gazed nonplussed at dumbledore then around at the silently watchful crowd then back at dumbledore and then it dawned on him 
 
 once before harry had found himself somewhere that nobody could see or hear him that time he had fallen through a page in an enchanted diary right into somebody memoryand unless he was very much mistaken something of the sort had happened again 
 
 harry raised his right hand hesitated and then waved it energetically in from of face dumbledore did not blink look around at harry or indeed move at all and that in opinion settled the matter dumbledore ignore him like that he was inside a memory and this was not the dumbledore yet it be that long agothe dumbledore sitting next to him now was just like the dumbledore but what was this place what were all these wizards waiting for 
 
 harry looked around more carefully the room as he had suspected when observing it from above was almost certainly underground more of a dungeon than a room he thought there was a bleak and forbidding air about the place there were no pictures on the walls no decorations at all just these serried rows of benches rising in levels all around the room all positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms 
 
 before harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were he heard footsteps the door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three people entered or at least one man flanked by two dementors 
 
 insides went cold the dementors tall hooded creatures whose faces were concealed were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room each grasping one of the arms with their dead and hands the man between them looked as though he was about to faint and harry blame himhe knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory but he remembered their power only too well the watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided back out of the room the door swung shut behind them 
 
 harry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw that it was karkaroff 
 
 unlike dumbledore karkaroff looked much younger his hair and goatee were black he was not dressed in sleek furs but in thin and ragged robes he was shaking even as harry watched the chains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked their way up arms binding him there 
 
 igor karkaroff said a curt voice to left harry looked around and saw mr crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him hair was dark his face was much less lined he looked fit and alert you have been brought from azkaban to present evidence to the ministry of magic you have given us to understand that you have important information for us 
 
 karkaroff straightened himself as best he could tightly bound to the chair 
 
 i have sir he said and although his voice was very scared harry could still hear the familiar unctuous note in it i wish to be of use to the ministry i wish to help i i know that the ministry is trying to to round up the last of the dark lords supporters i am eager to assist in any way i can 
 
 there was a murmur around the benches some of the wizards and witches were surveying karkaroff with interest others with pronounced mistrust then harry heard quite distinctly from dumbledores other side a familiar growling voice saying filth 
 
 harry leaned forward so that he could see past dumbledore moody was sitting there except that there was a very noticeable difference in his appearance he did not have his magical eye but two normal ones both were looking down upon karkaroff and both were narrowed in intense dislike 
 
 crouch is going to let him out moody breathed quietly to dumbledore done a deal with him took me six months to track him down and crouch is going to let him go if got enough new names hear his information i say and throw him straight back to the dementors 
 
 dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long crooked nose 
 
 ah i was forgettingyou like the dementors do you albus said moody with a sardonic smile 
 
 no said dumbledore calmly afraid i i have long felt the ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures 
 
 but for filth like this moody said softly 
 
 you say you have names for us karkaroff said mr crouch let us hear them please 
 
 you must understand said karkaroff hurriedly that operated always in the greatest preferred that we i mean to say his supporters and i regret now very deeply that i ever counted myself among them 
 
 get on with it sneered moody 
 
 we never knew the names of every one of our fellows he alone knew exactly who we all were 
 
 which was a wise move it as it prevented someone like you karkaroff from turning all of them in muttered moody 
 
 yet you say you have some names for us said mr crouch 
 
 i i do said karkaroff breathlessly and these were important supporters mark you people i saw with my own eyes doing his bidding i give this information as a sign that i fully and totally renounce him and am filled with a remorse so deep i can barely 
 
 these names are said mr crouch sharply 
 
 karkaroff drew a deep breath 
 
 there was antonin dolohov he said i i saw him torture countless muggles and and of the dark lord 
 
 and helped him do it murmured moody 
 
 we have already apprehended dolohov said crouch he was caught shortly after yourself 
 
 indeed said karkaroff his eyes widening i i am delighted to hear it 
 
 but he look it harry could tell that this news had come as a real blow to him one of his names was worthless 
 
 any others said crouch coldly 
 
 why yesthere was rosier said karkaroff hurriedly evan rosier 
 
 rosier is dead said crouch he was caught shortly after you were too he preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was killed in the struggle 
 
 took a bit of me with him though whispered moody to right harry looked around at him once more and saw him indicating the large chunk out of his nose to dumbledore 
 
 no no more than rosier deserved said karkaroff a real note of panic in his voice now harry could see that he was starting to worry that none of his information would be of any use to the ministry eyes darted toward the door in the corner behind which the dementors undoubtedly still stood waiting 
 
 any more said crouch 
 
 yes said karkaroff there was travers he helped murder the mckinnons mulciber he specialized in the imperius curse forced countless people to do horrific things rookwood who was a spy and passed useful information from inside the ministry itself 
 
 harry could tell that this time karkaroff had struck gold the watching crowd was all murmuring together 
 
 rookwood said mr crouch nodding to a witch sitting in front of him who began scribbling upon her piece of parchment augustus rookwood of the department of mysteries 
 
 the very same said karkaroff eagerly i believe he used a network of wizards both inside the ministry and out to collect information 
 
 but travers and mulciber we have said mr crouch very well karkaroff if that is all you will be returned to azkaban while we decide 
 
 not yet cried karkaroff looking quite desperate wait i have more 
 
 harry could see him sweating in the torchlight his white skin contrasting strongly with the black of his hair and beard 
 
 snape he shouted severus snape 
 
 snape has been cleared by this council said crouch disdainfully he has been vouched for by albus dumbledore 
 
 no shouted karkaroff straining at the chains that bound him to the chair i assure you severus snape is a death eater 
 
 dumbledore had gotten to his feet 
 
 i have given evidence already on this matter he said calmly severus snape was indeed a death eater however he rejoined our side before lord downfall and turned spy for us at great personal risk he is now no more a death eater than i am 
 
 harry turned to look at moody he was wearing a look of deep skepticism behind back 
 
 very well karkaroff crouch said coldly you have been of assistance i shall review your case you will return to azkaban in the meantime 
 
 mr voice faded harry looked around the dungeon was dissolving as though it were made of smoke everything was fading he could see only his own body all else was swirling darkness 
 
 and then the dungeon returned harry was sitting in a different seat still on the highest bench but now to the left side of mr crouch the atmosphere seemed quite different relaxed even cheerful the witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite she had short blonde hair was wearing magenta robes and was sucking the end of an quill it was unmistakably a younger rita skeeter harry looked around dumbledore was sitting beside him again wearing different robes mr crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer understood it was a different memory a different daya different trial 
 
 the door in the corner opened and ludo bagman walked into the room 
 
 this was not however a ludo bagman gone to seed but a ludo bagman who was clearly at the height of his fitness his nose broken now he was tall and lean and muscular bagman looked nervous as he sat down in the chained chair but it did not bind him there as it had bound karkaroff and bagman perhaps taking heart from this glanced around at the watching crowd waved at a couple of them and managed a small smile 
 
 ludo bagman you have been brought here in front of the council of magical law to answer charges relating to the activities of the death eaters said mr crouch we have heard the evidence against you and are about to reach our verdict do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment 
 
 harry believe his ears ludo bagman a death eater 
 
 only said bagman smiling awkwardly well i know been a bit of an idiot 
 
 one or two wizards and witches in the surrounding seats smiled indulgently mr crouch did not appear to share their feelings he was staring down at ludo bagman with an expression of the utmost severity and dislike 
 
 you never spoke a truer word boy someone muttered dryly to dumbledore behind harry he looked around and saw moody sitting there again if i know always been dim have said some of those bludgers had permanently affected his brain 
 
 ludovic bagman you were caught passing information to lord supporters said mr crouch for this i suggest a term of imprisonment in azkaban lasting no less than 
 
 but there was an angry outcry from the surrounding benches several of the witches and wizards around the walls stood up shaking their heads and even their fists at mr crouch 
 
 but told you i had no idea bagman called earnestly over the babble his round blue eyes widening none at all old rookwood was a friend of my crossed my mind he was in with i thought i was collecting information for our side and rookwood kept talking about getting me a job in the ministry later ononce my quidditch days are over you knowi mean i keep getting hit by bludgers for the rest of my life can i 
 
 there were titters from the crowd 
 
 it will be put to the vote said mr crouch coldly he turned to the side of the dungeon the jury will please raise their handsthose in favor of imprisonment 
 
 harry looked toward the side of the dungeon not one person raised their hand many of the witches and wizards around the walls began to clap one of the witches on the jury stood up 
 
 yes barked crouch 
 
 just like to congratulate mr bagman on his splendid performance for england in the quidditch match against turkey last saturday the witch said breathlessly 
 
 mr crouch looked furious the dungeon was ringing with applause now bagman got to his feet and bowed beaming 
 
 despicable mr crouch spat at dumbledore sitting down as bagman walked out of the dungeon rookwood get him a job day ludo bagman joins us will be a sad day indeed for the ministry 
 
 and the dungeon dissolved again when it had returned harry looked around he and dumbledore were still sitting beside mr crouch but the atmosphere could not have been more different there was total silence broken only by the dry sobs of a frail witch in the seat next to mr crouch she was clutching a handkerchief to her mouth with trembling hands 
 
 harry looked up at crouch and saw that he looked gaunter and grayer than ever before a nerve was twitching in his temple 
 
 bring them in he said and his voice echoed through the silent dungeon 
 
 the door in the corner opened yet again six dementors entered this time flanking a group of four people harry saw the people in the crowd turn to look up at mr crouch a few of them whispered to one another 
 
 the dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs with chained arms that now stood on the dungeon floor there was a thickset man who stared blankly up at crouch a thinner and more man whose eyes were darting around the crowd a woman with thick shining dark hair and heavily hooded eyes who was sitting in the chained chair as though it were a throne and a boy in his late teens who looked nothing short of petrified he was shivering his hair all over his face his freckled skin the wispy little witch beside crouch began to rock backward and forward in her seat whimpering into her handkerchief 
 
 crouch stood up he looked down upon the four in front of him and there was pure hatred in his face 
 
 you have been brought here before the council of magical law he said clearly so that we may pass judgment on you for a crime so heinous 
 
 father said the boy with the hair fatherplease 
 
 that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court said crouch speaking more loudly drowning out his voice 
 
 we have heard the evidence against you the four of you stand accused of capturing an auror frank longbottom and subjecting him to the cruciatus curse believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master 
 
 father i shrieked the boy in chains below i i swear it father send me back to the dementors 
 
 you are further accused bellowed mr crouch of using the cruciatus curse on frank wife when he would not give you information you planned to restore to power and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong i now ask the jury 
 
 mother screamed the boy below and the wispy little witch beside crouch began to sob rocking backward and forward mother stop him mother i do it it me 
 
 i now ask the jury shouted mr crouch to raise their hands if they believe as i do that these crimes deserve a life sentence in azkaban 
 
 in unison the witches and wizards along the side of the dungeon raised their hands the crowd around the walls began to clap as it had for bagman their faces full of savage triumph the boy began to scream 
 
 no mother no i do it i do it i know send me there let him 
 
 the dementors were gliding back into the room the boys three companions rose quietly from their seats the woman with the eyes looked up at crouch and called the dark lord will rise again crouch throw us into azkaban we will wait he will rise again and will come for us he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters we alone were faithful we alone tried to find him 
 
 but the boy was trying to fight off the dementors even though harry could see their cold draining power starting to affect him the crowd was jeering some of them on their feet as the woman swept out of the dungeon and the boy continued to struggle 
 
 your son he screamed up at crouch your son 
 
 you are no son of mine bellowed mr crouch his eyes bulging suddenly i have no son 
 
 the wispy witch beside him gave a great gasp and slumped in her seat she had fainted crouch appeared not to have noticed 
 
 take them away crouch roared at the dementors spit flying from his mouth take them away and may they rot there 
 
 father father i involved no no father please 
 
 i think harry it is time to return to my office said a quiet voice in ear 
 
 harry started he looked around then he looked on his other side 
 
 there was an albus dumbledore sitting on his right watching son being dragged away by the dementors and there was an albus dumbledore on his left looking right at him 
 
 come said the dumbledore on his left and he put his hand under elbow harry felt himself rising into the air the dungeon dissolved around him for a moment all was blackness and then he felt as though he had done a somersault suddenly landing flat on his feet in what seemed like the dazzling light of sunlit office the stone basin was shimmering in the cabinet in front of him and albus dumbledore was standing beside him 
 
 professor harry gasped i know i i mean the cabinet door was sort of open and 
 
 i quite understand said dumbledore he lifted the basin carried it over to his desk placed it upon the polished top and sat down in the chair behind it he motioned for harry to sit down opposite him 
 
 harry did so staring at the stone basin the contents had returned to their original state swirling and rippling beneath his gaze 
 
 what is it harry asked shakily 
 
 this it is called a pensieve said dumbledore i sometimes find and i am sure you know the feeling that i simply have too many thoughts and memories crammed into my mind 
 
 er said harry who truthfully say that he had ever felt anything of the sort 
 
 at these times said dumbledore indicating the stone basin i use the pensieve one simply siphons the excess thoughts from mind pours them into the basin and examines them at leisure it becomes easier to spot patterns and links you understand when they are in this form 
 
 you meanthat your thoughts harry said staring at the swirling white substance in the basin 
 
 certainly said dumbledore let me show you 
 
 dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair near his temple when he took the wand away hair seemed to be clinging to it but then harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange substance that filled the pensieve dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin and harry astonished saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the pensieve and swirled it rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of harry saw his own face change smoothly into who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling his voice echoing slightly 
 
 coming toostronger and clearer than ever 
 
 a connection i could have made without assistance dumbledore sighed but never mind he peered over the top of his spectacles at harry who was gaping at face which was continuing to swirl around the bowl i was using the pensieve when mr fudge arrived for our meeting and put it away rather hastily undoubtedly i did not fasten the cabinet door properly naturally it would have attracted your attention 
 
 sorry harry mumbled 
 
 dumbledore shook his head curiosity is not a sin he said but we should exercise caution with our curiosityyes indeed 
 
 frowning slightly he prodded the thoughts within the basin with the tip of his wand instantly a figure rose out of it a plump scowling girl of about sixteen who began to revolve slowly with her feet still in the basin she took no notice whatsoever of harry or professor dumbledore when she spoke her voice echoed as had done as though it were coming from the depths of the stone basin he put a hex on me professor dumbledore and i was only teasing him sir i only said seen him kissing florence behind the greenhouses last thursday 
 
 but why bertha said dumbledore sadly looking up at the now silently revolving girl why did you have to follow him in the first place 
 
 bertha harry whispered looking up at her is that was that bertha jorkins 
 
 yes said dumbledore prodding the thoughts in the basin again bertha sank back into them and they became silvery and opaque once more that was bertha as i remember her at school 
 
 the silvery light from the pensieve illuminated face and it struck harry suddenly how very old he was looking he knew of course that dumbledore was getting on in years but somehow he never really thought of dumbledore as an old man 
 
 so harry said dumbledore quietly before you got lost in my thoughts you wanted to tell me something 
 
 yes said harry professor i was in divination just now and er i fell asleep 
 
 he hesitated here wondering if a reprimand was coming but dumbledore merely said quite understandable continue 
 
 well i had a dream said harry a dream about lord voldemort he was torturing wormtailyou know who wormtail 
 
 i do know said dumbledore promptly please continue 
 
 voldemort got a letter from an owl he said something like blunder had been repaired he said someone was dead then he said wormtail be fed to the snake there was a snake beside his chair he said he said be feeding me to it instead then he did the cruciatus curse on wormtail and my scar hurt harry said it woke me up it hurt so badly 
 
 dumbledore merely looked at him 
 
 er all said harry 
 
 i see said dumbledore quietly i see now has your scar hurt at any other time this year excepting the time it woke you up over the summer 
 
 no i how did you know it woke me up over the summer said harry astonished 
 
 you are not only correspondent said dumbledore i have also been in contact with him ever since he left hogwarts last year it was i who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay 
 
 dumbledore got up and began walking up and down behind his desk every now and then he placed his wand tip to his temple removed another shining silver thought and added it to the pensieve the thoughts inside began to swirl so fast that harry make out anything clearly it was merely a blur of color 
 
 professor he said quietly after a couple of minutes 
 
 dumbledore stopped pacing and looked at harry 
 
 my apologies he said quietly he sat back down at his desk 
 
 know why my hurting me 
 
 dumbledore looked very intently at harry for a moment and then said i have a theory no more than is my belief that your scar hurts both when lord voldemort is near you and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred 
 
 butwhy 
 
 because you and he are connected by the curse that failed said dumbledore that is no ordinary scar 
 
 so you thinkthat dreamdid it really happen 
 
 it is possible said dumbledore i would say probable harry did you see voldemort 
 
 no said harry just the back of his chair but there have been anything to see would there i mean he got a body has he butbut then how could he have held the wand harry said slowly 
 
 how indeed muttered dumbledore how indeed 
 
 neither dumbledore nor harry spoke for a while dumbledore was gazing across the room and every now and then placing his wand tip to his temple and adding another shining silver thought to the seething mass within the pensieve 
 
 professor harry said at last do you think getting stronger 
 
 voldemort said dumbledore looking at harry over the pensieve it was the characteristic piercing look dumbledore had given him on other occasions and always made harry feel as though dumbledore were seeing right through him in a way that even magical eye could not once again harry i can only give you my suspicions 
 
 dumbledore sighed again and he looked older and wearier than ever 
 
 the years of ascent to power he said were marked with disappearances bertha jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where voldemort was certainly known to be last mr crouch too has disappearedwithin these very grounds and there was a third disappearance one which the ministry i regret to say do not consider of any importance for it concerns a muggle his name was frank bryce he lived in the village where father grew up and he has not been seen since last august you see i read the muggle newspapers unlike most of my ministry friends 
 
 dumbledore looked very seriously at harry 
 
 these disappearances seem to me to be linked the ministry disagrees as you may have heard while waiting outside my office 
 
 harry nodded silence fell between them again dumbledore extracting thoughts every now and then harry felt as though he ought to go but his curiosity held him in his chair 
 
 professor he said again 
 
 yes harry said dumbledore 
 
 ercould i ask you aboutthat court thing i was inin the pensieve 
 
 you could said dumbledore heavily i attended it many times but some trials come back to me more clearly than othersparticularly now 
 
 you know you know the trial you found me in the one with son they talking about parents 
 
 dumbledore gave harry a very sharp look has neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother he said 
 
 harry shook his head wondering as he did so how he could have failed to ask neville this in almost four years of knowing him 
 
 yes they were talking about parents said dumbledore his father frank was an auror just like professor moody he and his wife were tortured for information about whereabouts after he lost his powers as you heard 
 
 so dead said harry quietly 
 
 no said dumbledore his voice full of a bitterness harry had never heard there before they are insane they are both in st hospital for magical maladies and injuries i believe neville visits them with his grandmother during the holidays they do not recognize him 
 
 harry sat there he had never knownnever in four years bothered to find out 
 
 the longbottoms were very popular said dumbledore the attacks on them came after fall from power just when everyone thought they were safe those attacks caused a wave of fury such as i have never known the ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it unfortunately the longbottoms evidence was given their condition none too reliable 
 
 then mr son might not have been involved said harry slowly 
 
 dumbledore shook his head 
 
 as to that i have no idea 
 
 harry sat in silence once more watching the contents of the pensieve swirl there were two more questions he was burning to askbut they concerned the guilt of living people 
 
 er he said mr bagman 
 
 has never been accused of any dark activity since said dumbledore calmly 
 
 right said harry hastily staring at the contents of the pensieve again which were swirling more slowly now that dumbledore had stopped adding thoughts ander 
 
 but the pensieve seemed to be asking his question for him 
 
 face was swimming on the surface again dumbledore glanced down into it and then up at harry 
 
 no more has professor snape he said 
 
 harry looked into light blue eyes and the thing he really wanted to know spilled out of his mouth before he could stop it 
 
 what made you think really stopped supporting voldemort professor 
 
 dumbledore held gaze for a few seconds and then said that harry is a matter between professor snape and myself 
 
 harry knew that the interview was over dumbledore did not look angry yet there was a finality in his tone that told harry it was time to go he stood up and so did dumbledore 
 
 harry he said as harry reached the door please do not speak about parents to anybody else he has the right to let people know when he is ready 
 
 yes professor said harry turning to go 
 
 and 
 
 harry looked back dumbledore was standing over the pensieve his face lit from beneath by its silvery spots of light looking older than ever he stared at harry for a moment and then said good luck with the third task 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter thirty grawpcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the story of fred and flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of legend within a week even those who had been were they had seen the twins umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with dungbombs before zooming out of the doors in the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them harry frequently heard students saying things like honestly some days i just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place or else one more lesson like that and i might just do a weasley 
 
 fred and george had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon for one thing they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing umbridge and filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success eventually the area was roped off and filch gnashing his teeth furiously was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms harry was certain that teachers like mcgonagall or flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but just as in the case of fred and wildfire they seemed to prefer to watch umbridge struggle 
 
 then there were the two large holes in office door through which fred and cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters filch fitted a new door and removed firebolt to the dungeons where it was rumoured umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it however her troubles were far from over 
 
 inspired by fred and example a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of in spite of the new door somebody managed to slip a niffler into office which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects leapt on umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers dungbombs and stink pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform charms on themselves before leaving lessons which ensured them a supply of fresh air even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing goldfish bowls on their heads 
 
 filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands desperate to catch miscreants but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn the inquisitorial squad was attempting to help him but odd things kept happening to its members warrington of the slytherin quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes pansy parkinson to delight missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers 
 
 meanwhile it became clear just how many skiving snackboxes fred and george had managed to sell before leaving hogwarts umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint vomit develop dangerous fevers or else spout blood from both nostrils shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from umbridgeitis after putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding swooning sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves 
 
 but not even the users of the snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos peeves who seemed to have taken parting words deeply to heart cackling madly he soared through the school upending tables bursting out of blackboards toppling statues and vases twice he shut mrs norris inside a suit of armour from which she was rescued yowling loudly by the furious caretaker peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the great hall during breakfast and whenever he fancied a break spent hours at a time floating along after umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke 
 
 none of the staff but filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her indeed a week after fred and departure harry witnessed professor mcgonagall walking right past peeves who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth it unscrews the other way 
 
 to cap matters montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet he remained confused and disorientated and his parents were to be observed one tuesday morning striding up the front drive looking extremely angry 
 
 should we say something said hermione in a worried voice pressing her cheek against the charms window so that she could see mr and mrs montague marching inside about what happened to him in case it helps madam pomfrey cure him 
 
 course not recover said ron indifferently 
 
 anyway more trouble for umbridge it said harry in a satisfied voice 
 
 he and ron both tapped the teacups they were supposed to be charming with their wands spouted four very short legs that could not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair grew four very thin spindly legs that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty trembled for a few seconds then folded causing the cup to crack into two 
 
 reparo said hermione quickly mending cup with a wave of her wand all very well but what if permanently injured 
 
 who cares said ron irritably while his teacup stood up drunkenly again trembling violently at the knees montague have tried to take all those points from gryffindor should he if you want to worry about anyone hermione worry about me 
 
 you she said catching her teacup as it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little legs and replacing it in front of her why should i be worried about you 
 
 when next letter finally gets through screening process said ron bitterly now holding his cup up while its frail legs tried feebly to support its weight going to be in deep trouble i be surprised if sent another howler 
 
 but 
 
 be my fault fred and george left you wait said ron darkly say i stopped them leaving i grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something yeah be all my fault 
 
 well if she say that be very unfair you have done anything but sure she i mean if really true got premises in diagon alley they must have been planning this for ages 
 
 yeah but another thing how did they get premises said ron hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay twitching before him a bit dodgy it need loads of galleons to afford the rent on a place in diagon alley want to know what been up to to get their hands on that sort of gold 
 
 well yes that occurred to me too said hermione allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop been wondering whether mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful 
 
 he said harry curtly 
 
 how do you know said ron and hermione together 
 
 because harry hesitated but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come there was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that fred and george were criminals because they got the gold from me i gave them my triwizard winnings last june 
 
 there was a shocked silence then teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor 
 
 oh harry you she said 
 
 yes i did said harry mutinously and i regret it either i need the gold and be great at running a joke shop 
 
 but this is excellent said ron looking thrilled all your fault harrymum blame me at all can i tell her 
 
 yeah i suppose better said harry dully specially if she thinks receiving stolen cauldrons or something 
 
 hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson but harry had a shrewd suspicion that her was bound to crack before long sure enough once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak may sunshine she fixed harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air 
 
 harry interrupted her before she had even started 
 
 no good nagging me done he said firmly fred and george have got the gold spent a good bit of it too by the sounds of itand i get it back from them and i want to so save your breath hermione 
 
 i going to say anything about fred and george she said in an injured voice 
 
 ron snorted disbelievingly and hermione threw him a very dirty look 
 
 no i she said angrily as a matter of fact i was going to ask harry when going to go back to snape and ask for more occlumency lessons 
 
 heart sank once they had exhausted the subject of fred and dramatic departure which admittedly had taken many hours ron and hermione had wanted to hear news of sirius as harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to sirius in the first place it had been hard to think of what to tell them he had ended up saying truthfully that sirius wanted harry to resume occlumency lessons he had been regretting this ever since hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when harry least expected it 
 
 you tell me stopped having funny dreams hermione said now because ron told me you were muttering in your sleep again last night 
 
 harry threw ron a furious look ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself 
 
 you were only muttering a bit he mumbled apologetically something about just a bit further 
 
 i dreamed i was watching you lot play quidditch harry lied brutally i was trying to get you to stretch out a bit further to grab the quaffle 
 
 ears went red harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure he had not of course dreamed anything of the sort 
 
 last night he had once again made the journey along the department of mysteries corridor he had passed through the circular room then the room full of clicking and dancing light until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelves on which were ranged dusty glass spheres 
 
 he had hurried straight towards row number turned left and run along it it had probably been then that he had spoken aloud just a bit further for he felt his conscious self struggling to wake and before he had reached the end of the row he had found himself lying in bed again gazing up at the canopy of his 
 
 you are trying to block your mind you said hermione looking beadily at harry you are keeping going with your occlumency 
 
 of course i am said harry trying to sound as though this question was insulting but not quite meeting her eye the truth was he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue 
 
 the problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all and when he did his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams he also suspected that part of his mindthe part that often spoke in voicenow felt guilty on the occasions it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door and sought to wake him before he could reach the end 
 
 you know said ron whose ears were still flaming red if montague recover before slytherin play hufflepuff we might be in with a chance of winning the cup 
 
 yeah i so said harry glad of a change of subject 
 
 i mean won one lost oneif slytherin lose to hufflepuff next saturday 
 
 yeah right said harry losing track of what he was agreeing to cho chang had just walked across the courtyard determinedly not looking at him 
 
 the final match of the quidditch season gryffindor versus ravenclaw was to take place on the last weekend of may although slytherin had been narrowly defeated by hufflepuff in their last match gryffindor were not daring to hope for victory due mainly though of course nobody said it to him to abysmal record he however seemed to have found a new optimism 
 
 i mean i get any worse can i he told harry and hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match nothing to lose now is there 
 
 you know said hermione as she and harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd i think ron might do better without fred and george around they never exactly gave him a lot of confidence 
 
 luna lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head 
 
 oh gosh i forgot said hermione watching the eagle flapping its wings as luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing slytherins cho will be playing she 
 
 harry who had not forgotten this merely grunted 
 
 they found seats in the topmost row of the stands it was a fine ckar day ron could not wish for better and harry found himself hoping against hope that ron would not give the slytherins cause for more rousing choruses of weasley is our king 
 
 lee jordan who had been very dispirited since fred and george had left was commentating as usual as the teams zoomed out on to the pitch he named the players with something less than his usual gusto 
 
 bradley davies chang he said and harry felt his stomach perform less of a back flip more a feeble lurch as cho walked out on to the pitch her shiny black hair rippling in the slight was not sure what he wanted to happen any more except that he could not stand any more rows even the sight of her chatting animatedly to roger davies as they prepared to mount their brooms caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy 
 
 and off said lee and davies takes the quaffle immediately ravenclaw captain davies with the quaffle he dodges johnson he dodges bell he dodges spinnet as well going straight for goal going to shootandand lee swore very loudly and scored 
 
 harry and hermione groaned with the rest of the gryffindors predictably horribly the slytherins on the other side of the stands began to sing 
 
 weasley cannot save a thing 
 
 he cannot block a single ring 
 
 harry said a hoarse voice in ear hermione 
 
 harry looked round and saw enormous bearded face sticking between the seats apparently he had squeezed his way all along the row behind for the first and he had just passed had a ruffled flattened look about them for some reason hagrid was bent double as though anxious not to be seen though he was still at least four feet taller than everybody else 
 
 listen he whispered can yeh come with me now while watchin the match 
 
 er it wait hagrid asked harry till the match is over 
 
 no said hagrid no harry gotta be now while lookin the other way please 
 
 nose was gently dripping blood his eyes were both blackened harry had not seen him this since his return to the school he looked utterly woebegone 
 
 course said harry at once course come 
 
 he and hermione edged back along their row of seats causing much grumbling among the students who had to stand up for them the people in row were not complaining merely attempting to make themselves as small as possible 
 
 i ppreciate this you two i really do said hagrid as they reached the stairs he kept looking around nervously as they descended towards the lawn below i jus hope she doesn notice us goin 
 
 you mean umbridge said harry she got her whole inquisitorial squad sitting with her you see she must be expecting trouble at the match 
 
 yeah well a bit o trouble wouldn hurt said hagrid pausing to peer around the edge of the stands to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin was deserted give us more time 
 
 what is it hagrid said hermione looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face as they hurried across the grass towards the edge of the forest 
 
 see in a mo said hagrid looking over his shoulder as a great roar rose from the stands behind them heydid someone jus score 
 
 be ravenclaw said harry heavily 
 
 good good said hagrid distractedly good 
 
 they had to jog to keep up with him as he strode across the lawn looking around with every other step when they reached his cabin hermione turned automatically left towards the front door hagrid however walked straight past it into the shade of the trees on the outermost edge of the forest where he picked up a crossbow that was leaning against a tree when he realised they were no longer with him he turned 
 
 goin in here he said jerking his shaggy head behind him 
 
 into the forest said hermione perplexed 
 
 yeah said hagrid now quick before spotted 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other then ducked into the cover of the trees behind hagrid who was already striding away from them into the green gloom his crossbow over his arm harry and hermione ran to catch up with him 
 
 hagrid why are you armed said harry 
 
 jus a precaution said hagrid shrugging his massive shoulders 
 
 you bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thestrals said hermione timidly 
 
 nah well we weren goin in so far then said hagrid an anyway tha was before firenze left the forest wasn it 
 
 why does firenze leaving make a difference asked hermione curiously 
 
 cause the other centaurs are good an riled at me why said hagrid quietly glancing around they used ter bewell yeh couldn call em friendlybut we got on all righ kept emselves to emselves bu always turned up if i wanted a word not any more 
 
 he sighed deeply 
 
 firenze said angry because he went to work for dumbledore harry said tripping on a protruding root because he was busy watching profile 
 
 yeah said hagrid heavily well angry doesn cover it ruddy livid if i hadn stepped in i reckon kicked firenze ter death 
 
 they attacked him said hermione sounding shocked 
 
 yep said hagrid gruffly forcing his way through several branches he had half the herd on to him 
 
 and you stopped it said harry amazed and impressed by yourself 
 
 course i did stand by an watch em kill im could i said hagrid lucky i was passin really an thought firenze mighta remembered tha before he started sendin me stupid he added hotly and unexpectedly 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other startled but hagrid scowling did not elaborate 
 
 anyway he said breathing a little more heavily than usud since then the other bin livid with me an the trouble is got a lot of influence in the forest cleverest creatures in here 
 
 is that why here hagrid asked hermione the centaurs 
 
 ah no said hagrid shaking his head dismissively no not them well o course they could complicate the problem yeah but see what i mean in a bit 
 
 on this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little ahead taking one stride for every three of theirs so that they had great trouble keeping up with him 
 
 the path was becoming increasingly overgrown and the trees grew so closely together as they walked further and further into the forest that it was as dark as dusk they were soon a long way past the clearing where hagrid had shown them the thestrals but harry felt no sense of unease until hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of trees towards the dark heart of the forest 
 
 hagrid said harry fighting his way through thickly knotted brambles over which hagrid had stepped with ease and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasion he had stepped off the forest path where are we going 
 
 bit further said hagrid over his shoulder harry we need ter keep together now 
 
 it was a great struggle to keep up with hagrid what with branches and thickets of thorn through which hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs but which snagged harry and robes frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches they were so deep in the forest now that sometimes all harry could see of hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence the breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement even though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow caused harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit it occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature their absence struck him as rather ominous 
 
 hagrid would it be all right if we lit our wands said hermione quietly 
 
 er all righ hagrid whispered back in fact 
 
 he stopped suddenly and turned around hermione walked right into him and was knocked over backwards harry caught her just before she hit the forest floor 
 
 maybe we bes jus stop fer a momen so i can fill yeh in said hagrid before we ge there like 
 
 good said hermione as harry set her back on her feet they both murmured lumos and their ignited face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beams and harry saw again that he looked nervous and sad 
 
 righ said hagrid well see the thing is 
 
 he took a great breath 
 
 well a good chance goin ter be gettin the sack any day now he said 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other then back at him 
 
 but lasted this long hermione said tentatively what makes you think 
 
 umbridge reckons it was me that put tha niffler in her office 
 
 and was it said harry before he could stop himself 
 
 no it ruddy well wasn said hagrid indignantly ter do with magical creatures an she thinks got somethin ter do with me yeh know bin lookin fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since i got back i don wan ter go o course but if it wasn fer well the special circumstances abou ter explain to yeh leave righ now before go the chance ter do it in front o the whole school like she did with trelawney 
 
 harry and hermione both made noises of protest but hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hands 
 
 not the end o the world be able ter help dumbledore once outta here i can be useful ter the order an you have get through yer exams fine 
 
 his voice trembled and broke 
 
 don worry abou me he said hastily as hermione made to pat his arm he pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eyes with it look i wouldn be tellin yer this at all if i didn have ter see if i go well i can leave withou withou tellin someone because need yeh two ter help me an ron if willin 
 
 of course help you said harry at once what do you want us to do 
 
 hagrid gave a great sniff and patted harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force harry was knocked sideways into a tree 
 
 i knew say yes said hagrid into his handkerchief but i won never forget well jus a little bit further through here watch yerselves now nettles 
 
 they walked on in silence for another fifteen minutes harry had opened his mouth to ask how much further they had to go when hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop 
 
 really easy he said softly very quiet now 
 
 they crept forwards and harry saw that they were facing a large smooth mound of earth nearly as tall as hagrid that he thought with a jolt of dread was sure to be the lair of some enormous animal trees had been ripped up at the roots all around the mound so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heaps of trunks and boughs that formed a kind of fence or barricade behind which harry hermione and hagrid now stood 
 
 sleepin breathed hagrid 
 
 sure enough harry could hear a distant rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lungs at work he glanced sideways at hermione who was gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open she looked utterly terrified 
 
 hagrid she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature who is he 
 
 harry found this an odd question what is it was the one he had been planning on asking 
 
 hagrid you told us said hermione her wand now shaking in her hand you told us none of them wanted to come 
 
 harry looked from her to hagrid and then as realisation hit him he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror 
 
 the great mound of earth on which he hermione and hagrid could easily have stood was moving slowly up and down in time with the deep grunting breathing it was not a mound at all it was the curved back of what was clearly 
 
 wellnohe didn want ter come said hagrid sounding desperate but i had ter bring him hermione i had ter 
 
 but why asked hermione who sounded as though she wanted to cry whywhatoh hagrid 
 
 i knew if i jus got him back said hagrid sounding close to tears himself taught him a few be able ter take him outside an show harmless 
 
 harmless said hermione shrilly and hagrid made frantic hushing noises with his hands as the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in its sleep been hurting you all this time he why had all these injuries 
 
 he don know his own strength said hagrid earnestly an gettin better not fightin so much any more 
 
 so this is why it took you two months to get home said hermione distractedly oh hagrid why did you bring him back if he want to come he have been happier with his own people 
 
 they were all bullyin him hermione cause so small said hagrid 
 
 small said hermione small 
 
 hermione i couldn leave him said hagrid tears now trickling down his bruised face into his beard my brother 
 
 hermione simply stared at him her mouth open 
 
 hagrid when you say brother said harry slowly do you mean 
 
 well amended hagrid turns out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad an she went an had grawp here 
 
 grawp said harry 
 
 yeah well what it sounds like when he says his name said hagrid anxiously he don speak a lot of english bin tryin ter teach him anyway she don seem ter have liked him much she liked me see with giantesses what counts is producin good big kids and always been a bit on the runty side fer a sixteen foot 
 
 oh yes tiny said hermione with a kind of hysterical sarcasm absolutely minuscule 
 
 he was bein kicked aroun by all o themi jus couldn leave him 
 
 did madame maxime want to bring him back asked harry 
 
 shewell she could see it was right importan ter me said hagrid twisting his enormous hands she got a bit tired o him after a while i must admit so we split up on the journey home she promised not ter tell anyone though 
 
 how on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing said harry 
 
 well why it took so long see said hagrid could travel by nigh an through wild country an stuff course he covers the ground pretty well when he wants ter but he kep wantin ter go back 
 
 oh hagrid why on earth you let him said hermione flopping down on to a ripped up tree and burying her face in her hands what do you think going to do with a violent giant who even want to be here 
 
 well now a bit harsh said hagrid still twisting his hands agitatedly admit he mighta taken a couple o swings at me when bin in a bad mood but gettin better loads better settlin down well 
 
 what are those ropes for then harry asked 
 
 he had just noticed ropes thick as saplings stretching from around the trunks of the largest nearby trees towards the place where grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them 
 
 you have to keep him tied up said hermione faintly 
 
 well yeah said hagrid looking anxious like i sayhe doesn really know is own strength 
 
 harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the forest 
 
 so what is it you want harry and ron and me to do hermione asked apprehensively 
 
 look after him said hagrid croakily after gone 
 
 harry and hermione exchanged miserable looks harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised hagrid that he would do whatever he asked 
 
 whatwhat does that involve exactly hermione enquired 
 
 not food or anythin said hagrid eagerly he can get his own food no problem birds an deer an stuff no company he needs i xxjus knew someone was carryin on trying ter help him a bit teachin him yeh know 
 
 harry said nothing but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them unlike hagrid who simply looked like an oversized human grawp looked strangely misshapen what harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognised as head it was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head and was almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling hair the colour of bracken the rim of a single large fleshy ear was visible on top of the head which seemed to sit rather like uncle directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between the back under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together was very broad and as grawp slept it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins the legs were curled up under the body harry could see the soles of enormous filthy bare feet large as sledges resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest floor 
 
 you want us to teach him harry said in a hollow voice he now understood what warning had meant his attempt is not working he would do better to abandon course the other creatures who lived in the forest would have heard fruitless attempts to teach grawp english 
 
 yeaheven if yeh jus talk ter him a bit said hagrid hopefully cause i reckon if he can talk ter people understand more that we all like im really an want im ter stay 
 
 harry looked at hermione who peered back at him from between the fingers over her face 
 
 kind of makes you wish we had norbert back it he said and she gave a very shaky laugh 
 
 do it then said hagrid who did not seem to have caugit what harry had just said 
 
 said harry already bound by his promise try hagrid 
 
 i knew i could count on yeh harry hagrid said beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again an i don wan yeh ter put yerself out too much like i know got exams if yeh could jus nip down here in yer invisibility cloak maybe once a week an have a little chat with im wake im up thenintroduce yeh 
 
 whano said hermione jumping up hagrid no wake him really we need 
 
 but hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding towards grawp when he was about ten feet away he lifted a long broken bough from the ground smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at harry and hermione then poked grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough 
 
 the giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away in front of harry and hermione meanwhile the gigantic grawp was rising from the ground which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself on to his knees he turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him 
 
 all righ grawpy said hagrid in a cheery voice backing away with the long bough raised ready to poke grawp again had a nice sleep eh 
 
 harry and hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted they looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing it was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball the nose was stubby and shapeless the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of the eyes small by giant standards were a muddy and just now were together with sleep grawp raised dirty knuckles each as big as a cricket ball to his eyes rubbed vigorously then without warning pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility 
 
 oh my harry heard hermione squeal terrified beside him 
 
 the trees to which the other ends of the ropes around wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously he was as hagrid had said at least sixteen feet tall gazing blearily around grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella seized a nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself 
 
 anyway grawpy shouted hagrid looking up apprehensively in case of further falling eggs brought some friends ter meet yeh remember i told yeh i might remember when i said i might have ter go on a little trip an leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit remember that grawpy 
 
 but grawp merely gave another low roar it was hard to say whether he was listening to hagrid or whether he even recognised the sounds hagrid was making as speech he had now seized the top of the pine tree and was pulling it towards him evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go 
 
 now grawpy don do that shouted hagrid how you ended up pullin up the others 
 
 and sure enough harry could see the earth around the roots beginning to crack 
 
 i got company for yeh hagrid shouted company see look down yeh big buffoon i brought yeh some friends 
 
 oh hagrid moaned hermione but hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave knee a sharp poke 
 
 the giant let go of the top of the tree which swayed alarmingly and deluged hagrid with a rain of pine needles and looked down 
 
 this said hagrid hastening over to where harry and herrmone stood is harry grawp harry potter he migh be comin ter visit yeh if i have ter go away understand 
 
 the giant had only just realised that harry and hermione were there they watched in great trepidation as he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them 
 
 an this is hermione see her hagrid hesitated turning to hermione he said would yeh mind if he called yeh hermy hermione a difficult name fer him ter remember 
 
 no not at all squeaked hermione 
 
 this is hermy grawp an gonna be comin an all tha nice eh two friends fer yeh tergrawpy no 
 
 hand had shot out of nowhere towards hermione harry seized her and pulled her backwards behind the tree so that fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air 
 
 bad boy grawpy they heard hagrid yelling as hermione clung to harry behind the tree shaking and whimpering very bad boy yeh don grabouch 
 
 harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw hagrid lying on his back his hand over his nose grawp apparently losing interest had straightened up and was again engaged in pulling back the pine as far as it would go 
 
 righ said hagrid thickly getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow well there yeh are met him an an now know yeh when yeh come back yeah well 
 
 he looked up at grawp who was now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face the roots were creaking as he ripped them away from the ground 
 
 well i reckon enough fer one day said hagrid go back now shall we 
 
 harry and hermione nodded hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and still pinching his nose led the way back into the trees 
 
 nobody spoke for a while not even when they heard the distant crash that meant grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last face was pale and set harry could not think of a single thing to say what on earth was going to happen when somebody found out that hagrid had hidden grawp in the forbidden forest and he had promised that he ron and hermione would continue totally pointless attempts to civilise the giant how could hagrid even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monsters were loveably harmless fool himself that grawp would ever be fit to mix with humans 
 
 hold it said hagrid abruptly just as harry and hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him he pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow harry and hermione raised their wands now that they had stopped walking they too could hear movement close by 
 
 oh blimey said hagrid quietly 
 
 i thought we told you hagrid said a deep male voice that you are no longer welcome here 
 
 a naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating towards them through the dappled green then they saw that his waist joined smoothly into a chestnut body this centaur had a proud face and long black hair like hagrid he was armed a quiverful of arrows and a longbow were slung over his shoulders 
 
 how are yeh magorian said hagrid warily 
 
 the trees behind the centaur rustled and four or five more centaurs emerged behind him harry recognised the and bearded bane whom he had met nearly four years ago on the same night he had met firenze bane gave no sign that he had ever seen harry before 
 
 so he said with a nasty inflection in his voice before turning immediately to magorian we agreed i think what we would do if this human ever showed his face in the forest again 
 
 this human now am i said hagrid testily jus fer stoppin all of yeh committin murder 
 
 you ought not to have meddled hagrid said magorian our ways are not yours nor are our laws firenze has betrayed and dishonoured us 
 
 i dunno how yeh work that out said hagrid impatiently done nothin except help albus dumbledore 
 
 firenze has entered into servitude to humans said a grey centaur with a hard deeply lined face 
 
 servitude said hagrid scathingly doin dumbledore a favour is all 
 
 he is peddling our knowledge and secrets among humans said magorian quietly there can be no return from such disgrace 
 
 if yeh say so said hagrid shrugging but personally i think makin a big mistake 
 
 as are you human said bane coming back into our forest when we warned you 
 
 now yeh listen ter me said hagrid angrily have less of the our forest if all the same ter yeh not up ter yeh who comes an goes in here 
 
 no more is it up to you hagrid said magorian smoothly i shall let you pass today because you are accompanied by your young 
 
 not his interrupted bane contemptuously students magorian from up at the school they have probably already profited from the traitor teachings 
 
 nevertheless said magorian calmly the slaughter of foals is a terrible crimewe do not touch the innocent today hagrid you pass henceforth stay away from this place you forfeited the friendship of the centaurs when you helped the traitor firenze escape us 
 
 i won be kept outta the fores by a bunch o old mules like yeh said hagrid loudly 
 
 hagrid said hermione in a and terrified voice as both bane and the grey centaur pawed at the ground go please go 
 
 hagrid moved forwards but his crossbow was still raised and his eyes were still fixed threateningly upon magorian 
 
 we know what you are keeping in the forest hagrid magorian called after them as the centaurs slipped out of sight and our tolerance is waning 
 
 hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to magorian 
 
 tolerate im as long as here as much his forest as yours he yelled as harry and hermione both pushed with all their might against moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forwards still scowling he looked down his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him he seemed not to have felt it 
 
 calm down you two he said turning to walk on while they parted along behind him ruddy old mules though eh 
 
 hagrid said hermione breathlessly skirting the patch of nettles they had passed on their way there if the centaurs want humans in the forest it really look as though harry and i will be able 
 
 ah you heard what they said said hagrid dismissively they hurt foalsi mean kids anyway we can let ourselves be pushed aroun by that lot 
 
 nice try harry murmured to hermione who looked crestfallen 
 
 at last they rejoined the path and after another ten minutes the trees began to thin they were able to see patches of clear blue sky again and in the distance the definite sounds of cheering and shouting 
 
 was that another goal asked hagrid pausing in the shelter of the trees as the quidditch stadium came into view or reckon the match is over 
 
 i know said hermione miserably harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear her hair was full of twigs and leaves her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms he knew he must look little better 
 
 i reckon over yeh know said hagrid still squinting towards the stadium look people comin out alreadyif yeh two hurry be able ter blend in with the crowd an no know yeh there 
 
 good idea said harry well see you later then hagrid 
 
 i believe him said hermione in a very unsteady voice the moment they were out of earshot of hagrid i believe him i really believe him 
 
 calm down said harry 
 
 calm down she said feverishly a giant a giant in the forest and supposed to give him english lessons always assuming of course we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out him 
 
 we got to do anything yet harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice as they joined a stream of jabbering hufflepuffs heading back towards the castle not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen 
 
 oh come off it harry said hermione angrily stopping dead in her tracks so that the people behind had to swerve to avoid her of course going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest after what just seen who can blame umbridge 
 
 there was a pause in which harry glared at her and her eyes filled slowly with tears 
 
 you mean that said harry quietly 
 
 no well all right i she said wiping her eyes angrily but why does he have to make life so difficult for himselffor us 
 
 i dunno 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 he let the quaffle in 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 
 
 and i wish stop singing that stupid song said hermione miserably they gloated enough 
 
 a great tide of students was moving up the sloping lawns from the pitch 
 
 oh get in before we have to meet the slytherins said hermione 
 
 weasley can save anything 
 
 he never leaves a single ring 
 
 why gryffindors all sing 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 hermione said harry slowly 
 
 the song was growing louder but it was issuing not from a crowd of slytherins but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly towards the castle bearing a solitary figure upon its many shoulders 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 he let the quaffle in 
 
 weasley is our king 
 
 no said hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 yes said harry loudly 
 
 harry hermione yelled ron waving the silver quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself we did it we won 
 
 they beamed up at him as he passed there was a scrum at the door of the castle and head got rather badly bumped on the lintel but nobody seemed to want to put him down still singing the crowd squeezed itself into the entrance hall and out of sight harry and hermione watched them go beaming until the last echoing strains of weasley is our king died away then they turned to each other their smiles fading 
 
 save our news till tomorrow shall we said harry 
 
 yes all right said hermione wearily not in any hurry 
 
 they climbed the steps together at the front doors both instinctively looked back at the forbidden forest harry was not sure whether or not it was his imagination but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of birds erupting into the air over the tree tops in the distance almost as though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the roots

 all lessons were suspended all examinations postponed some students were hurried away from hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of daysthe patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following death and zacharias smith was escorted from the castle by his father seamus finnigan on the other hand refused to accompany his mother home they had a shouting match in the entrance hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral she had difficulty in finding a bed in hogsmeade seamus told harry and ron for wizards and witches were pouring into the village preparing to pay their last respects to dumbledore 
 
 some excitement was caused among the younger students who had never seen it before when a carriage the size of a house pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the forest harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting arms meanwhile a delegation of ministry officials including the minister for magic himself was being accommodated within the castle harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them he was sure that sooner or later he would be asked again to account for last excursion from hogwarts 
 
 harry ron hermione and ginny were spending all of their time together the beautiful weather seemed to mock them harry could imagine how it would have been if dumbledore had not died and they had had this time together at the very end of the year examinations finished the pressure of homework lifted and hour by hour he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say doing what he knew it was right to do because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort 
 
 they visited the hospital wing twice a day neville had been discharged but bill remained under madam care his scars were as bad as ever in truth he now bore a distinct resemblance to moody though thankfully with both eyes and legs but in personality he seemed just the same as ever all that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks 
 
 so eet ees lucky e is marrying me said fleur happily plumping up pillows because ze british overcook their meat i ave always said this 
 
 i suppose just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her sighed ginny later that evening as she harry ron and hermione sat beside the open window of the gryffindor common room looking out over the twilit grounds 
 
 not that bad said harry ugly though he added hastily as ginny raised her eyebrows and she let out a reluctant giggle 
 
 well i suppose if mum can stand it i can 
 
 anyone else we know died ron asked hermione who was perusing the evening prophet 
 
 hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice 
 
 no she said reprovingly folding up the newspaper still looking for snape but no sign 
 
 of course there said harry who became angry every time this subject cropped up they find snape till they find voldemort and seeing as never managed to do that in all this time 
 
 going to go to bed yawned ginny i been sleeping that well since well i could do with some sleep 
 
 she kissed harry ron looked away pointedly waved at the other two and departed for the girls dormitories the moment the door had closed behind her hermione leaned forwards towards harry with a most look on her face 
 
 harry i found something out this morning in the library 
 
 said harry sitting up straight 
 
 he did not feel the way he had so often felt before excited curious burning to get to the bottom of a mystery he simply knew that the task of discovering the truth about the real horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little further along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him the path that he and dumbledore had set out upon together and which he now knew he would have to journey alone there might still be as many as four horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that voldemort could be killed he kept reciting their names to himself as though by listing them he could bring them within reach the locket the cup the snake something of or the locket the cup the snake something of or 
 
 this mantra seemed to pulse through mind as he fell asleep at night and his dreams were thick with cups lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach though dumbledore helpfully offered harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb 
 
 he had shown hermione the note inside the locket the morning after death and although she had not immediately recognised the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do 
 
 no she said sadly been trying harry but i found anything there are a couple of reasonably wizards with those initialsrosalind antigone bungs rupert axebanger brookstanton but they seem to fit at all judging by that note the person who stole the horcrux knew voldemort and i find a shred of evidence that bungs or axebanger ever had anything to do with him no actually about well snape 
 
 she looked nervous even saying the name again 
 
 what about him asked harry heavily slumping back in his chair 
 
 well just that i was sort of right about the prince business she said tentatively 
 
 have to rub it in hermione how do you think i feel about that now 
 
 nonoharry i mean that she said hastily looking around to check that they were not being overheard just that i was right about eileen prince once owning the book you see she was mother 
 
 i thought she much of a looker said ron hermione ignored him 
 
 i was going through the rest of the old prophets and there was a tiny announcement about eileen prince marrying a man called tobias snape and then later an announcement saying that given birth to a 
 
 murderer spat harry 
 
 well yes said hermione so i was sort of right snape must have been proud of being half a prince you see tobias snape was a muggle from what it said in the prophet 
 
 yeah that fits said harry play up the side so he could get in with lucius malfoy and the rest of them just like voldemort mother muggie father ashamed of his parentage trying to make himself feared using the dark arts gave himself an impressive new namelord voldemortthe princehow could dumbledore have missed 
 
 he broke off looking out of the window he could not stop himself dwelling upon inexcusable trust in snape but as hermione had just inadvertently reminded him he harry had been taken in just the same in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever who had helped him so much 
 
 helped him it was an almost unendurable thought now 
 
 i still get why he turn you in for using that book said ron he known where you were getting it all from 
 
 he knew said harry bitterly he knew when i used sectumsempra he really need legilimency he might even have known before then with slughom talking about how brilliant i was at potions have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard should he 
 
 but why he turn you in 
 
 i think he wanted to associate himself with that book said hermione i think dumbledore would have liked it very much if known and even if snape pretended it been his slughom would have recognised his writing at once anyway the book was left in old classroom and bet dumbledore knew his mother was called prince 
 
 i shown the book to dumbledore said harry all that time he was showing me how voldemort was evil even when he was at school and i had proof snape was too 
 
 evil is a strong word said hermione quietly 
 
 you were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous 
 
 trying to say harry that pulling too much blame on yourself i thought the prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humour but i would never have guessed he was a potential killer 
 
 none of us guessed snape would you know said ron 
 
 silence fell between them each of them lost in their own thoughts but harry was sure that they like him were thinking about the following morning when body would be laid to rest harry had never attended a funeral before there had been no body to bury when sirius had died he did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see about how he would feel he wondered whether death would be more real to him once the funeral was over though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him there were blank stretches of numbness where despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle he still found it difficult to believe that dumbledore had really gone admittedly he had not as he had with sirius looked desperately for some kind of loophole some way that dumbledore would come back he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake horcrux which he now carried with him everywhere not as a talisman but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do 
 
 harry rose early to pack the next day the hogwarts express would be leaving an hour after the funeral downstairs he found the mood in the great hall subdued everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed very hungry professor mcgonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty chair was deserted too harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast but place had been unceremoniously filled by rufus scrimgeour harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the hall harry had the uncomfortable feeling that scrimgeour was looking for him among entourage harry spotted the red hair and glasses of percy weasley ron gave no sign that he was aware of percy apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom 
 
 over at the slytherin table crabbe and goyle were muttering together hulking boys though they were they looked oddly lonely without the tall pale figure of malfoy between them bossing them around harry had not spared malfoy much thought his animosity was all for snape but he had not forgotten the fear in voice on that tower top nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other death eaters arrived harry did not believe that malfoy would have killed dumbledore he despised malfoy still for his infatuation with the dark arts but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike where harry wondered was malfoy now and what was voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parents 
 
 thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from ginny professor mcgonagall had risen to her feet and the mournful hum in the hall died away at once 
 
 it is nearly time she said please follow your heads of house out into the grounds gryffindors after me 
 
 they filed out from behind their benches in near silence harry glimpsed slughorn at the head of the slytherin column wearing magnificent long robes embroidered with silver he had never seen professor sprout head of the hufflepuffs looking so clean there was not a single patch on her hat and when they reached the entrance hall they found madam pince standing beside filch she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs 
 
 they were heading as harry saw when he stepped out on to the stone steps from the front doors towards the lake the warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed professor mcgonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows an aisle ran down the centre of them there was a marble table standing at the front all chairs facing it it was the most beautiful day 
 
 an extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs shabby and smart old and young most harry did not recognise but there were a few that he did including members of the order of the phoenix kingsley shacklebolt moody tonks her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink remus lupin with whom she seemed to be holding hands mr and mrs weasley bill supported by fleur and followed by fred and george who were wearing jackets of black dragonskin then there was madame maxime who took up chairs on her own tom the landlord of the leaky cauldron arabella figg squib neighbour the hairy bass player from the wizarding group the weird bisters ernie prang driver of the knight bus madam malkin of the robe shop in diagon alley and some people whom harry merely knew by sight such as the barman of the head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the hogwarts express the castle ghosts were there too barely visible in the bright sunlight discernible only when they moved shimmering insubstantially in the gleaming air 
 
 harry ron hermione and ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake people were whispering to each other it sounded like a breeze in the grass but the birdsong was louder by far the crowd continued to swell with a great rush of affection for both of them harry saw neville being helped into a seat by luna they alone of all the da had responded to summons the night that dumbledore had died and harry knew why they were the ones who had missed the da most probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting 
 
 cornelius fudge walked past them towards the front rows his expression miserable twirling his green bowler hat as usual harry next recognised rita skeeter who he was infuriated to see had a notebook clutched in her hand and then with a worse jolt of fury dolores umbridge an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face a black velvet bow set atop her curls at the sight of the centaur firenze who was standing like a sentinel near the edge she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away 
 
 the staff were seated at last harry could see scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with professor mcgonagall he wondered whether scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that dumbledore was dead but then he heard music strange otherworldly music and he forgot his dislike of the ministry in looking around for the source of it he was not the only one many heads were turning searching a little alarmed 
 
 in there whispered ginny in ear 
 
 and he saw them in the clear green sunlit water inches below the surface reminding him horribly of the inferi a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand their pallid faces rippling their purplish hair flowing all around them the music made the hair on neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant it spoke very clearly of loss and of despair as he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they at least were sorry for passing then ginny nudged him again and he looked round 
 
 hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs he was crying quite silently his face gleaming with tears and in his arms wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars was what harry knew to be body a sharp pain rose in throat at this sight for a moment the strange music and the knowledge that body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day ron looked white and shocked tears were falling thick and fast into both ginny and laps 
 
 they could not see clearly what was happening at the front hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table now he retreated down the aisle blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some including harry saw dolores umbridge but harry knew that dumbledore would not have cared he tried to make a friendly gesture to hagrid as he passed but eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going harry glanced at the back row to which hagrid was heading and realised what was guiding him for there dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee was the giant grawp his great ugly head bowed docile almost human hagrid sat down next to his and grawp patted hagrid hard on the head so that his chair legs sank into the ground harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh but then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again 
 
 a little man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of body harry could not hear what he was saying odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of beads nobility of spirit intellectual contribution greatness of heart it did not mean very much it had little to do with dumbledore as harry had known him he suddenly remembered idea of a few words nitwit oddment blubber and tweak and again had to suppress a grin what was the matter with him 
 
 there was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen too he remembered dumbledore crouching at the edge two years ago very close to where harry now sat and conversing in mermish with the merchieftainess harry wondered where dumbledore had learned mermish there was so much he had never asked him so much he should have said 
 
 and then without warning it swept over him the dreadful truth more completely and undeniably than it had until now dumbledore was dead gone he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes he looked away from ginny and the others and stared out over the lake towards the forest as the little man in black droned on there was movement among the trees the centaurs had come to pay their respects too they did not move into the open but harry saw them standing quite still in shadow watching the wizards their bows hanging at their sides and harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then voldemort and how he had faced him and how he and dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter it was important dumbledore said to fight and fight again and keep fighting for only then could evil be kept at bay though never quite eradicated 
 
 and harry saw very clearly as be sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one his mother his father his godfather and finally dumbledore all determined to protect him but now that was over he could not let anybody else stand between him and voldemort he must abandon for ever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one that the shelter of a arms meant that nothing could hurt him there was no waking from his nightmare no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really that it was all in his imagination the last and greatest of his protectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before 
 
 the little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet he expected speeches probably from the minister but nobody moved 
 
 then several people screamed bright white flames had erupted around body and the table upon which it lay higher and higher they rose obscuring the body white smoke spiralled into the air and made strange shapes harry thought for one moment that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue but next second the fire had vanished in its place was a white marble tomb encasing body and the table on which he had rested 
 
 there were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air but they fell far short of the crowd it was harry knew the centaurs tribute he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees likewise the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view 
 
 harry looked at ginny ron and hermione face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding him face was glazed with tears but ginny was no longer crying she met gaze with the same hard blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the quidditch cup in his absence and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly and that when he told her what he was going to do now she would not say be careful or do it but accept his decision because she would not have expected anything less of him and so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since dumbledore had died 
 
 ginny listen he said very quietly as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet i be involved with you any more got to stop seeing each other we be together 
 
 she said with an oddly twisted smile for some stupid noble reason it 
 
 been like like something out of someone life these last few weeks with you said harry but i we got things to do alone now 
 
 she did not cry she simply looked at him 
 
 voldemort uses people his enemies are close to already used you as bait once and that was just because my best sister think how much danger be in if we keep this up know find out try and get to me through you 
 
 what if i care said ginny fiercely 
 
 i care said harry how do you think feel if this was your funeral and it was my fault 
 
 she looked away from him over the lake 
 
 i never really gave up on you she said not really i always hoped hermione told me to get on with life maybe go out with some other people relax a bit around you because i never used to be able to talk if you were in the room remember and she thought you might take a bit more notice if i was a bit moremyself 
 
 smart girl that hermione said harry trying to smile i just wish asked you sooner we had ages months years maybe 
 
 but been too busy saving the wizarding world said ginny well i say surprised i knew this would happen in the end i knew you be happy unless you were hunting voldemort maybe why i like you so much 
 
 harry could not bear to hear these things nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her ron he saw was now holding hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder tears dripping from the end of his own long nose with a miserable gesture harry got up turned his back on ginny and on tomb and walked away around the lake moving felt much more bearable than sitting still just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the horcruxes and kill voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it 
 
 harry 
 
 he turned rufus scrimgeour was limping rapidly towards him around the bank leaning on his walking stick 
 
 been hoping to have a word do you mind if i walk a little way with you 
 
 no said harry indifferently and set off again 
 
 harry this was a dreadful tragedy said scrimgeour quietly i cannot tell you how appalled i was to hear of it dumbledore was a very great wizard we had our disagreements as you know but no one knows better than i 
 
 what do you want asked harry flatly 
 
 scrimgeour looked annoyed but as before hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding 
 
 you are of course devastated he said i know that you were very close to dumbledore i think you may have been his favourite ever pupil the bond between the two of you 
 
 what do you want harry repeated coming to a halt 
 
 scrimgeour stopped too leaned on his stick and stared at harry his expression shrewd now 
 
 the word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died 
 
 whose word said harry 
 
 somebody stupefied a death eater on top of the tower after dumbledore died there were also two broomsticks up there the ministry can add two and two harry 
 
 glad to hear it said harry well where i went with dumbledore and what we did is my business he want people to know 
 
 such loyalty is admirable of course said scrimgeour who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty but dumbledore is gone harry gone 
 
 he will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him said harry smiling in spite of himself 
 
 my dear boy even dumbledore cannot return from the 
 
 i am not saying he can you understand but got nothing to tell you 
 
 scrimgeour hesitated then said in what was evidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy the ministry can offer you all sorts of protection you know harry i would be delighted to place a couple of my aurors at your service 
 
 harry laughed 
 
 voldemort wants to kill me himself and aurors stop him so thanks for the offer but no thanks 
 
 so said scrimgeour his voice cold now the request i made of you at christmas 
 
 what request oh yeah the one where i tell the world what a great job doing in exchange for 
 
 for raising morale snapped scrimgeour 
 
 harry considered him for a moment 
 
 released stan shunpike yet 
 
 scrimgeour turned a nasty purple colour highly reminiscent of uncle vernon 
 
 i see you are 
 
 man through and through said harry right 
 
 scrimgeour glared at him for another moment then turned and limped away without another word harry could see percy and the rest of the ministry delegation waiting for him casting nervous glances at the sobbing hagrid and grawp who were still in their seats ron and hermione were hurrying towards harry passing scrimgeour going in the opposite direction harry turned and walked slowly on waiting for them to catch up which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times 
 
 what did scrimgeour want hermione whispered 
 
 same as he wanted at christmas shrugged harry wanted me to give him inside information on dumbledore and be the new poster boy 
 
 ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment then he said loudly to hermione look let me go back and hit percy 
 
 no she said firmly grabbing his arm 
 
 make me feel better 
 
 harry laughed even hermione grinned a little though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle 
 
 i bear the idea that we might never come back she said softly how can hogwarts close 
 
 maybe it said ron not in any more danger here than we are at home are we the same now even say hogwarts is safer there are more wizards inside to defend the place what reckon harry 
 
 not coming back even if it does reopen said harry 
 
 ron gaped at him but hermione said knew you were going to say that but then what will you do 
 
 going back to the dursleys once more because dumbledore wanted me to said be a short visit and then be gone for good 
 
 but where will you go if you come back to school 
 
 i thought i might go back to hollow harry muttered he had had the idea in his head ever since the night of death for me it started there all of it just got a feeling i need to go there and i can visit my parents graves like that 
 
 and then what said ron 
 
 then got to track down the rest of the horcruxes i said harry his eyes upon white tomb reflected in the water on the other side of the lake what he wanted me to do why he told me all about them if dumbledore was rightand sure he wasthere are still four of them out there got to find them and destroy them and then got to go after the seventh bit of soul the bit still in his body and the one going to kill him and if i meet severus snape along the way he added so much the better for me so much the worse for him 
 
 there was a long silence the crowd had almost dispersed now the stragglers giving the monumental figure of grawp a wide berth as he cuddled hagrid whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water 
 
 be there harry said ron 
 
 what 
 
 at your aunt and house said ron and then go with you wherever going 
 
 no said harry quickly he had not counted on this he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone 
 
 you said to us once before said hermione quietly that there was time to turn back if we wanted to had time we 
 
 with you whatever happens said ron but mate going to have to come round my mum and house before we do anything else even hollow 
 
 why 
 
 bill and wedding remember 
 
 harry looked at him startled the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful 
 
 yeah we miss that he said finally 
 
 his hand closed automatically around the fake horcrux but in spite of everything in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself in spite of the final meeting with voldemort he knew must come whether in a month in a year or in ten he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with ron and hermione
