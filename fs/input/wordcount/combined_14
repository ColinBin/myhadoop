 chapter ii 
 
 at the beginning of winter prince nicholas bolkonski and his daughter moved to moscow at that time enthusiasm for the emperor regime had weakened and a patriotic and tendency prevailed there and this together with his past and his intellect and his originality at once made prince nicholas bolkonski an object of particular respect to the moscovites and the center of the moscow opposition to the government 
 the prince had aged very much that year he showed marked signs of senility by a tendency to fall asleep forgetfulness of quite recent events remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with which he accepted the role of head of the moscow opposition in spite of this the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful veneration especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his coat and powdered wig and aroused by anyone told his abrupt stories of the past or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms of the present for them all that house with its gigantic mirrors furniture powdered footmen and the stern shrewd old man himself a relic of the past century with his gentle daughter and the pretty frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle but the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw their host there were also hours in the day during which the private and intimate life of the house continued 
 latterly that private life had become very trying for princess mary there in moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures talks with the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at bald hills and she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life she did not go out into society everyone knew that her father would not let her go anywhere without him and his failing health prevented his going out himself so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties she had quite abandoned the hope of getting married she saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the young men possible suitors who sometimes appeared at their house she had no friends during this visit to moscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to her mademoiselle bourienne with whom she had never been able to be quite frank had now become unpleasant to her and for various reasons princess mary avoided her julie with whom she had corresponded for the last five years was in moscow but proved to be quite alien to her when they met just then julie who by the death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in moscow was in the full whirl of society pleasures she was surrounded by young men who she fancied had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or never on thursdays princess mary remembered with a mournful smile that she now had no one to write to since julie whose presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week like the old emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his evenings for years she regretted presence and having no one to write to in moscow princess mary had no one to talk to no one to whom to confide her sorrow and much sorrow fell to her lot just then the time for prince return and marriage was approaching but his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out in fact it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless for at every mention of the young countess rostova the old prince who apart from that was usually in a bad temper lost control of himself another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six nephew to her consternation she detected in herself in relation to little nicholas some symptoms of her irritability however often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew almost every time that pointer in hand she sat down to show him the french alphabet she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child who was already afraid that auntie might at any moment get angry that at his slightest inattention she trembled became flustered and heated raised her voice and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner having put him in the corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel evil nature and little nicholas following her example would sob and without permission would leave his corner come to her pull her wet hands from her face and comfort her but what distressed the princess most of all was her irritability which was always directed against her and had of late amounted to cruelty had he forced her to prostrate herself to the ground all night had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard but this loving despot the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason tormented himself and her knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately but to show her that she was always to blame for everything of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented princess mary more than anything else this was his intimacy with mademoiselle bourienne the idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of his intentions had occurred to him in jest that if andrew got married he himself would marry bourienne had evidently pleased him and latterly he had persistently and as it seemed to princess mary merely to offend her shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of bourienne 
 one day in moscow in princess presence she thought her father did it purposely when she was there the old prince kissed mademoiselle hand and drawing her to him embraced her affectionately princess mary flushed and ran out of the room a few minutes later mademoiselle bourienne came into princess room smiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice princess mary hastily wiped away her tears went resolutely up to mademoiselle bourienne and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste at the frenchwoman her voice breaking horrible vile inhuman to take advantage of the weakness she did not finish leave my room she exclaimed and burst into sobs 
 next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter but she noticed that at dinner he gave orders that mademoiselle bourienne should be served first after dinner when the footman handed coffee and from habit began with the princess the prince suddenly grew furious threw his stick at philip and instantly gave instructions to have him conscripted for the army 
 he obey i said it twice and he obey she is the first person in this house my best friend cried the prince and if you allow yourself he screamed in a fury addressing princess mary for the first time to forget yourself again before her as you dared to do yesterday i will show you who is master in this house go let me set eyes on you beg her pardon 
 princess mary asked mademoiselle pardon and also her pardon for herself and for philip the footman who had begged for her intervention 
 at such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her soul and suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his spectacles in her presence fumbling near them and not seeing them or would forget something that had just occurred or take a false step with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness or worst of all at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him would suddenly fall asleep letting his napkin drop and his shaking head sink over his plate he is old and feeble and i dare to condemn him she thought at such moments with a feeling of revulsion against herself

 chapter ix 
 
 cloistered 
 cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent 
 it was quite natural that cosette should think herself jean daughter 
 moreover as she knew nothing she could say nothing and then she would not have said anything in any case 
 as we have just observed nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness cosette had suffered so much that she feared everything even to speak or to breathe 
 a single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her 
 she had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with jean valjean 
 she speedily became accustomed to the convent 
 only she regretted catherine but she dared not say so 
 once however she did say to jean valjean father if i had known i would have brought her away with me 
 cosette had been obliged on becoming a scholar in the convent to don the garb of the pupils of the house 
 jean valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside this was the same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted the thenardiers inn 
 it was not very threadbare even now jean valjean locked up these garments plus the stockings and the shoes with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound in a little valise which he found means of procuring he set this valise on a chair near his bed and he always carried the key about his person 
 father cosette asked him one day what is there in that box which smells so good 
 father fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action in addition to the glory which we just mentioned and of which he knew nothing in the first place it made him happy next he had much less work since it was shared 
 lastly as he was very fond of snuff he found the presence of m madeleine an advantage in that he used three times as much as he had done previously and that in an infinitely more luxurious manner seeing that m madeleine paid for it 
 the nuns did not adopt the name of ultime they called jean valjean the other fauvent 
 if these holy women had possessed anything of glance they would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done outside in the behalf of the garden it was always the elder fauchelevent the old the infirm the lame man who went and never the other but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on god know not how to spy or whether they were by preference occupied in keeping watch on each other they paid no heed to this 
 moreover it was well for jean valjean that he kept close and did not stir out 
 javert watched the quarter for more than a month 
 this convent was for jean valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs 
 henceforth those four walls constituted his world he saw enough of the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity and cosette enough to remain happy 
 a very sweet life began for him 
 he inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden in company with fauchelevent 
 this hovel built of old rubbish which was still in existence in was composed as the reader already knows of three chambers all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls 
 the principal one had been given up by force for jean valjean had opposed it in vain to m madeleine by father fauchelevent 
 the walls of this chamber had for ornament in addition to the two nails whereon to hang the and the basket a royalist of applied to the wall over the and of which the following is an exact facsimile 
 
 graphic here 
 
 this specimen of vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by the preceding gardener an old chouan who had died in the convent and whose place fauchelevent had taken 
 jean valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very useful he had formerly been a pruner of trees and he gladly found himself a gardener once more 
 it will be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture 
 he turned these to advantage almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted and wild he budded them and made them produce excellent fruit 
 cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day as the sisters were melancholy and he was kind the child made comparisons and adored him 
 at the appointed hour she flew to the hut when she entered the lowly cabin she filled it with paradise jean valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded cosette 
 the joy which we inspire has this charming property that far from growing meagre like all reflections it returns to us more radiant than ever at recreation hours jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest 
 for cosette laughed now 
 face had even undergone a change to a certain extent the gloom had disappeared from it 
 a smile is the same as sunshine it banishes winter from the human countenance 
 recreation over when cosette went into the house again jean valjean gazed at the windows of her and at night he rose to look at the windows of her dormitory 
 god has his own ways moreover the convent contributed like cosette to uphold and complete the work in jean valjean 
 it is certain that virtue adjoins pride on one side 
 a bridge built by the devil exists there 
 jean valjean had been unconsciously perhaps tolerably near that side and that bridge when providence cast his lot in the convent of the so long as he had compared himself only to the bishop he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in general and pride was beginning to spring up who knows 
 he might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred 
 the convent stopped him on that downward path 
 this was the second place of captivity which he had seen in his youth in what had been for him the beginning of his life and later on quite recently again he had beheld another a frightful place a terrible place whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of justice and the crime of the law now after the galleys he saw the cloister and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys and that he now so to speak was a spectator of the cloister he confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety 
 sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe and slowly descended the endless spirals of revery 
 he recalled his former companions 
 how wretched they were they rose at dawn and toiled until night hardly were they permitted to sleep they lay on camp beds where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches thick in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of the year they were clothed in frightful red blouses they were allowed as a great favor linen trousers in the hottest weather and a woollen blouse on their backs when it was very cold they drank no wine and ate no meat except when they went on fatigue duty 
 they lived nameless designated only by numbers and converted after a manner into ciphers themselves with downcast eyes with lowered voices with shorn heads beneath the cudgel and in disgrace 
 then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes 
 these beings also lived with shorn heads with downcast eyes with lowered voices not in disgrace but amid the scoffs of the world not with their backs bruised with the cudgel but with their shoulders lacerated with their discipline 
 their names also had vanished from among men they no longer existed except under austere appellations they never ate meat and they never drank wine they often remained until evening without food they were attired not in a red blouse but in a black shroud of woollen which was heavy in summer and thin in winter without the power to add or subtract anything from it without having even according to the season the resource of the linen garment or the woollen cloak and for six months in the year they wore serge chemises which gave them fever 
 they dwelt not in rooms warmed only during rigorous cold but in cells where no fire was ever lighted they slept not on mattresses two inches thick but on straw 
 and finally they were not even allowed their sleep every night after a day of toil they were obliged in the weariness of their first slumber at the moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm to rouse themselves to rise and to go and pray in an and gloomy chapel with their knees on the stones 
 on certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve successive hours in a kneeling posture or prostrate with face upon the pavement and arms outstretched in the form of a cross 
 the others were men these were women 
 what had those men done 
 they had stolen violated pillaged murdered assassinated 
 they were bandits counterfeiters poisoners incendiaries murderers parricides 
 what had these women done 
 they had done nothing whatever 
 on the one hand highway robbery fraud deceit violence sensuality homicide all sorts of sacrilege every variety of crime on the other one thing only innocence 
 perfect innocence almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious assumption attached to the earth by virtue already possessing something of heaven through holiness 
 on the one hand confidences over crimes which are exchanged in whispers on the other the confession of faults made aloud and what crimes 
 and what faults 
 on the one hand miasms on the other an ineffable perfume on the one hand a moral pest guarded from sight penned up under the range of cannon and literally devouring its victims on the other the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth there darkness here the shadow but a shadow filled with gleams of light and of gleams full of radiance 
 two strongholds of slavery but in the first deliverance possible a legal limit always in sight and then escape 
 in the second perpetuity the sole hope at the distant extremity of the future that faint light of liberty which men call death 
 in the first men are bound only with chains in the other chained by faith 
 what flowed from the first 
 an immense curse the gnashing of teeth hatred desperate viciousness a cry of rage against human society a sarcasm against heaven 
 what results flowed from the second 
 blessings and love 
 and in these two places so similar yet so unlike these two species of beings who were so very unlike were undergoing the same work expiation 
 jean valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former that personal expiation the expiation for self 
 but he did not understand that of these last that of creatures without reproach and without stain and he trembled as he asked himself the expiation of what 
 what expiation 
 a voice within his conscience replied 
 the most divine of human generosities the expiation for others 
 here all personal theory is withheld we are only the narrator we place ourselves at jean point of view and we translate his impressions 
 before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation the highest possible pitch of virtue the innocence which pardons men their faults and which expiates in their stead servitude submitted to torture accepted punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned for the sake of sparing it to souls which have fallen the love of humanity swallowed up in the love of god but even there preserving its distinct and mediatorial character sweet and feeble beings possessing the misery of those who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed 
 and he remembered that he had dared to murmur 
 often in the middle of the night he rose to listen to the grateful song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities and the blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly chastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy and that he wretch that he was had shaken his fist at god 
 there was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply like a warning whisper from providence itself 
 the scaling of that wall the passing of those barriers the adventure accepted even at the risk of death the painful and difficult ascent all those efforts even which he had made to escape from that other place of expiation he had made in order to gain entrance into this one 
 was this a symbol of his destiny 
 this house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to that other one whence he had fled and yet he had never conceived an idea of anything similar 
 again he beheld gratings bolts iron guard whom 
 angels 
 these lofty walls which he had seen around tigers he now beheld once more around lambs 
 this was a place of expiation and not of punishment and yet it was still more austere more gloomy and more pitiless than the other 
 these virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts a cold harsh wind that wind which had chilled his youth traversed the barred and padlocked grating of the vultures a still harsher and more biting breeze blew in the cage of these doves 
 why 
 when he thought on these things all that was within him was lost in amazement before this mystery of sublimity 
 in these meditations his pride vanished 
 he scrutinized his own heart in all manner of ways he felt his pettiness and many a time he wept 
 all that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him back towards the holy injunctions cosette through love the convent through humility 
 sometimes at eventide in the twilight at an hour when the garden was deserted he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which skirted the chapel in front of the window through which he had gazed on the night of his arrival and turned towards the spot where as he knew the sister was making reparation prostrated in prayer thus he prayed as he knelt before the sister 
 it seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before god 
 everything that surrounded him that peaceful garden those fragrant flowers those children who uttered joyous cries those grave and simple women that silent cloister slowly permeated him and little by little his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister of perfume like the flowers of simplicity like the women of joy like the children 
 and then he reflected that these had been two houses of god which had received him in succession at two critical moments in his life 
 the first when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him the second at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit of him and when the galleys were again yawning and that had it not been for the first he should have relapsed into crime and had it not been for the second into torment 
 his whole heart melted in gratitude and he loved more and more 
 many years passed in this manner cosette was growing up

 book eight 
 chapter iii 
 
 in there was living in moscow a french doctor metivier who had rapidly become the fashion he was enormously tall handsome amiable as frenchmen are and was as all moscow said an extraordinarily clever doctor he was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor but as an equal 
 prince nicholas had always ridiculed medicine but latterly on mademoiselle advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and had grown accustomed to him metivier came to see the prince about twice a week 
 on december st nicholas day and the name day all moscow came to the front door but he gave orders to admit no one and to invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom he gave to princess mary 
 metivier who came in the morning with his felicitations considered it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne as he told princess mary and went in to see the prince it happened that on that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods he had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be understood himself princess mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed querulousness which generally culminated in a burst of rage and she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion until the arrival the morning had passed off safely after admitting the doctor princess mary sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she could hear all that passed in the study 
 to force the guard 
 at first she heard only voice then her then both voices began speaking at the same time the door was flung open and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified metivier with his shock of black hair and the prince in his dressing gown and fez his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards 
 you understand shouted the prince but i do french spy slave of buonaparte spy get out of my house be off i tell you 
 metivier shrugging his shoulders went up to mademoiselle bourienne who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room 
 the prince is not very well bile and rush of blood to the head keep calm i will call again tomorrow said metivier and putting his fingers to his lips he hastened away 
 through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry spies traitors traitors everywhere not a peace in my own house 
 after departure the old prince called his daughter in and the whole weight of his wrath fell on her she was to blame that a spy had been admitted had he not told her yes told her to make a list and not to admit anyone who was not on that list then why was that scoundrel admitted she was the cause of it all with her he said he could not have a peace and could not die quietly 
 no we must part we must part understand that understand it i cannot endure any more he said and left the room then as if afraid she might find some means of consolation he returned and trying to appear calm added and imagine i have said this in a moment of anger i am calm i have thought it over and it will be carried out we must part so find some place for yourself but he could not restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves is capable evidently suffering himself he shook his fists at her and screamed 
 if only some fool would marry her then he slammed the door sent for mademoiselle bourienne and subsided into his study 
 at two the six chosen guests assembled for dinner 
 these guests the famous count rostopchin prince lopukhin with his nephew general chatrov an old war comrade of the and of the younger generation pierre and boris drubetskoy awaited the prince in the drawing room 
 boris who had come to moscow on leave a few days before had been anxious to be presented to prince nicholas bolkonski and had contrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house 
 the house did not belong to what is known as fashionable society but his little circle though not much talked about in town was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other boris had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in his presence invited rostopchin to dinner on st nicholas day and rostopchin had replied that he could not come 
 on that day i always go to pay my devotions to the relics of prince nicholas bolkonski 
 oh yes yes replied the commander in chief how is he 
 the small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a court of justice all were silent or talked in low tones prince nicholas came in serious and taciturn princess mary seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual the guests were reluctant to address her feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation count rostopchin alone kept the conversation going now relating the latest town news and now the latest political gossip 
 lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation prince bolkonski listened as a presiding judge receives a report only now and then silently or by a brief word showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him the tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political world incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse but whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped or was stopped at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself 
 at dinner the talk turned on the latest political news seizure of the duke of territory and the russian note hostile to napoleon which had been sent to all the european courts 
 bonaparte treats europe as a pirate does a captured vessel said count rostopchin repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before one only wonders at the or blindness of the crowned heads now the turn has come and bonaparte scruple to depose the head of the catholic church yet all keep silent our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the duke of territory and even count rostopchin paused feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was impossible 
 other territories have been offered in exchange for the duchy of oldenburg said prince bolkonski he shifts the dukes about as i might move my serfs from bald hills to bogucharovo or my ryazan estates 
 the duke of oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of character and resignation remarked boris joining in respectfully 
 he said this because on his journey from petersburg he had had the honor of being presented to the duke prince bolkonski glanced at the young man as if about to say something in reply but changed his mind evidently considering him too young 
 i have read our protests about the oldenburg affair and was surprised how badly the note was worded remarked count rostopchin in the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him 
 pierre looked at rostopchin with naive astonishment not understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the note 
 does it matter count how the note is worded he asked so long as its substance is forcible 
 my dear fellow with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy to have a good style returned count rostopchin 
 pierre now understood the dissatisfaction with the wording of the note 
 one would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up remarked the old prince there in petersburg they are always writing not notes only but even new laws my andrew there has written a whole volume of laws for russia nowadays they are always writing and he laughed unnaturally 
 there was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general cleared his throat to draw attention 
 did you hear of the last event at the review in petersburg the figure cut by the new french ambassador 
 eh yes i heard something he said something awkward in his presence 
 his majesty drew attention to the grenadier division and to the march past continued the general and it seems the ambassador took no notice and allowed himself to reply that we in france pay no attention to such trifles the emperor did not condescend to reply at the next review they say the emperor did not once deign to address him 
 all were silent on this fact relating to the emperor personally it was impossible to pass any judgment 
 impudent fellows said the prince you know metivier i turned him out of my house this morning he was here they admitted him spite of my request that they should let no one in he went on glancing angrily at his daughter 
 and he narrated his whole conversation with the french doctor and the reasons that convinced him that metivier was a spy though these reasons were very insufficient and obscure no one made any rejoinder 
 after the roast champagne was served the guests rose to congratulate the old prince princess mary too went round to him 
 he gave her a cold angry look and offered her his wrinkled cheek to kiss the whole expression of his face told her that he had not forgotten the talk that his decision remained in force and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to her now 
 when they went into the drawing room where coffee was served the old men sat together 
 prince nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the impending war 
 he said that our wars with bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we sought alliances with the germans and thrust ourselves into european affairs into which we had been drawn by the peace of tilsit we ought not to fight either for or against austria our political interests are all in the east and in regard to bonaparte the only thing is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy and he will never dare to cross the russian frontier as was the case in 
 how can we fight the french prince said count rostopchin can we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities look at our youths look at our ladies the french are our gods paris is our kingdom of heaven 
 he began speaking louder evidently to be heard by everyone 
 french dresses french ideas french feelings there now you turned metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a frenchman and a scoundrel but our ladies crawl after him on their knees i went to a party last night and there out of five ladies three were roman catholics and had the indulgence for doing woolwork on sundays and they themselves sit there nearly naked like the signboards at our public baths if i may say so ah when one looks at our young people prince one would like to take peter the old cudgel out of the museum and belabor them in the russian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them 
 all were silent the old prince looked at rostopchin with a smile and wagged his head approvingly 
 well your excellency keep well said rostopchin getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince 
 my dear fellow his words are music i never tire of hearing him said the old prince keeping hold of the hand and offering his cheek to be kissed 
 following example the others also rose

 homuncio plautus would say 
 this little being is joyous 
 he has not food every day and he goes to the play every evening if he sees good 
 he has no shirt on his body no shoes on his feet no roof over his head he is like the flies of heaven who have none of these things he is from seven to thirteen years of age he lives in bands roams the streets lodges in the open air wears an old pair of trousers of his which descend below his heels an old hat of some other father which descends below his ears a single suspender of yellow listing he runs lies in wait rummages about wastes time blackens pipes swears like a convict haunts the knows thieves calls gay women thou talks slang sings obscene songs and has no evil in his heart this is because he has in his heart a pearl innocence and pearls are not to be dissolved in mud

 book eight 
 chapter iv 
 
 princess mary as she sat listening to the old talk and faultfinding understood nothing of what she heard she only wondered whether the guests had all observed her hostile attitude toward her she did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities shown her during dinner by boris drubetskoy who was visiting them for the third time already 
 princess mary turned with questioning look to pierre who hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone in the drawing room 
 may i stay a little longer he said letting his stout body sink into an armchair beside her 
 oh yes she answered you noticed nothing her look asked 
 pierre was in an agreeable mood he looked straight before him and smiled quietly 
 have you known that young man long princess he asked 
 who 
 drubetskoy 
 no not long 
 do you like him 
 yes he is an agreeable young man why do you ask me that said princess mary still thinking of that conversation with her father 
 because i have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from petersburg to moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an heiress 
 you have observed that said princess mary 
 yes returned pierre with a smile and this young man now manages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too i can read him like a book at present he is hesitating whom to lay siege to you or mademoiselle julie karagina he is very attentive to her 
 he visits them 
 yes very often and do you know the new way of courting said pierre with an amused smile evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary 
 no replied princess mary 
 to please moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy he is very melancholy with mademoiselle karagina said pierre 
 really asked princess mary looking into kindly face and still thinking of her own sorrow it would be a relief thought she if i ventured to confide what i am feeling to someone i should like to tell everything to pierre he is kind and generous it would be a relief he would give me advice 
 would you marry him 
 oh my god count there are moments when i would marry anybody she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice ah how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that she went on in a trembling voice that you can do nothing for him but grieve him and to know that you cannot alter this then there is only one thing left to go away but where could i go 
 what is wrong what is it princess 
 but without finishing what she was saying princess mary burst into tears 
 i know what is the matter with me today take any notice forget what i have said 
 gaiety vanished completely he anxiously questioned the princess asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him but she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said that she did not remember what she had said and that she had no trouble except the one he knew of that prince marriage threatened to cause a rupture between father and son 
 have you any news of the rostovs she asked to change the subject i was told they are coming soon i am also expecting andrew any day i should like them to meet here 
 and how does he now regard the matter asked pierre referring to the old prince 
 princess mary shook her head 
 what is to be done in a few months the year will be up the thing is impossible i only wish i could spare my brother the first moments i wish they would come sooner i hope to be friends with her you have known them a long time said princess mary tell me honestly the whole truth what sort of girl is she and what do you think of her the real truth because you know andrew is risking so much doing this against his will that i should like to know 
 an undefined instinct told pierre that these explanations and repeated requests to be told the whole truth expressed on the princess part toward her future and a wish that he should disapprove of choice but in reply he said what he felt rather than what he thought 
 i know how to answer your question he said blushing without knowing why i really know what sort of girl she is i analyze her at all she is enchanting but what makes her so i know that is all one can say about her 
 princess mary sighed and the expression on her face said yes what i expected and feared 
 is she clever she asked 
 pierre considered 
 i think not he said and yet yes she does not deign to be clever oh no she is simply enchanting and that is all 
 princess mary again shook her head disapprovingly 
 ah i so long to like her tell her so if you see her before i do 
 i hear they are expected very soon said pierre 
 princess mary told pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future as soon as the rostovs arrived and to try to accustom the old prince to her

 of nobility 
 we will speak of nobility first as a portion of an estate then as a condition of 
 particular persons a monarchy where there is no nobility at all is ever a pure 
 and absolute tyranny as that of the turks for nobility attempers sovereignty and draws the eyes of me people somewhat aside from the line royal but for democracies they need it not and they are commonly more quiet and less subject to sedition then where there are stirps of nobles for eyes are upon the business and not upon the persons or if upon the persons it is for the business sake as fittest and not for flags and pedigree 
 we see the switzers last well notwithstanding their diversity of religion and of cantons for utility is their bond and not respects the united provinces of the low countries in their government excel for where there is an equality the consultations are more indifferent and the payments and tributes more cheerful a great and potent nobility addeth majesty to a monarch but diminisheth power and putteth life and spirit into the people but presseth their fortune it is well when nobles are not too great for sovereignty nor for justice and yet maintained in that height as the insolence of inferiors may be broken upon them before it come on too fast upon the majesty of kings 
 a numerous nobility causeth poverty and inconvenience in a state for it is a surcharge of expense and besides it being of necessity that many of the nobility fall in time to be weak in fortune it maketh a kind of disproportion between honour and means 
 as for nobility in particular persons it is a reverend thing to see an ancient castle or building not in decay or to see a fair timber tree sound and perfect how much more to behold an ancient noble family which hath stood against me waves and weathers of time 
 for new nobility is but the act of power but ancient nobility is the act of time those that are first raised to nobility are commonly more virtuous but less 
 innocent than their descendants for there is rarely any rising but by a of good and evil arts but it is reason the memory of their virtues remain to their posterity and their faults die with themselves 
 nobility of birth commonly abateth industry and he that is not industrious envieth him that is besides noble persons cannot go much higher and he that standeth at a stay when others rise can hardly avoid motions of envy on the other side nobility extinguished the passive envy from others towards them 
 because they are in possession of honour certainly kings that have able men of their nobility shall find ease in employing them and a better slide into their business for people naturally bend to them as born in some sort to command

 book just man 
 chapter xiii 
 
 what he believed 
 we are not obliged to sound the bishop of d on the score of orthodoxy 
 in the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect 
 the conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word 
 moreover certain natures being given we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own 
 what did he think of this dogma or of that mystery 
 these secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb where souls enter naked 
 the point on which we are certain is that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case 
 no decay is possible to the diamond he believed to the extent of his powers 
 credo in patrem he often exclaimed 
 moreover he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience and which whispers to a man thou art with god 
 the point which we consider it our duty to note is that outside of and beyond his faith as it were the bishop possessed an excess of love 
 in was in that quarter quia multum he loved he was regarded as vulnerable by serious men grave persons and reasonable people favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry what was this excess of love 
 it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men as we have already pointed out and which on occasion extended even to things 
 he lived without disdain he was indulgent towards creation 
 every man even the best has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals the bishop of d had none of that harshness which is peculiar to many priests nevertheless 
 he did not go as far as the brahmin but he seemed to have weighed this saying of ecclesiastes 
 who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth 
 hideousness of aspect deformity of instinct troubled him not and did not arouse his indignation 
 he was touched almost softened by them it seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which is apparent the cause the explanation or the excuse for them 
 he seemed at times to be asking god to commute these penalties 
 he examined without wrath and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest that portion of chaos which still exists in nature 
 this revery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings 
 one morning he was in his garden and thought himself alone but his sister was walking behind him unseen by him 
 suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground it was a large black hairy frightful spider 
 his sister heard him say 
 poor beast 
 it is not its fault 
 why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness puerile they may be but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to saint francis and of marcus aurelius 
 one day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant thus lived this just man 
 sometimes he fell asleep in his garden and then there was nothing more venerable possible 
 monseigneur bienvenu had formerly been if the stories anent his youth and even in regard to his manhood were to be believed a passionate and possibly a violent man 
 his universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life and had trickled there slowly thought by thought for in a character as in a rock there may exist apertures made by drops of water these hollows are uneffaceable these formations are indestructible 
 in as we think we have already said he reached his birthday but he did not appear to be more than sixty 
 he was not tall he was rather plump and in order to combat this tendency he was fond of taking long strolls on foot his step was firm and his form was but slightly bent a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion 
 gregory xvi at the age of eighty held himself erect and smiling which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop 
 monseigneur welcome had what the people term a fine head but so amiable was he that they forgot that it was fine 
 when he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms and of which we have already spoken people felt at their ease with him and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person 
 his fresh and ruddy complexion his very white teeth all of which he had preserved and which were displayed by his smile gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man a good fellow and of an old man he is a fine man 
 that it will be recalled was the effect which he produced upon napoleon 
 on the first encounter and to one who saw him for the first time he was nothing in fact but a fine man 
 but if one remained near him for a few hours and beheld him in the least degree pensive the fine man became gradually transfigured and took on some imposing quality i know not what his broad and serious brow rendered august by his white locks became august also by virtue of meditation majesty radiated from his goodness though his goodness ceased not to be radiant one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings without ceasing to smile 
 respect an unutterable respect penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart and one felt that one had before him one of those strong thoroughly tried and indulgent souls where thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle 
 as we have seen prayer the celebration of the offices of religion the consolation of the afflicted the cultivation of a bit of land fraternity frugality hospitality renunciation confidence study work filled every day of his life 
 filled is exactly the word certainly the day was quite full to the brim of good words and good deeds 
 nevertheless it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed and after the two women had retired it seemed to be a sort of rite with him to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens 
 sometimes if the two old women were not asleep they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at a very advanced hour of the night 
 he was there alone communing with himself peaceful adoring comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the invisible splendor of god opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the unknown at such moments while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation he could not have told himself probably what was passing in his spirit he felt something take its flight from him and something descend into him 
 mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe 
 he thought of the grandeur and presence of god of the future eternity that strange mystery of the eternity past a mystery still more strange of all the infinities which pierced their way into all his senses beneath his eyes and without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible he gazed upon it 
 he did not study god he was dazzled by him 
 he considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms which communicate aspects to matter reveal forces by verifying them create individualities in unity proportions in extent the innumerable in the infinite and through light produce beauty these conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly hence life and death 
 he seated himself on a wooden bench with his back against a decrepit vine he gazed at the stars past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his this quarter of an acre so poorly planted so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds was dear to him and satisfied his wants 
 what more was needed by this old man who divided the leisure of his life where there was so little leisure between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night 
 was not this narrow enclosure with the heavens for a ceiling sufficient to enable him to adore god in his most divine works in turn 
 does not this comprehend all in fact and what is there left to desire beyond it a little garden in which to walk and immensity in which to dream at feet that which can be cultivated and plucked over head that which one can study and meditate upon 
 some flowers on earth and all the stars in the sky

 a new hope 
 xiii 
 
 a cheering gleeful throng of technicians mechanics and other inhabitants of thealliance headquarters swarmed around each fighter as it touched down and taxied intothe temple hangar several of the other surviving pilots had already vacated theirships and were waiting to greet luke 
 on the opposite side of the fighter the crowd was far smaller and morerestrained it consisted of a couple of technicians and one tall humanoid droid whowatched worriedly as the humans mounted the scorched fighter and lifted a badlyburned metal hulk from its back 
 oh my artoo threepio pleaded bending close to the carbonized you hear me say something his unwinking gaze turned to one of thetechs you can repair him you 
 do our best the man studied the vaporized metal the danglingcomponents taken a terrible beating 
 you must repair him sir if any of my circuits or modules will help donate them 
 they moved slowly away oblivious to the noise and excitement around robots and the humans who repaired them there existed a very specialrelationship each partook a little of the other and sometimes the dividing linebetween man and machine was more blurred than many would admit 
 the center of the carnival atmosphere was formed by three figures who battled tosee who could compliment the others the most when it came to however chewbacca won by default there was laughter as thewookie looked embarrassed at having nearly flattened luke in his eagerness to greethim 
 i know come back luke was shouting i just know it i nothing but dust if you sailed in like that han 
 solo had lost none of his smug well i very well let aflying farm boy go up against that station all by himself besides i was beginning torealize what could happen and i felt terrible about it you to maybetake all the credit and get all the reward 
 as they laughed a little figure robes flowing rushed up to luke in a veryunsenatorial fashion you did it luke you did it leia was shouting 
 she fell into his arms and hugged him as he spun her around then she movedto solo and repeated the embrace expectantly the corellian was not quite asembarrassed 
 suddenly awed by the adulation of the crowd luke turned away he gave thetired fighter a look of approval then found his gaze traveling upward up to theceiling high overhead for a second he thought he heard something faintly like agratified sigh a relaxing of muscles a crazy old man had once performed in momentsof pleasure of course it was probably the intruding hot wind of a steaming jungleworld but luke smiled anyway at what he thought he saw up here 
 there were many rooms in the vast expanse of the temple which had beenconverted for modern service by the technicians of the alliance even in theirdesperate need however there was something too clean and classically beautifulabout the ruins of the ancient throne room for the architects to modify they had leftit as it was save for scouring it clear of creeping jungle growth and debris 
 for the first time in thousands of years that spacious chamber was of rebel troops and technicians stood assembled on the old stone together for one last time before dispersing to new posts and distant the first time ever the massed ranks of pressed uniforms and polished arrayed together in a fitting show of alliance might 
 the banners of the many worlds which had lent support to the rebellion flutteredin the gentle breeze formed inside at the far end of a long open aisle stood a visiongowned in formal white barred with chalcedony signet ofoffice 
 several figures appeared at the far end of the aisle one massive and signs of running for cover but was urged on down the open row by hiscompanion it took several minutes for luke han chewie and threepio to coverthe distance to the other end 
 they stopped before leia and luke recognized general dodonna among theother dignitaries seated nearby there was a pause and a gleaming familiar artoounit joined the group moving to stand next to a thoroughly awestruck threepio 
 chewbacca shuffled nervously giving every indication of wishing he weresomeplace else solo silenced him as leia rose and came forward at the sametime banners tilted in unison and all those gathered in the great hall turned to face thedais 
 she place something heavy and golden around neck then to strain to do finally around then she made a signal to thecrowd and the rigid discipline dissolved as every man woman and mechanicalpresent was permitted to give full vent to their feelings 
 as he stood awash in the cheers and shouts luke found that his mind wasneither on his possible future with the alliance nor on the chance of travelingadventurously with han solo and chewbacca instead unlikely as solo had claimedit might be he found his full attention occupied by the radiant leia organa 
 she noticed his unabashed stare but this time she only smiled

 book one 
 chapter xiv 
 
 after receiving her visitors the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came to congratulate the countess wished to have a talk with the friend of her childhood princess anna mikhaylovna whom she had not seen properly since she returned from petersburg anna mikhaylovna with her but pleasant face drew her chair nearer to that of the countess 
 with you i will be quite frank said anna mikhaylovna there are not many left of us old friends why i so value your friendship 
 anna mikhaylovna looked at vera and paused the countess pressed her hand 
 vera she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite how is it you have so little tact you see you are not wanted here go to the other girls or 
 the handsome vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt 
 if you had told me sooner mamma i would have gone she replied as she rose to go to her own room 
 but as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting one pair at each window she stopped and smiled scornfully sonya was sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses for her the first he had ever written boris and natasha were at the other window and ceased talking when vera entered sonya and natasha looked at vera with guilty happy faces 
 it was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in vera 
 how often have i asked you not to take my things she said you have a room of your own and she took the inkstand from nicholas 
 in a minute in a minute he said dipping his pen 
 you always manage to do things at the wrong time continued vera you came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you 
 though what she said was quite just perhaps for that very reason no one replied and the four simply looked at one another she lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand 
 and at your age what secrets can there be between natasha and boris or between you two all nonsense 
 now vera what does it matter to you said natasha in defense speaking very gently 
 she seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone 
 very silly said vera i am ashamed of you secrets indeed 
 all have secrets of their own answered natasha getting warmer we interfere with you and berg 
 i should think not said vera because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior but just tell mamma how you are behaving with boris 
 natalya ilynichna behaves very well to me remarked boris i have nothing to complain of 
 boris you are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome said natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly she used the word diplomat which was just then much in vogue among the children in the special sense they attached to it why does she bother me and she added turning to vera never understand it because never loved anyone you have no heart you are a madame de genlis and nothing more this nickname bestowed on vera by nicholas was considered very stinging and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people go and flirt with berg as much as you please she finished quickly 
 i shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors 
 well now done what you wanted put in nicholas said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them go to the nursery 
 all four like a flock of scared birds got up and left the room 
 the unpleasant things were said to me remarked vera i said none to anyone 
 madame de genlis madame de genlis shouted laughing voices through the door 
 the handsome vera who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone smiled and evidently unmoved by what had been said to her went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer 
 in the drawing room the conversation was still going on 
 ah my dear said the countess my life is not all roses either i know that at the rate we are living our means last long all the club and his easygoing nature even in the country do we get any rest theatricals hunting and heaven knows what besides but talk about me tell me how you managed everything i often wonder at you annette how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to moscow to petersburg to those ministers and great people and know how to deal with them all quite astonishing how did you get things settled i possibly do it 
 ah my love answered anna mikhaylovna god grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction one learns many things then she added with a certain pride that lawsuit taught me much when i want to see one of those big people i write a note princess desires an interview with so and then i take a cab and go myself two three or four times till i get what i want i mind what they think of me 
 well and to whom did you apply about bory asked the countess you see yours is already an officer in the guards while my nicholas is going as a cadet no one to interest himself for him to whom did you apply 
 to prince vasili he was so kind he at once agreed to everything and put the matter before the emperor said princess anna mikhaylovna enthusiastically quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end 
 has prince vasili aged much asked the countess i have not seen him since we acted together at the rumyantsovs theatricals i expect he has forgotten me he paid me attentions in those days said the countess with a smile 
 he is just the same as ever replied anna mikhaylovna overflowing with amiability his position has not turned his head at all he said to me i am sorry i can do so little for you dear princess i am at your command yes he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation but nataly you know my love for my son i would do anything for his happiness and my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one continued anna mikhaylovna sadly dropping her voice my wretched lawsuit takes all i have and makes no progress would you believe it i have literally not a penny and know how to equip boris she took out her handkerchief and began to cry i need five hundred rubles and have only one note i am in such a state my only hope now is in count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov if he will not assist his godson you know he is godfather and allow him something for his maintenance all my trouble will have been thrown away i shall not be able to equip him 
 the countess eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence 
 i often think though perhaps a sin said the princess that here lives count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov so rich all alone that tremendous fortune and what is his life worth a burden to him and life is only just beginning 
 surely he will leave something to boris said the countess 
 heaven only knows my dear these rich grandees are so selfish still i will take boris and go to see him at once and i shall speak to him straight out let people think what they will of me really all the same to me when my fate is at stake the princess rose now two and you dine at four there will just be time 
 and like a practical petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time anna mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son and went into the anteroom with him 
 my dear said she to the countess who saw her to the door and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear wish me good luck

 chapter 
 
 as soon as i had perused this epistle i went to the master and informed him that his sister had arrived at the heights and sent me a letter expressing her sorrow for mrs situation and her ardent desire to see him with a wish that he would transmit to her as early as possible some token of forgiveness by me 
 forgiveness said linton i have nothing to forgive her ellen you may call at wuthering heights this afternoon if you like and say that i am not angry but sorry to have lost her especially as i can never think be happy it is out of the question my going to see her however we are eternally divided and should she really wish to oblige me let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country 
 and you write her a little note sir i asked imploringly 
 no he answered it is needless my communication with family shall be as sparing as his with mine it shall not exist 
 mr coldness depressed me exceedingly and all the way from the grange i puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said when i repeated it and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to console isabella i dare say she had been on the watch for me since morning i saw her looking through the lattice as i came up the garden causeway and i nodded to her but she drew back as if afraid of being observed i entered without knocking there never was such a dreary dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented i must confess that if i had been in the young place i would at least have swept the hearth and wiped the tables with a duster but she already partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her her pretty face was wan and listless her hair uncurled some locks hanging lankly down and some carelessly twisted round her head probably she had not touched her dress since yester evening hindley was not there mr heathcliff sat at a table turning over some papers in his but he rose when i appeared asked me how i did quite friendly and offered me a chair he was the only thing there that seemed decent and i thought he never looked better so much had circumstances altered their positions that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman and his wife as a thorough little slattern she came forward eagerly to greet me and held out one hand to take the expected letter i shook my head she understand the hint but followed me to a sideboard where i went to lay my bonnet and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what i had brought heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manoeuvres and said 
 if you have got anything for isabella as no doubt you have nelly give it to her you make a secret of it we have no secrets between us 
 oh i have nothing i replied thinking it best to speak the truth at once my master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either a letter or a visit from him at present he sends his love and his wishes for your happiness and his pardon for the grief you have occasioned but he thinks that after this time his household and the household here should drop intercommunication as nothing good could come of keeping it up 
 mrs lip quivered slightly and she returned to her seat in the window her husband took his stand on the hearthstone near me and began to put questions concerning catherine i told him as much as i thought proper of her illness and he extorted from me by most of the facts connected with its origin i blamed her as she deserved for bringing it all on herself and ended by hoping that he would follow mr example and avoid future interference with his family for good or evil 
 mrs linton is now just recovering i said never be like she was but her life is spared and if you really have a regard for her shun crossing her way again nay move out of this country entirely and that you may not regret it inform you catherine linton is as different now from your old friend catherine earnshaw as that young lady is different from me her appearance is changed greatly her character much more so and the person who is compelled of necessity to be her companion will only sustain his affection hereafter by the remembrance of what she once was by common humanity and a sense of duty 
 that is quite possible remarked heathcliff forcing himself to seem calm quite possible that your master should have nothing but common humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon but do you imagine that i shall leave catherine to his duty and humanity and can you compare my feelings respecting catherine to his before you leave this house i must exact a promise from you that get me an interview with her consent or refuse i will see her what do you say 
 i say mr heathcliff i replied you must not you never shall through my means another encounter between you and the master would kill her altogether 
 with your aid that may be avoided he continued and should there be danger of such an he be the cause of adding a single trouble more to her i think i shall be justified in going to extremes i wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether catherine would suffer greatly from his loss the fear that she would restrains me and there you see the distinctions between our feelings had he been in my place and i in his though i hated him with a hatred that turned my life to gall i never would have raised a hand against him you may look incredulous if you please i never would have banished him from her society as long as she desired his the moment her regard ceased i would have torn his heart out and drunk his blood but till you believe me you know then i would have died by inches before i touched a single hair of his head 
 and yet i interrupted you have no scruples in completely ruining all hopes of her perfect restoration by thrusting yourself into her remembrance now when she has nearly forgotten you and involving her in a new tumult of discord and distress 
 you suppose she has nearly forgotten me he said oh nelly you know she has not you know as well as i do that for every thought she spends on linton she spends a thousand on me at a most miserable period of my life i had a notion of the kind it haunted me on my return to the neighbourhood last summer but only her own assurance could make me admit the horrible idea again and then linton would be nothing nor hindley nor all the dreams that ever i dreamt two words would comprehend my and hell existence after losing her would be hell yet i was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued edgar attachment more than mine if he loved with all the powers of his puny being he love as much in eighty years as i could in a day and catherine has a heart as deep as i have the sea could be as readily contained in that as her whole affection be monopolized by him tush he is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog or her horse it is not in him to be loved like me how can she love in him what he has not 
 catherine and edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be cried isabella with sudden vivacity no one has a right to talk in that manner and i hear my brother depreciated in silence 
 your brother is wondrous fond of you too he observed heathcliff scornfully he turns you adrift on the world with surprising alacrity 
 he is not aware of what i suffer she replied i tell him that 
 you have been telling him something then you have written have you 
 to say that i was married i did saw the note and nothing since 
 no 
 my young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition i remarked love comes short in her case obviously whose i may guess but perhaps i say 
 i should guess it was her own said heathcliff she degenerates into a mere slut she is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early hardly credit it but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to go home however suit this house so much the better for not being over nice and take care she does not disgrace me by rambling abroad 
 well sir returned i i hope consider that mrs heathcliff is accustomed to be looked after and waited on and that she has been brought up like an only daughter whom everyone was ready to serve you must let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her and you must treat her kindly whatever be your notion of mr edgar you cannot doubt that she has a capacity for strong attachments or she have abandoned the elegances and comforts and friends of her former home to fix contentedly in such a wilderness as this with you 
 she abandoned them under a delusion he answered picturing in me a hero of romance and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous devotion i can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished but at last i think she begins to know me i perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first and the senseless incapability of discerning that i was in earnest when i gave her my opinion of her infatuation and herself it was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that i did not love her i believed at one time no lessons could teach her that and yet it is poorly learnt for this morning she announced as a piece of appalling intelligence that i had actually succeeded in making her hate me a positive labour of hercules i assure you if it be achieved i have cause to return thanks can i trust your assertion isabella are you sure you hate me if i let you alone for half a day you come sighing and wheedling to me again i dare say she would rather i had seemed all tenderness before you it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed but i care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side and i never told her a lie about it she cannot accuse me of showing a bit of deceitful softness the first thing she saw me do on coming out of the grange was to hang up her little dog and when she pleaded for it the first words i uttered were a wish that i had the hanging of every being belonging to her except one possibly she took that exception for herself but no brutality disgusted her i suppose she has an innate admiration of it if only her precious person were secure from injury now was it not the depth of genuine idiocy for that pitiful slavish brach to dream that i could love her tell your master nelly that i never in all my life met with such an abject thing as she is she even disgraces the name of linton and sometimes relented from pure lack of invention in my experiments on what she could endure and still creep shamefully cringing back but tell him also to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease that i keep strictly within the limits of the law i have avoided up to this period giving her the slightest right to claim a separation and more thank nobody for dividing us if she desired to go she might the nuisance of her presence outweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her 
 mr heathcliff said i this is the talk of a madman and your wife most likely is convinced you are mad and for that reason she has borne with you hitherto but now that you say she may go doubtless avail herself of the permission you are not so bewitched are you as to remain with him of your own accord 
 take care ellen answered isabella her eyes sparkling irefully there was no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her endeavours to make himself detested put faith in a single word he speaks a lying fiend a monster and not a human being been told i might leave him before and made the attempt but i dare not repeat it only ellen promise not mention a syllable of his infamous conversation to my brother or catherine whatever he may pretend he wishes to provoke edgar to desperation he says he has married me on purpose to obtain power over him and he obtain die first i just hope i pray that he may forget his diabolical prudence and kill me the single pleasure i can imagine is to die or see him dead 
 will do for the present said heathcliff if you are called upon in a court of law remember her language nelly and take a good look at that countenance near the point which would suit me no not fit to be your own guardian isabella now and i being your legal protector must detain you in my custody however distasteful the obligation may be go upstairs i have something to say to ellen dean in private not the way upstairs i tell you why this is the road upstairs child 
 he seized and thrust her from the room and returned muttering 
 i have no pity i have no pity the more the worms writhe the more i yearn to crush out their entrails it is a moral teething and i grind with greater energy in proportion to the increase of pain 
 do you understand what the word pity means i said hastening to resume my bonnet did you ever feel a touch of it in your life 
 put that down he interrupted perceiving my intention to depart you are not going yet come here now nelly i must either persuade or compel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see catherine and that without delay i swear that i meditate no harm i desire to cause any disturbance or to exasperate or insult mr linton i only wish to hear from herself how she is and why she has been ill and to ask if anything that i could do would be of use to her last night i was in the grange garden six hours and return there tonight and every night haunt the place and every day till i find an opportunity of entering if edgar linton meets me i shall not hesitate to knock him down and give him enough to insure his quiescence while i stay if his servants oppose me i shall threaten them off with these pistols but it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them or their master and you could do it so easily warn you when i came and then you might let me in unobserved as soon as she was alone and watch till i departed your conscience quite calm you would be hindering mischief 
 i protested against playing that treacherous part in my house and besides i urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying mrs tranquillity for his satisfaction the commonest occurrence startles her painfully i said all nerves and she bear the surprise positive persist sir or else i shall be obliged to inform my master of your designs and take measures to secure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions 
 in that case take measures to secure you woman exclaimed heathcliff you shall not leave wuthering heights till tomorrow morning it is a foolish story to assert that catherine could not bear to see me and as to surprising her i desire it you must prepare her ask her if i may come you say she never mentions my name and that i am never mentioned to her to whom should she mention me if i am a forbidden topic in the house she thinks you are all spies for her husband oh no doubt in hell among you i guess by her silence as much as anything what she feels you say she is often restless and is that a proof of tranquillity you talk of her mind being unsettled how the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation and that insipid paltry creature attending her from duty and humanity from pity and charity he might as well plant an oak in a flowerpot and expect it to thrive as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares let us settle it at once will you stay here and am i to fight my way to catherine over linton and his footmen or will you be my friend as you have been hitherto and do what i request decide cause there is no reason for my lingering another minute if you persist in your stubborn 
 well mr lockwood i argued and complained and flatly refused him fifty times but in the long run he forced me to an agreement i engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress and should she consent i promised to let him have intelligence of next absence from home when he might come and get in as he was able i be there and my should be equally out of the way was it right or wrong i fear it was wrong though expedient i thought i prevented another explosion by my compliance and i thought too it might create a favourable crisis in mental illness and then i remembered mr stern rebuke of my carrying tales and i tried to smooth away all disquietude on the subject by affirming with frequent iteration that that betrayal of trust if it merited so harsh an appellation should be the last notwithstanding my journey homeward was sadder than my journey thither and many misgivings i had ere i could prevail on myself to put the missive into mrs hand 
 but here is kenneth go down and tell him how much better you are my history is dree as we say and will serve to while away another morning 
 dree and dreary i reflected as the good woman descended to receive the doctor and not exactly of the kind which i should have chosen to amuse me but never mind extract wholesome medicines from mrs bitter herbs and firstly let me beware the fascination that lurks in catherine brilliant eyes i should be in a curious taking if i surrendered my heart to that young person and the daughter turned out a second edition of the mother

 chapter fourteen 
 
 jo was very busy in the garret for the october days began to grow chilly and the afternoons were short for two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window showing jo seated on the old sofa writing busily with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her while scrabble the pet rat promenaded the beams overhead accompanied by his oldest son a fine young fellow who was evidently very proud of his whiskers quite absorbed in her work jo scribbled away till the last page was filled when she signed her name with a flourish and threw down her pen exclaiming 
 there done my best if this suit i shall have to wait till i can do better 
 lying back on the sofa she read the manuscript carefully through making dashes here and there and putting in many exclamation points which looked like little balloons then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon and sat a minute looking at it with a sober wistful expression which plainly showed how ernest her work had been desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall it it she kept her papers and a few books safely shut away from scrabble who being likewise of a literary turn was fond of making a circulating library of such books as were left in his way by eating the leaves from this tin receptacle jo produced another manuscript and putting both in her pocket crept quietly downstairs leaving her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink 
 she put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible and going to the back entry window got out upon the roof of a low porch swung herself down to the grassy bank and took a roundabout way to the road once there she composed herself hailed a passing omnibus and rolled away to town looking very merry and mysterious 
 if anyone had been watching her he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar for on alighting she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street having found the place with some difficulty she went into the doorway looked up the dirty stairs and after standing stock still a minute suddenly dived into the street and walked away as rapidly as she came this maneuver she repeated several times to the great amusement of a young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite on returning for the third time jo gave herself a shake pulled her hat over her eyes and walked up the stairs looking as if she were going to have all her teeth out 
 there was a sign among others which adorned the entrance and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth the young gentleman put on his coat took his hat and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway saying with a smile and a shiver like her to come alone but if she has a bad time need someone to help her home 
 in ten minutes jo came running downstairs with a very red face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort when she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased and passed him with a nod but he followed asking with an air of sympathy did you have a bad time 
 not very 
 you got through quickly 
 yes thank goodness 
 why did you go alone 
 want anyone to know 
 the oddest fellow i ever saw how many did you have out 
 jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something 
 there are two which i want to have come out but i must wait a week 
 what are you laughing at you are up to some mischief jo said laurie looking mystified 
 so are you what were you doing sir up in that billiard saloon 
 begging your pardon it a billiard saloon but a gymnasium and i was taking a lesson in fencing 
 glad of that 
 why 
 you can teach me and then when we play hamlet you can be laertes and make a fine thing of the fencing scene 
 laurie burst out with a hearty laugh which made several smile in spite of themselves 
 teach you whether we play hamlet or not grand fun and will straighten you up capitally but i believe that was your only reason for saying glad in that decided way was it now 
 no i was glad that you were not in the saloon because i hope you never go to such places do you 
 not often 
 i wish you 
 no harm jo i have billiards at home but no fun unless you have good players so as fond of it i come sometimes and have a game with ned moffat or some of the other fellows 
 oh dear so sorry for get to liking it better and better and will waste time and money and grow like those dreadful boys i did hope stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends said jo shaking her head 
 a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then without losing his respectability asked laurie looking nettled 
 that depends upon how and where he takes it i like ned and his set and wish keep out of it mother let us have him at our house though he wants to come and if you grow like him she be willing to have us frolic together as we do now 
 she asked laurie anxiously 
 no she bear fashionable young men and shut us all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them 
 well she get out her bandboxes yet not a fashionable party and mean to be but i do like harmless larks now and then you 
 yes nobody minds them so lark away but get wild will you or there will be an end of all our good times 
 be a double distilled saint 
 i bear saints just be a simple honest respectable boy and never desert you i know what i should do if you acted like mr son he had plenty of money but know how to spend it and got tipsy and gambled and ran away and forged his name i believe and was altogether horrid 
 you think likely to do the same much obliged 
 no i dear i hear people talking about money being such a temptation and i sometimes wish you were poor i worry then 
 do you worry about me jo 
 a little when you look moody and discontented as you sometimes do for got such a strong will if you once get started wrong afraid it would be hard to stop you 
 laurie walked in silence a few minutes and jo watched him wishing she had held her tongue for his eyes looked angry though his lips smiled as if at her warnings 
 are you going to deliver lectures all the way home he asked presently 
 of course not why 
 because if you are take a bus if not like to walk with you and tell you something very interesting 
 i preach any more and like to hear the news immensely 
 very well then come on a secret and if i tell you you must tell me yours 
 i got any began jo but stopped suddenly remembering that she had 
 you know you hide anything so up and fess or i tell cried laurie 
 is your secret a nice one 
 oh it all about people you know and such fun you ought to hear it and been aching to tell it this long time come you begin 
 not say anything about it at home will you 
 not a word 
 and you tease me in private 
 i never tease 
 yes you do you get everything you want out of people i know how you do it but you are a born wheedler 
 thank you fire away 
 well left two stories with a newspaperman and to give his answer next week whispered jo in her ear 
 hurrah for miss march the celebrated american authoress cried laurie throwing up his hat and catching it again to the great delight of two ducks four cats five hens and half a dozen irish children for they were out of the city now hush it come to anything i dare say but i rest till i had tried and i said nothing about it because i want anyone else to be disappointed 
 it fail why jo your stories are works of shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day it be fun to see them in print and we feel proud of our authoress 
 eyes sparkled for it is always pleasant to be believed in and a praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper puffs 
 your secret play fair teddy or never believe you again she said trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement 
 i may get into a scrape for telling but i promise not to so i will for i never feel easy in my mind till told you any plummy bit of news i get i know where glove is 
 is that all said jo looking disappointed as laurie nodded and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence 
 quite enough for the present as agree when i tell you where it is 
 tell then 
 laurie bent and whispered three words in ear which produced a comical change she stood and stared at him for a minute looking both surprised and displeased then walked on saying sharply how do you know 
 saw it 
 where 
 pocket 
 all this time 
 yes that romantic 
 no horrid 
 you like it 
 of course i ridiculous it be allowed my patience what would meg say 
 you are not to tell anyone mind that 
 i promise 
 that was understood and i trusted you 
 well i for the present anyway but disgusted and wish you told me 
 i thought be pleased 
 at the idea of anybody coming to take meg away no thank you 
 feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away 
 like to see anyone try it cried jo fiercely 
 so should i and laurie chuckled at the idea 
 i think secrets agree with me i feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that said jo rather ungratefully 
 race down this hill with me and be all right suggested laurie 
 no one was in sight the smooth road sloped invitingly before her and finding the temptation irresistible jo darted away soon leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the success of his treatment for his atalanta came panting up with flying hair bright eyes ruddy cheeks and no signs of dissatisfaction in her face 
 i wish i was a horse then i could run for miles in this splendid air and not lose my breath it was capital but see what a guy made me go pick up my things like a cherub as you are said jo dropping down under a maple tree which was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves 
 laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property and jo bundled up her braids hoping no one would pass by till she was tidy again but someone did pass and who should it be but meg looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit for she had been making calls 
 what in the world are you doing here she asked regarding her disheveled sister with surprise 
 getting leaves meekly answered jo sorting the rosy handful she had just swept up 
 and hairpins added laurie throwing half a dozen into lap they grow on this road meg so do combs and brown straw hats 
 you have been running jo how could you when will you stop such romping ways said meg reprovingly as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair with which the wind had taken liberties 
 never till stiff and old and have to use a crutch try to make me grow up before my time meg hard enough to have you change all of a sudden let me be a little girl as long as i can 
 as she spoke jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling of her lips for lately she had felt that margaret was fast getting to be a woman and secret made her dread the separation which must surely come some time and now seemed very near he saw the trouble in her face and drew attention from it by asking quickly where have you been calling all so fine 
 at the gardiners and sallie has been telling me all about belle wedding it was very splendid and they have gone to spend the winter in paris just think how delightful that must be 
 do you envy her meg said laurie 
 afraid i do 
 glad of it muttered jo tying on her hat with a jerk 
 why asked meg looking surprised 
 because if you care much about riches you will never go and marry a poor man said jo frowning at laurie who was mutely warning her to mind what she said 
 i shall never go and marry anyone observed meg walking on with great dignity while the others followed laughing whispering skipping stones and behaving like children as meg said to herself though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on 
 for a week or two jo behaved so queerly that her sisters were quite bewildered she rushed to the door when the postman rang was rude to mr brooke whenever they met would sit looking at meg with a face occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner laurie and she were always making signs to one another and talking about spread eagles till the girls declared they had both lost their wits on the second saturday after jo got out of the window meg as she sat sewing at her window was scandalized by the sight of laurie chasing jo all over the garden and finally capturing her in bower what went on there meg could not see but shrieks of laughter were heard followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers 
 what shall we do with that girl she never will behave like a young lady sighed meg as she watched the race with a disapproving face 
 i hope she she is so funny and dear as she is said beth who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at having secrets with anyone but her 
 very trying but we never can make her commy la fo added amy who sat making some new frills for herself with her curls tied up in a very becoming way two agreeable things that made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike 
 in a few minutes jo bounced in laid herself on the sofa and affected to read 
 have you anything interesting there asked meg with condescension 
 nothing but a story amount to much i guess returned jo carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight 
 better read it aloud that will amuse us and keep you out of mischief said amy in her most tone 
 the name asked beth wondering why jo kept her face behind the sheet 
 the rival painters 
 that sounds well read it said meg 
 with a loud hem and a long breath jo began to read very fast the girls listened with interest for the tale was romantic and somewhat pathetic as most of the characters died in the end i like that about the splendid picture was approving remark as jo paused 
 i prefer the lovering part viola and angelo are two of our favorite names that queer said meg wiping her eyes for the lovering part was tragical 
 who wrote it asked beth who had caught a glimpse of face 
 the reader suddenly sat up cast away the paper displaying a flushed countenance and with a funny mixture of solemnity and excitement replied in a loud voice your sister 
 you cried meg dropping her work 
 very good said amy critically 
 i knew it i knew it oh my jo i am so proud and beth ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success 
 dear me how delighted they all were to be sure how meg believe it till she saw the words miss josephine march actually printed in the paper how graciously amy critisized the artistic parts of the story and offered hints for a sequel which unfortunately be carried out as the hero and heroine were dead how beth got excited and skipped and sang with joy how hannah came in to exclaim sakes alive well i never in great astonishment at that how proud mrs march was when she knew it how jo laughed with tears in her eyes as she declared she might as well be a peacock and done with it and how th spread eagle might be said to flap his wings triumphantly over the house of march as the paper passed from hand to hand 
 tell us about it when did it come how much did you get for it what will father say laurie laugh cried the family all in one breath as they clustered about jo for these foolish affectionate people mad a jubilee of every little household joy 
 stop jabbering girls and tell you everything said jo wondering if miss burney felt any grander over her evilina than she did over her rival painters having told how she disposed of her tales jo added and when i went to get my answer the man said he liked them both but pay beginners only let them print in his paper and noticed the stories it was good practice he said and when the beginners improved anyone would pay so i let him have the two stories and today this was sent to me and laurie caught me with it and insisted on seeing it so i let him and he said it was good and i shall write more and going to get the next paid for and i am so happy for in time i may be able to support myself and help the girls 
 breath gave out here and wrapping her head in the paper she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved were the dearest wishes of her heart and this seemed to be the first step toward that happy end

 they look at each other and she throws her self into his arms holding her tight they kiss passionately then hold each other for a few more moments and ann cries against his shoulder they release enough for her to turn around to look back down the street then she looks at back him they manage a smile at each other and then ann looks down unable to stay the inevitable turning away from him she opens the door and gets out without looking back she starts off down the street her walk turning into a run joe watches her as she disappears round the corner joe looks out at the empty street toward the gate and looking as if he might go after her but after a pause he looks away glumly then switches on the engine and drives off 
 in the embassy princess ann stands in a large room across from the others in their bedclothes ambassador the countess who is upset wiping her nose with a handkerchief and the general who stands

 they stand for a moment then bow and walk away at the door the countess takes a tray from a servant 
 no milk and crackers 
 
 the countess gives them back about to shut the door 
 that will be all thank you countess 
 
 the countess bows in respect and then goes out closing the door 
 alone in the room the princess walks slowly over to a window looking out over the city in silence 
 
 the next day joe sits in his apartment looking out of his window over the town there is a knock at the door and joe looks up hopefully the knocking persists and he walks to the door slowly and opens it then turns around in disappointment

lionfish nov chapter fourteen cornelius fudgecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry ron and hermione had always known that hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures during their first year at hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant dog christened fluffy and if as a boy hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle harry was sure have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs harry could just imagine the hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it but he was equally certain that hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody 
 
 harry half wished he found out how to work diary again and again ron and hermione made him recount what seen until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long circular conversations that followed 
 
 riddle might have got the wrong person said hermione maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people 
 
 how many monsters think this place can hold ron asked dully 
 
 we always knew hagrid had been expelled said harry miserably and the attacks stopped after hagrid was kicked out otherwise riddle have got his award 
 
 ron tried a different tack 
 
 riddle does sound like percy who asked him to squeal on hagrid anyway 
 
 but the monster had killed someone ron said hermione 
 
 and riddle was going to go back to some muggle orphanage if they closed hogwarts said harry i blame him for wanting to stay here 
 
 you met hagrid down knockturn alley you harry 
 
 he was buying a slug repellent said harry quickly 
 
 the three of them fell silent after a long pause hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice 
 
 do you think we should go and ask hagrid about it all 
 
 be a cheerful visit said ron hello hagrid tell us have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately 
 
 in the end they decided that they would not say anything to hagrid unless there was another attack and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled it was now nearly four months since justin and nearly headless nick had been petrified and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker whoever it was had retired for good peeves had finally got bored of his oh potter you rotter song ernie macmillan asked harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in herbology one day and in march several of the mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three this made professor sprout very happy 
 
 the moment they start trying to move into each pots know fully mature she told harry then be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing 
 
 the second years were given something new to think about during their easter holidays the time had come to choose their subjects for the third year a matter that hermione at least took very seriously 
 
 it could affect our whole future she told harry and ron as they pored over lists of new subjects marking them with checks 
 
 i just want to give up potions said harry 
 
 we said ron gloomily we keep all our old subjects or ditched defense against the dark arts 
 
 but very important said hermione shocked 
 
 not the way lockhart teaches it said ron i learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose 
 
 neville longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family all giving him different advice on what to choose confused and worried he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out asking people whether they thought arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of ancient runes dean thomas who like harry had grown up with muggles ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list then picking the subjects it landed on hermione took advice but signed up for everything 
 
 harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what uncle vernon and aunt petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them not that he get any guidance percy weasley was eager to share his experience 
 
 depends where you want to go harry he said never too early to think about the future so recommend divination people say muggle studies is a soft option but i personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the community particularly if thinking of working in close contact with them look at my father he has to deal with muggle business all the time my brother charlie was always more of an outdoor type so he went for care of magical creatures play to your strengths harry 
 
 but the only thing harry felt he was really good at was quidditch in the end he chose the same new subjects as ron feeling that if he was lousy at them at least have someone friendly to help him 
 
 next quidditch match would be against hufflepuff wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner so that harry barely had time for anything but quidditch and homework however the training sessions were getting better or at least drier and the evening before match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling chances for the quidditch cup had never been better 
 
 but his cheerful mood last long at the top of the stairs to the dormitory he met neville longbottom who was looking frantic 
 
 harry i know who did it i just found 
 
 watching harry fearfully neville pushed open the door 
 
 the contents of trunk had been thrown everywhere his cloak lay ripped on the floor the bedclothes had been pulled off his and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet the contents strewn over the mattress 
 
 harry walked over to the bed treading on a few loose pages of travels with trolls as he and neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed ron dean and seamus came in dean swore loudly 
 
 what happened harry 
 
 no idea said harry but ron was examining robes all the pockets were hanging out 
 
 been looking for something said ron is there anything missing 
 
 harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk it was only as he threw the last of the lockhart books back into it that he realized what there 
 
 gone he said in an undertone to ron 
 
 what 
 
 harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and ron followed him out they hurried down to the gryffindor common room which was and joined hermione who was sitting alone reading a book called ancient runes made easy 
 
 hermione looked aghast at the news 
 
 but only a gryffindor could have stolen nobody else knows our password 
 
 exactly said harry 
 
 they woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light refreshing breeze 
 
 perfect quidditch conditions said wood enthusiastically at the gryffindor table loading the plates with scrambled eggs harry buck up there you need a decent breakfast 
 
 harry had been staring down the packed gryffindor table wondering if the new owner of diary was right in front of his eyes hermione had been urging him to report the robbery but harry like the idea have to tell a teacher all about the diary and how many people knew why hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago he want to be the one who brought it all up again 
 
 as he left the great hall with ron and hermione to go and collect his quidditch things another very serious worry was added to growing list he had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again 
 
 kill this time let me rip tear 
 
 he shouted aloud and ron and hermione both jumped away from him in alarm 
 
 the voice said harry looking over his shoulder i just heard it again you 
 
 ron shook his head hermione however clapped a hand to her forehead 
 
 harry i think just understood something got to go to the library 
 
 and she sprinted away up the stairs 
 
 what does she understand said harry distractedly still looking around trying to tell where the voice had come from 
 
 loads more than i do said ron shaking his head 
 
 but she got to go to the library 
 
 because what hermione does said ron shrugging when in doubt go to the library 
 
 harry stood irresolute trying to catch the voice again but people were now emerging from the great hall behind him talking loudly exiting through the front doors on their way to the quidditch pitch 
 
 better get moving said ron nearly eleven the match 
 
 harry raced up to gryffindor tower collected his nimbus two thousand and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game 
 
 the teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause oliver wood took off for a flight around the goal posts madam hooch released the balls the hufflepuffs who played in canary yellow were standing in a huddle having a discussion of tactics 
 
 harry was just mounting his broom when professor mcgonagall came half marching half running across the pitch carrying an enormous purple megaphone 
 
 heart dropped like a stone 
 
 this match has been cancelled professor mcgonagall called through the megaphone addressing the packed stadium there were boos and shouts oliver wood looking devastated landed and ran toward professor mcgonagall without getting off his broomstick 
 
 but professor he shouted got to play the cup gryffindor 
 
 professor mcgonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone 
 
 all students are to make their way back to the house common rooms where their heads of houses will give them further information as quickly as you can please 
 
 then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned harry over to her 
 
 potter i think better come with me 
 
 wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time harry saw ron detach himself from the complaining crowd he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle to surprise professor mcgonagall object 
 
 yes perhaps better come too weasley 
 
 some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled others looked worried harry and ron followed professor mcgonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase but they taken to office this time 
 
 this will be a bit of a shock said professor mcgonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary there has been another attack another double attack 
 
 insides did a horrible somersault professor mcgonagall pushed the door open and he and ron entered madam pomfrey was bending over a girl with long curly hair harry recognized her as the ravenclaw accidentally asked for directions to the slytherin common room and on the bed next to her was 
 
 hermione ron groaned 
 
 hermione lay utterly still her eyes open and glassy 
 
 they were found near the library said professor mcgonagall i suppose either of you can explain this it was on the floor next to them 
 
 she was holding up a small circular mirror 
 
 harry and ron shook their heads both staring at hermione 
 
 i will escort you back to gryffindor tower said professor mcgonagall heavily i need to address the students in any case 
 
 all students will return to their house common rooms by six in the evening no student is to leave the dormitories after that time you will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher no student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher all further quidditch training and matches are to be postponed there will be no more evening activities 
 
 the gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to professor mcgonagall in silence she rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice i need hardly add that i have rarely been so distressed it is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught i would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward 
 
 she climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole and the gryffindors began talking immediately 
 
 two gryffindors down not counting a gryffindor ghost one ravenclaw and one hufflepuff said the weasley lee jordan counting on his fingers any of the teachers noticed that the slytherins are all safe it obvious all this coming from slytherin the heir of slytherin the monster of slytherin why they just chuck all the slytherins out he roared to nods and scattered applause 
 
 percy weasley was sitting in a chair behind lee but for once he seem keen to make his views heard he was looking pale and stunned 
 
 in shock george told harry quietly that ravenclaw girl penelope clearwater a prefect i think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect 
 
 but harry was only he seem to be able to get rid of the picture of hermione lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone and if the culprit caught soon he was looking at a lifetime back with the dursleys tom riddle had turned hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a muggle orphanage if the school closed harry now knew exactly how he had felt 
 
 we going to do said ron quietly in ear think they suspect hagrid 
 
 got to go and talk to him said harry making up his mind i believe him this time but if he set the monster loose last time know how to get inside the chamber of secrets and a start 
 
 but mcgonagall said got to stay in our tower unless in class 
 
 i think said harry more quietly still time to get my old cloak out again 
 
 harry had inherited just one thing from his father a long and silvery invisibility cloak it was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit hagrid without anyone knowing about it they went to bed at the usual time waited until neville dean and seamus had stopped discussing the chamber of secrets and finally fallen asleep then got up dressed again and threw the cloak over themselves 
 
 the journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors enjoyable harry who had wandered the castle at night several times before had never seen it so crowded after sunset teachers prefects and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs staring around for any unusual activity their invisibility cloak stop them making any noise and there was a particularly tense moment when ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where snape stood standing guard thankfully snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment ron swore it was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open 
 
 it was a clear starry night they hurried toward the lit windows of house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door 
 
 seconds after they had knocked hagrid flung it open they found themselves with him aiming a crossbow at them fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him 
 
 oh he said lowering the weapon and staring at them you two 
 
 that for said harry pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside 
 
 nothin nothin hagrid muttered bin expectin sit down make tea 
 
 he hardly seemed to know what he was doing he nearly extinguished the fire spilling water from the kettle on it and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand 
 
 are you okay hagrid said harry did you hear about hermione 
 
 oh i heard all righ said hagrid a slight break in his voice 
 
 he kept glancing nervously at the windows he poured them both large mugs of boiling water he had forgotten to add tea bags and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door 
 
 hagrid dropped the fruitcake harry and ron exchanged panicstricken looks then threw the invisibility cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner hagrid checked that they were hidden seized his crossbow and flung open his door once more 
 
 good evening hagrid 
 
 it was dumbledore he entered looking deadly serious and was followed by a second very man 
 
 the stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes a pinstriped suit a scarlet tie a long black cloak and pointed purple boots under his arm he carried a bowler 
 
 boss ron breathed cornelius fudge the minister of magic 
 
 harry elbowed ron hard to make him shut up 
 
 hagrid had gone pale and sweaty he dropped into one of his chairs and looked from dumbledore to cornelius fudge 
 
 bad business hagrid said fudge in rather clipped tones very bad business had to come four attacks on gone far enough got to act 
 
 i never said hagrid looking imploringly at dumbledore you know i never professor dumbledore sir 
 
 i want it understood cornelius that hagrid has my full confidence said dumbledore frowning at fudge 
 
 look albus said fudge uncomfortably against him got to do something the school governors have been in touch 
 
 yet again cornelius i tell you that taking hagrid away will not help in the slightest said dumbledore his blue eyes were full of a fire harry had never seen before 
 
 look at it from my point of view said fudge fidgeting with his bowler under a lot of pressure got to be seen to be doing something if it turns out it hagrid be back and no more said but got to take him got to be doing my duty 
 
 take me said hagrid who was trembling take me where 
 
 for a short stretch only said fudge not meeting eyes not a punishment hagrid more a precaution if someone else is caught be let out with a full apology 
 
 not azkaban croaked hagrid 
 
 before fudge could answer there was another loud rap on the door 
 
 dumbledore answered it it was turn for an elbow in the ribs let out an audible gasp 
 
 mr lucius malfoy strode into hut swathed in a long black traveling cloak smiling a cold and satisfied smile fang started to growl 
 
 already here fudge he said approvingly good good 
 
 you said hagrid furiously get outta my house 
 
 my dear man please believe me i have no pleasure at all in being inside your er call this a house said lucius malfoy sneering as he looked around the small cabin i simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here 
 
 and what exactly did you want with me lucius said dumbledore he spoke politely but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes 
 
 dreadful thing dumbledore said malfoy lazily taking out a long roll of parchment but the governors feel time for you to step aside this is an order of suspension find all twelve signatures on it afraid we feel losing your touch how many attacks have there been now two more this afternoon it at this rate be no left at hogwarts and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school 
 
 oh now see here lucius said fudge looking alarmed dumbledore suspended no no last thing we want just now 
 
 the appointment or suspension of the headmaster is a matter for the governors fudge said mr malfoy smoothly and as dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks 
 
 see here malfoy if dumbledore stop them said fudge whose upper lip was sweating now i mean to say who can 
 
 that remains to be seen said mr malfoy with a nasty smile but as all twelve of us have voted 
 
 hagrid leapt to his feet his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling 
 
 many did yeh have ter threaten before they agreed malfoy eh he roared 
 
 dear dear you know that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days hagrid said mr malfoy i would advise you not to shout at the azkaban guards like that they like it at all 
 
 yeh dumbledore yelled hagrid making fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket take him away a chance be 
 
 calm yourself hagrid said dumbledore sharply he looked at lucius malfoy 
 
 if the governors want my removal lucius i shall of course step aside 
 
 but stuttered fudge 
 
 no growled hagrid 
 
 dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off lucius cold gray ones 
 
 however said dumbledore speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word you will find that i will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it 
 
 for a second harry was almost sure eyes flickered toward the corner where he and ron were hidden 
 
 admirable sentiments said malfoy bowing we shall all miss your er highly individual way of running things albus and only hope your successor willl manage to prevent any ah killins 
 
 he strode to the cabin door opened it and bowed dumbledore out fudge fiddling with his bowler waited for hagrid to go ahead of him but hagrid stood his ground took a deep breath and said carefully if anyone wanted ter find out some stuff all have ter do would be ter follow the spiders lead em right all sayin 
 
 fudge stared at him in amazement 
 
 all right comin said hagrid pulling on his moleskin overcoat but as he was about to follow fudge through the door he stopped again and said loudly need ter feed fang while away 
 
 the door banged shut and ron pulled off the invisibility cloak 
 
 in trouble now ron said hoarsely no dumbledore they might as well close the school tonight be an attack a day with him gone 
 
 fang started howling scratching at the closed door 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the chamber of secrets 
 

lionfish nov chapter fourteen grudgecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 no one in gryffindor tower slept that night they knew that the castle was being searched again and the whole house stayed awake in the common room waiting to hear whether black had been caught professor mcgonagall came back at dawn to tell them that he had again escaped 
 
 throughout the day everywhere they went they saw signs of tighter security professor flitwick could be seen teaching the front doors to recognize a large picture of sirius black filch was suddenly bustling up and down the corridors boarding up everything from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes sir cadogan had been fired his portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the seventh floor and the fat lady was back she had been expertly restored but was still extremely nervous and had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection a bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her they paced the corridor in a menacing group talking in grunts and comparing the size of their clubs 
 
 harry help noticing that the statue of the witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked it seemed that fred and george had been right in thinking that they and now harry ron and hermione were the only ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it 
 
 reckon we should tell someone harry asked ron 
 
 we know not coming in through said ron dismissively heard if the shop had been broken into 
 
 harry was glad ron took this view if the witch was boarded up too he would never be able to go into hogsmeade again 
 
 ron had become an instant celebrity for the first time in his life people were paying more attention to him than to harry and it was clear that ron was rather enjoying the experience though still severely shaken by the events he was happy to tell anyone who asked what had happened with a wealth of detail 
 
 i was asleep and i heard this ripping noise and i thought it was in my dream you know but then there was this drafti woke up and one side of the hangings on my bed had been pulled downi rolled overand i saw him standing over melike a skeleton with loads of filthy hairholding this great long knife been twelve inchesand he looked at me and i looked at him and then i yelled and he scampered 
 
 why though ron added to harry as the group of second year girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed why did he run 
 
 harry had been wondering the same thing why had black having got the wrong bed not silenced ron and proceeded to harry black had proved twelve years ago that he mind murdering innocent people and this time he had been facing five unarmed boys four of whom were asleep 
 
 he known have a job getting back out of the castle once yelled and woken people up said harry thoughtfully had to kill the whole house to get back through the portrait holethen he met the teachers 
 
 neville was in total disgrace professor mcgonagall was so furious with him she had banned him from all future hogsmeade visits given him a detention and forbidden anyone to give him the password into the tower poor neville was forced to wait outside the common room every night for somebody to let him in while the security trolls leered unpleasantly at him none of these punishments however came close to matching the one his grandmother had in store for him two days after she sent neville the very worst thing a hogwarts student could receive over breakfast a howler 
 
 the school owls swooped into the great hall carrying the mail as usual and neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front of him a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak harry and ron who were sitting opposite him recognized the letter as a howler at once ron had got one from his mother the year before 
 
 run for it neville ron advised 
 
 neville need telling twice he seized the envelope and holding it before him like a bomb sprinted out of the hall while the slytherin table exploded with laughter at the sight of him they heard the howler go off in the entrance hall voice magically magnified to a hundred times its usual volume shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole family 
 
 harry was too busy feeling sorry for neville to notice immediately that he had a letter too hedwig got his attention by nipping him sharply on the wrist 
 
 ouch oh thanks hedwig 
 
 harry tore open the envelope while hedwig helped herself to some of cornflakes the note inside said 
 
 dear harry and ron 
 how about having tea with me this afternoon round six come collect you from the castle wait for me in the entrance hall not allowed out on your own 
 cheers 
 hagrid 
 he probably wants to hear all about black said ron 
 
 so at six that afternoon harry and ron left gryffindor tower passed the security trolls at a run and headed down to the entrance hall 
 
 hagrid was already waiting for them 
 
 all right hagrid said ron you want to hear about saturday night do you 
 
 already heard all abou it said hagrid opening the front doors and leading them outside 
 
 oh said ron looking slightly put out 
 
 the first thing they saw on entering cabin was buckbeak who was stretched out on top of patchwork quilt his enormous wings folded tight to his body enjoying a large plate of dead ferrets averting his eyes from this unpleasant sight harry saw a gigantic hairy brown suit and a very horrible tie hanging from the top of wardrobe door 
 
 what are they for hagrid said harry 
 
 case against the committee fer the disposal o dangerous creatures said hagrid this friday him an be goin down ter london together booked two beds on the knight bus 
 
 harry felt a nasty pang of guilt he had completely forgotten that trial was so near and judging by the uneasy look on face he had too they had also forgotten their promise about helping him prepare defense the arrival of the firebolt had driven it clean out of their minds 
 
 hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of bath buns but they knew better than to accept they had had too much experience with cooking 
 
 i got somethin ter discuss with you two said hagrid sitting himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious 
 
 what said harry 
 
 hermione said hagrid 
 
 what about her said ron 
 
 in a righ state what bin comin down ter visit me a lot since bin feelin lonely firs yeh weren talking to her because o the firebolt now yer not talkin to her because her cat 
 
 c ate scabbers ron interjected angrily 
 
 because her cat acted like all cats do hagrid continued doggedly cried a fair few times yeh know goin through a rough time at the moment bitten off she can chew if yeh ask me all the work tryin ter do still found time ter help me with case found some really good stuff fer mereckon stand a good chance now 
 
 hagrid we helped as well sorry harry began awkwardly 
 
 not blamin yeh said hagrid waving apology aside gawd knows had enough ter be getting on with seen yeh practicin quidditch hour o the day an night but i gotta tell yeh i thought you value yer friend broomsticks or rats all 
 
 harry and ron exchanged uncomfortable looks 
 
 really upset she was when black nearly stabbed yeh ron got her heart in the right place hermione has an you two not talkin to her 
 
 if just get rid of that cat speak to her again ron said angrily but still sticking up for it a maniac and she hear a word against it 
 
 ah well people can be a bit stupid abou their pets said hagrid wisely behind him buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto pillow 
 
 they spent the rest of their visit discussing improved chances for the quidditch cup at nine hagrid walked them back up to the castle 
 
 a large group of people was bunched around the bulletin board when they returned to the common room 
 
 hogsmeade next weekend said ron craning over the heads to read the new notice what reckon he added quietly to harry as they went to sit down 
 
 well filch done anything about the passage into honeydukes harry said even more quietly 
 
 harry said a voice in his right ear harry started and looked around at hermione who was sitting at the table right behind them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hiding her 
 
 harry if you go into hogsmeade tell professor mcgonagall about that map said hermione 
 
 can you hear someone talking harry growled ron not looking at hermione 
 
 ron how can you let him go with you after what sirius black nearly did to you i mean it tell 
 
 so now trying to get harry expelled said ron furiously you done enough damage this year 
 
 hermione opened her mouth to respond but with a soft hiss crookshanks leapt onto her lap hermione took one frightened look at the expression on face gathered up crookshanks and hurried away toward the girls dormitories 
 
 so how about it ron said to harry as though there had been no interruption come on last time we went you see anything you even been inside yet 
 
 harry looked around to check that hermione was well out of earshot 
 
 okay he said but taking the invisibility cloak this time 
 
 
 
 on saturday morning harry packed his invisibility cloak in his bag slipped the map into his pocket and went down to breakfast with everyone else hermione kept shooting suspicious looks down the table at him but he avoided her eye and was careful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors 
 
 bye harry called to ron see you when you get back 
 
 ron grinned and winked 
 
 harry hurried up to the third floor slipping the map out of his pocket as he went crouching behind the witch he smoothed it out a tiny dot was moving in his direction harry squinted at it the minuscule writing next to it read neville longbottom 
 
 harry quickly pulled out his wand muttered dissendium and shoved his bag into the statue but before he could climb in himself neville came around the corner 
 
 harry i forgot you going to hogsmeade either 
 
 hi neville said harry moving swiftly away from the statue and pushing the map back into his pocket what are you up to 
 
 nothing shrugged neville want a game of exploding snap 
 
 er not now i was going to go to the library and do that vampire essay for lupin 
 
 come with you said neville brightly i done it either 
 
 er hang on yeah i forgot i finished it last night 
 
 great you can help me said neville his round face anxious i understand that thing about the garlic at all do they have to eat it or 
 
 he broke off with a small gasp looking over shoulder 
 
 it was snape neville took a quick step behind harry 
 
 and what are you two doing here said snape coming to a halt and looking from one to the other an odd place to meet 
 
 to immense disquiet black eyes flicked to the doorways on either side of them and then to the witch 
 
 not meeting here said harry we just met here 
 
 indeed said snape you have a habit of turning up in unexpected places potter and you are very rarely there for no good reasoni suggest the pair of you return to gryffindor tower where you belong 
 
 harry and neville set off without another word as they turned the corner harry looked back snape was running one of his hands over the head examining it closely 
 
 harry managed to shake neville off at the fat lady by telling him the password then pretending left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back once out of sight of the security trolls he pulled out the map again and held it close to his nose 
 
 the third floor corridor seemed to be deserted harry scanned the map carefully and saw with a leap of relief that the tiny dot labeled severus snape was now back in its office 
 
 he sprinted back to the witch opened her hump heaved himself inside and slid down to meet his bag at the bottom of the stone chute he wiped the map blank again then set off at a run 
 
 
 
 harry completely hidden beneath the invisibility cloak emerged into the sunlight outside honeydukes and prodded ron in the back 
 
 me he muttered 
 
 what kept you ron hissed 
 
 snape was hanging around 
 
 they set off up the high street 
 
 where are you ron kept muttering out of the corner of his mouth are you still there this feels weird 
 
 they went to the post office ron pretended to be checking the price of an owl to bill in egypt so that harry could have a good look around the owls sat hooting softly down at him at least three hundred of them from great grays right down to tiny little scops owls local deliveries only which were so small they could have sat in the palm of hand 
 
 then they visited which was so packed with students harry had to exercise great care not to tread on anyone and cause a panic there were jokes and tricks to fulfill even and wildest dreams harry gave ron whispered orders and passed him some gold from under the cloak they left with their money bags considerably lighter than they had been on entering but their pockets bulging with dungbombs hiccup sweets frog spawn soap and a teacup apiece 
 
 the day was fine and breezy and neither of them felt like staying indoors so they walked past the three broomsticks and climbed a slope to visit the shrieking shack the most haunted dwelling in britain it stood a little way above the rest of the village and even in daylight was slightly creepy with its boarded windows and dank overgrown garden 
 
 even the hogwarts ghosts avoid it said ron as they leaned on the fence looking up at it i asked nearly headless nickhe says heard a very rough crowd lives here no one can get in fred and george tried obviously but all the entrances are sealed shut 
 
 harry feeling hot from their climb was just considering taking off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill moments later malfoy had appeared followed closely by crabbe and goyle malfoy was speaking 
 
 should have an owl from father any time now he had to go to the hearing to tell them about my armabout how i use it for three months 
 
 crabbe and goyle sniggered 
 
 i really wish i could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend no arm in im onest that as good as dead 
 
 malfoy suddenly caught sight of ron his pale face split in a malevolent grin 
 
 what are you doing weasley 
 
 malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind ron 
 
 suppose love to live here you weasley dreaming about having your own bedroom i heard your family all sleep in one room is that true 
 
 harry seized the back of robes to stop him from leaping on malfoy 
 
 leave him to me he hissed in ear 
 
 the opportunity was too perfect to miss harry crept silently around behind malfoy crabbe and goyle bent down and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path 
 
 we were just discussing your friend hagrid malfoy said to ron just trying to imagine what saying to the committee for the disposal of dangerous creatures think cry when they cut off his 
 
 splat 
 
 head jerked forward as the mud hit him his silverblond hair was suddenly dripping in muck 
 
 what the 
 
 ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing he was laughing so hard malfoy crabbe and goyle spun stupidly on the spot staring wildly around malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean 
 
 what was that who did that 
 
 very haunted up here it said ron with the air of one commenting on the weather 
 
 crabbe and goyle were looking scared their bulging muscles were no use against ghosts malfoy was staring madly around at the deserted landscape 
 
 harry sneaked along the path where a particularly sloppy puddle yielded some green sludge 
 
 splatter 
 
 crabbe and goyle caught some this time goyle hopped furiously on the spot trying to rub it out of his small dull eyes 
 
 it came from over there said malfoy wiping his face and staring at a spot some six feet to the left of harry 
 
 crabbe blundered forward his long arms outstretched like a zombie harry dodged around him picked up a stick and lobbed it at back harry doubled up with silent laughter as crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair trying to see who had thrown it as ron was the only person crabbe could see it was ron he started toward but harry stuck out his leg crabbe stumbled and his huge flat foot caught the hem of cloak harry felt a great tug then the cloak slid off his face 
 
 for a split second malfoy stared at him 
 
 aaargh he yelled pointing at head then he turned tail and ran at breakneck speed back down the hill crabbe and goyle behind him 
 
 harry tugged the cloak up again but the damage was done 
 
 harry ron said stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at the point where harry had disappeared better run for it if malfoy tells anyone better get back to the castle quick 
 
 see you later said harry and without another word he tore back down the path toward hogsmeade 
 
 would malfoy believe what he had seen would anyone believe malfoy nobody knew about the invisibility cloak nobody except dumbledore stomach turned over dumbledore would know exactly what had happened if malfoy said anything 
 
 back into honeydukes back down the cellar steps across the stone floor through the trapdoor harry pulled off the cloak tucked it under his arm and ran flat out along the passagemalfoy would get back first how long would it take him to find a teacher panting a sharp pain in his side harry slow down until he reached the stone slide he would have to leave the cloak where it was it was too much of a giveaway in case malfoy had tipped off a teacher he hid it in a shadowy corner then started to climb fast as he could his sweaty hands slipping on the sides of the chute he reached the inside of the hump tapped it with his wand stuck his head through and hoisted himself out the hump closed and just as harry jumped out from behind the statue he heard quick footsteps approaching 
 
 it was snape he approached harry at a swift walk his black robes swishing then stopped in front of him 
 
 so he said 
 
 there was a look of suppressed triumph about him harry tried to look innocent all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands which he quickly hid in his pockets 
 
 come with me potter said snape 
 
 harry followed him downstairs trying to wipe his hands clean on the inside of his robes without snape noticing they walked down the stairs to the dungeons and then into office 
 
 harry had been in here only once before and he had been in very serious trouble then too snape had acquired a few more slimy horrible things in jars since last time all standing on shelves behind his desk glinting in the firelight and adding to the threatening atmosphere 
 
 sit said snape 
 
 harry sat snape however remained standing 
 
 mr malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story potter said snape 
 
 harry say anything 
 
 he tells me that he was up by the shrieking shack when he ran into weasley apparently alone 
 
 still harry speak 
 
 mr malfoy states that he was standing talking to weasley when a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head how do you think that could have happened 
 
 harry tried to look mildly surprised 
 
 i know professor 
 
 eyes were boring into it was exactly like trying to stare down a hippogriff harry tried hard not to blink 
 
 mr malfoy then saw an extraordinary apparition can you imagine what it might have been potter 
 
 no said harry now trying to sound innocently curious 
 
 it was your head potter floating in midair 
 
 there was a long silence 
 
 maybe better go to madam pomfrey said harry if seeing things like 
 
 what would your head have been doing in hogsmeade potter said snape softly your head is not allowed in hogsmeade no part of your body has permission to be in hogsmeade 
 
 i know that said harry striving to keep his face free of guilt or fear it sounds like having hallucin 
 
 malfoy is not having hallucinations snarled snape and he bent down a hand on each arm of chair so that their faces were a foot apart if your head was in hogsmeade so was the rest of you 
 
 been up in gryffindor tower said harry like you told 
 
 can anyone confirm that 
 
 harry say anything thin mouth curled into a horrible smile 
 
 so he said straightening up again everyone from the minister of magic downward has been trying to keep famous harry potter safe from sirius black but famous harry potter is a law unto himself let the ordinary people worry about his safety famous harry potter goes where he wants to with no thought for the consequences 
 
 harry stayed silent snape was trying to provoke him into telling the truth he going to do it snape had no proof yet 
 
 how extraordinarily like your father you are potter snape said suddenly his eyes glinting he too was exceedingly arrogant a small amount of talent on the quidditch field made him think he was a cut above the rest of us too strutting around the place with his friends and admirersthe resemblance between you is uncanny 
 
 my dad strut said harry before he could stop himself and neither do i 
 
 your father set much store by rules either snape went on pressing his advantage his thin face full of malice rules were for lesser mortals not quidditch his head was so swollen 
 
 shut up 
 
 harry was suddenly on his feet rage such as he had not felt since his last night in privet drive was coursing through him he care that face had gone rigid the black eyes flashing dangerously 
 
 what did you say to me potter 
 
 i told you to shut up about my dad harry yelled i know the truth all right he saved your life dumbledore told me you even be here if it for my dad 
 
 sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk 
 
 and did the headmaster tell you the circumstances in which your father saved my life he whispered or did he consider the details too unpleasant for precious delicate ears 
 
 harry bit his lip he know what had happened and want to admit it but snape seemed to have guessed the truth 
 
 i would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father potter he said a terrible grin twisting his face have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism then let me correct you your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father got cold feet at the last moment there was nothing brave about what he did he was saving his own skin as much as mine had their joke succeeded he would have been expelled from hogwarts 
 
 uneven yellowish teeth were bared 
 
 turn out your pockets potter he spat suddenly 
 
 harry move there was a pounding in his ears 
 
 turn out your pockets or we go straight to the headmaster pull them out potter 
 
 cold with dread harry slowly pulled out the bag of tricks and the map 
 
 snap picked up the bag 
 
 ron gave them to me said harry praying get a chance to tip ron off before snape saw him he brought them back from hogsmeade last time 
 
 indeed and been carrying them around ever since how very touchingand what is this 
 
 snape had picked up the map harry tried with all his might to keep his face impassive 
 
 spare bit of parchment he said with a shrug 
 
 snape turned it over his eyes on harry 
 
 surely you need such a very old piece of parchment he said why i just throw this away 
 
 his hand moved toward the fire 
 
 no harry said quickly 
 
 so said snape his long nostrils quivering is this another treasured gift from mr weasley or is it something else a letter perhaps written in invisible ink or instructions to get into hogsmeade without passing the dementors 
 
 harry blinked eyes gleamed 
 
 let me see let me see he muttered taking out his wand and smoothing the map out on his desk reveal your secret he said touching the wand to the parchment 
 
 nothing happened harry clenched his hands to stop them from shaking 
 
 show yourself snape said tapping the map sharply 
 
 it stayed blank harry was taking deep calming breaths 
 
 professor severus snape master of this school commands you to yield the information you conceal snape said hitting the map with his wand 
 
 as though an invisible hand were writing upon it words appeared on the smooth surface of the map 
 
 mooney presents his compliments to professor snape and begs him to keep his abnormally large nose out of other business 
 
 snape froze harry stared dumbstruck at the message but the map stop there more writing was appearing beneath the first 
 
 mr prongs agrees with mr mooney and would like to add that professor snape is an ugly git 
 
 it would have been very funny if the situation been so serious and there was more 
 
 mr padfoot would like to register his astonishment that an idiot like that ever became a professor 
 
 harry closed his eyes in horror when opened them the map had had its last word 
 
 mr wormtail bids professor snape good day and advises him to wash his hair the slimeball 
 
 harry waited for the blow to fall 
 
 so said snape softly see about this 
 
 he strode across to his fire seized a fistful of glittering powder from a jar on the fireplace and threw it into the flames 
 
 lupin snape called into the fire i want a word 
 
 utterly bewildered harry stared at the fire a large shape had appeared in it revolving very fast seconds later professor lupin was clambering out of the fireplace brushing ash off his shabby robes 
 
 you called severus said lupin mildly 
 
 i certainly did said snape his face contorted with fury as he strode back to his desk i have just asked potter to empty his pockets he was carrying this 
 
 snape pointed at the parchment on which the words of messrs moony wormtail padfoot and prongs were still shining an odd closed expression appeared on face 
 
 well said snape 
 
 lupin continued to stare at the map harry had the impression that lupin was doing some very quick thinking 
 
 well said snape again this parchment is plainly full of dark magic this is supposed to be your area of expertise lupin where do you imagine potter got such a thing 
 
 lupin looked up and by the merest in direction warned him not to interrupt 
 
 full of dark magic he repeated mildly do you really think so severus it looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parchment that insults anybody who reads it childish but surely not dangerous i imagine harry got it from a joke shop 
 
 indeed said snape his jaw had gone rigid with anger you think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing you think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufacturers 
 
 harry understand what snape was talking about nor apparently did lupin 
 
 you mean by mr wormtail or one of these people he said harry do you know any of these men 
 
 no said harry quickly 
 
 you see severus said lupin turning back to snape it looks like a zonko product to me 
 
 right on cue ron came bursting into the office he was completely out of breath and stopped just short of desk clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak 
 
 i gave harry that stuff he choked bought itin ages ago 
 
 well said lupin clapping his hands together and looking around cheerfully that seems to clear that up severus take this back shall i he folded the map and tucked it inside his robes harry ron come with me i need a word about my vampire essay excuse us severus 
 
 harry dare look at snape as they left his office he ron and lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before speaking then harry turned to lupin 
 
 professor i 
 
 i want to hear explanations said lupin shortly he glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice i happen to know that this map was confiscated by mr filch many years ago yes i know a map he said as harry and ron looked amazed i want to know how it fell into your possession i am however astounded that you hand it in particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around and i let you have it back harry 
 
 harry had expected that and was too keen for explanations to protest 
 
 why did snape think got it from the manufacturers 
 
 because lupin hesitated because these mapmakers would have wanted to lure you out of school think it extremely entertaining 
 
 do you know them said harry impressed 
 
 met he said shortly he was looking at harry more seriously than ever before 
 
 expect me to cover up for you again harry i cannot make you take sirius black seriously but i would have thought that what you have heard when the dementors draw near you would have had more of an effect on you your parents gave their lives to keep you alive harry a poor way to repay them gambling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks 
 
 he walked away leaving harry feeling worse by far than he had at any point in office slowly he and ron mounted the marble staircase as harry passed the witch he remembered the invisibility cloak it was still down there but he dare go and get it 
 
 my fault said ron abruptly i persuaded you to go right it was stupid we done it 
 
 he broke off they reached the corridor where the security trolls were pacing and hermione was walking toward them one look at her face convinced harry that she had heard what had happened his heart plummeted had she told professor mcgonagall 
 
 come to have a good gloat said ron savagely as she stopped in front of them or have you just been to tell on us 
 
 no said hermione she was holding a letter in her hands and her lip was trembling i just thought you ought to knowhagrid lost his case buckbeak is going to be executed

lionfish nov chapter fourteen the unforgivable cursescontents prev chapter next chapter 
 the next two days passed without great incident unless you counted neville melting his sixth cauldron in potions professor snape who seemed to have attained new levels of vindictiveness over the summer gave neville detention and neville returned from it in a state of nervous collapse having been made to disembowel a barrel full of horned toads 
 
 you know why in such a foul mood you said ron to harry as they watched hermione teaching neville a scouring charm to remove the frog guts from under his fingernails 
 
 yeah said harry moody 
 
 it was common knowledge that snape really wanted the dark arts job and he had now failed to get it for the fourth year running snape had disliked all of their previous dark arts teachers and shown it but he seemed strangely wary of displaying overt animosity to moody indeed whenever harry saw the two of them together at mealtimes or when they passed in the corridors he had the distinct impression that snape was avoiding eye whether magical or normal 
 
 i reckon a bit scared of him you know harry said thoughtfully 
 
 imagine if moody turned snape into a horned toad said ron his eyes misting over and bounced him all around his dungeon 
 
 the gryffindor fourth years were looking forward to first lesson so much that they arrived early on thursday lunchtime and queued up outside his classroom before the bell had even rung the only person missing was hermione who turned up just in time for the lesson 
 
 been in the 
 
 library harry finished her sentence for her quick or we get decent seats 
 
 they hurried into three chairs right in front of the desk took out their copies of the dark forces a guide to and waited unusually quiet soon they heard distinctive clunking footsteps coming down the corridor and he entered the room looking as strange and frightening as ever they could just see his clawed wooden foot protruding from underneath his robes 
 
 you can put those away he growled stumping over to his desk and sitting down those books you need them 
 
 they returned the books to their bags ron looking excited 
 
 moody took out a register shook his long mane of grizzled gray hair out of his twisted and scarred face and began to call out names his normal eye moving steadily down the list while his magical eye swiveled around fixing upon each student as he or she answered 
 
 right then he said when the last person had declared themselves present had a letter from professor lupin about this class seems had a pretty thorough grounding in tackling dark creatures covered boggarts red caps hinkypunks grindylows kappas and werewolves is that right 
 
 there was a general murmur of assent 
 
 but behind very behind on dealing with curses said moody so here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other got one year to teach you how to deal with dark 
 
 what you staying ron blurted out 
 
 magical eye spun around to stare at ron ron looked extremely apprehensive but after a moment moody smiled the first time harry had seen him do so the effect was to make his heavily scarred face look more twisted and contorted than ever but it was nevertheless good to know that he ever did anything as friendly as smile ron looked deeply relieved 
 
 be arthur son eh moody said your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days staying just the one year special favor to year and then back to my quiet retirement 
 
 he gave a harsh laugh and then clapped his gnarled hands together 
 
 so straight into it curses they come in many strengths and forms now according to the ministry of magic supposed to teach you countercurses and leave it at that not supposed to show you what illegal dark curses look like until in the sixth year not supposed to be old enough to deal with it till then but professor got a higher opinion of your nerves he reckons you can cope and i say the sooner you know what up against the better how are you supposed to defend yourself against something never seen a wizard about to put an illegal curse on you going to tell you what about to do not going to do it nice and polite to your face you need to be prepared you need to be alert and watchful you need to put that away miss brown when talking 
 
 lavender jumped and blushed she had been showing parvati her completed horoscope under the desk apparently magical eye could see through solid wood as well as out of the back of his head 
 
 sodo any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law 
 
 several hands rose tentatively into the air including and moody pointed at ron though his magical eye was still fixed on lavender 
 
 er said ron tentatively my dad told me about it called the imperius curse or something 
 
 ah yes said moody appreciatively your father would know that one gave the ministry a lot of trouble at one time the imperius curse 
 
 moody got heavily to his mismatched feet opened his desk drawer and took out a glass jar three large black spiders were scuttling around inside it harry felt ron recoil slightly next to him ron hated spiders 
 
 moody reached into the jar caught one of the spiders and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it he then pointed his wand at it and muttered imperio 
 
 the spider leapt from hand on a fine thread of silk and began to swing backward and forward as though on a trapeze it stretched out its legs rigidly then did a back flip breaking the thread and landing on the desk where it began to cartwheel in circles moody jerked his wand and the spider rose onto two of its hind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance 
 
 everyone was laughing everyone except moody 
 
 think funny do you he growled like it would you if i did it to you 
 
 the laughter died away almost instantly 
 
 total control said moody quietly as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over i could make it jump out of the window drown itself throw itself down one of your throats 
 
 ron gave an involuntary shudder 
 
 years back there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the imperius curse said moody and harry knew he was talking about the days in which voldemort had been some job for the ministry trying to sort out who was being forced to act and who was acting of their own free will 
 
 the imperius curse can be fought and be teaching you how but it takes real strength of character and not got it better avoid being hit with it if you can constant vigilance he barked and everyone jumped 
 
 moody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back into the jar 
 
 anyone else know one another illegal curse 
 
 hand flew into the air again and so to slight surprise did the only class in which neville usually volunteered information was herbology which was easily his best subject neville looked surprised at his own daring 
 
 yes said moody his magical eye rolling right over to fix on neville 
 
 one the cruciatus curse said neville in a small but distinct voice 
 
 moody was looking very intently at neville this time with both eyes 
 
 your longbottom he said his magical eye swooping down to check the register again 
 
 neville nodded nervously but moody made no further inquiries turning back to the class at large he reached into the jar for the next spider and placed it upon the desktop where it remained motionless apparently too scared to move 
 
 the cruciatus curse said moody needs to be a bit bigger for you to get the idea he said pointing his wand at the spider engorgio 
 
 the spider swelled it was now larger than a tarantula abandoning all pretense ron pushed his chair backward as far away from desk as possible 
 
 moody raised his wand again pointed it at the spider and muttered crucio 
 
 at once the legs bent in upon its body it rolled over and began to twitch horribly rocking from side to side no sound came from it but harry was sure that if it could have given voice it would have been screaming moody did not remove his wand and the spider started to shudder and jerk more violently 
 
 stop it hermione said shrilly 
 
 harry looked around at her she was looking not at the spider but at neville and harry following her gaze saw that hands were clenched upon the desk in front of him his knuckles white his eyes wide and horrified 
 
 moody raised his wand the legs relaxed but it continued to twitch 
 
 reducio moody muttered and the spider shrank back to its proper size he put it back into the jar 
 
 pain said moody softly you need thumbscrews or knives to torture someone if you can perform the cruciatus one was very popular once too 
 
 rightanyone know any others 
 
 harry looked around from the looks on faces he guessed they were all wondering what was going to happen to the last spider hand shook slightly as for the third time she raised it into the air 
 
 yes said moody looking at her 
 
 avada kedavra hermione whispered 
 
 several people looked uneasily around at her including ron 
 
 ah said moody another slight smile twisting his lopsided mouth yes the last and worst avada killing curse 
 
 he put his hand into the glass jar and almost as though it knew what was coming the third spider scuttled frantically around the bottom of the jar trying to evade fingers but he trapped it and placed it upon the desktop it started to scuttle frantically across the wooden surface 
 
 moody raised his wand and harry felt a sudden thrill of foreboding 
 
 avada kedavra moody roared 
 
 there was a flash of blinding green light and a rushing sound as though a vast invisible something was soaring through the air instantaneously the spider rolled over onto its back unmarked but unmistakably dead several of the students stifled cries ron had thrown himself backward and almost toppled off his seat as the spider skidded toward him 
 
 moody swept the dead spider off the desk onto the floor 
 
 not nice he said calmly not pleasant and no countercurse no blocking it only one known person has ever survived it and sitting right in front of me 
 
 harry felt his face redden as eyes both of them looked into his own he could feel everyone else looking around at him too harry stared at the blank blackboard as though fascinated by it but not really seeing it at all 
 
 so that was how his parents had diedexactly like that spider had they been unblemished and unmarked too had they simply seen the flash of green light and heard the rush of speeding death before life was wiped from their bodies 
 
 harry had been picturing his parents deaths over and over again for three years now ever since found out they had been murdered ever since found out what had happened that night wormtail had betrayed his parents whereabouts to voldemort who had come to find them at their cottage how voldemort had killed father first how james potter had tried to hold him off while he shouted at his wife to take harry and runvoldemort had advanced on lily potter told her to move aside so that he could kill harryhow she had begged him to kill her instead refused to stop shielding her sonand so voldemort had murdered her too before turning his wand on harry 
 
 harry knew these details because he had heard his parents voices when he had fought the dementors last year for that was the terrible power of the dementors to force their victims to relive the worst memories of their lives and drown powerless in their own despair 
 
 moody was speaking again from a great distance it seemed to harry with a massive effort he pulled himself back to the present and listened to what moody was saying 
 
 avada a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words and i doubt get so much as a nosebleed but that matter not here to teach you how to do it 
 
 now if no countercurse why am i showing you because got to know got to appreciate what the worst is you want to find yourself in a situation where facing it constant vigilance he roared and the whole class jumped again 
 
 nowthose three curses avada kedavra imperius and cruciatus are known as the unforgivable curses the use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in azkaban what up against what got to teach you to fight you need preparing you need arming but most of all you need to practice constant vigilance get out your quillscopy this down 
 
 they spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on each of the unforgivable curses no one spoke until the bell rang but when moody had dismissed them and they had left the classroom a torrent of talk burst forth most people were discussing the curses in awed voices did you see it twitch and when he killed it just like that 
 
 they were talking about the lesson harry thought as though it had been some sort of spectacular show but he found it very entertaining and nor it seemed had hermione 
 
 hurry up she said tensely to harry and ron 
 
 not the ruddy library again said ron 
 
 no said hermione curtly pointing up a side passage neville 
 
 neville was standing alone halfway up the passage staring at the stone wall opposite him with the same horrified look he had worn when moody had demonstrated the cruciatus curse 
 
 neville hermione said gently 
 
 neville looked around 
 
 oh hello he said his voice much higher than usual interesting lesson it i wonder for dinner starving you 
 
 neville are you all right said hermione 
 
 oh yes fine neville gabbled in the same unnaturally high voice very interesting dinner i mean lesson for eating 
 
 ron gave harry a startled look 
 
 neville what 
 
 but an odd clunking noise sounded behind them and they turned to see professor moody limping toward them all four of them fell silent watching him apprehensively but when he spoke it was in a much lower and gentler growl than they had yet heard 
 
 all right sonny he said to neville why you come up to my office come onwe can have a cup of tea 
 
 neville looked even more frightened at the prospect of tea with moody he neither moved nor spoke moody turned his magical eye upon harry 
 
 you all right are you potter 
 
 yes said harry almost defiantly 
 
 blue eye quivered slightly in its socket as it surveyed harry then he said got to know it seems harsh maybe but got to know no point pretendingwellcome on longbottom got some books that might interest you 
 
 neville looked pleadingly at harry ron and hermione but they say anything so neville had no choice but to allow himself to be steered away one of gnarled hands on his shoulder 
 
 what was that about said ron watching neville and moody turn the corner 
 
 i know said hermione looking pensive 
 
 some lesson though eh said ron to harry as they set off for the great hall fred and george were right they he really knows his stuff moody he when he did avada kedavra the way that spider just died just snuffed it right 
 
 but ron fell suddenly silent at the look on face and speak again until they reached the great hall when he said he supposed they had better make a start on professor predictions tonight since they would take hours 
 
 hermione did not join in with harry and conversation during dinner but ate furiously fast and then left for the library again harry and ron walked back to gryffindor tower and harry who had been thinking of nothing else all through dinner now raised the subject of the unforgivable curses himself 
 
 moody and dumbledore be in trouble with the ministry if they knew seen the curses harry asked as they approached the fat lady 
 
 yeah probably said ron but always done things his way he and been getting in trouble for years i reckon attacks first and asks questions later look at his dustbins balderdash 
 
 the fat lady swung forward to reveal the entrance hole and they climbed into the gryffindor common room which was crowded and noisy 
 
 shall we get our divination stuff then said harry 
 
 i ron groaned 
 
 they went up to the dormitory to fetch their books and charts to find neville there alone sitting on his bed reading he looked a good deal calmer than at the end of lesson though still not entirely normal his eyes were rather red 
 
 you all right neville harry asked him 
 
 oh yes said neville fine thanks just reading this book professor moody lent me 
 
 he held up the book magical water plants of the mediterranean 
 
 apparently professor sprout told professor moody really good at herbology neville said there was a faint note of pride in his voice that harry had rarely heard there before he thought like this 
 
 telling neville what professor sprout had said harry thought had been a very tactful way of cheering neville up for neville very rarely heard that he was good at anything it was the sort of thing professor lupin would have done 
 
 harry and ron took their copies of unfogging the future back down to the common room found a table and set to work on their predictions for the coming month an hour later they had made very little progress though their table was littered with bits of parchment bearing sums and symbols and brain was as fogged as though it had been filled with the fumes from professor fire 
 
 i got a clue what this supposed to mean he said staring down at a long list of calculations 
 
 you know said ron whose hair was on end because of all the times he had run his fingers through it in frustration i think back to the old divination standby 
 
 what make it up 
 
 yeah said ron sweeping the jumble of scrawled notes off the table dipping his pen into some ink and starting to write 
 
 next monday he said as he scribbled i am likely to develop a cough owing to the unlucky conjunction of mars and jupiter he looked up at harry you know her just put in loads of misery lap it up 
 
 right said harry crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first years into the fire okayon monday i will be in danger of er burns 
 
 yeah you will be said ron darkly seeing the skrewts again on monday okay tuesday 
 
 lose a treasured possession said harry who was flicking through unfogging the future for ideas 
 
 good one said ron copying it down because ofermmercury why you get stabbed in the back by someone you thought was a friend 
 
 yeahcool said harry scribbling it down becausevenus is in the twelfth house 
 
 and on wednesday i think come off worst in a fight 
 
 aaah i was going to have a fight okay lose a bet 
 
 yeah be betting win my fight 
 
 they continued to make up predictions which grew steadily more tragic for another hour while the common room around them slowly emptied as people went up to bed crookshanks wandered over to them leapt lightly into an empty chair and stared inscrutably at harry rather as hermione might look if she knew they doing their homework properly 
 
 staring around the room trying to think of a kind of misfortune he yet used harry saw fred and george sitting together against the opposite wall heads together quills out poring over a single piece of parchment it was most unusual to see fred and george hidden away in a corner and working silently they usually liked to be in the thick of things and the noisy center of attention there was something secretive about the way they were working on the piece of parchment and harry was reminded of how they had sat together writing something back at the burrow he had thought then that it was another order form for weasleys wizard wheezes but it look like that this time if it had been they would surely have let lee jordan in on the joke he wondered whether it had anything to do with entering the triwizard tournament 
 
 as harry watched george shook his head at fred scratched out something with his quill and said in a very quiet voice that nevertheless carried across the almost deserted room no that sounds like accusing him got to be careful 
 
 then george looked over and saw harry watching him harry grinned and quickly returned to his predictions he want george to think he was eavesdropping shortly after that the twins rolled up their parchment said good night and went off to bed 
 
 fred and george had been gone ten minutes or so when the portrait hole opened and hermione climbed into the common room carrying a sheaf of parchment in one hand and a box whose contents rattled as she walked in the other crookshanks arched his back purring 
 
 hello she said just finished 
 
 so have i said ron triumphantly throwing down his quill 
 
 hermione sat down laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair and pulled predictions toward her 
 
 not going to have a very good month are you she said sardonically as crookshanks curled up in her lap 
 
 ah well at least forewarned ron yawned 
 
 you seem to be drowning twice said hermione 
 
 oh am i said ron peering down at his predictions better change one of them to getting trampled by a rampaging hippogriff 
 
 you think a bit obvious made these up said hermione 
 
 how dare you said ron in mock outrage been working like here 
 
 hermione raised her eyebrows 
 
 just an expression said ron hastily 
 
 harry laid down his quill too having just finished predicting his own death by decapitation 
 
 in the box he asked pointing at it 
 
 funny you should ask said hermione with a nasty look at ron she took off the lid and showed them the contents 
 
 inside were about fifty badges all of different colors but all bearing the same letters s p e w 
 
 spew said harry picking up a badge and looking at it this about 
 
 not spew said hermione impatiently stands for the society for the promotion of elfish welfare 
 
 never heard of it said ron 
 
 well of course you said hermione briskly only just started it 
 
 yeah said ron in mild surprise how many members have you got 
 
 well if you two join three said hermione 
 
 and you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying spew do you said ron 
 
 said hermione hotly i was going to put stop the outrageous abuse of our fellow magical creatures and campaign for a change in their legal status but it fit so the heading of our manifesto 
 
 she brandished the sheaf of parchment at them 
 
 been researching it thoroughly in the library elf enslavement goes back centuries i believe no done anything about it before now 
 
 hermione open your ears said ron loudly they like it they like being enslaved 
 
 our aims said hermione speaking even more loudly than ron and acting as though she heard a word are to secure fair wages and working conditions our aims include changing the law about use and trying to get an elf into the department for the regulation and control of magical creatures because shockingly underrepresented 
 
 and how do we do all this harry asked 
 
 we start by recruiting members said hermione happily i thought two sickles to join that buys a badge and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign treasurer ron got you a collecting tin upstairs and harry secretary so you might want to write down everything saying now as a record of our first meeting 
 
 there was a pause in which hermione beamed at the pair of them and harry sat torn between exasperation at hermione and amusement at the look on face the silence was broken not by ron who in any case looked as though he was temporarily dumbstruck but by a soft tap tap on the window harry looked across the now empty common room and saw illuminated by the moonlight a snowy owl perched on the windowsill 
 
 hedwig he shouted and he launched himself out of his chair and across the room to pull open the window 
 
 hedwig flew inside soared across the room and landed on the table on top of predictions 
 
 about time said harry hurrying after her 
 
 got an answer said ron excitedly pointing at the grubby piece of parchment tied to leg 
 
 harry hastily untied it and sat down to read whereupon hedwig fluttered onto his knee hooting softly 
 
 what does it say hermione asked breathlessly 
 
 the letter was very short and looked as though it had been scrawled in a great hurry harry read it aloud 
 
 harry 
 flying north immediately this news about your scar is the latest in a series of strange rumors that have reached me here if it hurts again go straight to dumbledore saying got out of retirement which means reading the signs even if no one else is 
 be in touch soon my best to ron and hermione keep your eyes open harry 
 sirius 
 harry looked up at ron and hermione who stared back at him 
 
 flying north hermione whispered coming back 
 
 reading what signs said ron looking perplexed harry up 
 
 for harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist jolting hedwig out of his lap 
 
 i told him harry said furiously 
 
 what are you on about said ron in surprise 
 
 made him think got to come back said harry now slamming his fist on the table so that hedwig landed on the back of chair hooting indignantly coming back because he thinks in trouble and nothing wrong with me and i got anything for you harry snapped at hedwig who was clicking her beak expectantly have to go up to the owlery if you want food 
 
 hedwig gave him an extremely offended look and took off for the open window cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went 
 
 harry hermione began in a pacifying sort of voice 
 
 going to bed said harry shortly see you in the morning 
 
 upstairs in the dormitory he pulled on his pajamas and got into his but he feel remotely tired 
 
 if sirius came back and got caught it would be his fault why he kept his mouth shut a few seconds pain and had to just had the sense to keep it to himself 
 
 he heard ron come up into the dormitory a short while later but did not speak to him for a long time harry lay staring up at the dark canopy of his bed the dormitory was completely silent and had he been less preoccupied harry would have realized that the absence of usual snores meant that he was not the only one lying awake 
 
 rowling

lionfish nov chapter fourteen percy and padfootcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry was first to wake up in his dormitory next morning he lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the ray of sunlight coming through the gap in his hangings and savoured the thought that it was saturday the first week of term seemed to have dragged on for ever like one gigantic history of magic lesson 
 
 judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight it was just after daybreak he pulled open the curtains around his bed got up and started to dress the only sound apart from the distant twittering of birds was the slow deep breathing of his fellow gryffindors he opened his schoolbag carefully pulled out parchment and quill and headed out of the dormitory for the common room 
 
 making straight for his favourite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room the detritus of bits of parchment old gobstones empty ingredient jars and sweet wrappers that usually covered the common room at the end of each day was gone as were all elf hats wondering vaguely how many elves had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not harry uncorked his ink bottle dipped his quill into it then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment thinking hard but after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate at a complete loss for what to say 
 
 he could now appreciate how hard it had been for ron and hermione to write him letters over the summer how was he supposed to tell sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the questions he was burning to ask without giving potential a lot of information he did not want them to have 
 
 he sat quite motionless for a while gazing into the fireplace then finally coming to a decision he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely on the parchment 
 
 dear snuffles 
 
 hope ok the first week back been terrible really glad the weekend 
 
 got a new defence against the dark arts teacher professor umbridge nearly as nice as your mum writing because that thing i wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when i was doing a detention with umbridge 
 
 all missing our biggest friend we hope be back soon 
 
 please write back quickly 
 
 best 
 
 harry 
 
 harry reread the letter several times trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider he could not see how they would know what he was talking aboutor who he was talking tojust from reading this letter he did hope sirius would pick up the hint about hagrid and tell them when he might be back harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what hagrid might be up to while he was not at hogwarts 
 
 considering it was a very short letter it had taken a long time to write sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it and he could now hear distant sounds of movement from the dormitories above sealing the parchment carefully he climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the owlery 
 
 i would not go that way if i were you said nearly headless nick drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of harry as he walked down the passage peeves is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pass the bust of paracelsus halfway down the corridor 
 
 does it involve paracelsus falling on top of the head asked harry 
 
 funnily enough it does said nearly headless nick in a bored voice subtlety has never been strong point off to try and find the bloody baron he might be able to put a stop to it see you harry 
 
 yeah bye said harry and instead of turning right he turned left taking a longer but safer route up to the owlery his spirits rose as he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky he had training later he would be back on the quidditch pitch at last 
 
 something brushed his ankles he looked down and saw the skeletal grey cat mrs norris slinking past him she turned lamplike yellow eyes on him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of wilfred the wistful 
 
 not doing anything wrong harry called after her she had the unmistakeable air of a cat that was off to report to her boss yet harry could not see why he was perfectly entitled to walk up to the owlery on a saturday morning 
 
 the sun was high in the sky now and when harry entered the owlery the glassless windows dazzled his eyes thick silvery beams of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundreds of owls nestled on rafters a little restless in the light some clearly just returned from hunting the floor crunched a little as he stepped across tiny animal bones craning his neck for a sight of hedwig 
 
 there you are he said spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling get down here got a letter for you 
 
 with a low hoot she stretched her great white wings and soared down on to his shoulder 
 
 right i know this says snuffles on the outside he told her giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and without knowing exactly why whispering but for sirius ok 
 
 she blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood 
 
 safe flight then said harry and he carried her to one of the windows with a moments pressure on his arm hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky he watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished then switched his gaze to hut clearly visible from this window and just as clearly uninhabited the chimney smokeless the curtains drawn 
 
 the treetops of the forbidden forest swayed in a light breeze harry watched them savouring the fresh air on his face thinking about quidditch later then he saw it a great reptilian winged hcrse just like the ones pulling the hogwarts carriages with leahery black wings spread wide like a rose up out of the trees like a grotesque giant bird it soared in a great circle then plunged back into the trees the whole thing had happened so quickly harry could hardly believe what he had seen except that his heart was hammering madly 
 
 the owlery door opened behind him he leapt in shock and turning quickly saw cho chang holding a letter and a parcel in his hands 
 
 hi said harry automatically 
 
 oh hi she said breathlessly i think anyone would be up here this early i only remembered five minutes ago my birthday 
 
 she held up the parcel 
 
 right said harry his brain seemed to have jammed he wanted to say something funny and interesting but the memory of that terrible winged horse was fresh in his mind 
 
 nice day he said gesturing to the windows his insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment the weather he was talking about the weather 
 
 yeah said cho looking around for a suitable owl good quidditch conditions i been out all week have you 
 
 no said harry 
 
 cho had selected one of the school barn owls she coaxed it down on to her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel 
 
 hey has gryffindor got a new keeper yet she asked 
 
 yeah said harry my friend ron weasley know him 
 
 the said cho rather coolly is he any good 
 
 yeah said harry i think so i see his tryout though i was in detention 
 
 cho looked up the parcel only to the legs 
 
 that umbridge foul she said in a low voice putting you in detention just because you told the truth about howhowhow he died everyone heard about it it was all over the school you were really brave standing up to her like that 
 
 insides so rapidly he felt as though he might actually float a few inches off the floor who cared about a stupid flying horse cho thought he had been really brave for a moment he considered showing her his cut hand as he helped her tie her parcel on to her owl but the very instant this thrilling thought occurred the owlery door opened again 
 
 filch the caretaker came wheezing into the room there were purple patches on his sunken veined cheeks his jowls were aquiver and his thin grey hair dishevelled he had obviously run here mrs norris came trotting at his heels gazing up at the owls overhead and mewing hungrily there was a restless shifting of wings from above and a large brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion 
 
 aha said filch taking a step towards harry his pouchy cheeks trembling with anger had a that you are intending to place a massive order for dungbombs 
 
 harry folded his arms and stared at the caretaker 
 
 who told you i was ordering dungbombs 
 
 cho was looking from harry to filch also frowning the barn owl on her arm tired of standing on one leg gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it 
 
 i have my sources said filch in a hiss now hand over whatever it is sending 
 
 feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter harry said i gone 
 
 gone said filch his face contorting with rage 
 
 gone said harry calmly 
 
 filch opened his mouth furiously mouthed for a few seconds then raked robes with his eyes 
 
 how do i know you got it in your pocket 
 
 because 
 
 i saw him send it said cho angrily 
 
 filch rounded on her 
 
 you saw him 
 
 right i saw him she said fiercely 
 
 there was a pause in which filch glared at cho and cho glared right back then the caretaker turned on his heel and shuffled back towards the door he stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at harry 
 
 if i get so much as a whiff of a dungbomb 
 
 he stumped off down the stairs mrs norris cast a last longing look at the owls and followed him 
 
 harry and cho looked at each other 
 
 thanks harry said 
 
 no problem said cho finally fixing the parcel to the barn other leg her face slightly pink you ordering dungbombs were you 
 
 no said harry 
 
 i wonder why he thought you were then she said as she carried the owl to the window 
 
 harry shrugged he was quite as mystified by that as she was though oddly it was not bothering him very much at the moment 
 
 they left the owlery together at the entrance of a corridor that led towards the west wing of the castle cho said going this see you around harry 
 
 yeah see you 
 
 she smiled at him and departed harry walked on feeling quietly elated he had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once you were really brave standing up to her like that cho had called him brave she did not hate him for being alive 
 
 of course she had preferred cedric he knew that though if only asked her to the ball before cedric had things might have turned out differently she had seemed sincerely sorry that had to refuse when harry asked her 
 
 morning harry said brightly to ron and hermione as he joined them at the gryffindor table in the great hall 
 
 what are you looking so pleased about said ron eyeing harry in surprise 
 
 erm quidditch later said harry happily pulling a large platter of bacon and eggs towards him 
 
 oh yeah said ron he put down the piece of toast he was eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice then he said listen you fancy going out a bit earlier with me do you just toergive me some practice before training so i can you know get my eye in a bit 
 
 yeah ok said harry 
 
 look i think you should said hermione seriously both really behind on homework as it 
 
 but she broke off the morning post was arriving and as usual the daily prophet was soaring towards her in the beak of a screech owl which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg hermione pushed a knut into its leather pouch took the newspaper and scanned the front page critically as the owl took off 
 
 anything interesting said ron harry grinned knowing ron was keen to keep her off the subject of homework 
 
 no she sighed just some guff about the bass player in the weird sisters getting married 
 
 hermione opened the paper and disappeared behind it harry devoted himself to another helping of eggs and bacon ron was staring up at the high windows looking slightly preoccupied 
 
 wait a moment said hermione suddenly oh no sirius 
 
 happened said harry snatching at the paper so violently it ripped down the middle with him and hermione each holding one half 
 
 the ministry of magic has received a from a reliable source that sirius black notorious mass murderer blah blah blah is currently hiding in read from her half in an anguished whisper 
 
 lucius malfoy bet anything said harry in a low furious voice he did recognise sirius on the platform 
 
 what said ron looking alarmed you say 
 
 shh said the other two 
 
 ministry warns wizarding community that black is very dangerous killed thirteen people broke out of azkaban the usual rubbish hermione concluded laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully at harry and ron well he just be able to leave the house again all she whispered dumbledore did warn him not to 
 
 harry looked down glumly at the bit of the prophet he had torn off most of the page was devoted to an advertisement for madam robes for all occasions which was apparently having a sale 
 
 hey he said flattening it down so hermione and ron could see it look at this 
 
 got all the robes i want said ron 
 
 no said harry look this little piece here 
 
 ron and hermione bent closer to read it the item was barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column it was headlined 
 
 trespass at ministry 
 
 
 
 sturgis podmore of number two laburnum gardens clapham has appeared in front of the wizcngamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the ministry of magic on st august podmore was arrested by ministry of magic watchwizard eric munch who found him attempting to force his way through a door at one in the morning podmore who refused to speak in his own defence was convicted on both charges and sentenced to six months in azkaban 
 
 
 
 sturgis podmore said ron slowly that bloke who looks like his been thatched he one of the ord 
 
 ron shh said hermione casting a terrified look around them 
 
 six months in azkaban whispered harry shocked just for trying to get through a door 
 
 be silly it just for trying to get through a door what on earth was he doing at the ministry of magic at one in the morning breathed hermione 
 
 reckon he was doing something for the order ron muttered 
 
 wait a moment said harry slowly sturgis was supposed to come and see us off remember 
 
 the other two looked at him 
 
 yeah he was supposed to be part of our guard going to cross remember and moody was all annoyed because he turn up so he have been on a job for them could he 
 
 well maybe they expect him to get caught said hermione 
 
 it could be a ron exclaimed excitedly nolisten he went on dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look on face the ministry suspects one of lot soi dunnothey lured him to the ministry and he trying to get through a door at all maybe just made something up to get him 
 
 there was a pause while harry and hermione considered this harry thought it seemed hermione on the other hand looked rather impressed 
 
 do you know i be at all surprised if that were true 
 
 she folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully as harry laid down his knife and fork she seemed to come out of a reverie 
 
 right well i think we should tackle that essay for sprout on shrubs first and if lucky be able to start inanimatus conjurus spell before lunch 
 
 harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him upstairs but the sky was a clear exhilarating blue and he had not been on his firebolt for a week 
 
 i mean we can do it tonight said ron as he and harry walked down the sloping lawns towards the quidditch pitch their broomsticks over their shoulders and with dire warnings that they would fail all their owls still ringing in their ears and got tomorrow she gets too worked up about work her trouble there was a pause and he added in a slightly more anxious tone think she meant it when she said we copying from her 
 
 yeah i do said harry still this is important too got to practise if we want to stay on the quidditch team 
 
 yeah right said ron in a heartened tone and we have got plenty of time to do it all 
 
 as they approached the quidditch pitch harry glanced over to his right to where the trees of the forbidden forest were swaying darkly nothing flew out of them the sky was empty but for a few distant owls fluttering around the owlery tower he had enough to worry about the flying horse doing him any harm he pushed it out of his mind 
 
 they collected balls from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work ron guarding the three tall goalposts harry playing chaser and trying to get the quaffle past ron harry thought ron was pretty good he blocked of the goals harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practised after a couple of hours they returned to the castle for lunchduring which hermione made it quite clear she thought they were irresponsiblethen returned to the quidditch pitch for the real training session all their teammates but angelina were already in the changing room when they entered 
 
 all right ron said george winking at him 
 
 yeah said ron who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch 
 
 ready to show us all up ickle prefect said fred emerging from the neck of his quidditch robes a slightly malicious grin on his face 
 
 shut up said ron pulling on his own team robes for the first time they fitted him well considering they had been oliver who was rather broader in the shoulder 
 
 ok everyone said angelina entering from the office already changed get to it alicia and fred if you can just bring out the ball crate for us oh and there are a couple of people out there watching but i want you to just ignore them all right 
 
 something in her casual voice made harry think he might know who the uninvited spectators were and sure enough when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it was to a storm of catcalls and jeers from the slytherin quidditch team and assorted who were grouped halfway up the empty stands and whose voices echoed loudly around the stadium 
 
 that riding malfoy called in his sneering drawl why would anyone put a flying charm on a mouldy old log like that 
 
 crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and harry followed him watching his ears turn red from behind 
 
 ignore them he said accelerating to catch up with ron see laughing after we play them 
 
 exactly the attitude i want harry said angelina approvingly soaring around them with the quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team ok everyone going to start with some passes just to warm up the whole team please 
 
 hey johnson with that hairstyle anyway shrieked pansy parkinson from below why would anyone want to look like got worms coming out of their head 
 
 angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and continued calmly spread out then and see what we can do 
 
 harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch ron fell back towards the opposite goal angelina raised the quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to fred who passed to george who passed to harry who passed to ron who dropped it 
 
 the slytherins led by malfoy roared and screamed with laughter ron who had pelted towards the ground to catch the quaffle before it landed pulled out of the dive untidily so that he slipped sideways on his broom and returned to playing height blushing harry saw fred and george exchange looks but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything for which he was grateful 
 
 pass it on ron called angelina as though nothing had happened 
 
 ron threw the quaffle to alicia who passed back to harry who passed to george 
 
 hey potter your scar feeling called malfoy sure you need a lie down it must be what a whole week since you were in the hospital wing a record for you it 
 
 george passed to angelina she to harry who had not been expecting it but caught it in the very tips of his fingers and passed it quickly to ron who lunged for it and missed by inches 
 
 come on now ron said angelina crossly as he dived for the ground again chasing the quaffle pay attention 
 
 it would have been hard to say whether face or the quaffle was a deeper scarlet when he again returned to playing height malfoy and the rest of the slytherin team were howling with laughter 
 
 on his third attempt ron caught the quaffle perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight though outstretched hands and hit her hard in the face 
 
 sorry ron groaned zooming forwards to see whether he had done any damage 
 
 get back in position fine barked angelina but as passing to a teammate do try not to knock her off her broom you got bludgers for that 
 
 nose was bleeding down below the slytherins were stamping their feet and jeering fred and george converged on katie 
 
 here take this fred told her handing her something small anc purple from out of his pocket clear it up in no time 
 
 all right called angelina fred george go and get your bats and a bludger ron get up to the goalposts harry release the snitch when i say so going to aim for goal obviously 
 
 harry zoomed off after the twins to fetch the snitch 
 
 making a right ear of things he muttered george as the three of them landed at the crate containing the balls and opened it to extract one of the bludgers and the snitch 
 
 just nervous said harry he was fine when i was practising with him this morning 
 
 yeah well i hope he peaked too soon said fred gloomily 
 
 they returned to the air when angelina blew her whistle harry released the snitch and fred and george let fly the bludger from that moment on harry was barely aware of what the others were doing it was his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that was worth a hundred and fifty points to the team and doing so required enormous speed and skill he accelerated rolling and swerving in and out of the chasers the warm autumn air whipping his face and the distant yells of the slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ears but too soon the whistle brought him to a halt again 
 
 stopstop stop screamed angelina not covering your middle post 
 
 harry looked round at ron who was hovering in front of the hoop leaving the other two completely unprotected 
 
 oh sorry 
 
 you keep shifting around while watching the chasers said angelina either stay in centre position until you have to move to defend a hoop or else circle the hoops but drift vaguely off to one side how you let in the last three goals 
 
 sorry ron repeated his red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky 
 
 and katie you do something about that nosebleed 
 
 just getting worse said katie thickly attempting to stem the flow with her sleeve 
 
 harry glanced round at fred who was looking anxious and checking his pockets he saw fred pull out something purple examine it for a second and then look round at katie evidently 
 
 well try again said angelina she was ignoring the slytherins who had now set up a chant of gryffindor are losers gryffindor are losers but there was a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless 
 
 this time they had been flying for barely three minutes when angelinas whistle sounded harry who had just sighted the snitch circling the opposite goalpost pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved 
 
 what now he said impatiently to alicia who was nearest 
 
 katie she said shortly 
 
 harry turned and saw angelina fred and george all flying as fast as they could towards katie harry and alicia sped towards her too it was plain that angelina had stopped training just in time katie was now chalk white and covered in blood 
 
 she needs the hospital wing said angelina 
 
 take her said fred sheermight have swallowed a blood blisterpod by mistake 
 
 well no point continuing with no beaters and a chaser gone said angelina glumly as fred and george zoomed off towards the castle supporting katie between them come on go and get changed 
 
 the slytherins continued to chant as they trailed back into the changing rooms 
 
 how was practice asked hermione rather coolly half an hour later as harry and ron climbed through the portrait hole into the gryffindor common room 
 
 it was harry began 
 
 completely lousy said ron in a hollow voice sinking into a chair beside hermione she looked up at ron and her frost mess seemed to melt 
 
 well it was only your first one she said consolingly bound to take time to 
 
 who said it was me who made it lousy snapped ron 
 
 no one said hermione looking taken aback i thought 
 
 you thought i was bound to be rubbish 
 
 no of course i look you said it was lousy so i just 
 
 going to get started on some homework said ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boys dormitories and vanished from sight hermione turned to harry 
 
 was he lousy 
 
 no said harry loyally 
 
 hermione raised her eyebrows 
 
 well i suppose he played better harry muttered but it was only the first training session like you said 
 
 neither harry nor ron seemed to make much headway with their homework that night harry knew ron was too preoccupied with how badly he had performed at quidditch practice and he himself was having difficulty in getting the gryffindor are losers chant out of his head 
 
 they spent the whole of sunday in the common room buried in heir books while the room around them filled up then emptied it was another clear fine day and most of their fellow gryffindors spent the day out in the grounds enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year by the evening harry felt as though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull 
 
 you know we probably should try and get more homework done during the week harry muttered to ron as they finally laid aside professor long essay on the inanimatus conjurus spell and turned miserably to professor equally long and difficult essay about many moons 
 
 yeah said ron rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them listen shall we just ask hermione if we can have a look at what done 
 
 harry glanced over at her she was sitting with crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to ginny as a pair of knitting needles flashed in midair in front of her now knitting a pair of shapeless elf socks 
 
 no he said heavily you know she let us 
 
 and so they worked on while the sky outside the windows became steadily darker slowly the crowd in the common room began to thin again at half past eleven hermione wandered over to them yawning 
 
 nearly done 
 
 no said ron shortly 
 
 biggest moon is ganymede not callisto she said pointing over shoulder at a line in his astronomy essay and io got the volcanoes 
 
 thanks snarled ron scratching out the offending sentences 
 
 sorry i only 
 
 yeah well if just come over here to criticise 
 
 ron 
 
 i got time to listen to a sermon all right hermione up to my neck in it here 
 
 nolook 
 
 hermione was pointing to the nearest window harry and ron both looked over a handsome screech owl was standing on the windowsill gazing into the room at ron 
 
 that hermes said hermione sounding amazed 
 
 blimey it is said ron quietly throwing down his quill and getting to his feet percy writing to me for 
 
 he crossed to the window and opened it hermes flew inside landed on essay and held out a leg to which a letter was attached ron took the letter off it and the owl departed at once leaving inky footprints across drawing of the moon io 
 
 definitely handwriting said ron sinking back into his chair and staring at the words on the outside of the scroll ronald weasley gryffindor house hogwarts he looked up at the other two what reckon 
 
 open it said hermione eagerly and harry nodded 
 
 ron unrolled the scroll and began to read the further clown the parchment his eyes travelled the more pronounced became his scowl when he had finished reading he looked disgusted he thrust the letter at harry and hermione who leaned towards each other to read it together 
 
 dear ron 
 
 i have only just heard from no less a person than the minister for magic himself who has it from your new teacher professor umbridge that you have become a hogwarts prefect 
 
 i was most pleasantly surprised when f heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulations i must admit that i have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the fred and george route rather than following in my footsteps so you can imagine my feelings on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility 
 
 but i want to give you more than congratulations ron i want to give you some advice which is why i am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post hopefully you will be able to read this away from prying eyes and avoid awkward questions 
 
 from something the minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect i gather that you are still seeing a lot of harry potter i must tell you ron that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternisation with that boy yes i am sure you are surprised to hear this no doubt you will say that potter has always been favouritebut i feel bound to tell you that dumbledore may not be in charge at hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very differentand probably more accurateview of behaviour i shall say no more here but if you look at the daily prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowingand see if you can spot yours truly 
 
 seriously ron you do not want to be tarred with the same brush as potter it could be very damaging to your future prospects and i am talking here about life after school too as you must be aware given that our father escorted him to court potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good he got off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the people spoken to remain convinced of his guilt 
 
 it may be that you are afraid to sever ties with potteri know that he can be unbalanced and for all i know violentbut if you have any worries about this or have spotted anything else in behaviour that is troubling you i urge you to speak to dolores umbridge a truly delightful woman who i know will be only too happy to advise you 
 
 this leads me to my other bit of advice as i have hinted above regime at hogwarts may soon be over your loyalty ron should be not to him but to the school and the ministry i am very sorry to hear that so far professor umbridge is encountering very little from staff as she strives to make those necessary changes within hogwarts that the ministry so ardently desires although she should find this easier from next week again see the daily prophet tomorrow i shall say only thisa student who shows himself willing to help professor umbridge now may be very for head boyship in a couple of years 
 
 i am sorry that i was unable to see more of you over the summer it pains me to criticise our parents but i am afraid i can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around dumbledore if you are writing to mother at any point you might tell her that a certain sturgis podmore who is a great friend of has recently been sent to azkaban for trespass at the ministry perhaps that will open their eyes to the kind of petty criminals with whom they are currently rubbing shoulders i count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such peoplethe minister really could not be more gracious to meand i do hope ron that you will not allow family ties to blind you to the misguided nature of our parents beliefs and actions either i sincerely hope that in time they will realise how mistaken they were and i shall of course be ready to accept a full apology when that day comes 
 
 please think over what i have said most carefully particularly the bit about harry potter and congratulations again on becoming prefect 
 
 your brother 
 
 percy 
 
 harry looked up at ron 
 
 well he said trying to sound as though he found the whole thing a joke if you want toer what is checked ties with me i swear i get violent 
 
 give it back said ron holding out his hand he is ron said jerkily tearing letter in half the he tore it into quarters biggest he tore it into eighths git he threw the pieces into the fire 
 
 come on got to get this finished sometime before dawn he said briskly to harry pulling professor essay back towards him 
 
 hermione was looking at ron with an odd expression on her face 
 
 oh give them here she said abruptly 
 
 what said ron 
 
 give them to me look through them and correct them she said 
 
 are you serious ah hermione a said ron what can i 
 
 what you can say is we promise never leave our homework this late again she said holding out both hands for their essays but she looked slightly amused all the same 
 
 thanks a million hermione said harry weakly passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair rubbing his eyes 
 
 it was now past midnight and the common room was deserted but for the three of them and crookshanks the only sound was that of quill scratching out sentences here and there on their essays and the ruffle of pages as she checked various facts in the reference books strewn across the table harry was exhausted he also felt an odd sick empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire 
 
 he knew that half the people inside hogwarts thought him strange even mad he knew that the daily prophet had been making snide allusions to him for months but there was something about seeing it written down like that in writing about knowing that percy was advising ron to drop him and even to tell tales about him to umbridge that made his situation real to him as nothing else had he had known percy for four years had stayed in his house during the summer holidays shared a tent with him during the quidditch world cup had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the triwizard tournament last year yet now percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent 
 
 and with a surge of sympathy for his godfather harry thought sirius was probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment because sirius was in the same situation nearly everyone in the wizarding world thought sirius a dangerous murderer and a great voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen years 
 
 harry blinked he had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there it had flashed into sight and vanished immediately no it could not have been he had imagined it because he had been thinking about sirius 
 
 ok write that down hermione said to ron pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to ron then add this conclusion written for you 
 
 hermione you are honestly the most wonderful person ever met said ron weakly and if ever rude to you again 
 
 know back to normal said hermione harry yours is ok except for this bit at the end i think you must have misheard professor sinistra covered in ice not miceharry 
 
 harry had slid off his chair on to his knees and was now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug gazing into the flames 
 
 erharry said ron uncertainly why are you down there 
 
 because just seen head in the fire said harry 
 
 he spoke quite calmly after all he had seen head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it too nevertheless he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time it had vanished so quickly 
 
 head hermione repeated you mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the triwizard tournament but he do that now it would be toosirius 
 
 she gasped gazing at the fire ron dropped his quill there in the middle of the dancing flames sat head long dark hair failing around his grinning face 
 
 i was starting to think go to bed before everyone else had disappeared he said been checking every hour 
 
 been popping into the fire every hour harry said 
 
 just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear 
 
 but what if been seen said hermione anxiously 
 
 well i think a by the look of get a glimpse of me earlier but worry sirius said hastily as hermione clapped a hand to her mouth i was gone the moment she looked back at me and bet she just thought i was an log or something 
 
 but sirius this is taking an awful risk hermione began 
 
 you sound like molly said sirius this was the only way i could come up with of answering letter without resorting to a codeand codes are breakable 
 
 at the mention of letter hermione and ron both turned to stare at him 
 
 you say written to sirius said hermione accusingly 
 
 i forgot said harry which was perfectly true his meeting with cho in the owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind look at me like that hermione there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it was there sirius 
 
 no it was very good said sirius smiling anyway better be quick just in case disturbedyour scar 
 
 what about ron began but hermione interrupted him 
 
 tell you afterwards go on sirius 
 
 well i know it be fun when it hurts but we think its anything to really worry about it kept aching all last year it 
 
 yeah and dumbledore said it happened whenever voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion said harry ignoring as usual ron and winces so maybe he was just i dunno really angry or something the night i had that detention 
 
 well now back bound to hurt more often said sirius 
 
 so you think it had anything to do with umbridge touching me when i was in detention with her harry asked 
 
 i doubt it said sirius i know her by reputation and sure no death eater 
 
 foul enough to be one said harry darkly and ron and hermione nodded vigorously in agreement 
 
 yes but the world split into good people and death eaters said sirius with a wry smile i know a nasty piece of work thoughyou should hear remus talk about her 
 
 does lupin know her asked harry quickly remembering comments about dangerous during her first lesson 
 
 no said sirius but she drafted a bit of legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job 
 
 harry remembered how much shabbier lupin looked these days and his dislike of umbridge deepened even further 
 
 she got against werewolves said hermione angrily 
 
 scared of them i expect said sirius smiling at her indignation apparently she loathes she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year too imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like kreacher on the loose 
 
 ron laughed but hermione looked upset 
 
 sirius she said reproachfully honestly if you made a bit of an effort with kreacher sure respond after all you are the only member of his family got left and professor dumbledore said 
 
 so what are lessons like sirius interrupted is she training you all to kill 
 
 no said harry ignoring affronted look at being cut off in her defence of kreacher not letting us use magic at all 
 
 all we do is read the stupid textbook said ron 
 
 ah well that figures said sirius our information from inside the ministry is that fudge want you trained in combat 
 
 trained in combat repeated harry incredulously what does he think doing here forming some sort of wizard army 
 
 exactly what he thinks doing said sirius or rather exactly what afraid doingforming his own private army with which he will be able to take on the ministry of magic 
 
 there was a pause at this then ron said the most stupid thing ever heard including all the stuff that luna lovegood comes out with 
 
 so being prevented from learning defence against the dark arts because fudge is scared use spells against the ministry said hermione looking furious 
 
 yep said sirius fudge thinks dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power getting more paranoid about dumbledore by the day a matter of time before he has dumbledore arrested on some charge 
 
 this reminded harry of letter 
 
 know if going to be anything about dumbledore in the daily prophet tomorrow brother percy reckons there will be 
 
 i know said sirius i seen anyone from the order all weekend all busy just been kreacher and me here 
 
 there was a definite note of bitterness in voice 
 
 so you had any news about hagrid either 
 
 ah said sirius well he was supposed to be back by now no sure happened to him then seeing their stricken faces he added quickly but not worried so you three get yourselves in a state sure fine 
 
 but if he was supposed to be back by now said hermione in a small anxious voice 
 
 madame maxime was with him been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey homebut nothing to suggest hurt orwell nothing to suggest not perfectly ok 
 
 unconvinced harry ron and hermione exchanged worried looks 
 
 listen go asking too many questions about hagrid said sirius hastily just draw even more attention to the fact that not back and i know dumbledore want that tough be ok and when they did not appear cheered by this sirius added your next hogsmeade weekend anyway i was thinking we got away with the dog disguise at the station we i thought i could 
 
 no said harry and hermione together very loudly 
 
 sirius you see the daily prophet said hermione anxiously 
 
 oh that said sirius grinning always guessing where i am they really got a clue 
 
 yeah but we think this time they have said harry something malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you and his father was on the platform sirius you know lucius malfoyso come up here whatever you do if malfoy recognises you again 
 
 all right all right got the point said sirius he looked most displeased just an idea thought you might like to get together 
 
 i would i just want you chucked back in azkaban said harry 
 
 there was a pause in which sirius looked out of the fire at harry a crease between his sunken eyes 
 
 less like your father than i thought he said finally a definite coolness in his voice the risk been what made it fun for james 
 
 look 
 
 well better get going i can hear kreacher coming down the stairs said sirius but harry was sure he was lying write to tell you a time i can make it back into the fire then shall i if you can stand to risk it 
 
 there was a tiny pop and the place where head had been was flickering flame once more 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter fourteen felix feliciscontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry had herbology first thing the following morning he had been unable to tell ron and hermione about his lesson with dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses the brutal wind had died out at last the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse 
 
 wow scary thought the boy said ron quietly as they took their places around one of the gnarled snargaluff stumps that formed this project and began pulling on their protective gloves but i still get why showing you all this i mean really interesting and everything but the point 
 
 dunno said harry inserting a gum shield but he says its all important and help me survive 
 
 i think fascinating said hermione earnestly it makes absolute sense to know as much about voldemort as possible how else will you find out his weaknesses 
 
 so how was latest party harry asked her thickly through the gum shield 
 
 oh it was quite fun really said hermione now putting on protective goggles i mean he drones on about famous exploits a bit and he absolutely fawns on mclaggen because so well connected but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to gwenog jones 
 
 gwenog jones said ron his eyes widening under his own goggles the gwenog jones captain of the holyhead harpies 
 
 right said hermione personally i thought she was a bit full of herself but 
 
 quite enough chat over here said professor sprout briskly bustling over and looking stern lagging behind everybody else has started and already got his first pod 
 
 they looked around sure enough there sat neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit 
 
 okay professor starting now said ron adding quietly when she had turned away again used muffliato harry 
 
 no we said hermione at once looking as she always did intensely cross at the thought of the prince and his spells well come on better get going 
 
 she gave the other two an apprehensive look they all took deep breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them 
 
 it sprang to life at once long prickly vines flew out of the top and whipped through the air one tangled itself in hair and ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them together a hole opened in the middle of all the branches hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole which closed like a trap around her elbow harry and ron tugged and wrenched at the vines forcing the hole to open again and hermione snatched her arm free clutching in her fingers a pod just like at once the prickly vines shot back inside and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood 
 
 you know i think be having any of these in my garden when got my own place said ron pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face 
 
 pass me a bowl said hermione holding the pulsating pod at length harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face 
 
 be squeamish squeeze it out best when fresh called professor sprout 
 
 anyway said hermione continuing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them going to have a christmas party harry and no way be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come 
 
 harry groaned meanwhile ron who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it standing up and squashing it as hard as he could said angrily and this is another party just for favorites is it 
 
 just for the slug club yes said hermione 
 
 the pod flew out from under fingers and hit the green house glass rebounding onto the back of professor head and knocking off her old patched hat harry went to retrieve the pod when he got back hermione was saying look i make up the name slug club 
 
 slug club repeated ron with a sneer worthy of malfoy pathetic well i hope you enjoy your party why you try hooking up with mclaggen then slughorn can make you king and queen slug 
 
 allowed to bring guests said hermione who for some reason had turned a bright boiling scarlet and i was going to ask you to come but if you think that stupid then i bother 
 
 harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them unnoticed by either he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he could think of unfortunately he could still hear every word of their conversation 
 
 you were going to ask me asked ron in a completely different voice 
 
 yes said hermione angrily but obviously if rather i hooked up with mclaggen 
 
 there was a pause while harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel 
 
 no i said ron in a very quiet voice 
 
 harry missed the pod hit the bowl and shattered it 
 
 reparo he said hastily poking the pieces with his wand and the bowl sprang back together again the crash however appeared to have awoken ron and hermione to presence hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of trees of the world to find out the correct way to juice snargaluff pods ron on the other hand looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself 
 
 hand that over harry said hermione hurriedly it says supposed to puncture them with something sharp 
 
 harry passed her the pod in the bowl he and ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived once more for the stump 
 
 it was not as though he was really surprised thought harry as he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later but he was not sure how he felt about it he and cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other let alone talk to each other what if ron and hermione started going out together then split up could their friendship survive it harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them and then what if they split up what if they became like bill and fleur and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence so that he was shut out for good 
 
 gotcha yelled ron pulling a second pod from the stump just as hermione managed to burst the first one open so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms 
 
 the rest of the lesson passed without further mention of party although harry watched his two friends more closely over the next few days ron and hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer in dimly lit room on the night of the party in the meantime however he had more pressing worries 
 
 katie bell was still in st hospital with no prospect of leaving which meant that the promising gryffindor team harry had been training so carefully since september was one chaser short he kept putting off replacing katie in the hope that she would return but their opening match against slytherin was looming and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play 
 
 harry did not think he could stand another tryout with a sinking feeling that had little to do with quidditch he cornered dean thomas after transfiguration one day most of the class had already left although several twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room all of creation nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air 
 
 are you still interested in playing chaser 
 
 why yeah of course said dean excitedly over shoulder harry saw seamus finnegan slamming his books into his bag looking sour one of the reasons why harry would have preferred not to have to ask dean to play was that he knew seamus would not like it on the other hand he had to do what was best for the team and dean had outflown seamus at the tryouts 
 
 well then in said harry a practice tonight seven 
 
 right said dean cheers harry blimey i wait to tell ginny 
 
 he sprinted out of the room leaving harry and seamus alone together an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on head as one of canaries whizzed over them 
 
 seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of substitute there was much muttering in the common room about the fact that harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team as harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career he was not particularly bothered but all the same the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against slytherin if gryffindor won harry knew that the whole house would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team if they lost well harry thought wryly he had still endured worse mutterings 
 
 harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw dean fly that evening he worked well with ginny and demelza the beaters peakes and coote were getting better all the time the only problem was ron 
 
 harry had known all along that ron was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence and unfortunately the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities after letting in half a dozen goals most of them scored by ginny his technique became wilder and wilder until he finally punched an oncoming demelza robins in the mouth 
 
 it was an accident sorry demelza really sorry ron shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground dripping blood everywhere i just 
 
 panicked ginny said angrily landing next to demelza and examining her fat lip you prat ron look at the state of her 
 
 i can fix that said harry landing beside the two girls pointing his wand at demelzas mouth and saying episkey and ginny call ron a prat not the captain of this team 
 
 well you seemed too busy to call him a prat and i thought someone should 
 
 harry forced himself not to laugh 
 
 in the air everyone go 
 
 overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term though harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this close to the match 
 
 good work everyone i think flatten slytherin he said bracingly and the chasers and beaters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves 
 
 i played like a sack of dragon dung said ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind ginny 
 
 no you said harry firmly the best keeper i tried out ron your only problem is nerves 
 
 he kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle and by the time they reached the second floor ron was looking marginally more cheerful when harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to gryffindor tower however they found themselves looking at dean and ginny who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together 
 
 it was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in stomach clawing at his insides hot blood seemed to flood his brain so that all thought was extinguished replaced by a savage urge to jinx dean into a jelly wrestling with this sudden madness he heard voice as though from a great distance away 
 
 oi 
 
 dean and ginny broke apart and looked around 
 
 what said ginny 
 
 i want to find my own sister snogging people in public 
 
 this was a deserted corridor till you came butting in said ginny 
 
 dean was looking embarrassed he gave harry a shifty grin that harry did not return as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for instant dismissal from the team 
 
 er ginny said dean go back to the common room 
 
 you go said ginny i want a word with my dear brother 
 
 dean left looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene 
 
 right said ginny tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at ron get this straight once and for all it is none of your business who i go out with or what i do with them ron 
 
 yeah it is said ron just as angrily d you think i want people saying my a 
 
 a what shouted ginny drawing her wand a what exactly 
 
 he mean anything ginny said harry automatically though the monster was roaring its approval of words 
 
 oh yes he does she said flaring up at harry just because never snogged anyone in his life just because the best kiss ever had is from our auntie muriel 
 
 shut your mouth bellowed ron bypassing red and turning maroon 
 
 no i will not yelled ginny beside herself seen you with phlegm hoping kiss you on the cheek every time you see her pathetic if you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself you mind so much that everyone else does it 
 
 ron had pulled out his wand too harry stepped swiftly between them 
 
 you know what talking about ron roared trying to get a clear shot at ginny around harry who was now standing in front of her with his arms outstretched just because i do it in public 
 
 ginny screamed with derisive laughter trying to push harry out of the way 
 
 been kissing pigwidgeon have you or have you got a picture of auntie muriel stashed under your pillow you 
 
 a streak of orange light flew under left arm and missed ginny by inches harry pushed ron up against the wall 
 
 be stupid 
 
 snogged cho chang shouted ginny who sounded close to tears now and hermione snogged viktor krum only you who acts like something disgusting ron and because got about as much experience as a 
 
 and with that she stormed away harry quickly let go of ron the look on his face was murderous they both stood there breathing heavily until mrs norris cat appeared around the corner which broke the tension 
 
 said harry as the sound of shuffling feet reached their ears 
 
 they hurried up the stairs and along a corridor oi out of the way ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of 
 
 harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass he felt disoriented dizzy being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this just because sister he told himself you just like seeing her kissing dean because sister 
 
 but unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing ginny instead the monster in his chest purred but then he saw ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on harry shouting things like betrayal of trust supposed to be my friend 
 
 think hermione did snog krum ron asked abruptly as they approached the fat lady harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no ron intruded in which he and ginny were quite alone 
 
 what he said confusedly oh er 
 
 the honest answer was yes but he did not want to give it however ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on face 
 
 dilligrout he said darkly to the fat lady and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room 
 
 neither of them mentioned ginny or hermione again indeed they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence each absorbed in his own thoughts 
 
 harry lay awake for a long time looking up at the canopy of his and trying to convince himself that his feelings for ginny were entirely they had lived had they not like brother and sister all summer playing quidditch teasing ron and having a laugh about bill and phlegm he had known ginny for years now it was natural that he should feel protective natural that he should want to look out for her want to rip dean limb from limb for kissing her no he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling 
 
 ron gave a great grunting snore 
 
 sister harry told himself firmly sister he would not risk his friendship with ron for anything he punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near ginny 
 
 harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which ron had chased him with a bat but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream ron for the real one who was not only ginny and dean but also treating a hurt and bewildered hermione with an icy sneering indifference what was more ron seemed to have become overnight as touchy and ready to lash out as the average skrewt harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between ron and hermione with no success finally hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon and ron stalked off to the boys dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened for looking at him 
 
 to dismay new aggression did not wear off over the next few days worse still it coincided with an even deeper dip in his keeping skills which made him still more aggressive so that during the final quidditch practice before match he failed to save every single goal the chasers aimed at him but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced demelza robins to tears 
 
 you shut up and leave her alone shouted peakes who was about height though admittedly carrying a heavy bat 
 
 enough bellowed harry who had seen ginny glowering in direction and remembering her reputation as an accomplished caster of the hex soared over to intervene before things got out of hand peakes go and pack up the bludgers demelza pull yourself together you played really well today ron he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it my best mate but carry on treating the rest of them like this and going to kick you off the team 
 
 he really thought for a moment that ron might hit him but then something much worse happened ron seemed to sag on his broom all the fight went out of him and he said i resign pathetic 
 
 not pathetic and not resigning said harry fiercely seizing ron by the front of his robes you can save anything when on form a mental problem got 
 
 you calling me mental 
 
 yeah maybe i am 
 
 they glared at each other for a moment then ron shook his head wearily 
 
 i know you got any time to find another keeper so play tomorrow but if we lose and we will taking myself off the team 
 
 nothing harry said made any difference he tried boosting confidence all through dinner but ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with hermione to notice harry persisted in the common room that evening but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if ron left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner clearly muttering about ron and casting him nasty looks finally harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking ron into a defiant and hopefully attitude but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever 
 
 harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness he did not want to lose the upcoming match not only was it his first as captain but he was determined to beat draco malfoy at quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him yet if ron played as he had done in the last few practices their chances of winning were very slim 
 
 if only there was something he could do to make ron pull himself together make him play at the top of his form something that would ensure that ron had a really good day 
 
 and the answer came to harry in one sudden glorious stroke of inspiration 
 
 breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning the slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the gryffindor team entered the great hall harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear pale blue sky a good omen 
 
 the gryffindor table a solid mass of red and gold cheered as harry and ron approached harry grinned and waved ron grimaced weakly and shook his head 
 
 cheer up ron called lavender i know be brilliant 
 
 ron ignored her 
 
 tea harry asked him coffee pumpkin juice 
 
 anything said ron glumly taking a moody bite of toast 
 
 a few minutes later hermione who had become so tired of recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them paused on her way up the table 
 
 how are you both feeling she asked tentatively her eyes on the back of head 
 
 fine said harry who was concentrating on handing ron a glass of pumpkin juice there you go ron drink up 
 
 ron had just raised the glass to his lips when hermione spoke sharply 
 
 drink that ron 
 
 both harry and ron looked up at her 
 
 why not said ron 
 
 hermione was now staring at harry as though she could not believe her eyes 
 
 you just put something in that drink 
 
 excuse me said harry 
 
 you heard me i saw you you just tipped something into drink got the bottle in your hand right now 
 
 i dont know what talking about said harry stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket 
 
 ron i warn you drink it hermione said again alarmed but ron picked up the glass drained it in one gulp and said stop bossing me around hermione 
 
 she looked scandalized bending low so that only harry could hear her she hissed you should be expelled for that never have believed it of you harry 
 
 look talking he whispered back confunded anyone lately 
 
 she stormed up the table away from them harry watched her go without regret hermione had never really understood what a serious business quidditch was he then looked around at ron who was smacking his lips 
 
 nearly time said harry blithely 
 
 the frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the stadium 
 
 pretty lucky the weathers this good eh harry asked ron 
 
 yeah said ron who was pale and 
 
 ginny and demelza were already wearing their quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room 
 
 conditions look ideal said ginny ignoring ron and guess what that slytherin chaser vaisey he took a bludger in the head yesterday during their practice and too sore to play and even better than gone off sick too 
 
 what said harry wheeling around to stare at her ill wrong with him 
 
 no idea but great for us said ginny brightly playing harper instead in my year and an idiot 
 
 harry smiled back vaguely but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from quidditch malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the slytherins better why was he now happy to let a substitute go on was he really ill or was he faking 
 
 fishy it he said in an undertone to ron malfoy not playing 
 
 lucky i call it said ron looking slightly more animated and vaisey off too their best goal scorer i fancyhey he said suddenly freezing halfway through pulling on his keepers gloves and staring at harry 
 
 what 
 
 i you ron had dropped his voice he looked both scared and excited my drink my pumpkin juice you 
 
 harry raised his eyebrows but said nothing except be starting in about five minutes better get your boots on 
 
 they walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos one end of the stadium was solid red and gold the other a sea of green and silver many hufflepuffs and ravenclaws had taken sides too amidst all the yelling and clapping harry could distinctly hear the roar of luna famous hat 
 
 harry stepped up to madam hooch the referee who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate 
 
 captains shake hands she said and harry had his hand crushed by the new slytherin captain urquhart mount your brooms on the whistle three two one 
 
 the whistle sounded harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground and they were away 
 
 harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds looking around for the snitch and keeping one eye on harper who was zigzagging far below him then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual started up 
 
 well there they go and i think all surprised to see the team that put together this year many thought given ronald patchy performance as keeper last year that he might be off the team but of course a close personal friendship with the captain does help 
 
 these words were greeted with jeers and applause from the slytherin end of the pitch harry craned around on his broom to look toward the podium a call skinny blond buy with an upturned nose was standing there talking into the magical megaphone that had once been lee harry recognized zacharias smith a hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked 
 
 oh and here comes first attempt on goal urquhart streaking down the pitch and 
 
 stomach turned over 
 
 weasley saves it well bound to get lucky sometimes i suppose 
 
 right smith he is muttered harry grinning to himself as he dived amongst the chasers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive snitch 
 
 with half an hour of the game gone gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero ron having made some truly spectacular saves some by the very tips of his gloves and ginny having scored four of six goals this effectively stopped zacharias wondering loudly whether the two weasleys were only there because harry liked them and he started on peakes and coote instead 
 
 of course coote really the usual build for a beater said zacharias loftily generally got a bit more muscle 
 
 hit a bludger at him harry called to coote as he zoomed past but coote grinning broadly chose to aim the next bludger at harper instead who was just passing harry in the opposite direction harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the bludger had found its mark 
 
 it seemed as though gryffindor could do no wrong again and again they scored and again and again at the other end of the pitch ron saved goals with apparent ease he was actually smiling now and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a rousing chorus of the old favorite weasley is our king he pretended to conduct them from on high 
 
 thinks something special today he said a snide voice and harry was nearly knocked off his broom as harper collided with him hard and deliberately your pal 
 
 madam back was turned and though gryffindors below shouted in anger by the time she looked around harper had already sped off his shoulder aching harry raced after him determined to ram him back 
 
 and i think harper of seen the snitch said zacharias smith through his megaphone yes certainly seen something potter 
 
 smith really was an idiot thought harry he noticed them collide but next moment his stomach seemed to drop out of the skysmith was right and harry was wrong harper had not sped upward at random he had spotted what harry had not the snitch was speeding along high above them glinting brightly against the clear blue sky 
 
 harry accelerated the wind was whistling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of commentary or the crowd but harper was still ahead of him and gryffindor was only a hundred points up if harper got there first gryffindor had lost and now harper was feet from it his hand outstretched 
 
 oi harper yelled harry in desperation how much did malfoy pay you to come on instead of him 
 
 he did not know what made him say it but harper did a he fumbled the snitch let it slip through his fingers and shot right past it harry made a great swipe for the tiny fluttering ball and caught it 
 
 yes hairy yelled wheeling around he hurtled back toward the ground the snitch held high in his hand as the crowd realized what had happened a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game 
 
 ginny you going yelled harry who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team but ginny sped right on past them until with an almighty crash she collided with the podium as the crowd shrieked and laughed the gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which zacharias was feebly stirring harry heard ginny saying blithely to an irate professor mcgonagall forgot to brake professor sorry 
 
 laughing harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged ginny but let go very quickly avoiding her gaze he clapped cheering ron on the back instead as all enmity forgotten the gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm punching the air and waving to their supporters 
 
 the atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant party up in the common room seamus said yelled dean exuberantly ginny demelza 
 
 ron and harry were the last two in the changing room they were just about to leave when hermione entered she was twisting her gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined 
 
 i want a word with you harry she took a deep breath you have done it you heard slughorn illegal 
 
 what are you going to do turn us in demanded ron 
 
 what are you two talking about asked harry turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning 
 
 you know perfectly well what talking about said hermione shrilly you spiked juice with lucky potion at breakfast felix felicis 
 
 no i said harry turning back to face them both 
 
 yes you did harry and why everything went right there were slytherin players missing and ron saved everything 
 
 i put it in said harry grinning broadly he slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that hermione had seen in his hand that morning it was full of golden potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax i wanted ron to think done it so i faked it when i knew you were looking he looked at ron you saved everything because you felt lucky you did it all yourself 
 
 he pocketed the potion again 
 
 there really anything in my pumpkin juice ron said astounded but the good and vaisey play i honestly been given lucky potion 
 
 harry shook his head ron gaped at him for a moment then rounded on hermione imitating her voice 
 
 you added felix felicis to juice this morning why he saved everything see i can save goals without help hermione 
 
 i never said you ron you thought been given it too 
 
 but ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder 
 
 er said harry into the sudden silence he had not expected his plan to backfire like this shall shall we go up to the party then 
 
 you go said hermione blinking back tears sick of ron at the moment i know what supposed to have done 
 
 and she stormed out of the changing room too 
 
 harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle through the crowd many of whom shouted congratulations at him but he felt a great sense of he had been sure that if ron won the match he and hermione would be friends again immediately he did not see how he could possibly explain to hermione that what she had done to offend ron was kiss viktor krum not when the offense had occurred so long ago 
 
 harry could not see hermione at the gryffindor celebration party which was in full swing when he arrived renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearance and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him what with trying to shake off the creevey brothers who wanted a match analysis and the large group of girls that encircled him laughing at his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids it was some time before he could try and find ron at last he extricated himself from romilda vane who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to christmas party with him as he was ducking toward the drinks table he walked straight into ginny arnold the pygmy puff riding on her shoulder and crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels 
 
 looking for ron she asked smirking over there the filthy hypocrite 
 
 harry looked into the corner she was indicating there in full view of the whole room stood ron wrapped so closely around lavender brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose 
 
 it looks like eating her face it said ginny dispassionately but i suppose got to refine his technique somehow good game harry 
 
 she patted him on the arm harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer crookshanks trotted after her his yellow eyes fixed upon arnold 
 
 harry turned away from ron who did not look like he would be surfacing soon just as the portrait hole was closing with a sinking feeling he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight 
 
 he darted forward sidestepped romilda vane again and pushed open the portrait of the fat lady the corridor outside seemed to be deserted 
 
 hermione 
 
 he found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried she was sitting on the desk alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head which she had clearly just conjured out of midair harry could not help admiring her at a time like this 
 
 oh hello harry she said in a brittle voice i was just practicing 
 
 yeah really good said harry 
 
 he had no idea what to say to her he was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed ron that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy when she said in an unnaturally voice ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations 
 
 er does he said harry 
 
 pretend you see him said hermione he exactly hiding it was 
 
 the door behind them burst open to horror ron came in laughing pulling lavender by the hand 
 
 oh he said drawing up short at the sight of harry and hermione 
 
 oops said lavender and she backed out of the room giggling the door swung shut behind her 
 
 there was a horrible swelling billowing silence hermione was staring at ron who refused to look at her but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness hi harry wondered where got to 
 
 hermione slid off the desk the little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange feathery model of the solar system 
 
 you leave lavender waiting outside she said quietly wonder where gone 
 
 she walked very slowly and erectly toward the door harry glanced at ron who was looking relieved that nothing worse had happened 
 
 oppugno came a shriek from the doorway 
 
 harry spun around to see hermione pointing her wand at ron her expression wild the little flock of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward ron who yelped and covered his face with his hands but the birds attacked pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach 
 
 gerremoffme he yelled but with one last look of vindictive fury hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter fourteen the thiefcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green he had no idea what had happened he only knew that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt flattened he blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him then an object twitched close to his face he pushed himself onto his hands and knees ready to face some small fierce creature but saw that the object was rons foot looking around harry saw that they and hermione were lying on a forest floor apparently alone 
 
 harrys first thought was of the forbidden forest and for a moment even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of hogwarts his heart leapt at the thought of sneaking through the trees to hagrids hut however in the few moments it took for ron to give a low groan and harry to start crawling toward him he realized that this was not the forbidden forest the trees looked younger they were more widely spaced the ground clearer 
 
 he met hermione also on her hands and knees at rons head the moment his eyes fell upon ron all other concerns fled harrys mind for blood drenched the whole of rons left side and his face stood out against the earth the polyjuice potion was wearing off now ron was halfway between cattermole and himself in appearance his hair turning redder and redder as his face drained of the little color it had left 
 
 whats happened to him 
 
 splinched said hermione her fingers already busy at rons sleeve where the blood was wettest and darkest 
 
 harry watched horrified as she tore open rons short he had always thought of splinching as something comical but this his insides crawled unpleasantly as hermione laid bare rons upper arm where a great chunk of flesh was missing scooped cleanly away as though by a knife 
 
 harry quickly in my bag theres a small bottle labeled essence of dittanyc 
 
 bag c right c 
 
 harry sped to the place where hermione had landed seized the tiny beaded bag and thrust his hand inside it at once object after object began presenting itself to his touch he felt the leather spines of books woolly sleeves of jumpers heels of shoes c 
 
 quickly 
 
 he grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag 
 
 accio dittany 
 
 a small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag he caught it and hastened back to hermione and ron whose eyes were now strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids 
 
 hes fainted said hermione who was also rather pale she no longer looked like mafalda though her hair was still gray in places unstopper it for me harry my hands are shaking 
 
 harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle hermione took it and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared harry saw that the bleeding had stopped the wound now looked several days old new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh 
 
 wow said harry 
 
 its all i feel safe doing said hermione shakily there are spells that would put him completely right but i darent try in case i do them wrong and cause more damage hes lost so much blood already 
 
 how did he get hurt i mean c harry shook his head trying to clear it to make sense of whatever had just taken place c why are we here i thought we were going back to grimmauld place 
 
 hermione took a deep breath she looked close to tears 
 
 harry i dont think were going to be able to go back there 
 
 what dyou c 
 
 as we disapparated yaxley caught hold of me and i couldnt get rid of him he was too strong and he was still holding on when we arrived at grimmauld place and then c well i think he must have seen the door and thought we were stopping there so he slackened his grip and i managed to sake him off and i brought us here instead 
 
 but then wheres he hang on you dont mean hes at grimmauld place he cant get in there 
 
 her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded 
 
 harry i think he can i c i forced him to let go with a revulsion jinx but id already taken him inside the fidelius charms protection since dumbledore died were so ive given him the secret havent i 
 
 there was no pretending harry was sure she was right it was a serious blow if yaxley could now get inside the house there was no way that they could return even now he could be bringing other death eaters in there by apparition gloomy and oppressive though the house was it had been their one safe refuge even now that kreacher was so much happier and friendlier a kind of home with a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food harry imagined the busying himself over the pie that harry ron and hermione would never eat 
 
 harry im sorry im so sorry 
 
 dont be stupid it wasnt your fault if anything it was mine 
 
 harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out eye hermione recoiled looking horrified 
 
 umbridge had stuck it to her office door to spy on people i couldnt leave it there but thats how they knew there were intruders 
 
 before hermione could answer ron groaned and opened his eyes he was still gray and his face glistened with sweat 
 
 how dyou feel hermione whispered 
 
 lousy croaked ron wincing as he felt his injured arm where are we 
 
 in the woods where they held the quidditch world cup said hermione i wanted somewhere enclosed undercover and this was c 
 
 c the first place you thought of harry finished for her glancing around at the apparently deserted glade he could not help remembering what had happened the last time they had apparated to the first place hermione had thought of c how death eaters had found them within minutes had it been legilimency did voldemort or his henchmen know even now where hermione had taken them 
 
 dyou reckon we should move on ron asked harry and harry could tell by the look on rons face that he was thinking the same 
 
 i dunno 
 
 ron still looked pale and clammy he had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so the prospect of moving him was daunting 
 
 lets stay here for now harry said 
 
 looking relieved hermione sprang to her feet 
 
 where are you going asked ron 
 
 if were staying we should put some protective enchantments around the place she replied and raising her wand she began to walk in a wide circle around harry and ron murmuring incantations as she went harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air it was as if hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing 
 
 salvio hexia protego totalum repello muggletum muffliato you could get out the tent harry 
 
 tent 
 
 in the bag 
 
 in the of course said harry 
 
 he did not bother to grope inside it this time but used another summoning charm the tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas ropes and poles harry recognized it partly because of the smell of cats as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the quidditch world cup 
 
 i thought this belonged to that bloke perkins at the ministry he asked starting to disentangle the pent pegs 
 
 apparently he didnt want it back his lumbagos so bad said hermione now performing complicated movements with her wand so rons dad said i could borrow it erecto she added pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas which in one fluid motion rose into the air and settled fully constructed onto the ground before harry out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope 
 
 cave inimicum hermione finished with a skyward flourish thats as much as i can do at the very least we should know theyre coming i cant guarantee it will keep out vol c 
 
 dont say the name ron cut across her his voice harsh 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other 
 
 im sorry ron said moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them but it feels like a c a jinx or something cant we call him c please 
 
 dumbledore said fear of a name c began harry 
 
 in case you hadnt noticed mate calling by his name didnt do dumbledore much good in the end ron snapped back just c just show some respect will you 
 
 respect harry repeated but hermione shot him a warning look apparently he was not to argue with ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition 
 
 harry and hermione half carried half dragged ron through the entrance of the tent the interior was exactly as harry remembered it a small flat complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen he shoved aside an old armchair and lowered ron carefully onto the lower berth of a bunk bed even this very short journey had turned ron whiter still and once they had settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while 
 
 ill make some tea said hermione breathlessly pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen 
 
 harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that had died it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest after a minute or two ron broke the silence 
 
 what dyou reckon happened to the cattermoles 
 
 with any luck theyll have got away said hermione clutching her hot mug for comfort as long as mr cattermole had his wits about him hell have transported mrs cattermole by and theyll be fleeing the country right now with their children thats what harry told her to do 
 
 blimey i hope they escaped said ron leaning back on his pillows the tea seemed to be doing him good a little of his color had returned i didnt get the feeling reg cattermole was all that though the way everyone was talking to me when i was him god i hope they made it if they both end up in azkaban because of us 
 
 harry looked over at hermione and the question he had been about to ask c about whether mrs cattermoles lack of a wand would prevent her apparating alongside her husband c died in his throat hermione was watching ron fret over the fate of the cattermoles and there was such tenderness in her expression that harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing him 
 
 so have you got it harry asked her partly to remind her that he was there 
 
 got c got what she said with a little start 
 
 what did we just go through all that for the locket wheres the locket 
 
 you got it shouted ron raising himself a little higher on his pillows no one tells me anything blimey you could have mentioned it 
 
 well we were running for our lives from the death eaters werent we said hermione here 
 
 and she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to ron 
 
 it was as large as a chickens egg an ornate letter s inlaid with many small green stones glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tents canvas roof 
 
 there isnt any chance someones destroyed it since kreacher had it asked ron hopefully i mean are we sure its still a horcrux 
 
 i think so said hermione taking it back from him and looking at it closely thered be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed 
 
 she passed it to harry who turned it over in his fingers the thing looked perfect pristine he remembered the mangled remains of the diary and how the stone in the horcrux ring had been cracked open when dumbledore destroyed it 
 
 i reckon kreachers right said harry were going to have to work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it 
 
 sudden awareness of what he was holding of what lived behind the little golden doors hit harry as he spoke even after all their efforts to find it he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him mastering himself again he tried to pry the locket apart with his fingers then attempted the charm hermione had used to open reguluss bedroom door neither worked he handed the locket back to ron and hermione each of whom did their best but were no more successful at opening it than he had been 
 
 can you feel it though ron asked in a hushed voice as he held it tight in his clenched fist 
 
 what dyou mean 
 
 ron passed the horcrux to harry after a moment or two harry thought he knew what ron meant was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could feel or was it something beating inside the locket like a tiny metal heart 
 
 what are we going to do with it hermione asked 
 
 keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it harry replied and little though he wanted to he hung the chain around his own neck dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes where it rested against his chest beside the pouch hagrid had given him 
 
 i think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent he added to hermione standing up and stretching and well need to think about some food as well you stay there he added sharply as ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green 
 
 with the sneakoscope hermione had given harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in the tent harry and hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout however the sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day and whether because of the protective enchantments and charms hermione had spread around them or because people rarely ventured this way their patch of wood remained deserted apart from occasional birds and squirrels evening brought no change harry lit his wand as he swapped places with hermione at ten oclock and looked out upon a deserted scene noting the bats fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing 
 
 he felt hungry now and a little hermione had not packed any food in her magical bag as she had assumed that they would be returning to grimmauld place that night so they had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that hermione had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a billycan after a couple of mouthfuls ron had pushed his portion away looking queasy harry had only persevered so as to not hurt hermiones feelings 
 
 the surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people yet he kept his wand held tight at the ready his insides already uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms tingled with unease 
 
 he had though that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the horcrux but somehow he did not all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness of which his wand lit only a tiny part was worry about what would happen next it was as though he had been hurtling toward this point for weeks months maybe even years but how he had come to an abrupt halt run out of road 
 
 there were other horcruxes out there somewhere but he did not have the faintest idea where they could be he did not even know what all of them were meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to destroy the only one that they had found the horcrux that currently lay against the bare flesh of his chest curiously it had not taken heat from his body but lay so cold against his skin it might just have emerged from icy water from time to time harry thought or perhaps imagined that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the dark he tried to resist them push them away yet they came at him relentlessly neither can live while the other survives ron and hermione now talking softly behind him in the tent could walk away if they wanted to he could not and it seemed to harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion that the horcrux against his chest was ticking away the time he had left stupid idea he told himself dont think that 
 
 his scar was starting to prickle again he was afraid that he was making it happen by having these thoughts and tried to direct them into another channel he thought of poor kreacher who had expected them home and had received yaxley instead would the elf keep silent or would he tell the death eater everything he knew harry wanted to believe that kreacher had changed towards him in the past month that he would be loyal now but who knew what would happen what if the death eaters tortured the elf sick images swarmed into harrys head and he tried to push these away too for there was nothing he could do for kreacher he and hermione had already decided against trying to summon him what if someone from the ministry came too they could not count on elfish apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken yaxley to grimmauld place on the hem of hermiones sleeve 
 
 harrys scar was burning now he thought that there was so much they did not know lupin had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined why hadnt dumbledore explained more had he thought that there would be time that he would live for years for centuries perhaps like his friend nicolas flamel if so he had been wrong snape had seen to that snape the sleeping snake who had struck at the top of the tower 
 
 and dumbledore had fallen fallen 
 
 give it to me gregorovitch 
 
 harrys voice was high clear and cold his wand held in front of him by a white hand the man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair though there were no ropes holding him he swung there invisibly and eerily bound his limbs wrapped about him his terrified face on a level with harrys ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head he had hair and a thick bushy beard a father christmas 
 
 i have it not i have it no more it was many years ago stolen from me 
 
 do not lie to lord voldemort gregorovitch he knows he always knows 
 
 the hanging mans pupils were wide dilated with fear and they seemed to swell bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed harry whole c 
 
 and how harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little gregorovitchs wake as he held a lantern aloft gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated what looked like a workshop wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of light and there on the window ledge sat perched like a giant bird a young man with golden hair in the split second that the lanterns light illuminated him harry saw the delight upon his handsome face then the intruder shot a stunning spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window with a crow of laughter 
 
 and harry was hurtling back out of those wide tunnellike pupils and gregorovitchs face was stricken with terror 
 
 who was the thief gregorovitch said the high cold voice 
 
 i do not know i never knew a young man c no c please c please 
 
 a scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light c 
 
 harry 
 
 he opened his eyes panting his forehead throbbing he had passed out against the side of the tent had slid sideways down the canvas and was sprawled on the ground he looked up at hermione whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high above them 
 
 dream he said sitting up quickly and attempting to meet hermiones glower with a look of innocence mustve dozed off sorry 
 
 i know it was your scar i can tell by the look on your face you were looking into vol c 
 
 dont say his name came rons angry voice from the depths of the tent 
 
 fine retorted hermione mind then 
 
 i didnt mean it to happen harry said it was a dream can you control what you dream about hermione 
 
 if you just learned to apply occlumency c 
 
 but harry was not interested in being told off he wanted to discuss what he had just seen 
 
 hes found gregorovitch hermione and i think hes killed him but before he killed him he read gregorovitchs mind and i saw c 
 
 i think id better take over the watch if youre so tired youre falling sleep said hermione coldly 
 
 i can finish the watch 
 
 no youre obviously exhausted go and lie down 
 
 she dropped down in the mouth of the tent looking stubborn angry but wishing to avoid a row harry ducked back inside 
 
 rons face was poking out from the lower bunk harry climbed into the one above him lay down and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling after several moments ron spoke in a voice so low that it would not carry to hermione huddle in the entrance 
 
 whats doing 
 
 harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail then whispered into the darkness 
 
 he found gregorovitch he had him tied up he was torturing him 
 
 hows gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if hes tied up 
 
 i dunno its weird isnt it 
 
 harry closed his eyes thinking of all that he had seen and heard the more he recalled the less sense it made voldemort had said nothing about harrys wand nothing about the twin cores nothing about gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat harrys 
 
 he wanted something from gregorovitch harry said eyes still closed tight he asked him to hand it over but gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him and then then 
 
 he remembered how he as voldemort had seemed to hurtle through gregorovitchs eyes into his memories 
 
 he read gregorovitchs mind and i saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill and he fired a curse at gregorovitch and jumped out of sight he stole it he stole whatever after and i i think ive seen him somewhere 
 
 harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boys face the theft had happened many years ago according to gregorovitch why did the young thief look familiar 
 
 the noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent all harry could hear was rons breathing after a while ron whispered couldnt you see what the thief was holding 
 
 no it mustve been something small 
 
 harry 
 
 the wooden slats of rons bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed 
 
 harry you dont reckon after something else to turn into a horcrux 
 
 i dont know said harry slowly maybe but wouldnt it be dangerous for him to make another one didnt hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already 
 
 yeah but maybe he doesnt know that 
 
 yeahmaybe said harry 
 
 he had been sure that voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem of the twin cores sure that voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker and yet he had killed him apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore 
 
 what was voldemort trying to find why with the ministry of magic and the wizarding world at his feet was he far away intent on the pursuit of an object that gregorovitch had once owned and which had been stolen by the unknown thief 
 
 harry could still see the youths face it was merry wild there was a fred and air of triumphant trickery about him he had soared from the windowsill like a bird and harry had seen him before but he could not think where 
 
 with gregorovitch dead it was the thief who was in danger now and it was on him that harrys thoughts dwelled as rons snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself drifted slowly into sleep once more

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 holger danske 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 in denmark there stands an old castle named kronenburg close by 
 the sound of elsinore where large ships both english russian and 
 prussian pass by hundreds every day and they salute the old castle 
 with cannons boom boom which is as if they said 
 and the cannons of the old castle answer boom which means many thanks in winter no ships sail by for the whole sound is covered with ice as far as the swedish coast and has quite the appearance of a the danish and the swedish flags wave and danes and swedes say and thank you to each other not with cannons but with a friendly shake of the hand and they exchange white bread and biscuits with each other because foreign articles taste the best 
 
 but the most beautiful sight of all is the old castle of kronenburg where holger danske sits in the deep dark cellar into which no one goes he is clad in iron and steel and rests his head on his strong arm his long beard hangs down upon the marble table into which it has become firmly rooted he sleeps and dreams but in his dreams he sees everything that happens in denmark on each an angel comes to him and tells him that all he has dreamed is true and that he may go to sleep again in peace as denmark is not yet in any real danger but should danger ever come then holger danske will rouse himself and the table will burst asunder as he draws out his beard then he will come forth in his strength and strike a blow that shall sound in all the countries of the world 
 
 an old grandfather sat and told his little grandson all this about 
 holger danske and the boy knew that what his grandfather told him 
 must be true as the old man related this story he was carving an 
 image in wood to represent holger danske to be fastened to the prow of a ship for the old grandfather was a carver in wood that is 
 one who carved figures for the heads of ships according to the 
 names given to them and now he had carved holger danske who stood there erect and proud with his long beard holding in one hand his broad while with the other he leaned on the danish arms 
 
 the old grandfather told the little boy a great deal about danish 
 men and women who had distinguished themselves in olden times so that he fancied he knew as much even as holger danske himself who after all could only dream and when the little fellow went to bed he thought so much about it that he actually pressed his chin against the counterpane and imagined that he had a long beard which had become rooted to it but the old grandfather remained sitting at his work and carving away at the last part of it which was the danish arms and when he had finished he looked at the whole figure and thought of all he had heard and read and what he had that evening related to his little grandson then he nodded his head wiped his spectacles and put them on and said ah yes holger danske will not appear in my lifetime but the boy who is in bed there may very likely live to see him when the event really comes to pass and the old grandfather nodded again and the more he looked at holger danske the more satisfied he felt that he had carved a good image of him it seemed to glow with the color of life the armor glittered like iron and steel the hearts in the danish arms grew more and more red while the lions with gold crowns on their heads were leaping up 
 that is the most beautiful coat of arms in the world said the old man 
 
 the lions represent strength and the hearts gentleness and love 
 and as he gazed on the uppermost lion he thought of king canute 
 who chained great england to throne and he looked at the 
 second lion and thought of waldemar who untied denmark and conquered the vandals the third lion reminded him of margaret who united denmark sweden and norway but when he gazed at the red hearts their colors glowed more deeply even as flames and his memory followed each in turn the first led him to a dark narrow prison in which sat a prisoner a beautiful woman daughter of christian the fourth eleanor ulfeld and the flame became a rose on her bosom and its blossoms were not more pure than the heart of this noblest and best of all danish women ah yes that is indeed a noble heart in the danish arms said the grandfather and his spirit 
 followed the second flame which carried him out to sea where cannons roared and the ships lay shrouded in smoke and the flaming heart attached itself to the breast of hvitfeldt in the form of the ribbon 
 of an order as he blew himself and his ship into the air in order 
 to save the fleet and the third flame led him to wretched 
 huts where the preacher hans egede ruled with love in every word 
 and action the flame was as a star on his breast and added another 
 heart to the danish arms and as the old spirit followed 
 the next hovering flame he knew whither it would lead him in a 
 peasant humble room stood frederick the sixth writing his 
 name with chalk on the beam the flame trembled on his breast and in 
 his heart and it was in the room that his heart became 
 one for the danish arms the old grandfather wiped his eyes for he 
 had known king frederick with his silvery locks and his honest blue 
 eyes and had lived for him and he folded his hands and remained 
 for some time silent then his daughter came to him and said it was 
 getting late that he ought to rest for a while and that the supper 
 was on the table 
 
 what you have been carving is very beautiful grandfather 
 said she holger danske and the old coat of arms it seems to me as 
 if i have seen the face somewhere 
 
 no that is impossible replied the old grandfather but i have 
 seen it and i have tried to carve it in wood as i have retained it 
 in my memory it was a long time ago while the english fleet lay in 
 the roads on the second of april when we showed that we were true ancient danes i was on board the denmark in steene squadron i had a man by my side whom even the cannon balls seemed to fear he sung old songs in a merry voice and fired and fought as if he were something more than a man i still remember his face but from whence he came or whither he went i know not no one knows i have often thought it might have been holger danske himself who had swam down to us from kronenburg to help us in the hour of danger that was my idea and there stands his likeness 
 the wooden figure threw a gigantic shadow on the wall and even on 
 part of the ceiling it seemed as if the real holger danske stood 
 behind it for the shadow moved but this was no doubt caused by the flame of the lamp not burning steadily then the 
 kissed the old grandfather and led him to a large by the 
 table and she and her husband who was the son of the old man and 
 the father of the little boy who lay in bed sat down to supper with 
 him and the old grandfather talked of the danish lions and the danish hearts emblems of strength and gentleness and explained quite clearly that there is another strength than that which lies in a 
 sword and he pointed to a shelf where lay a number of old books 
 and amongst them a collection of plays which are much 
 read and are so clever and amusing that it is easy to fancy we have 
 known the people of those days who are described in them 
 
 he knew how to fight also said the old man for he lashed 
 the follies and prejudices of people during his whole life 
 then the grandfather nodded to a place above the 
 where hung an almanac with a representation of the round tower upon it and said tycho brahe was another of those who used a sword but not one to cut into the flesh and bone but to make the way of the stars of heaven clear and plain to be understood and then he whose father belonged to my calling yes he the son of the old he whom we ourselves have seen with his silvery locks and his broad shoulders whose name is known in all lands yes he was a sculptor while i am only a carver holger danske can appear in marble so that people in all countries of the world may hear of the strength of denmark now let us drink the health of bertel 
 but the little boy in bed saw plainly the old castle of kronenburg and the sound of elsinore and holger danske far down in the cellar with his beard rooted to the table and dreaming of everything that was passing above him 
 
 and holger danske did dream of the little humble room in which the 
 sat he heard all that had been said and he nodded in 
 his dream saying ah yes remember me you danish people keep me in your memory i will come to you in the hour of need 
 
 the bright morning light shone over kronenburg and the wind 
 brought the sound of the across from the neighboring 
 shores the ships sailed by and saluted the castle with the boom of 
 the cannon and kronenburg returned the salute boom boom but 
 the roaring cannons did not awake holger danske for they meant only good morning and thank you they must fire in another fashion before he awakes but wake he will for there is energy yet in 
 holger danske

 some of his particular characteristics 
 the street paris is the dwarf of the giant 
 let us not exaggerate this cherub of the gutter sometimes has a shirt but in that case he owns but one he sometimes has shoes but then they have no soles he sometimes has a lodging and he loves it for he finds his mother there but he prefers the street because there he finds liberty 
 he has his own games his own bits of mischief whose foundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois his peculiar metaphors 
 to be dead is to eat dandelions by the root his own occupations calling letting down establishing means of transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains which he calls making the bridge of arts crying discourses pronounced by the authorities in favor of the french people cleaning out the cracks in the pavement he has his own coinage which is composed of all the little morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets this curious money which receives the name of an invariable and currency in this little bohemia of children 
 lastly he has his own fauna which he observes attentively in the corners the the the the devil a black insect which menaces by twisting about its tail armed with two horns 
 he has his fabulous monster which has scales under its belly but is not a lizard which has pustules on its back but is not a toad which inhabits the nooks of old and wells that have run dry which is black hairy sticky which crawls sometimes slowly sometimes rapidly which has no cry but which has a look and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it he calls this monster the deaf thing 
 the search for these deaf things among the stones is a joy of formidable nature 
 another pleasure consists in suddenly prying up a and taking a look at the each region of paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which are to be found there 
 there are in the of the ursulines there are millepeds in the pantheon there are tadpoles in the ditches of the 
 as far as sayings are concerned this child has as many of them as talleyrand 
 he is no less cynical but he is more honest he is endowed with a certain indescribable unexpected joviality he upsets the composure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter he ranges boldly from high comedy to farce 
 a funeral passes by 
 among those who accompany the dead there is a doctor 
 hey there shouts some street arab how long has it been customary for doctors to carry home their own work 
 another is in a crowd 
 a grave man adorned with spectacles and trinkets turns round indignantly 
 you you have seized my sir 
 search me

 chapter v 
 
 boris had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in petersburg so with the same object in view he came to moscow there he wavered between the two richest heiresses julie and princess mary though princess mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than julie he without knowing why felt awkward about paying court to her when they had last met on the old name day she had answered at random all his attempts to talk sentimentally evidently not listening to what he was saying 
 julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily though in a manner peculiar to herself 
 she was after the death of her brothers she had become very wealthy she was by now decidedly plain but thought herself not merely as as before but even far more attractive she was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less dangerous she became to men and the more freely they could associate with her and avail themselves of her suppers soirees and the animated company that assembled at her house without incurring any obligation a man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there for fear of compromising her and committing himself would now go boldly every day and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance 
 that winter the karagins house was the most agreeable and hospitable in moscow in addition to the formal evening and dinner parties a large company chiefly of men gathered there every day supping at midnight and staying till three in the morning julie never missed a ball a promenade or a play her dresses were always of the latest fashion but in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love or any of the joys of life and expected peace only yonder she adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment like a girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in that light and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered much in life this melancholy which did not prevent her amusing herself did not hinder the young people who came to her house from passing the time pleasantly every visitor who came to the house paid his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess and then amused himself with society gossip dancing intellectual games and bouts rimes which were in vogue at the karagins only a few of these young men among them boris entered more deeply into melancholy and with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of all worldly things and to them she showed her albums filled with mournful sketches maxims and verses 
 to boris julie was particularly gracious she regretted his early disillusionment with life offered him such consolation of friendship as she who had herself suffered so much could render and showed him her album boris sketched two trees in the album and wrote rustic trees your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me 
 on another page he drew a tomb and wrote 
 la mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille 
 ah contre les douleurs il a pas asile 
 death gives relief and death is peaceful 
 ah from suffering there is no other refuge julia said this was charming 
 there is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy she said to boris repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a book it is a ray of light in the darkness a shade between sadness and despair showing the possibility of consolation 
 in reply boris wrote these lines 
 aliment de poison ame trop sensible 
 toi sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible 
 tendre melancholie ah viens me consoler 
 viens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite 
 et mele une douceur secrete 
 a ces pleurs que je sens couler 
 poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul 
 thou without whom happiness would for me be impossible 
 tender melancholy ah come to console me 
 come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat 
 and mingle a secret sweetness 
 with these tears that i feel to be flowing 
 for boris julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp boris read poor liza aloud to her and more than once interrupted the reading because of the emotions that choked him meeting at large gatherings julie and boris looked on one another as the only souls who understood one another in a world of indifferent people 
 anna mikhaylovna who often visited the karagins while playing cards with the mother made careful inquiries as to dowry she was to have two estates in penza and the nizhegorod forests anna mikhaylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy julie with emotion and resignation to the divine will 
 you are always charming and melancholy my dear julie she said to the daughter boris says his soul finds repose at your house he has suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive said she to the mother ah my dear i tell you how fond i have grown of julie latterly she said to her son but who could help loving her she is an angelic being ah boris boris she paused and how i pity her mother she went on today she showed me her accounts and letters from penza they have enormous estates there and she poor thing has no one to help her and they do cheat her so 
 boris smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother he laughed blandly at her naive diplomacy but listened to what she had to say and sometimes questioned her carefully about the penza and nizhegorod estates 
 julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and was ready to accept it but some secret feeling of repulsion for her for her passionate desire to get married for her artificiality and a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still restrained boris his leave was expiring he spent every day and whole days at the karagins and every day on thinking the matter over told himself that he would propose tomorrow but in presence looking at her red face and chin nearly always powdered her moist eyes and her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural rapture of married bliss boris could not utter the decisive words though in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of those penza and nizhegorod estates and had apportioned the use of the income from them julie saw boris indecision and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him but her feminine immediately supplied her with consolation and she told herself that he was only shy from love her melancholy however began to turn to irritability and not long before boris departure she formed a definite plan of action just as boris leave of absence was expiring anatole kuragin made his appearance in moscow and of course in the karagins drawing room and julie suddenly abandoning her melancholy became cheerful and very attentive to kuragin 
 my dear said anna mikhaylovna to her son i know from a reliable source that prince vasili has sent his son to moscow to get him married to julie i am so fond of julie that i should be sorry for her what do you think of it my dear 
 the idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole month of arduous melancholy service to julie and of seeing all the revenue from the penza estates which he had already mentally apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another and especially into the hands of that idiot anatole pained boris he drove to the karagins with the firm intention of proposing julie met him in a gay careless manner spoke casually of how she had enjoyed ball and asked when he was leaving though boris had come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender he began speaking irritably of feminine inconstancy of how easily women can turn from sadness to joy and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them julie was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs variety and the same thing over and over again would weary anyone 
 then i should advise you boris began wishing to sting her but at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to leave moscow without having accomplished his aim and have vainly wasted his efforts which was a thing he never allowed to happen 
 he checked himself in the middle of the sentence lowered his eyes to avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face and said 
 i did not come here at all to quarrel with you on the contrary 
 he glanced at her to make sure that he might go on her irritability had suddenly quite vanished and her anxious imploring eyes were fixed on him with greedy expectation i can always arrange so as not to see her often thought boris the affair has been begun and must be finished he blushed hotly raised his eyes to hers and said 
 you know my feelings for you 
 there was no need to say more face shone with triumph and but she forced boris to say all that is said on such occasions that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more than her she knew that for the penza estates and nizhegorod forests she could demand this and she received what she demanded 
 the affianced couple no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and melancholy upon them planned the arrangements of a splendid house in petersburg paid calls and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding

 he is agreeable 
 in the evening thanks to a few sous which he always finds means to procure the homuncio enters a theatre 
 on crossing that magic threshold he becomes transfigured he was the street arab he becomes the titi theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with the keel in the air 
 it is in that keel that the titi huddle together 
 the titi is to the gamin what the moth is to the larva the same being endowed with wings and soaring it suffices for him to be there with his radiance of happiness with his power of enthusiasm and joy with his which resembles a clapping of wings to confer on that narrow dark fetid sordid unhealthy hideous abominable keel the name of paradise 
 chicken 
 slang allusion to the noise made in calling poultry 
 bestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary and you have the gamin 
 the gamin is not devoid of literary intuition 
 his tendency and we say it with the proper amount of regret would not constitute classic taste 
 he is not very academic by nature 
 thus to give an example the popularity of mademoiselle mars among that little audience of stormy children was seasoned with a touch of irony the gamin called her mademoiselle yourself 
 this being bawls and scoffs and ridicules and fights has rags like a baby and tatters like a philosopher fishes in the sewer hunts in the cesspool extracts mirth from foulness whips up the squares with his wit grins and bites whistles and sings shouts and shrieks tempers alleluia with chants every rhythm from the de profundis to the finds without seeking knows what he is ignorant of is a spartan to the point of thieving is mad to wisdom is lyrical to filth would crouch down on olympus wallows in the dunghill and emerges from it covered with stars the gamin of paris is rabelais in this youth 
 he is not content with his trousers unless they have a 
 he is not easily astonished he is still less easily terrified he makes songs on superstitions he takes the wind out of exaggerations he twits mysteries he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts he takes the poetry out of stilted things he introduces caricature into epic extravaganzas 
 it is not that he is prosaic far from that but he replaces the solemn vision by the farcical phantasmagoria if adamastor were to appear to him the street arab would say hi there

 at the end of january old count rostov went to moscow with natasha and sonya the countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was impossible to wait for her recovery prince andrew was expected in moscow any day the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near moscow had to be sold besides which the opportunity of presenting his future to old prince bolkonski while he was in moscow could not be missed the rostovs moscow house had not been heated that winter and as they had come only for a short time and the countess was not with them the count decided to stay with marya dmitrievna akhrosimova who had long been pressing her hospitality on them 
 late one evening the rostovs four sleighs drove into marya courtyard in the old konyusheny street marya dmitrievna lived alone she had already married off her daughter and her sons were all in the service 
 she held herself as erect told everyone her opinion as candidly loudly and bluntly as ever and her whole bearing seemed a reproach to others for any weakness passion or temptation the possibility of which she did not admit from early in the morning wearing a dressing jacket she attended to her household affairs and then she drove out on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on affairs of which she never spoke to anyone on ordinary days after dressing she received petitioners of various classes of whom there were always some then she had dinner a substantial and appetizing meal at which there were always three or four guests after dinner she played a game of boston and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read to her while she knitted she rarely made an exception and went out to pay visits and then only to the most important persons in the town 
 she had not yet gone to bed when the rostovs arrived and the pulley of the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the rostovs and their servants marya dmitrievna with her spectacles hanging down on her nose and her head flung back stood in the hall doorway looking with a stern grim face at the new arrivals one might have thought she was angry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out had she not at the same time been giving careful instructions to the servants for the accommodation of the visitors and their belongings 
 the things bring them here she said pointing to the portmanteaus and not greeting anyone the young ladies there to the left now what are you dawdling for she cried to the maids get the samovar ready grown plumper and prettier she remarked drawing natasha whose cheeks were glowing from the cold to her by the hood foo you are cold now take off your things quick she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand half frozen sure bring some rum for tea bonjour sonya dear she added turning to sonya and indicating by this french greeting her slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her 
 when they came in to tea having taken off their outdoor things and tidied themselves up after their journey marya dmitrievna kissed them all in due order 
 heartily glad you have come and are staying with me it was high time she said giving natasha a significant look the old man is here and his expected any day have to make his aquaintance but speak of that later on she added glancing at sonya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her presence now listen she said to the count what do you want tomorrow whom will you send for shinshin she crooked one of her fingers the sniveling anna mikhaylovna two here with her son the son is getting married then bezukhov eh he is here too with his wife he ran away from her and she came galloping after him he dined with me on wednesday as for them and she pointed to the girls tomorrow take them first to the iberian shrine of the mother of god and then drive to the i suppose have everything new judge by me sleeves nowadays are this size the other day young princess irina vasilevna came to see me she was an awful sight looked as if she had put two barrels on her arms you know not a day passes now without some new fashion and what have you to do yourself she asked the count sternly 
 one thing has come on top of another her rags to buy and now a purchaser has turned up for the moscow estate and for the house if you will be so kind fix a time and go down to the estate just for a day and leave my lassies with you 
 all right all right be safe with me as safe as in chancery take them where they must go scold them a bit and pet them a bit said marya dmitrievna touching her goddaughter and favorite natasha on the cheek with her large hand 
 next morning marya dmitrievna took the young ladies to the iberian shrine of the mother of god and to madame who was so afraid of marya dmitrievna that she always let her have costumes at a loss merely to get rid of her marya dmitrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau when they got home she turned everybody out of the room except nataisha and then called her pet to her armchair 
 well now talk i congratulate you on your betrothed hooked a fine fellow i am glad for your sake and known him since he was so high she held her hand a couple of feet from the ground natasha blushed happily i like him and all his family now listen you know that old prince nicholas much dislikes his marrying the old crotchety of course prince andrew is not a child and can shift without him but not nice to enter a family against a will one wants to do it peacefully and lovingly a clever girl and know how to manage be kind and use your wits then all will be well 
 natasha remained silent from shyness marya dmitrievna supposed but really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love of prince andrew which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs that no one could understand it she loved and knew prince andrew he loved her only and was to come one of these days and take her she wanted nothing more 
 you see i have known him a long time and am also fond of mary your future husbands sisters bring up blisters but this one hurt a fly she has asked me to bring you two together tomorrow go with your father to see her be very nice and affectionate to her younger than she when he comes find you already know his sister and father and are liked by them am i right or not that be best 
 yes it will natasha answered reluctantly

 next day by marya advice count rostov took natasha to call on prince nicholas bolkonski the count did not set out cheerfully on this visit at heart he felt afraid he well remembered the last interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the enrollment when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of men natasha on the other hand having put on her best gown was in the highest spirits they help liking me she thought everybody always has liked me and i am so willing to do anything they wish so ready to be fond of him for being his father and of her for being his sister that there is no reason for them not to like me 
 they drove up to the gloomy old house on the vozdvizhenka and entered the vestibule 
 well the lord have mercy on us said the count half in jest half in earnest but natasha noticed that her father was flurried on entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and princess were at home 
 when they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the servants the footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by another in the large hall and they whispered to one another then a maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something mentioning the princess at last an old cross looking footman came and announced to the rostovs that the prince was not receiving but that the princess begged them to walk up the first person who came to meet the visitors was mademoiselle bourienne she greeted the father and daughter with special politeness and showed them to the princess room the princess looking excited and nervous her face flushed in patches ran in to meet the visitors treading heavily and vainly trying to appear cordial and at ease from the first glance princess mary did not like natasha she thought her too fashionably dressed frivolously gay and vain she did not at all realize that before having seen her future she was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty youth and happiness as well as by jealousy of her love for her apart from this insuperable antipathy to her princess mary was agitated just then because on the rostovs being announced the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them that princess mary might do so if she chose but they were not to be admitted to him she had decided to receive them but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in some freak as he seemed much upset by the rostovs visit 
 there my dear princess brought you my songstress said the count bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince might appear i am so glad you should get to know one another very sorry the prince is still ailing and after a few more commonplace remarks he rose if allow me to leave my natasha in your hands for a quarter of an hour princess drive round to see anna semenovna quite near in the dogs square and then come back for her 
 the count had devised this diplomatic ruse as he afterwards told his daughter to give the future an opportunity to talk to one another freely but another motive was to avoid the danger of encountering the old prince of whom he was afraid he did not mention this to his daughter but natasha noticed her nervousness and anxiety and felt mortified by it she blushed for him grew still angrier at having blushed and looked at the princess with a bold and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody the princess told the count that she would be delighted and only begged him to stay longer at anna and he departed 
 despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by princess mary who wished to have a with natasha mademoiselle bourienne remained in the room and persistently talked about moscow amusements and theaters natasha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom by her nervousness and by the unnatural manner of the princess who she thought was making a favor of receiving her and so everything displeased her she did not like princess mary whom she thought very plain affected and dry natasha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated princess mary still more after five minutes of irksome constrained conversation they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching princess mary looked frightened 
 the door opened and the old prince in a dress ing gown and a white nightcap came in 
 ah madam he began madam countess countess rostova if i am not mistaken i beg you to excuse me to excuse me i did not know madam god is my witness i did not know you had honored us with a visit and i came in such a costume only to see my daughter i beg you to excuse me god is my witness i know he repeated stressing the word god so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that princess mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her father or at natasha 
 nor did the latter having risen and curtsied know what to do mademoiselle bourienne alone smiled agreeably 
 i beg you to excuse me excuse me god is my witness i did not know muttered the old man and after looking natasha over from head to foot he went out 
 mademoiselle bourienne was the first to recover herself after this apparition and began speaking about the indisposition natasha and princess mary looked at one another in silence and the longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say the greater grew their antipathy to one another 
 when the count returned natasha was impolitely pleased and hastened to get away at that moment she hated the stiff elderly princess who could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an hour with her without once mentioning prince andrew i begin talking about him in the presence of that frenchwoman thought natasha the same thought was meanwhile tormenting princess mary she knew what she ought to have said to natasha but she had been unable to say it because mademoiselle bourienne was in the way and because without knowing why she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage when the count was already leaving the room princess mary went up hurriedly to natasha took her by the hand and said with a deep sigh 
 wait i must 
 natasha glanced at her ironically without knowing why 
 dear natalie said princess mary i want you to know that i am glad my brother has found happiness 
 she paused feeling that she was not telling the truth natasha noticed this and guessed its reason 
 i think princess it is not convenient to speak of that now she said with external dignity and coldness though she felt the tears choking her 
 what have i said and what have i done thought she as soon as she was out of the room 
 they waited a long time for natasha to come to dinner that day she sat in her room crying like a child blowing her nose and sobbing sonya stood beside her kissing her hair 
 natasha what is it about she asked what do they matter to you it will all pass natasha 
 but if you only knew how offensive it was as if i 
 talk about it natasha it your fault so why should you mind kiss me said sonya 
 natasha raised her head and kissing her friend on the lips pressed her wet face against her 
 i tell you i know no to blame said natasha my fault but it all hurts terribly oh why he come 
 she came in to dinner with red eyes marya dmitrievna who knew how the prince had received the rostovs pretended not to notice how upset natasha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count and the other guests

 his frontiers 
 the gamin loves the city he also loves solitude since he has something of the sage in him 
 urbis amator like fuscus ruris amator like flaccus 
 to roam thoughtfully about that is to say to lounge is a fine employment of time in the eyes of the philosopher particularly in that rather illegitimate species of campaign which is tolerably ugly but odd and composed of two natures which surrounds certain great cities notably paris 
 to study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal 
 end of the trees beginning of the roofs end of the grass beginning of the pavements end of the furrows beginning of the shops end of the beginning of the passions end of the divine murmur beginning of the human uproar hence an extraordinary interest 
 hence in these not very attractive places indelibly stamped by the passing stroller with the epithet 
 melancholy the apparently objectless promenades of the dreamer 
 he who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers of paris and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs that turf those pebbly paths that chalk those pools those harsh monotonies of waste and fallow lands the plants of early suddenly springing into sight in a bottom that mixture of the savage and the citizen those vast desert nooks where the garrison drums practise noisily and produce a sort of lisping of battle those hermits by day and by night that clumsy mill which turns in the wind the of the quarries the at the corners of the cemeteries the mysterious charm of great sombre walls squarely intersecting immense vague stretches of land inundated with sunshine and full of this attracted him 
 there is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with those singular spots the glaciere the cunette the hideous wall of grenelle all speckled with balls the aubiers on the bank of the marne the the de chatillon where there is an old exhausted quarry which no longer serves any purpose except to raise mushrooms and which is closed on a level with the ground by a of rotten planks the campagna of rome is one idea the banlieue of paris is another to behold nothing but fields houses or trees in what a stretch of country offers us is to remain on the surface all aspects of things are thoughts of god 
 the spot where a plain effects its junction with a city is always stamped with a certain piercing melancholy nature and humanity both appeal to you at the same time there local originalities there make their appearance 
 any one who like ourselves has wandered about in these solitudes contiguous to our faubourgs which may be designated as the limbos of paris has seen here and there in the most desert spot at the most unexpected moment behind a meagre hedge or in the corner of a lugubrious wall children grouped tumultuously fetid muddy dusty ragged dishevelled playing and crowned with all of them are little ones who have made their escape from poor families 
 the outer boulevard is their breathing space the suburbs belong to them 
 there they are eternally playing truant there they innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs there they are or rather there they exist far from every eye in the sweet light of may or june kneeling round a hole in the ground snapping marbles with their thumbs quarrelling over irresponsible volatile free and happy and no sooner do they catch sight of you than they recollect that they have an industry and that they must earn their living and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled with cockchafers or a bunch of lilacs these encounters with strange children are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces of the environs of paris 
 sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys are they their are almost young maidens thin feverish with sunburnt hands covered with freckles crowned with poppies and ears of rye gay haggard barefooted 
 they can be seen devouring cherries among the wheat 
 in the evening they can be heard laughing these groups warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday or indistinctly seen in the twilight occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time and these visions mingle with his dreams 
 paris centre banlieue circumference this constitutes all the earth to those children 
 they never venture beyond this they can no more escape from the parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the water 
 for them nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers

 that evening the rostovs went to the opera for which marya dmitrievna had taken a box 
 natasha did not want to go but could not refuse marya kind offer which was intended expressly for her when she came ready dressed into the ballroom to await her father and looking in the large mirror there saw that she was pretty very pretty she felt even more sad but it was a sweet tender sadness 
 o god if he were here now i would not behave as i did then but differently i would not be silly and afraid of things i would simply embrace him cling to him and make him look at me with those searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me and then i would make him laugh as he used to laugh and his eyes how i see those eyes thought natasha and what do his father and sister matter to me i love him alone him him with that face and those eyes with his smile manly and yet childlike no i had better not think of him not think of him but forget him quite forget him for the present i bear this waiting and i shall cry in a minute and she turned away from the glass making an effort not to cry and how can sonya love nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so long and so patiently thought she looking at sonya who also came in quite ready with a fan in her hand no altogether different i 
 natasha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not enough for her to love and know she was beloved she wanted now at once to embrace the man she loved to speak and hear from him words of love such as filled her heart while she sat in the carriage beside her father pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on the frozen window she felt still sadder and more in love and forgot where she was going and with whom having fallen into the line of carriages the rostovs carriage drove up to the theater its wheels squeaking over the snow natasha and sonya holding up their dresses jumped out quickly the count got out helped by the footmen and passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes through the closed doors the music was already audible 
 natasha your hair whispered sonya 
 an attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and opened the door of their box the music sounded louder and through the door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and shoulders and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms glittered before their eyes a lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy at natasha the curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being played natasha smoothing her gown went in with sonya and sat down scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite a sensation she had not experienced for a long time that of hundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and neck suddenly affected her both agreeably and disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories desires and emotions associated with that feeling 
 the two remarkably pretty girls natasha and sonya with count rostov who had not been seen in moscow for a long time attracted general attention moreover everybody knew vaguely of engagement to prince andrew and knew that the rostovs had lived in the country ever since and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who was making one of the best matches in russia 
 looks as everyone told her had improved in the country and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty she struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty combined with her indifference to everything about her her black eyes looked at the crowd without seeking anyone and her delicate arm bare to above the elbow lay on the velvet edge of the box while evidently unconsciously she opened and closed her hand in time to the music crumpling her program look alenina said sonya with her mother it 
 dear me michael kirilovich has grown still stouter remarked the count 
 look at our anna mikhaylovna what a headdress she has on 
 the karagins julie and boris with them one can see at once that engaged 
 drubetskoy has proposed 
 oh yes i heard it today said shinshin coming into the rostovs box 
 natasha looked in the direction in which her eyes were turned and saw julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck which natasha knew was covered with powder behind them wearing a smile and leaning over with an ear to mouth was boris handsome smoothly brushed head he looked the rostovs from under his brows and said something smiling to his betrothed 
 they are talking about us about me and him thought natasha and he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me they trouble themselves if only they knew how little i am concerned about any of them 
 behind them sat anna mikhaylovna wearing a green headdress and with a happy look of resignation to the will of god on her face their box was pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which natasha knew so well and liked so much she turned away and suddenly remembered all that had been so humiliating in her visit 
 what right has he not to wish to receive me into his family oh better not think of it not till he comes back she told herself and began looking at the faces some strange and some familiar in the stalls in the front in the very center leaning back against the orchestra rail stood dolokhov in a persian dress his curly hair brushed up into a huge shock he stood in full view of the audience well aware that he was attracting attention yet as much at ease as though he were in his own room around him thronged most brilliant young men whom he evidently dominated 
 the count laughing nudged the blushing sonya and pointed to her former adorer 
 do you recognize him said he and where has he sprung from he asked turning to shinshin he vanish somewhere 
 he did replied shinshin he was in the caucasus and ran away from there they say he has been acting as minister to some ruling prince in persia where he killed the brother now all the moscow ladies are mad about him dolokhov the persian that does it we never hear a word but dolokhov is mentioned they swear by him they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet dolokhov and anatole kuragin have turned all our ladies heads 
 a tall beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed plump white shoulders and neck round which she wore a double string of large pearls entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress and took a long time settling into her place 
 natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck those shoulders and pearls and coiffure and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls while natasha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady looked round and meeting the eyes nodded to him and smiled she was the countess bezukhova wife and the count who knew everyone in society leaned over and spoke to her 
 have you been here long countess he inquired call call to kiss your hand here on business and have brought my girls with me they say semenova acts marvelously count pierre never used to forget us is he here 
 yes he meant to look in answered helene and glanced attentively at natasha 
 count rostov resumed his seat 
 handsome she he whispered to natasha 
 wonderful answered natasha a woman one could easily fall in love with 
 just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor tapped with his stick some latecomers took their seats in the stalls and the curtain rose 
 as soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent and all the men old and young in uniform and evening dress and all the women with gems on their bare flesh turned their whole attention with eager curiosity to the stage natasha too began to look at it

 a bit of history 
 at the epoch nearly contemporary by the way when the action of this book takes place there was not as there is a policeman at the corner of every street a benefit which there is no time to discuss here stray children abounded in paris the statistics give an average of two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that period by the police patrols in unenclosed lands in houses in process of construction and under the arches of the bridges 
 one of these nests which has become famous produced the swallows of the bridge of arcola this is moreover the most disastrous of social symptoms all crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child 
 let us make an exception in favor of paris nevertheless 
 in a relative measure and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled the exception is just 
 while in any other great city the vagabond child is a lost man while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is in some sort sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the public vices which devour in him honesty and conscience the street boy of paris we insist on this point however defaced and injured on the surface is almost intact on the interior 
 it is a magnificent thing to put on record and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our popular revolutions that a certain incorruptibility results from the idea which exists in the air of paris as salt exists in the water of the ocean to breathe paris preserves the soul 
 what we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which one experiences every time that one meets one of these children around whom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken family 
 in the civilization of the present day incomplete as it still is it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families pouring themselves out into the darkness not knowing clearly what has become of their children and allowing their own entrails to fall on the public highway hence these obscure destinies 
 this is called for this sad thing has given rise to an expression to be cast on the pavements of paris 
 let it be said by the way that this abandonment of children was not discouraged by the ancient monarchy 
 a little of egypt and bohemia in the lower regions suited the upper spheres and compassed the aims of the powerful 
 the hatred of instruction for the children of the people was a dogma 
 what is the use of such was the countersign 
 now the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child 
 besides this the monarchy sometimes was in need of children and in that case it skimmed the streets 
 under louis xiv not to go any further back the king rightly desired to create a fleet 
 the idea was a good one 
 but let us consider the means 
 there can be no fleet if beside the sailing ship that plaything of the winds and for the purpose of towing it in case of necessity there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases either by means of oars or of steam the galleys were then to the marine what steamers are therefore galleys were necessary but the galley is moved only by the hence were required 
 colbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliaments make as many convicts as possible the magistracy showed a great deal of complaisance in the matter a man kept his hat on in the presence of a was a huguenot attitude he was sent to the galleys 
 a child was encountered in the streets provided that he was fifteen years of age and did not know where he was to sleep he was sent to the galleys grand reign grand century 
 under louis xv 
 children disappeared in paris the police carried them off for what mysterious purpose no one knew people whispered with terror monstrous conjectures as to the baths of purple 
 barbier speaks ingenuously of these things it sometimes happened that the exempts of the guard when they ran short of children took those who had fathers 
 the fathers in despair attacked the exempts 
 in that case the parliament intervened and had some one hung 
 who 
 the exempts 
 no the fathers

 chapter ix 
 
 the floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards at the sides was some painted cardboard representing trees and at the back was a cloth stretched over boards in the center of the stage sat some girls in red bodices and white skirts one very fat girl in a white silk dress sat apart on a low bench to the back of which a piece of green cardboard was glued they all sang something when they had finished their song the girl in white went up to the box and a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs and holding a plume and a dagger went up to her and began singing waving his arms about 
 first the man in the tight trousers sang alone then she sang then they both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand of the girl in white obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with her they sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and shouting while the man and woman on the stage who represented lovers began smiling spreading out their arms and bowing 
 after her life in the country and in her present serious mood all this seemed grotesque and amazing to natasha she could not follow the opera nor even listen to the music she saw only the painted cardboard and the queerly dressed men and women who moved spoke and sang so strangely in that brilliant light she knew what it was all meant to represent but it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused at them she looked at the faces of the audience seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she herself experienced but they all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage and expressed delight which to natasha seemed feigned i suppose it has to be like this she thought she kept looking round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude women in the boxes especially at helene in the next box who apparently quite unclothed sat with a quiet tranquil smile not taking her eyes off the stage and feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd natasha little by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long while she did not realize who and where she was nor what was going on before her as she looked and thought the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her mind the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the air the actress was singing then she wished to touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her then to lean over to helene and tickle her 
 at a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song a door leading to the stalls on the side nearest the rostovs box creaked and the steps of a belated arrival were heard kuragin whispered shinshin countess bezukhova turned smiling to the newcomer and natasha following the direction of that look saw an exceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their box with a yet courteous bearing this was anatole kuragin whom she had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in petersburg he was now in an uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot he moved with a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so and had his handsome face not worn such an expression of complacency and gaiety though the performance was proceeding he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high having looked at natasha he approached his sister laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her box nodded to her and leaning forward asked a question with a motion toward natasha 
 mais charmante said he evidently referring to natasha who did not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his lips then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down beside dolokhov nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way that dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly he winked at him gaily smiled and rested his foot against the orchestra screen 
 how like the brother is to the sister remarked the count and how handsome they both are 
 shinshin lowering his voice began to tell the count of some intrigue of in moscow and natasha tried to overhear it just because he had said she was charmante 
 the first act was over in the stalls everyone began moving about going out and coming in 
 boris came to the rostovs box received their congratulations very simply and raising his eyebrows with an smile conveyed to natasha and sonya his invitation to her wedding and went away natasha with a gay coquettish smile talked to him and congratulated on his approaching wedding that same boris with whom she had formerly been in love in the state of intoxication she was in everything seemed simple and natural 
 the scantily clad helene smiled at everyone in the same way and natasha gave boris a similar smile 
 box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most distinguished and intellectual men who seemed to vie with one another in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her 
 during the whole of that kuragin stood with dolokhov in front of the orchestra partition looking at the rostovs box natasha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure she even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming aspect before the beginning of the second act pierre appeared in the stalls the rostovs had not seen him since their arrival his face looked sad and he had grown still stouter since natasha last saw him he passed up to the front rows not noticing anyone anatole went up to him and began speaking to him looking at and indicating the rostovs box on seeing natasha pierre grew animated and hastily passing between the rows came toward their box when he got there he leaned on his elbows and smiling talked to her for a long time while conversing with pierre natasha heard a voice in countess box and something told her it was kuragin she turned and their eyes met almost smiling he gazed straight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be so near him to look at him like that to be so sure he admired her and not to be acquainted with him 
 in the second act there was scenery representing tombstones there was a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon shades were raised over the footlights and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding things like daggers in their hands they began waving their arms then some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been in white and was now in light blue they did not drag her away at once but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off and behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyone knelt down and sang a prayer all these things were repeatedly interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience 
 during this act every time natasha looked toward the stalls she saw anatole kuragin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair staring at her she was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it 
 when the second act was over countess bezukhova rose turned to the rostovs box her whole bosom completely exposed beckoned the old count with a gloved finger and paying no attention to those who had entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile 
 do make me acquainted with your charming daughters said she the whole town is singing their praises and i even know then 
 natasha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess she was so pleased by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure 
 i want to become a moscovite too now said helene how is it not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country 
 countess bezukhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating woman she could say what she did not think especially what was flattering quite simply and naturally 
 dear count you must let me look after your daughters though i am not staying here long this time nor are you i will try to amuse them i have already heard much of you in petersburg and wanted to get to know you said she to natasha with her stereotyped and lovely smile i had heard about you from my page drubetskoy have you heard he is getting married and also from my friend bolkonski prince andrew bolkonski she went on with special emphasis implying that she knew of his relation to natasha to get better acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the performance and natasha moved over to it 
 the scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the walls in the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen the king waved his right arm and evidently nervous sang something badly and sat down on a crimson throne the maiden who had been first in white and then in light blue now wore only a smock and stood beside the throne with her hair down she sang something mournfully addressing the queen but the king waved his arm severely and men and women with bare legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together then the violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick bare legs and thin arms separating from the others went behind the wings adjusted her bodice returned to the middle of the stage and began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other in the stalls everyone clapped and shouted bravo then one of the men went into a corner of the stage the cymbals and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly and this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet about very rapidly he was duport who received sixty thousand rubles a year for this art everybody in the stalls boxes and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might and the man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides then other men and women danced with bare legs then the king again shouted to the sound of music and they all began singing but suddenly a storm came on chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the orchestra everyone ran off again dragging one of their number away and the curtain dropped once more there was a terrible noise and clatter among the audience and with rapturous faces everyone began shouting duport duport duport natasha no longer thought this strange she look about with pleasure smiling joyfully 
 duport delightful helene asked her 
 oh yes replied natasha

 the gamin should have his place in the classifications of india 
 the body of street arabs in paris almost constitutes a caste one might almost say 
 not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so 
 this word gamin was printed for the first time and reached popular speech through the literary tongue in 
 it is in a little work entitled claude gueux that this word made its appearance the horror was lively 
 the word passed into circulation 
 the elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for each other are very various 
 we have known and associated with one who was greatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall from the top of the tower of another because he had succeeded in making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the dome of the invalides had been temporarily deposited and had prigged some lead from them a third because he had seen a diligence tip over still another because he knew a soldier who came near putting out the eye of a citizen 
 this explains that famous exclamation of a parisian gamin a profound epiphonema which the vulgar herd laughs at without de dieu 
 what i do have to think that i have never yet seen anybody tumble from a window i have pronounced and fifth pronounced fift 
 surely this saying of a peasant is a fine one 
 father your wife has died of her malady why did you not send for the doctor what would you have sir we poor folks die of ourselves but if the whole passivity lies in this saying the whole of the anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is assuredly contained in this other saying 
 a man condemned to death is listening to his confessor in the tumbrel 
 the child of paris exclaims he is talking to his black cap 
 oh the sneak 
 a certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin to be is an important item 
 to be present at executions constitutes a duty 
 he shows himself at the guillotine and he laughs 
 he calls it by all sorts of pet names the end of the soup the growler the mother in the blue the sky the last mouthful etc etc 
 in order not to lose anything of the affair he scales the walls he hoists himself to balconies he ascends trees he suspends himself to gratings he clings fast to chimneys 
 the gamin is born a tiler as he is born a mariner a roof inspires him with no more fear than a mast 
 there is no festival which comes up to an execution on the place de greve samson and the abbe montes are the truly popular names 
 they hoot at the victim in order to encourage him 
 they sometimes admire him lacenaire when a gamin on seeing the hideous dautin die bravely uttered these words which contain a future 
 i was jealous of him in the brotherhood of gamins voltaire is not known but papavoine is politicians are confused with assassins in the same legend they have a tradition as to last garment 
 it is known that tolleron had a cap avril an otter cap losvel a round hat that old delaporte was bald and that castaing was all ruddy and very handsome that bories had a romantic small beard that jean martin kept on his suspenders that lecouffe and his mother quarrelled 
 reproach each other for your basket shouted a gamin to them 
 another in order to get a look at debacker as he passed and being too small in the crowd caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbed it 
 a gendarme stationed opposite frowned 
 let me climb up le gendarme said the gamin 
 and to soften the heart of the authorities he added i will not fall 
 i care if you do retorted the gendarme 
 in the brotherhood of gamins a memorable accident counts for a great deal 
 one reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cut self very deeply to the very bone 
 the fist is no mediocre element of respect 
 one of the things that the gamin is fondest of saying is 
 i am fine and strong come now 
 to be renders you very enviable 
 a squint is highly esteemed

 during the a whiff of cold air came into box the door opened and anatole entered stooping and trying not to brush against anyone 
 let me introduce my brother to you said helene her eyes shifting uneasily from natasha to anatole 
 natasha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer and smiled at him over her bare shoulder anatole who was as handsome at close quarters as at a distance sat down beside her and told her he had long wished to have this happiness ever since the naryshkins ball in fact at which he had had the pleasure of seeing her kuragin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men he talked boldly and naturally and natasha was strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much talk but that on the contrary his smile was most naive cheerful and 
 kuragin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a previous performance semenova had fallen down on the stage 
 and do you know countess he said suddenly addressing her as an old familiar acquaintance we are getting up a costume tournament you ought to take part in it it will be great fun we shall all meet at the karagins please come no really eh said he 
 while saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face her neck and her bare arms natasha knew for certain that he was enraptured by her this pleased her yet his presence made her feel constrained and oppressed when she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking at her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should look into hers rather than this but looking into his eyes she was frightened realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other men she did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to this man when she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck they spoke of most ordinary things yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man natasha kept turning to helene and to her father as if asking what it all meant but helene was engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer her look and her eyes said nothing but what they always said having a good time well glad of it 
 during one of these moments of awkward silence when prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her natasha to break the silence asked him how he liked moscow she asked the question and blushed she felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing something improper anatole smiled as though to encourage her 
 at first i did not like it much because what makes a town pleasant ce sont les jolies femmes that so but now i like it very much indeed he said looking at her significantly come to the costume tournament countess do come and putting out his hand to her bouquet and dropping his voice he added you will be the prettiest there do come dear countess and give me this flower as a pledge 
 are the pretty women 
 natasha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did himself but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper intention she did not know what to say and turned away as if she had not heard his remark but as soon as she had turned away she felt that he was there behind so close behind her 
 how is he now confused angry ought i to put it right she asked herself and she could not refrain from turning round she looked straight into his eyes and his nearness and the tenderness of his smile vanquished her she smiled just as he was doing gazing straight into his eyes and again she felt with horror that no barrier lay between him and her 
 the curtain rose again anatole left the box serene and gay natasha went back to her father in the other box now quite submissive to the world she found herself in all that was going on before her now seemed quite natural but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her betrothed of princess mary or of life in the country did not once recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past 
 in the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm about till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared down below that was the only part of the fourth act that natasha saw she felt agitated and tormented and the cause of this was kuragin whom she could not help watching as they were leaving the theater anatole came up to them called their carriage and helped them in as he was putting natasha in he pressed her arm above the elbow agitated and flushed she turned round he was looking at her with glittering eyes smiling tenderly 
 only after she had reached home was natasha able clearly to think over what had happened to her and suddenly remembering prince andrew she was horrified and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera she gave a loud exclamation flushed and ran out of the room 
 o god i am lost she said to herself how could i let him she sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize what had happened to her but was unable either to understand what had happened or what she felt everything seemed dark obscure and terrible there in that enormous illuminated theater where the duport in a jacket jumped about to the music on wet boards and young girls and old men and the nearly naked helene with her proud calm smile rapturously cried bravo there in the presence of that helene it had all seemed clear and simple but now alone by herself it was incomprehensible what is it what was that terror i felt of him what is this gnawing of conscience i am feeling now she thought 
 only to the old countess at night in bed could natasha have told all she was feeling she knew that sonya with her severe and simple views would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a confession so natasha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself 
 am i spoiled for love or not she asked herself and with soothing irony replied what a fool i am to ask that what did happen to me nothing i have done nothing i lead him on at all nobody will know and i shall never see him again she told herself so it is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of and andrew can love me still but why still o god why he here natasha quieted herself for a moment but again some instinct told her that though all this was true and though nothing had happened yet the former purity of her love for prince andrew had perished and again in imagination she went over her whole conversation with kuragin and again saw the face gestures and tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm

 chapter viii 
 
 in which the reader will find a charming saying of the last king 
 in summer he metamorphoses himself into a frog and in the evening when night is falling in front of the bridges of austerlitz and jena from the tops of coal wagons and the boats he hurls himself headlong into the seine and into all possible infractions of the laws of modesty and of the police 
 nevertheless the police keep an eye on him and the result is a highly dramatic situation which once gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry that cry which was celebrated about is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin it scans like a verse from homer with a notation as inexpressible as the eleusiac chant of the panathenaea and in it one encounters again the ancient evohe 
 here it is ohe titi oheee 
 here comes the bobby here comes the pick up your duds and be off through the sewer with you 
 sometimes this is what he calls how to read sometimes he knows how to write he always knows how to daub he does not hesitate to acquire by no one knows what mysterious mutual instruction all the talents which can be of use to the public from to he imitated the cry of the turkey from to he scrawled pears on the walls 
 one summer evening when louis philippe was returning home on foot he saw a little fellow no higher than his knee perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one of the pillars of the gate of neuilly the king with that which came to him from henry iv helped the gamin finished the pear and gave the child a louis saying 
 the pear is on that also the gamin loves uproar a certain state of violence pleases him 
 he execrates the cures one day in the rue de one of these scamps was putting his thumb to his nose at the carriage gate of no 
 why are you doing that at the gate a asked 
 the boy replied there is a cure there 
 it was there in fact that the papal nuncio lived 
 louis xviii 
 is represented in comic pictures of that day as having a head 
 nevertheless whatever may be the voltairianism of the small gamin if the occasion to become a chorister presents itself it is quite possible that he will accept and in that case he serves the mass civilly 
 there are two things to which he plays tantalus and which he always desires without ever attaining them to overthrow the government and to get his trousers sewed up again 
 the gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of paris and can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to meet 
 he can tell them off on the tips of his fingers he studies their habits and he has special notes on each one of them 
 he reads the souls of the police like an open book he will tell you fluently and without flinching 
 such an one is a traitor such another is very malicious such another is great such another is ridiculous 
 all these words traitor malicious great ridiculous have a particular meaning in his mouth that one imagines that he owns the and he prevents people from walking on the cornice outside the parapet that other has a mania for pulling ears etc etc

 anatole kuragin was staying in moscow because his father had sent him away from petersburg where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles a year in cash besides running up debts for as much more which his creditors demanded from his father 
 his father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the last time but only on condition that he went to moscow as adjutant to the commander in chief a post his father had procured for him and would at last try to make a good match there he indicated to him princess mary and julie karagina 
 anatole consented and went to moscow where he put up at house pierre received him unwillingly at first but got used to him after a while sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals and gave him money under the guise of loans 
 as shinshin had remarked from the time of his arrival anatole had turned the heads of the moscow ladies especially by the fact that he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and french actresses with the chief of whom mademoiselle george he was said to be on intimate relations he had never missed a carousal at or other moscow revelers drank whole nights through outvying everyone else and was at all the balls and parties of the best society there was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies and he flirted with a few of them at the balls but he did not run after the unmarried girls especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain there was a special reason for this as he had got married two years before a fact known only to his most intimate friends at that time while with his regiment in poland a polish landowner of small means had forced him to marry his daughter anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and for a payment which he agreed to send to his had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor 
 anatole was always content with his position with himself and with others he was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that was impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had never in his life done anything base he was incapable of considering how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or that action of his might be he was convinced that as a duck is so made that it must live in water so god had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in society he believed this so firmly that others looking at him were persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place in society or money which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay 
 he was not a gambler at any rate he did not care about winning he was not vain he did not mind what people thought of him still less could he be accused of ambition more than once he had vexed his father by spoiling his own career and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds he was not mean and did not refuse anyone who asked of him all he cared about was gaiety and women and as according to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in these tastes and he was incapable of considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others he honestly considered himself irreproachable sincerely despised rogues and bad people and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high 
 rakes those male magdalenes have a secret feeling of innocence similar to that which female magdalenes have based on the same hope of forgiveness all will be forgiven her for she loved much and all will be forgiven him for he enjoyed much 
 dolokhov who had reappeared that year in moscow after his exile and his persian adventures and was leading a life of luxury gambling and dissipation associated with his old petersburg comrade kuragin and made use of him for his own ends 
 anatole was sincerely fond of dolokhov for his cleverness and audacity dolokhov who needed anatole name position and connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set made use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it apart from the advantage he derived from anatole the very process of dominating will was in itself a pleasure a habit and a necessity to dolokhov 
 natasha had made a strong impression on kuragin at supper after the opera he described to dolokhov with the air of a connoisseur the attractions of her arms shoulders feet and hair and expressed his intention of making love to her anatole had no notion and was incapable of considering what might come of such as he never had any notion of the outcome of any of his actions 
 my dear fellow but not for us replied dolokhov 
 i will tell my sister to ask her to dinner said anatole eh 
 better wait till married 
 you know i adore little girls they lose their heads at once pursued anatole 
 you have been caught once already by a little girl said dolokhov who knew of marriage take care 
 well that happen twice eh said anatole with a laugh

 the old soul of gaul 
 there was something of that boy in poquelin the son of the beaumarchais had something of it 
 gaminerie is a shade of the gallic spirit 
 mingled with good sense it sometimes adds force to the latter as alcohol does to wine 
 sometimes it is a defect homer repeats himself eternally granted one may say that voltaire plays the gamin 
 camille desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs 
 championnet who treated miracles brutally rose from the pavements of paris he had when a small lad inundated the porticos of de beauvais and of du mont he had addressed the shrine of familiarly to give orders to the phial of saint januarius 
 the gamin of paris is respectful ironical and insolent 
 he has villainous teeth because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers and handsome eyes because he has wit 
 if jehovah himself were present he would go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot he is strong on boxing 
 all beliefs are possible to him he plays in the gutter and straightens himself up with a revolt his effrontery persists even in the presence of he was a scapegrace he is a hero like the little theban he shakes the skin from the lion barra the was a gamin of paris he shouts forward as the horse of scripture says vah and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to the giant 
 this child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal measure that spread of wings which reaches from moliere to barra 
 to sum up the whole and in one word the gamin is a being who amuses himself because he is unhappy

 the day after the opera the rostovs went nowhere and nobody came to see them marya dmitrievna talked to the count about something which they concealed from natasha natasha guessed they were talking about the old prince and planning something and this disquieted and offended her she was expecting prince andrew any moment and twice that day sent a manservant to the vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he had come he had not arrived she suffered more now than during her first days in moscow to her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant recollection of her interview with princess mary and the old prince and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause she continually fancied that either he would never come or that something would happen to her before he came she could no longer think of him by herself calmly and continuously as she had done before as soon as she began to think of him the recollection of the old prince of princess mary of the theater and of kuragin mingled with her thoughts the question again presented itself whether she was not guilty whether she had not already broken faith with prince andrew and again she found herself recalling to the minutest detail every word every gesture and every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling to the family natasha seemed livelier than usual but she was far less tranquil and happy than before 
 on sunday morning marya dmitrievna invited her visitors to mass at her parish church the church of the assumption built over the graves of victims of the plague 
 i like those fashionable churches she said evidently priding herself on her independence of thought god is the same every where we have an excellent priest he conducts the service decently and with dignity and the deacon is the same what holiness is there in giving concerts in the choir i like it just 
 marya dmitrievna liked sundays and knew how to keep them her whole house was scrubbed and cleaned on saturdays neither she nor the servants worked and they all wore holiday dress and went to church at her table there were extra dishes at dinner and the servants had vodka and roast goose or suckling pig but in nothing in the house was the holiday so noticeable as in marya broad stern face which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity 
 after mass when they had finished their coffee in the dining room where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture a servant announced that the carriage was ready and marya dmitrievna rose with a stern air she wore her holiday shawl in which she paid calls and announced that she was going to see prince nicholas bolkonski to have an explanation with him about natasha 
 after she had gone a dressmaker from madame waited on the rostovs and natasha very glad of this diversion having shut herself into a room adjoining the drawing room occupied herself trying on the new dresses just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and only tacked together and was turning her head to see in the glass how the back fitted she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of her voice and a that made her flush it was helene natasha had not time to take off the bodice before the door opened and countess bezukhova dressed in a purple velvet gown with a high collar came into the room beaming with amiable smiles 
 oh my enchantress she cried to the blushing natasha charming no this is really beyond anything my dear count said she to count rostov who had followed her in how can you live in moscow and go nowhere no i let you off mademoiselle george will recite at my house tonight and be some people and if you bring your lovely girls who are prettier than mademoiselle george i know you my husband is away in tver or i would send him to fetch you you must come you positively must between eight and nine 
 she nodded to the dressmaker whom she knew and who had curtsied respectfully to her and seated herself in an armchair beside the looking glass draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely she did not cease chattering and gaily continually praising beauty she looked at dresses and praised them as well as a new dress of her own made of metallic gauze which she had received from paris and advised natasha to have one like it 
 but anything suits you my charmer she remarked 
 a smile of pleasure never left face she felt happy and as if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear countess bezukhova who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was now so kind to her natasha brightened up and felt almost in love with this woman who was so beautiful and so kind helene for her part was sincerely delighted with natasha and wished to give her a good time anatole had asked her to bring him and natasha together and she was calling on the rostovs for that purpose the idea of throwing her brother and natasha together amused her 
 though at one time in petersburg she had been annoyed with natasha for drawing boris away she did not think of that now and in her own way heartily wished natasha well as she was leaving the rostovs she called her protegee aside 
 my brother dined with me yesterday we nearly died of laughter he ate nothing and kept sighing for you my charmer he is madly quite madly in love with you my dear 
 natasha blushed scarlet when she heard this 
 how she blushes how she blushes my pretty said helene you must certainly come if you love somebody my charmer that is not a reason to shut yourself up even if you are engaged i am sure your fiance would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to death 
 so she knows i am engaged and she and her husband pierre that good pierre have talked and laughed about this so all right and again under influence what had seemed terrible now seemed simple and natural and she is such a grande dame so kind and evidently likes me so much and why not enjoy myself thought natasha gazing at helene with wondering eyes 
 marya dmitrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious having evidently suffered a defeat at the old she was still too agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly in answer to the inquiries she replied that things were all right and that she would tell about it next day on hearing of countess visit and the invitation for that evening marya dmitrievna remarked 
 i care to have anything to do with bezukhova and advise you to however if promised go it will divert your thoughts she added addressing natasha

 ecce paris ecce homo 
 to sum it all up once more the paris gamin of like the graeculus of rome in days gone by is the infant populace with the wrinkle of the old world on his brow 
 the gamin is a grace to the nation and at the same time a disease a disease which must be cured how 
 by light 
 light renders healthy 
 light kindles 
 all generous social irradiations spring from science letters arts education 
 make men make men 
 give them light that they may warm you sooner or later the splendid question of universal education will present itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth and then those who govern under the superintendence of the french idea will have to make this choice the children of france or the gamins of paris flames in the light or in the gloom 
 the gamin expresses paris and paris expresses the world 
 for paris is a total 
 paris is the ceiling of the human race the whole of this prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and living manners 
 he who sees paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history with heaven and constellations in the intervals 
 paris has a capital the a parthenon a mount aventine the faubourg an asinarium the sorbonne a pantheon the pantheon a via sacra the boulevard des italiens a temple of the winds opinion and it replaces the gemoniae by ridicule its majo is called faraud its transteverin is the man of the faubourgs its hammal is the its lazzarone is the pegre its cockney is the native of ghent 
 everything that exists elsewhere exists at paris

 seek something that paris has not 
 the vat of trophonius contains nothing that is not in tub ergaphilas lives again in cagliostro the brahmin vasaphanta become incarnate in the comte de the cemetery of works quite as good miracles as the mosque of oumoumie at damascus 
 paris has an and a canidia mademoiselle lenormand it is terrified like delphos at the fulgurating realities of the vision it makes tables turn as dodona did tripods 
 it places the grisette on the throne as rome placed the courtesan there and taking it altogether if louis xv 
 is worse than claudian madame dubarry is better than messalina 
 paris combines in an unprecedented type which has existed and which we have elbowed grecian nudity the hebraic ulcer and the gascon pun it mingles diogenes job and dresses up a spectre in old numbers of the constitutional and makes chodruc duclos 
 although plutarch says 
 the tyrant never grows old rome under sylla as under domitian resigned itself and willingly put water in its wine 
 the tiber was a lethe if the rather doctrinary eulogium made of it by varus vibiscus is to be credited 
 contra gracchos tiberim habemus bibere tiberim id est seditionem oblivisci paris drinks a million litres of water a day but that does not prevent it from occasionally beating the general alarm and ringing the tocsin 
 with that exception paris is amiable 
 it accepts everything royally it is not too particular about its venus its callipyge is hottentot provided that it is made to laugh it condones ugliness cheers it deformity provokes it to laughter vice diverts it be eccentric and you may be an eccentric even hypocrisy that supreme cynicism does not disgust it it is so literary that it does not hold its nose before basile and is no more scandalized by the prayer of tartuffe than horace was repelled by the hiccup of priapus no trait of the universal face is lacking in the profile of paris the bal mabile is not the polymnia dance of the janiculum but the dealer in ladies wearing apparel there devours the lorette with her eyes exactly as the procuress staphyla lay in wait for the virgin planesium 
 the barriere du combat is not the coliseum but people are as ferocious there as though caesar were looking on the syrian hostess has more grace than mother saguet but if virgil haunted the roman david balzac and charlet have sat at the tables of parisian taverns 
 paris reigns geniuses flash forth there the red tails prosper there adonai passes on his chariot with its twelve wheels of thunder and lightning silenus makes his entry there on his ass 
 for silenus read ramponneau 
 paris is the synonym of cosmos paris is athens sybaris jerusalem pantin 
 all civilizations are there in an abridged form all barbarisms also 
 paris would greatly regret it if it had not a guillotine 
 a little of the place de greve is a good thing 
 what would all that eternal festival be without this seasoning 
 our laws are wisely provided and thanks to them this blade drips on this shrove tuesday

 count rostov took the girls to countess there were a good many people there but nearly all strangers to natasha count rostov was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct mademoiselle george was standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young men there were several frenchmen present among them metivier who from the time helene reached moscow had been an intimate in her house the count decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight and to get away as soon as mademoiselle performance was over 
 anatole was at the door evidently on the lookout for the rostovs immediately after greeting the count he went up to natasha and followed her as soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had had at the opera gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at the absence of a moral barrier between them 
 helene welcomed natasha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her beauty and her dress soon after their arrival mademoiselle george went out of the room to change her costume in the drawing room people began arranging the chairs and taking their seats anatole moved a chair for natasha and was about to sit down beside her but the count who never lost sight of her took the seat himself anatole sat down behind her 
 mademoiselle george with her bare fat dimpled arms and a red shawl draped over one shoulder came into the space left vacant for her and assumed an unnatural pose enthusiastic whispering was audible 
 mademoiselle george looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and began reciting some french verses describing her guilty love for her son in some places she raised her voice in others she whispered lifting her head triumphantly sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse sounds rolling her eyes 
 adorable divine delicious was heard from every side 
 natasha looked at the fat actress but neither saw nor heard nor understood anything of what went on before her she only felt herself again completely borne away into this strange senseless world so remote from her old world a world in which it was impossible to know what was good or bad reasonable or senseless behind her sat anatole and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of expectancy 
 after the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded mademoiselle george expressing their enthusiasm 
 how beautiful she is natasha remarked to her father who had also risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress 
 i think so when i look at you said anatole following natasha he said this at a moment when she alone could hear him you are enchanting from the moment i saw you i have never ceased 
 come come natasha said the count as he turned back for his daughter how beautiful she is natasha without saying anything stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring eyes 
 after giving several recitations mademoiselle george left and countess bezukhova asked her visitors into the ballroom 
 the count wished to go home but helene entreated him not to spoil her improvised ball and the rostovs stayed on anatole asked natasha for a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her she was bewitching and that he loved her during the ecossaise which she also danced with him anatole said nothing when they happened to be by themselves but merely gazed at her natasha lifted her frightened eyes to him but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate look and smile that she could not whilst looking at him say what she had to say she lowered her eyes 
 say such things to me i am betrothed and love another she said rapidly she glanced at him 
 anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said 
 speak to me of that what can i do said he i tell you i am madly madly in love with you is it my fault that you are enchanting our turn to begin 
 natasha animated and excited looked about her with frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual she understood hardly anything that went on that evening they danced the ecossaise and the grossvater her father asked her to come home but she begged to remain wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to she felt his eyes upon her later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress that helene had followed her and spoken laughingly of her love and that she again met anatole in the little sitting room helene had disappeared leaving them alone and anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice 
 i cannot come to visit you but is it possible that i shall never see you i love you madly can i never and blocking her path he brought his face close to hers 
 his large glittering masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw nothing but them 
 natalie he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being painfully pressed natalie 
 i understand i have nothing to say her eyes replied 
 burning lips were pressed to hers and at the same instant she felt herself released and footsteps and the rustle of her dress were heard in the room natasha looked round at her and then red and trembling threw a frightened look of inquiry at anatole and moved toward the door 
 one word just one for sake cried anatole 
 she paused she so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what had happened and to which she could find no answer 
 natalie just a word only one he kept repeating evidently not knowing what to say and he repeated it till helene came up to them 
 helene returned with natasha to the drawing room the rostovs went away without staying for supper 
 after reaching home natasha did not sleep all night she was tormented by the insoluble question whether she loved anatole or prince andrew she loved prince andrew she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved him but she also loved anatole of that there was no doubt else how could all this have happened thought she if after that i could return his smile when saying if i was able to let it come to that it means that i loved him from the first it means that he is kind noble and splendid and i could not help loving him what am i to do if i love him and the other one too she asked herself unable to find an answer to these terrible questions

 to scoff to reign 
 there is no limit to paris 
 no city has had that domination which sometimes derides those whom it subjugates 
 to please you o athenians exclaimed alexander 
 paris makes more than the law it makes the fashion paris sets more than the fashion it sets the routine 
 paris may be stupid if it sees fit it sometimes allows itself this luxury then the universe is stupid in company with it then paris awakes rubs its eyes says 
 how stupid i am and bursts out laughing in the face of the human race what a marvel is such a city it is a strange thing that this grandioseness and this burlesque should be amicable neighbors that all this majesty should not be thrown into disorder by all this parody and that the same mouth can blow into the trump of the judgment day and into the paris has a sovereign joviality 
 its gayety is of the thunder and its farce holds a sceptre 
 its tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace

 such is paris 
 the smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe a heap of mud and stone if you will but above all a moral being it is more than great it is immense 
 why 
 because it is daring 
 to dare that is the price of progress 
 all sublime conquests are more or less the prizes of daring in order that the revolution should take place it does not suffice that montesquieu should foresee it that diderot should preach it that beaumarchais should announce it that condorcet should calculate it that arouet should prepare it that rousseau should premeditate it it is necessary that danton should dare it 
 the cry 
 audacity is a fiat lux 
 it is necessary for the sake of the forward march of the human race that there should be proud lessons of courage permanently on the heights 
 daring deeds dazzle history and are one of great sources of light the dawn dares when it rises 
 to attempt to brave to persist to persevere to be faithful to self to grasp fate bodily to astound catastrophe by the small amount of fear that it occasions us now to affront unjust power again to insult drunken victory to hold position to stand ground that is the example which nations need that is the light which electrifies them the same formidable lightning proceeds from the torch of prometheus to short pipe

 book eight 
 chapter xiv 
 
 morning came with its cares and bustle everyone got up and began to move about and talk dressmakers came again marya dmitrievna appeared and they were called to breakfast natasha kept looking uneasily at everybody with eyes as if wishing to intercept every glance directed toward her and tried to appear the same as usual 
 after breakfast which was her best time marya dmitrievna sat down in her armchair and called natasha and the count to her 
 well friends i have now thought the whole matter over and this is my advice she began yesterday as you know i went to see prince bolkonski well i had a talk with him he took it into his head to begin shouting but i am not one to be shouted down i said what i had to say 
 well and he asked the count 
 he crazy he did not want to listen but the use of talking as it is we have worn the poor girl out said marya dmitrievna my advice to you is finish your business and go back home to otradnoe and wait there 
 oh no exclaimed natasha 
 yes go back said marya dmitrievna and wait there if your betrothed comes here now there will be no avoiding a quarrel but alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you 
 count rostov approved of this suggestion appreciating its reasonableness if the old man came round it would be all the better to visit him in moscow or at bald hills later on and if not the wedding against his wishes could only be arranged at otradnoe 
 that is perfectly true and i am sorry i went to see him and took her said the old count 
 no why be sorry being here you had to pay your respects but if he his affair said marya dmitrievna looking for something in her reticule besides the trousseau is ready so there is nothing to wait for and what is not ready send after you though i like letting you go it is the best way so go with blessing 
 having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to natasha it was a letter from princess mary 
 she has written to you how she torments herself poor thing afraid you might think that she does not like you 
 but she like me said natasha 
 talk nonsense cried marya dmitrievna 
 i believe anyone i know she like me replied natasha boldly as she took the letter and her face expressed a cold and angry resolution that caused marya dmitrievna to look at her more intently and to frown 
 answer like that my good girl she said what i say is true write an answer natasha did not reply and went to her own room to read princess letter 
 princess mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that had occurred between them whatever her feelings might be she begged natasha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one chosen by her brother for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice everything 
 do not think however she wrote that my father is toward you he is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy princess mary went on to ask natasha to fix a time when she could see her again 
 after reading the letter natasha sat down at the writing table to answer it dear princess she wrote in french quickly and mechanically and then paused what more could she write after all that had happened the evening before yes yes all that has happened and now all is changed she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her must i break off with him must i really awful and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to sonya and began sorting patterns with her 
 after dinner natasha went to her room and again took up princess letter can it be that it is all over she thought can it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before she recalled her love for prince andrew in all its former strength and at the same time felt that she loved kuragin she vividly pictured herself as prince wife and the scenes of happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination and at the same time aglow with excitement recalled every detail of interview with anatole 
 why could that not be as well she sometimes asked herself in complete bewilderment only so could i be completely happy but now i have to choose and i be happy without either of them only she thought to tell prince andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both equally impossible but with that one nothing is spoiled but am i really to abandon forever the joy of prince love in which i have lived so long 
 please miss whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious air a man told me to give you this and she handed natasha a letter 
 only for sake the girl went on as natasha without thinking mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from anatole of which without taking in a word she understood only that it was a letter from him from the man she loved yes she loved him or else how could that have happened which had happened and how could she have a love letter from him in her hand 
 with trembling hands natasha held that passionate love letter which dolokhov had composed for anatole and as she read it she found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling 
 since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed to be loved by you or to die there is no other way for me the letter began then he went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him for this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her but that if she loved him she need only say the word yes and no human power could hinder their bliss love would conquer all he would steal her away and carry her off to the ends of the earth 
 yes yes i love him thought natasha reading the letter for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of it 
 that evening marya dmitrievna was going to the akharovs and proposed to take the girls with her natasha pleading a headache remained at home

 of seditions troubles 
 shepherds of people had need know the calendars of tempests in state which are commonly greatest when things grow to equality as natural tempests are greatest about the equinoxes and as there are certain hollow blasts of wind and secret swellings of seas before a tempest so are there in states ille etiam caecos instare tumultus sa epe et operta tumescere bella libels and licentious discourses against the state when they are frequent and open and in like sort false news often running up and down to the disadvantage of the 
 state and hastily embraced are amongst the signs of troubles virgil giving the 
 pedigree of fame saith she was sister to the giants 
 illam terra parens ira irritata deorun progenuit as if fame were the relics of seditions past but they are no less indeed the preludes of seditions to come howsoever he noteth it right that seditious tumults and seditious fame differ no more but as brother and sister masculine and feminine especially if it come to that that the best actions of a state and the most plausible and which ought to give greatest contentment are taken in ill sense and traduced for that shows the envy great as tacitus saith conflata magnia invidia seu bene seu male gesta premunt neither doth it follow that because these fames are a sign of troubles that the suppressing of them with too much severity should be a remedy 
 of troubles 
 for the despising of them many times checks them best and the going 
 about to stop them doth but make a wonder also that kind of obedience which tacitus speaketh of is to be held suspected erant in cfficio sed tamen qvi mallent mandata imperantium interpretari quam exseqid disputing excusing calling upon mandates and directions is a kind of shaking off the yoke and assay of disobedience especially if in those disputings they which are for the direction speak fearfully and tenderly and those that are against it audaciously 
 also as machiavelli noteth well when princes that ought to be common parents make themselves as a party and lean to a side it is as a boat that is overthrown by uneven weight on the one side as was well seen in the time of henry the third of france for first himself entered league for the extirpation of the protestants and presently after the same league was turned upon himself for when the authority of princes is made but an accessory to a cause and that there be other bands that tie faster than the band of sovereignty kings begin to be put almost out of possession 
 also when discords and quarrels and factions are carried openly and audaciously it is a sign the reverence of government is lost for the motions of the greatest persons in a government ought to be as the motions of the planets under primum mobile according to the old opinion which is that every of them is carried swiftly by the highest motion and softly in their own motion 
 and therefore when great ones in their own particular motion move violently and as tacitus expressed it well liberals quam ut imperantium meminissent it is a sign the orbs are out of frame 
 for reverence is that wherewith princes are girt from god who threatneth the 
 dissolving thereof solvam cingula regum 
 so when any of the four pillars of government are mainly shaken or weakened which are religion justice counsel and treasure men had need to pray for fair weather but let us pass from this part of predictions concerning which nevertheless more light may be taken from that which followeth and let us speak first of the materials of seditions then of the motives of them and thirdly of the remedies 
 concerning the materials of seditions it is a thing well to be considered for the 
 surest way to prevent seditions if the times do bear it is to take away the matter of them for if there be fuel prepared it is hard to tell whence the spark shall come that shall set it on fire the matter of seditions is of two kinds much poverty and much discontentment it is certain so many overthrown estates so many votes for troubles lucan noteth well the state of rome before the civil war 
 hinc usura vorax rapidumque in tempore foenus hinc concussa fides et multis utile bellum this same mutes utile bellurn is an assured and infallible sign of a state disposed to seditions and troubles and if this poverty and broken estate in the better sort be joined with a want and necessity in the mean people the danger is imminent and great for the rebellions of the belly are the worst as for discontentments they are in the politic body like to humours in the natural which are apt to gather a preternatural heat and to inflame and let no prince measure the danger of them by this whether they be just or unjust for that were to imagine people to be too reasonable who do often spurn at their own good nor yet by this whether me griefs whereupon they rise be in fact great or small for they are the most dangerous discontentments where the fear is greater than the feeling dolendi modus timendi non item besides in great oppressions the same things that provoke the patience do withal mate the courage but in fears it is not so neither let any prince or state be secure concerning discontentments because they have been often or have been long and yet no peril hath ensued for as it is true that every vapour or fume 
 doth not turn into a storm so it is nevertheless true that storms though they 
 blow over divers times yet may fall at last and as me spanish proverb noteth well 
 
 the cord hreaketh at the last by me weakest pull 
 the causes and motives of seditions are innovation in religion 
 taxes alteration of laws and customs breaking of privileges general oppression 
 advancement of unworthy persons strangers dearths disbanded soldiers factions grown desperate and whatsoever in offending people joined and knitteth them in a common cause 
 
 for the remedies there may be some general preservatives whereof we will speak as for the just cure it must answer to the particular disease and so be left to counsel rather than rule 
 
 the first remedy or prevention is to remove by all means possible that material 
 cause of sedition whereof we spoke which is want and poverty in the estate 
 to which purpose serveth the opening and well balancing of trade the cherishing of manufactures me banishing of idleness the repressing of waste and excess by sumptuary laws the improvement and husbanding of the soil the regulating of prices of things vendible the moderating of taxes and tributes and the like 
 generally it is to be foreseen that the population of a kingdom especially if it be not mown down by wars do not exceed the stock of the kingdom which should maintain them neither is the population to be reckoned only by number for a smaller number that spend more and earn less do wear out an estate sooner than a greater number that live lower and gather more therefore the multiplying of nobility and other degrees of quality in an over proportion to the common people doth speedily bring a state to necessity and so doth likewise an overgrown clergy for they bring nothing to the stock and in like manner when more are bred scholars than preferments can take off it is likewise to be remembered that for as much as the increase of any estate must be upon the foreigner for whatsoever is somewhere gotten is somewhere lost there 
 be but three things which one nation selleth unto another the commodity nature 
 yieldeth it the manufacture and the vecture or carriage 
 so that if these three wheels go wealth will flow as in a spring tide and it cometh many times to pass that materiam superabit opus that the work and carriage is more worth than the material and enricheth a state more as is notably seen in the low countrymen who have the best mines above ground in the world 
 above all things good policy is to be used that the treasure and moneys in a state be not gathered into few hands for otherwise a state may have a great stock and yet starve and money is like muck not good except it be spread this is done chiefly by suppressing or at the least keeping a strait hand upon the devouring trades of usury engrossing great pasturages and the like 
 for removing discontentments or at least the danger of them there is in every state as we know two portions of subjects the noblesse and the commonality 
 when one of these is discontent the danger is not great for common 
 people are of slow motion if they be not excited by the greater sort and the greater sort are of small strength except the multitude be apt and ready to move of themselves 
 
 then is the danger when the greater sort do but wait for the troubling of the waters amongst the meaner that then they may declare themselves the poets feign that the rest of the gods would have bound jupiter which he hearing of by the counsel of pallas sent for briareus with his hundred hands to come in to his aid an emblem no doubt to show how safe it is for monarchs to make sure of the good will of common people 
 
 to give moderate liberty for griefs and discontentments to evaporate so it be without too great insolency or bravery is a safe way for he that turneth the humours back and maketh the wound bleed inwards endangereth malign ulcers and pernicious impostumations 
 
 the part of epimetheus mought well become prometheus in the case of discontentments for mere is not a better provision against them epimetheus when griefs and evils flew abroad at last shut the lid and kept hope in the bottom of the vessel certainly the politic and artificial nourishing and entertaining of hopes and carrying men from hopes to hopes is one of the best antidotes against me poison of discontentments and it is a certain sign of a wise government and proceeding when it can hold hearts by hopes when it cannot by satisfaction and when it can handle things in such manner as no evil shall appear so peremptory but that it hath some outlet of hope which is me less hard to do because both particular persons and factions are apt 
 enough to flatter themselves or at least to brave that which they believe not 
 
 also the foresight and prevention that there be no likely or fit head whereunto 
 discontented persons may resort and under whom they may join is a known but an excellent point of caution i understand a fit head to be one that hath greatness and reputation that hath confidence with the discontented party and upon whom they turn their eyes and that is thought discontented in his own particular which kind of persons are either to be won and reconciled to the state and that in a fast and true manner or to be fronted with some other of the same party that may oppose them and so divide the reputation 
 generally the dividing and breaking of all factions and combinations that are adverse to the state and setting them at distance or at least distrust amongst themselves is not one of the worst remedies for it is a desperate case if those that hold with the proceeding of the state be full of discord and faction and those that are against it be entire and united i have noted that some witty and sharp speeches which have fallen from princes have given fire to seditions caesar did himself infinite hurt in that speech sulla nescivit literas non potuit dictare for it did utterly cut off that hope which men had entertained that he would at one time or other give over his dictatorship galba undid himself by that speech legi a se militem non am for it put the soldiers out of hope of the donative probus likewise by that speech si vixero non opus erit amplius romanio imperio militibus a speech of great despair for the soldiers 
 and many the like surely princes had need in tender matters and ticklish times 
 to beware what they say especially in these short speeches which flee abroad like darts and are thought to be shot out of their secret intentions 
 for as for large discourses they are flat things and not so much noted 
 lastly let princes against all events not be without some great person one or 
 rather more of military valour near unto them for the repressing of seditions in 
 their beginnings 
 for without that there useth to be more trepidation in court upon the first breaking out of troubles than were fit and the state runneth the danger 
 of that which tacitus saith atque is habitus animorum fuit ut pessimum facinus 
 auderent pauci plures vellent crimes paterentur but let such military persons be 
 assured and well reputed of rather then factious and popular holding also good correspondence with the other great men in the state or else the remedy is worse than the disease

 book just man 
 chapter xiv 
 
 what he thought 
 one last word 
 since this sort of details might particularly at the present moment and to use an expression now in fashion give to the bishop of d a certain pantheistical physiognomy and induce the belief either to his credit or discredit that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion we insist upon it that not one of those persons who knew monseigneur welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort that which enlightened this man was his heart 
 his wisdom was made of the light which comes from there 
 no systems many works 
 abstruse speculations contain vertigo no there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses the apostle may be daring but the bishop must be timid 
 he would probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are in a manner reserved for terrible great minds there is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma those gloomy openings stand yawning there but something tells you you a in life that you must not enter woe to him who penetrates thither 
 geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation situated so to speak above all dogmas propose their ideas to god 
 their prayer audaciously offers discussion their adoration interrogates 
 this is direct religion which is full of anxiety and responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs 
 human meditation has no limits 
 at his own risk and peril it analyzes and digs deep into its own bedazzlement 
 one might almost say that by a sort of splendid reaction it with it dazzles nature the mysterious world which surrounds us renders back what it has received it is probable that the contemplators are contemplated 
 however that may be there are on earth men they men perceive distinctly at the verge of the horizons of revery the heights of the absolute and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain 
 monseigneur welcome was one of these men monseigneur welcome was not a genius 
 he would have feared those sublimities whence some very great men even like swedenborg and pascal have slipped into insanity 
 certainly these powerful reveries have their moral utility and by these arduous paths one approaches to ideal perfection 
 as for him he took the path which shortens the 
 he did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of mantle he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events he did not see to condense in flame the light of things he had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him this humble soul loved and that was all 
 that he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is probable 
 but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts saint theresa and saint jerome would be heretics 
 he inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates the universe appeared to him like an immense malady everywhere he felt fever everywhere he heard the sound of suffering and without seeking to solve the enigma he strove to dress the wound the terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him he was occupied only in finding for himself and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve 
 that which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation 
 there are men who toil at extracting gold he toiled at the extraction of pity 
 universal misery was his mine 
 the sadness which reigned everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness 
 love each other he declared this to be complete desired nothing further and that was the whole of his doctrine 
 one day that man who believed himself to be a philosopher the senator who has already been alluded to said to the bishop 
 just survey the spectacle of the world all war against all the strongest has the most wit 
 your love each other is replied monseigneur welcome without contesting the point if it is nonsense the soul should shut itself up in it as the pearl in the oyster 
 thus he shut himself up he lived there he was absolutely satisfied with it leaving on one side the prodigious questions which attract and terrify the fathomless perspectives of abstraction the precipices of those profundities which converge for the apostle in god for the atheist in nothingness destiny good and evil the way of being against being the conscience of man the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal the transformation in death the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains the incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent i the essence the substance the nile and the ens the soul nature liberty necessity perpendicular problems sinister obscurities where lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind formidable abysses which lucretius manou saint paul dante contemplate with eyes flashing lightning which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze forth there 
 monseigneur bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of mysterious questions without scrutinizing them and without troubling his own mind with them and who cherished in his own soul a grave respect for darkness

 reaching the last of the journalists ann turns and walks slowly up the steps the press gathering applauds her warmly as she reaches the top her back to them slowly she turns to face them smiling broadly to the the gathering as she looks over them inevitably her eyes fall to joe he smiles back then her expression grows sorrowful she manages another slight smile then turns away from them and walks slowly and gracefully towards the exit the officials step aside for her to pass and then file after her through the door 
 as she leaves joe watches her solemnly the press turning to leave also before turning to go himself irving looks to joe but seeing his gaze unmoved walks away with the rest of them

 the empire strikes back 
 i 
 
 now this is what i call cold luke voice broke the silence he hadobserved since leaving the newly established rebel base hours earlier he wasastride a tauntaun the only other living being as far as the eye could see he felttired and alone and the sound of his own voice startled him 
 luke as well as his fellow members of the rebel alliance took turns exploringthe white wastelands of hoth gathering information about their new home they allreturned to base with mixed feelings of comfort and loneliness there was nothingto contradict their earliest findings that no intelligent lifeforms existed on this coldplanet all that luke had seen on his solitary expeditions were barren white plainsand ranges of mountains that seemed to vanish in the mists of the distanthorizons 
 luke smiled behind the masklike gray bandana that protected him against winds peering out at the icy wastes through his goggles he pulled cap down more snugly about his head 
 one corner of his mouth curled upward as he tried to visualize the officialresearchers in the service of the imperial government the galaxy is peppered withsettlements of colonizers who care little about the affairs of the empire or itsopposition the rebel alliance he thought but a settler would have to be crazy tostake his claims on hoth this planet have a thing to offer anyone exceptus 
 the rebel alliance had established an outpost on the ice world little more than amonth before luke was on the base and although barely old he was addressed as commander skywalker by other rebel warriors thetitle made him feel a bit uncomfortable nonetheless he was already in the positionof giving orders to a band of seasoned soldiers so much had happened to luke andhe had changed a great deal luke himself found it hard to believe that only threeyears ago he was a farm boy on his home world of tatooine 
 the youthful commander spurred his tauntaun come on girl he urged 
 the gray body was insulated from the cold by a covering of thickfur it galloped on muscular hind legs its tridact feet terminating in large hookedclaws that dug up great plumes of snow the lamalike head thrustforward and its serpentine tail coiled out behind as the beast ran up the ice horned head turned from side to side buffeting the winds that assaulted itshaggy muzzle 
 luke wished his mission were finished his body felt nearly frozen in spite ofhis heavily padded clothing but he knew that it was his choice to bethere he had volunteered to ride across the ice fields looking for other lifeforms heshivered as he looked at the long shadow he and the beast cast on the snow thewinds are picking up he thought and these chilling winds bring unendurabletemperatures to the plains after nightfall he was tempted to return to the base alittle early but he knew the importance of establishing the certainty that the rebelswere alone on hoth 
 the tauntaun quickly turned to the right almost throwing luke was still getting used to riding the unpredictable creatures no offense he saidto his mount but feel a lot more at ease in the cockpit of my old reliablelandspeeder but for this mission a its themost efficient and practical form of transportation available on hoth 
 when the beast reached the top of another ice slope luke brought the animal tohalt he pulled off his goggles and squinted for a few moments justlong enough for his eyes to adjust to the blinding glare of the snow 
 suddenly his attention was diverted by the appearance of an object streakingacross the sky leaving behind a lingering trail of smoke as it dipped toward the mistyhorizon luke flashed his gloved hand to his utility belt and clutched his pair ofelectrobinoculars apprehensive he felt a chill that competed with the coldness ofthe hoth atmosphere what he had seen could have been manmade perhaps evensomething launched by the empire the young commander still focused on theobject followed its fiery course and watched intently as it crashed on the whiteground and was consumed in its own explosive brilliance 
 at the sound of the explosion tauntaun shuddered a fearful growlescaped its muzzle and it began to claw nervously at the snow luke patted head trying to reassure the beast he found it difficult to hear himself overthe blustering wind easy girl just another meteorite he shouted theanimal calmed and luke brought the communicator to his mouth echo three toecho seven han ol buddy do you read me 
 static crackled from the receiver then a familiar voice cut through theinterference is that you kid up 
 the voice sounded a little older and somewhat sharper than for amoment luke fondly recalled first meeting the corellian space smuggler in that cantina at a spaceport on tatooine and now he was one of friends who was not an official member of the rebel alliance 
 finished my circle and i picked up any life readings luke spokeinto his comlink pressing his mouth close to the transmitter 
 there enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser han to make his voice heard above the whistling winds my sentry markers areplaced heading back to base 
 see you shortly luke replied he still had his eye on the twisting column ofdark smoke rising from a black spot in the distance a meteorite just hit the groundnear here and i want to check it out i be long 
 clicking off his comlink luke turned his attention to his tauntaun thereptilian creature was pacing shifting its weight from one foot to the other it gaveout a roar that seemed to signal fear 
 whoa girl he said patting the head the matteryousmell something nothing out there 
 but luke too was beginning to feel uneasy for the first time since he had setout from the hidden rebel base if he knew anything about these itwas that their senses were keen without question the animal was trying to tell lukethat something some danger was near 
 not wasting a moment luke removed a small object from his utility belt andadjusted its miniature controls the device was sensitive enough to zero in on eventhe most minute life readings by detecting body temperature and internal life as luke began to scan the readings he realized there was no 
 a shadow crossed over him towering above by a good meter and a half lukespun around and suddenly it seemed as if the terrain itself had come to life a bulk perfectly camouflaged against the sprawling mounds of savagely at him 
 son of a jumpin 
 hand blaster never cleared its holster the huge claw of the wampa icecreature struck him hard and flat against his face knocking him off the tauntaun andinto the freezing snow 
 unconsciousness came swiftly to luke so swiftly that he never even heard thepitiful screams of the tauntaun nor the abrupt silence following the sound of asnapping neck and he never felt his own ankle savagely gripped by his giant hairyattacker or felt his body dragged like a lifeless doll across the plain 
 black smoke was still rising from the depression in the hillside where thing had fallen the smoky clouds had thinned considerably since theobject had crashed to the ground and formed a smoldering crater the dark fumesbeing dispersed over the plains by the icy hoth winds 
 something stirred within the crater 
 first there was only a sound a droning mechanical sound swelling in intensity asif to compete with the howling wind then the thing that glintedin the bright afternoon light as it slowly began to ride from the crater 
 the object appeared to be some form of alien organic life its head a horror its blister eyes training their cold gaze across the evencolder reaches of wilderness but as the thing rose higher from the crater its formshowed it clearly to be a machine of some sort a circular head and equipped withcameras sensors and metal appendages some of which terminated in crablikegrasping pincers 
 the machine hovered over the smoking crater and extended its appendages invarious directions then a signal was set off within its internal mechanical the machine began to float across the icy plain 
 the dark probe droid soon vanished over the distant horizon 
 another rider bundled in winter clothing and mounted on a spotted graytauntaun raced across the slopes of hoth toward the rebel base of operations 
 the eyes like points of cold metal glanced without interest at the domesof dull gray the myriad gun turrets and the colossal power generators that were theonly indications of civilized life on this world han solo gradually slowed guiding the reins so the creature trotted through the entrance of theenormous ice cave 
 han welcomed the relative warmth of the vast complex of caverns warmed byrebel heating units that obtained their power from the huge generators outside thissubterranean base was both a natural ice cave and a maze of angular tunnels blastedfrom a solid mountain of ice by rebel lasers the corellian had been in moredesolate in the galaxy but for the moment he remember the exactlocation of any one of them 
 he dismounted his tauntaun then glanced around to watch the activity takingplace inside the mammoth cave wherever he looked he saw things being or repaired rebels in gray uniforms rushed to unload supplies andadjust equipment and there were robots mostly r units and power droids thatseemed to be everywhere rolling or walking through the ice corridors efficientlyperforming their innumerable tasks 
 han was beginning to wonder if he were mellowing with age at first he hadhad no personal interest in or loyalty to this whole rebel affair his ultimateinvolvement in the conflict between empire and rebel alliance began as a merebusiness transaction selling his services and use of his ship the millennium job had seemed simple enough just pilot ben kenobi plus young luke andtwo droids to the alderaan system how could han have known at the time that hewould also be called on to rescue a princess from the most feared battlestation the death star 
 princess leia organa 
 the more solo thought about her the more he realized how much trouble heeventually bought himself by accepting ben money all han had wantedoriginally was to collect his fee and rocket off to pay back some bad debts that hungover his head like a meteor ready to fall never had he intended to become a hero 
 and yet something had kept him around to join luke and his crazy rebelfriends as they launched the space attack on the death for the present han decide just what that something was 
 now long after the death destruction han was still with the rebelalliance lending his assistance to establish this base on hoth probably the bleakestof all planets in the galaxy but all that was about to change he told himself asfar as he was concerned han solo and the rebels were about to blast off on divergentcourses 
 he walked rapidly through the underground hangar deck where several rebelfighter ship were docked and being serviced by men in gray assisted by droids ofvarious designs of greatest concern to han was the freighter shipresting on its newly installed landing pods this the largest ship in the hangar hadgarnered a few new dents in its metal hull since han first hooked up with skywalkerand kenobi yet the millennium falcon was famous not for its outward appearancebut for its speed this freighter was still fastest ship ever to make the kessel run orto outrun an imperial tie fighter 
 much of the success could be attributed to its maintenance nowentrusted to the shaggy hands of a mountain of brown hair whose facewas at the moment hidden behind a mask 
 chewbacca han giant wookiee copilot was repairing the central lifter when he noticed solo approaching the wookiee stopped hiswork and raised his face shield exposing his furry countenance a growl that in the universe could translate roared from his toothy mouth 
 han solo was one of those few cold the word for it chewie thecorellian replied take a good fight any day over all this hiding and noticed the smoky wisps rising from the newly welded section of metal howare you coming with those lifters 
 chewbacca replied with a typical wookiee grumble 
 all right han said fully agreeing with his desire to return to space tosome other but hoth go to report then give you ahand soon as those lifters are fixed out of here 
 the wookiee barked a joyful chuckle and returned to his work as hancontinued through the artificial ice cavern 
 the command center was alive with electronic equipment and monitoringdevices reaching toward the icy ceiling as in the hangar rebel personnel filled thecommand center the room was full of controller troopers with droid of varying models and sizes all of whom were diligentlyinvolved in converting the chamber into a workable base to replace the one on yavin 
 the man han solo had come to see was busily engaged behind a great attention riveted to a computer screen flashing brilliantly colored wearing the uniform of a rebel general straightened his tall frame to facesolo as he approached 
 general there a hint of life in the area han reported but all theperimeter markings are set so know if anyone comes calling 
 as usual general rieekan did not smile at flippancy but he admiredthe young taking a kind of unofficial membership in the rebellion soimpressed was rieekan by qualities that he often considered giving him anhonorary commission 
 has commander skywalker reported in yet the general inquired 
 checking out a meteorite that hit near him han answered be insoon 
 rieekan quickly glanced at a newly installed radar screen and studied theflashing images with all the meteor activity in this system going to bedifficult to spot approaching ships 
 general i han hesitated i think time for me to move on 
 attention was drawn from general rieekan to a steadily approachingfigure her walk was both graceful and determined and somehow the feminine features seemed incongruous with her white combat at this distance han could tell princess leia was upset 
 good in a fight the general remarked to han adding i hate to loseyou 
 thank you general but a price on my head if i pay off jabbathe hut a walking dead man 
 a death mark is not an easy thing to live with the officer began as hanturned to princess leia solo was not a sentimental sort but he was aware that hewas very emotional now i guess this is it your highness he paused notknowing what response to expect from the princess 
 right leia replied coldly her sudden aloofness was quickly evolvinginto genuine anger 
 han shook his head long ago he had told himself that or some biological class yet to be beyond his meagerpowers of comprehension better leave them to mystery often advised himself 
 but for a while at least han had begun to believe that there was at least onefemale in all the cosmos that he was beginning to understand and yet he had beenwrong before 
 well han said go all mushy on me so long princess 
 abruptly turning his back to her han strode into the quiet corridor thatconnected with the command center his destination was the hangar deck where agiant wookiee and a realities he did for him he was not about to stop walking 
 han leia was rushing after him slightly out of breath 
 coolly he stopped and turned toward her yes your highness 
 i thought you had decided to stay 
 there seemed to be real concern in voice but han could not be certain 
 that bounty hunter we ran into on ord mantell changed my mind 
 does luke know she asked 
 know when he gets back han replied gruffly 
 princess eyes narrowed her gaze judging him with a look he knew a moment han felt like one of the icicles on the surface of the planet 
 give me that look he said sternly every day more bounty hunters aresearching for me going to pay off jabba before he sends any more of hisremotes gank killers and who know what else got to get this price off myhead while i still have a head 
 leia was obviously affected by his words and han could see that she wasconcerned for him as well as perhaps feeling something more 
 but we still need you she said 
 we he asked 
 yes 
 what about you han was careful to emphasize the last word but really why maybe it was something he had for some time wanted to say but hadlacked the he amended the expose his feelings at themoment there seemed to be little to lose and he was ready for whatever she mightsay 
 me she said bluntly i know what you mean 
 incredulous han solo shook his head no you probably 
 and what precisely am i supposed to know anger was growing in her voiceagain probably because han thought she was finally beginning to understand 
 he smiled you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me 
 again the princess mellowed well yes been a great help she before going on to us a natural leader 
 but han refused to let her finish cutting her off in midsentence no yourworship not it 
 suddenly leia was staring directly into face with eyes that were at understanding she started to laugh imagining things 
 am i i think you were afraid i was going to leave you without even a eyes focused on her lips kiss 
 she began to laugh harder now just as soon kiss a wookiee 
 i can arrange that he moved closer to her and she looked radiant even in thecold light of the ice chamber believe me you could use a good kiss so busy giving orders forgotten how to be a woman if have letgo for a moment i could have helped you but too late now sweetheart yourbig opportunity is flying out of here 
 i think i can survive she said obviously irked 
 good luck 
 you even care if the 
 he knew what she was going to say and let her finish spare he interrupted tell me about the rebellion again all you thinkabout as cold as this planet 
 and you think the one to apply some heat 
 sure if i were interested but i think be much fun with stepped back and looked at her again appraising her coolly meetagain he said maybe by then have warmed up a little her expressionhad changed again han had seen killers with kinder eyes 
 you have all the breeding of a bantha she snarled but not as much your trip hot shot princess leia quickly turned away from han and hurrieddown the corridor

 book one 
 chapter xv 
 
 my dear boris said princess anna mikhaylovna to her son as countess carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of count cyril vladimirovich house my dear boris said the mother drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her arm be affectionate and attentive to him count cyril vladimirovich is your godfather after all your future depends on him remember that my dear and be nice to him as you so well know how to be 
 if only i knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it answered her son coldly but i have promised and will do it for your sake 
 although the hall porter saw carriage standing at the entrance after scrutinizing the mother and son who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches and looking significantly at the old cloak he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses and hearing that they wished to see the count said his excellency was worse today and that his excellency was not receiving anyone 
 we may as well go back said the son in french 
 my dear exclaimed his mother imploringly again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him 
 boris said no more but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak 
 my friend said anna mikhaylovna in gentle tones addressing the hall porter i know count cyril vladimirovich is very ill why i have come i am a relation i shall not disturb him my friend i only need see prince vasili sergeevich he is staying here is he not please announce me 
 the hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs and turned away 
 princess drubetskaya to see prince vasili sergeevich he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches shoes and a coat who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing 
 the mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large venetian mirror in the wall and in her shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs 
 my dear she said to her son once more stimulating him by a touch you promised me 
 the son lowering his eyes followed her quietly 
 they entered the large hall from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to prince vasili 
 just as the mother and son having reached the middle of the hall were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and prince vasili came out wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast as was his custom when at home taking leave of a man this was the celebrated petersburg doctor lorrain 
 then it is certain said the prince 
 prince humanum est errare but replied the doctor swallowing his and pronouncing the latin words with a french accent 
 to err is human 
 very well very well 
 seeing anna mikhaylovna and her son prince vasili dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry the son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his face and he smiled slightly 
 ah prince in what sad circumstances we meet again and how is our dear invalid said she as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her 
 prince vasili stared at her and at boris questioningly and perplexed boris bowed politely prince vasili without acknowledging the bow turned to anna mikhaylovna answering her query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient 
 is it possible exclaimed anna mikhaylovna oh how awful it is terrible to think this is my son she added indicating boris he wanted to thank you himself 
 boris bowed again politely 
 believe me prince a heart will never forget what you have done for us 
 i am glad i was able to do you a service my dear anna mikhaylovna said prince vasili arranging his lace frill and in tone and manner here in moscow to anna mikhaylovna whom he had placed under an obligation assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in petersburg at anna reception 
 try to serve well and show yourself worthy added he addressing boris with severity i am glad are you here on leave he went on in his usual tone of indifference 
 i am awaiting orders to join my new regiment your excellency replied boris betraying neither annoyance at the brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance 
 are you living with your mother 
 i am living at countess replied boris again adding your excellency 
 that is with ilya rostov who married nataly shinshina said anna mikhaylovna 
 i know i know answered prince vasili in his monotonous voice i never could understand how nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear a perfectly absurd and stupid fellow and a gambler too i am told 
 but a very kind man prince said anna mikhaylovna with a pathetic smile as though she too knew that count rostov deserved this censure but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man what do the doctors say asked the princess after a pause her worn face again expressing deep sorrow 
 they give little hope replied the prince 
 and i should so like to thank uncle once for all his kindness to me and boris he is his godson she added her tone suggesting that this fact ought to give prince vasili much satisfaction 
 prince vasili became thoughtful and frowned anna mikhaylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for count fortune and hastened to reassure him 
 if it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to uncle said she uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern i know his character noble upright but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses they are still young she bent her head and continued in a whisper has he performed his final duty prince how priceless are those last moments it can make things no worse and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill we women prince and she smiled tenderly always know how to say these things i absolutely must see him however painful it may be for me i am used to suffering 
 evidently the prince understood her and also understood as he had done at anna that it would be difficult to get rid of anna mikhaylovna 
 would not such a meeting be too trying for him dear anna mikhaylovna said he let us wait until evening the doctors are expecting a crisis 
 but one cannot delay prince at such a moment consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake ah it is awful the duties of a christian 
 a door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses the niece entered with a cold stern face the length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs prince vasili turned to her 
 well how is he 
 still the same but what can you expect this noise said the princess looking at anna mikhaylovna as at a stranger 
 ah my dear i hardly knew you said anna mikhaylovna with a happy smile ambling lightly up to the niece i have come and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle i imagine what you have gone through and she sympathetically turned up her eyes 
 the princess gave no reply and did not even smile but left the room at anna mikhaylovna took off her gloves and occupying the position she had conquered settled down in an armchair inviting prince vasili to take a seat beside her 
 boris she said to her son with a smile i shall go in to see the count my uncle but you my dear had better go to pierre meanwhile and forget to give him the rostovs invitation they ask him to dinner i suppose he go she continued turning to the prince 
 on the contrary replied the prince who had plainly become depressed i shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man here he is and the count has not once asked for him 
 he shrugged his shoulders a footman conducted boris down one flight of stairs and up another to rooms

 chapter 
 
 another week i am so many days nearer health and spring i have now heard all my history at different sittings as the housekeeper could spare time from more important occupations continue it in her own words only a little condensed she is on the whole a very fair narrator and i think i could improve her style 
 in the evening she said the evening of my visit to the heights i knew as well as if i saw him that mr heathcliff was about the place and i shunned going out because i still carried his letter in my pocket and want to be threatened or teased any more i had made up my mind not to give it till my master went somewhere as i could not guess how its receipt would affect catherine the consequence was that it did not reach her before the lapse of three days the fourth was sunday and i brought it into her room after the family were gone to church there was a manservant left to keep the house with me and we generally made a practice of locking the doors during the hours of service but on that occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that i set them wide open and to fulfil my engagement as i knew who would be coming i told my companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges and he must run over to the village and get a few to be paid for on the morrow he departed and i went upstairs 
 mrs linton sat in a loose white dress with a light shawl over her shoulders in the recess of the open window as usual her thick long hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness and now she wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck her appearance was altered as i had told heathcliff but when she was calm there seemed unearthly beauty in the change the flash of her eyes had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness they no longer gave the impression of looking at the objects around her they appeared always to gaze beyond and far would have said out of this world then the paleness of her haggard aspect having vanished as she recovered the peculiar expression arising from her mental state though painfully suggestive of their causes added to the touching interest which she awakened to me i know and to any person who saw her i should more tangible proofs of convalescence and stamped her as one doomed to decay 
 a book lay spread on the sill before her and the scarcely perceptible wind fluttered its leaves at intervals i believe linton had laid it there for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading or occupation of any kind and he would spend many an hour in trying to entice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her amusement she was conscious of his aim and in her better moods endured his efforts placidly only showing their uselessness by now and then suppressing a wearied sigh and checking him at last with the saddest of smiles and kisses at other times she would turn petulantly away and hide her face in her hands or even push him off angrily and then he took care to let her alone for he was certain of doing no good 
 gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing and the full mellow flow of the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear it was a sweet substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage which drowned that music about the grange when the trees were in leaf at wuthering heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a season of steady rain and of wuthering heights catherine was thinking as she listened that is if she thought or listened at all but she had the vague distant look i mentioned before which expressed no recognition of material things either by ear or eye 
 a letter for you mrs linton i said gently inserting it in one hand that rested on her knee you must read it immediately because it wants an answer shall i break the seal 
 yes she answered without altering the direction of her eyes i opened was very short now i continued read it she drew away her hand and let it fall i replaced it in her lap and stood waiting till it should please her to glance down but that movement was so long delayed that at last i resumed 
 must i read it it is from mr heathcliff 
 there was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection and a struggle to arrange her ideas she lifted the letter and seemed to peruse it and when she came to the signature she sighed yet still i found she had not gathered its import for upon my desiring to hear her reply she merely pointed to the name and gazed at me with mournful and questioning eagerness 
 well he wishes to see you said i guessing her need of an interpreter in the garden by this time and impatient to know what answer i shall bring 
 as i spoke i observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise its ears as if about to bark and then smoothing them back announce by a wag of the tail that someone approached whom it did not consider a stranger mrs linton bent forward and listened breathlessly the minute after a step traversed the hall the open house was too tempting for heathcliff to resist walking in most likely he supposed that i was inclined to shirk my promise and so resolved to trust to his own audacity with straining eagerness catherine gazed towards the entrance of her chamber he did not hit the right room directly she motioned me to admit him but he found it out ere i could reach the door and in a stride or two was at her side and had her grasped in his arms 
 he neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes during which period he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before i dare say but then my mistress had kissed him first and i plainly saw that he could hardly bear for downright agony to look into her face the same conviction had stricken him as me from the instant he beheld her that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery was fated sure to die 
 oh cathy oh my life how can i bear it was the first sentence he uttered in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair and now he stared at her so earnestly that i thought the very intensity of his gaze would bring tears into his eyes but they burned with anguish they did not melt 
 what now said catherine leaning back and returning his look with a suddenly clouded brow her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying caprices you and edgar have broken my heart heathcliff and you both came to bewail the deed to me as if you were the people to be pitied i shall not pity you not i you have killed thriven on it i think how strong you are how many years do you mean to live after i am gone 
 heathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her he attempted to rise but she seized his hair and kept him down 
 i wish i could hold you she continued bitterly till we were both dead i care what you suffered i care nothing for your sufferings why you suffer i do will you forget me will you be happy when i am in the earth will you say twenty years hence the grave of catherine earnshaw i loved her long ago and was wretched to lose her but it is past loved many others since my children are dearer to me than she was and at death i shall not rejoice that i am going to her i shall be sorry that i must leave them will you say so heathcliff 
 torture me till i am as mad as yourself cried he wrenching his head free and grinding his teeth 
 the two to a cool spectator made a strange and fearful picture well might catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her unless with her mortal body she cast away her moral character also her present countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek and a bloodless lip and scintillating eye and she retained in her closed fingers a portion of the locks she had been grasping as to her companion while raising himself with one hand he had taken her arm with the other and so inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her condition that on his letting go i saw four distinct impressions left blue in the colourless skin 
 are you possessed with a devil he pursued savagely to talk in that manner to me when you are dying do you reflect that all those words will be branded on my memory and eating deeper eternally after you have left me you know you lie to say i have killed you and catherine you know that i could as soon forget you as my existence is it not sufficient for your infernal selfishness that while you are at peace i shall writhe in the torments of hell 
 i shall not be at peace moaned catherine recalled to a sense of physical weakness by the violent unequal throbbing of her heart which beat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation she said nothing further till the paroxysm was over then she continued more kindly 
 not wishing you greater torment than i have heathcliff i only wish us never to be parted and should a word of mine distress you hereafter think i feel the same distress underground and for my own sake forgive me come here and kneel down again you never harmed me in your life nay if you nurse anger that will be worse to remember than my harsh words you come here again do 
 heathcliff went to the back of her chair and leant over but not so far as to let her see his face which was livid with emotion she bent round to look at him he would not permit it turning abruptly he walked to the fireplace where he stood silent with his back towards us mrs glance followed him suspiciously every movement woke a new sentiment in her after a pause and a prolonged gaze she resumed addressing me in accents of indignant disappointment 
 oh you see nelly he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave that is how loved well never mind that is not my heathcliff i shall love mine yet and take him with me in my soul and added she musingly the thing that irks me most in this shattered prison after all tired tired of being enclosed here wearying to escape into that glorious world and to be always there not seeing it dimly through tears and yearning for it through the walls of an aching heart but really with it and in it nelly you think you are better and more fortunate than i in full health and strength you are sorry for soon that will be altered i shall be sorry for you i shall be incomparably beyond and above you all i wonder he be near me she went on to herself i thought he wished it heathcliff dear you should not be sullen now do come to me heathcliff 
 in her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair at that earnest appeal he turned to her looking absolutely desperate his eyes wide and wet at last flashed fiercely on her his breast heaved convulsively an instant they held asunder and then how they met i hardly saw but catherine made a spring and he caught her and they were locked in an embrace from which i thought my mistress would never be released alive in fact to my eyes she seemed directly insensible he flung himself into the nearest seat and on my approaching hurriedly to ascertain if she had fainted he gnashed at me and foamed like a mad dog and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy i did not feel as if i were in the company of a creature of my own species it appeared that he would not understand though i spoke to him so i stood off and held my tongue in great perplexity 
 a movement of relieved me a little presently she put up her hand to clasp his neck and bring her cheek to his as he held her while he in return covering her with frantic caresses said wildly 
 you teach me now how cruel and false why did you despise me why did you betray your own heart cathy i have not one word of comfort you deserve this you have killed yourself yes you may kiss me and cry and ring out my kisses and tears blight damn you you loved what right had you to leave me what the poor fancy you felt for linton because misery and degradation and death and nothing that god or satan could inflict would have parted us you of your own will did it i have not broken your have broken it and in breaking it you have broken mine so much the worse for me that i am strong do i want to live what kind of living will it be when god would you like to live with your soul in the grave 
 let me alone let me alone sobbed catherine if i have done wrong dying for it it is enough you left me too but i upbraid you i forgive you forgive me 
 it is hard to forgive and to look at those eyes and feel those wasted hands he answered kiss me again and let me see your eyes i forgive what you have done to me i love my yours how can i 
 they were faces hid against each other and washed by each tears at least i suppose the weeping was on both sides as it seemed heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this 
 i grew very uncomfortable meanwhile for the afternoon wore fast away the man whom i had sent off returned from his errand and i could distinguish by the shine of the westering sun up the valley a concourse thickening outside gimmerton chapel porch 
 service is over i announced my master will be here in half an hour 
 heathcliff groaned a curse and strained catherine closer she never moved 
 ere long i perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards the kitchen wing mr linton was not far behind he opened the gate himself and sauntered slowly up probably enjoying the lovely afternoon that breathed as soft as summer 
 now he is here i exclaimed for sake hurry down not meet anyone on the front stairs do be quick and stay among the trees till he is fairly in 
 i must go cathy said heathcliff seeking to extricate himself from his arms but if i live see you again before you are asleep i stray five yards from your window 
 you must not go she answered holding him as firmly as her strength allowed you shall not i tell you 
 for one hour he pleaded earnestly 
 not for one minute she replied 
 i will be up immediately persisted the alarmed intruder 
 he would have risen and unfixed her fingers by the clung fast gasping there was mad resolution in her face 
 no she shrieked oh go it is the last time edgar will not hurt us heathcliff i shall die i shall die 
 damn the fool there he is cried heathcliff sinking back into his seat hush my darling hush hush catherine stay if he shot me so expire with a blessing on my lips 
 and there they were fast again i heard my master mounting the cold sweat ran from my forehead i was horrified 
 are you going to listen to her ravings i said passionately she does not know what she says will you ruin her because she has not wit to help herself get up you could be free instantly that is the most diabolical deed that ever you did we are all done mistress and servant 
 i wrung my hands and cried out mr linton hastened his step at the noise in the midst of my agitation i was sincerely glad to observe that arms had fallen relaxed and her head hung down 
 fainted or dead i thought so much the better far better that she should be dead than lingering a burden and a to all about her 
 edgar sprang to his unbidden guest blanched with astonishment and rage what he meant to do i cannot tell however the other stopped all demonstrations at once by placing the lifeless looking form in his arms 
 look there he said unless you be a fiend help her you shall speak to me 
 he walked into the parlour and sat down mr linton summoned me and with great difficulty and after resorting to many means we managed to restore her to sensation but she was all bewildered she sighed and moaned and knew nobody edgar in his anxiety for her forgot her hated friend i did not i went at the earliest opportunity and besought him to depart affirming that catherine was better and he should hear from me in the morning how she passed the night 
 i shall not refuse to go out of doors he answered but i shall stay in the garden and nelly mind you keep your word to morrow i shall be under those larch trees mind or i pay another visit whether linton be in or not 
 he sent a rapid glance through the door of the chamber and ascertaining that what i stated was apparently true delivered the house of his luckless presence
