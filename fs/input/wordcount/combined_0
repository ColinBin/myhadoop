 laws

 translated by benjamin jowett 
 book i 
 
 persons of the dialogue an athenian stranger cleinias acretan megillus a lacedaemonian 
 athenian stranger tell me strangers is a god or some man supposedto be the author of your laws 
 cleinias a god stranger in very truth a god among us cretans heis said to have been zeus but in lacedaemon whence our friend herecomes i believe they would say that apollo is their lawgiver wouldthey not megillus 
 megillus certainly 
 ath and do you cleinias believe as homer tells that every ninthyear minos went to converse with his olympian sire and was inspiredby him to make laws for your cities 
 cle yes that is our tradition and there was rhadamanthus abrother of his with whose name you are familiar he is reputed tohave been the justest of men and we cretans are of opinion that heearned this reputation from his righteous administration of justicewhen he was alive 
 ath yes and a noble reputation it was worthy of a son of zeus asyou and megillus have been trained in these institutions i dare saythat you will not be unwilling to give an account of your governmentand laws on our way we can pass the time pleasantly in about i am told that the distance from cnosus to the cave and templeof zeus is considerable and doubtless there are shady places underthe lofty trees which will protect us from this scorching no longer young we may often stop to rest beneath them and getover the whole journey without difficulty beguiling the time byconversation 
 cle yes stranger and if we proceed onward we shall come to grovesof cypresses which are of rare height and beauty and there are greenmeadows in which we may repose and converse 
 ath very good 
 cle very good indeed and still better when we see them let usmove on cheerily 
 ath i am first i want to know why the law has ordainedthat you shall have common meals and gymnastic exercises and weararms 
 cle i think stranger that the aim of our institutions is easilyintelligible to any one look at the character of our country creteis not like thessaly a large plain and for this reason they havehorsemen in thessaly and we have inequality of the groundin our country is more adapted to locomotion on foot but then if youhave runners you must have light one can carry a heavyweight when running and bows and arrows are convenient because theyare light now all these regulations have been made with a view towar and the legislator appears to me to have looked to this in allhis common meals if i am not mistaken wereinstituted by him for a similar reason because he saw that while theyare in the field the citizens are by the nature of the casecompelled to take their meals together for the sake of mutualprotection he seems to me to have thought the world foolish in notunderstanding that all are always at war with one another and if inwar there ought to be common meals and certain persons regularlyappointed under others to protect an army they should be continued inpeace for what men in general term peace would be said by him to beonly a name in reality every city is in a natural state of war withevery other not indeed proclaimed by heralds but everlasting and ifyou look closely you will find that this was the intention of thecretan legislator all institutions private as well as public werearranged by him with a view to war in giving them he was under theimpression that no possessions or institutions are of any value to himwho is defeated in battle for all the good things of the conqueredpass into the hands of the conquerors 
 ath you appear to me stranger to have been thoroughly trainedin the cretan institutions and to be well informed about them willyou tell me a little more explicitly what is the principle ofgovernment which you would lay down you seem to imagine that a wellgoverned state ought to be so ordered as to conquer all other statesin war am i right in supposing this to be your meaning 
 cle certainly and our lacedaemonian friend if i am notmistaken will agree with me 
 meg why my good friend how could any lacedaemonian say anythingelse 
 ath and is what you say applicable only to states or also tovillages 
 cle to both alike 
 ath the case is the same 
 cle yes 
 ath and in the village will there be the same war of family againstfamily and of individual against individual 
 cle the same 
 ath and should each man conceive himself to be his shall we say 
 cle o athenian of attica i will not call you seem to deserve rather to be named after the goddessherself because you go back to first principles you have thrown alight upon the argument and will now be better able to understandwhat i was just all men are publicly one and each man privately his own 
 ath my good sir what do you mean 
 cle moreover there is a victory and first andbest of victories the lowest and worst of each mangains or sustains at the hands not of another but of himself thisshows that there is a war against ourselves going on within everyone of us 
 ath let us now reverse the order of the argument seeing that everyindividual is either his own superior or his own inferior may wesay that there is the same principle in the house the village andthe state 
 cle you mean that in each of them there is a principle ofsuperiority or inferiority to self 
 ath yes 
 cle you are quite right in asking the question for there certainlyis such a principle and above all in states and the state in whichthe better citizens win a victory over the mob and over the inferiorclasses may be truly said to be better than itself and may bejustly praised where such a victory is gained or censured in theopposite case 
 ath whether the better is ever really conquered by the worse is aquestion which requires more discussion and may be therefore left forthe present but i now quite understand your meaning when you say thatcitizens who are of the same race and live in the same cities mayunjustly conspire and having the superiority in numbers mayovercome and enslave the few just and when they prevail the statemay be truly called its own inferior and therefore bad and whenthey are defeated its own superior and therefore good 
 cle your remark stranger is a paradox and yet we cannot possiblydeny it 
 ath here is another case for a family there maybe several brothers who are the offspring of a single pair verypossibly the majority of them may be unjust and the just may be ina minority 
 cle very possibly 
 ath and you and i ought not to raise a question of words as towhether this family and household are rightly said to be superior whenthey conquer and inferior when they are conquered for we are not nowconsidering what may or may not be the proper or customary way ofspeaking but we are considering the natural principles of right andwrong in laws 
 cle what you say stranger is most true 
 meg quite excellent in my opinion as far as we have gone 
 ath again might there not be a judge over these brethren ofwhom we were speaking 
 cle certainly 
 ath now which would be the better who destroyed thebad and appointed the good to govern themselves or one who whileallowing the good to govern let the bad live and made themvoluntarily submit or third i suppose in the scale of excellencemight be placed a judge who finding the family distracted notonly did not destroy any one but reconciled them to one another forever after and gave them laws which they mutually observed and wasable to keep them friends 
 cle the last would be by far the best sort of judge and legislator 
 ath and yet the aim of all the laws which he gave would be thereverse of war 
 cle very true 
 ath and will he who constitutes the state and orders the life ofman have in view external war or that kind of intestine war calledcivil which no one if he could prevent would like to have occurringin his own state and when occurring every one would wish to bequit of as soon as possible 
 cle he would have the latter chiefly in view 
 ath and would he prefer that this civil war should be terminated bythe destruction of one of the parties and by the victory of theother or that peace and friendship should be andthat being reconciled they should give their attention to foreignenemies 
 cle every one would desire the latter in the case of his own state 
 ath and would not that also be the desire of the legislator 
 cle certainly 
 ath and would not every one always make laws for the sake of thebest 
 cle to be sure 
 ath but war whether external or civil is not the best and theneed of either is to be deprecated but peace with one another andgood will are best nor is the victory of the state over itself to beregarded as a really good thing but as a necessity a man might aswell say that the body was in the best state when sick and purged bymedicine forgetting that there is also a state of the body whichneeds no purge and in like manner no one can be a true he aims at the happiness of the individual or state who looksonly or first of all to external warfare nor will he ever be asound legislator who orders peace for the sake of war and not war forthe sake of peace 
 cle i suppose that there is truth stranger in that remark ofyours and yet i am greatly mistaken if war is not the entire aimand object of our own institutions and also of the lacedaemonian 
 ath i dare say but there is no reason why we should rudely quarrelwith one another about your legislators instead of gently questioningthem seeing that both we and they are equally in earnest pleasefollow me and the argument first i will put forwardtyrtaeus an athenian by birth but also a spartan citizen who of allmen was most eager about war well he says i sing not i carenot about any man even if he were the richest of men andpossessed every good and then he gives a whole list of them if hebe not at all times a brave warrior i imagine that you too musthave heard his poems our lacedaemonian friend has probably heard morethan enough of them 
 meg very true 
 cle and they have found their way from lacedaemon to crete 
 ath come now and let us all join in asking this question oftyrtaeus o most divine poet we will say to him the excellent praisewhich you have bestowed on those who excel in war sufficientlyproves that you are wise and good and i and megillus and cleiniasof cnosus do as i believe entirely agree with you but we shouldlike to be quite sure that we are speaking of the same men tell do you agree with us in thinking that there are two kinds ofwar or what would you say a far inferior man to tyrtaeus wouldhave no difficulty in replying quite truly that war is of two kindsone which is universally called civil war and is as we were justnow saying of all wars the worst the other as we should alladmit in which we fall out with other nations who are of adifferent race is a far milder form of warfare 
 cle certainly far milder 
 ath well now when you praise and blame war in this whom are you praising or blaming and to which kind of war areyou referring i suppose that you must mean foreign war if i am tojudge from expressions of yours in which you say that you abominatethose 
 who refuse to look upon fields of blood and will not draw nearand strike at their we shall naturally go on to say to tyrtaeus as it those who distinguish themselves in external and foreign he must admit this 
 cle evidently 
 ath they are good but we say that there are still better men whosevirtue is displayed in the greatest of all battles and we too havea poet whom we summon as a witness theognis citizen of megara insicily 
 cyrnus he who is faithful in a civil broil is worth his weight ingold and such an one is far better as we affirm than the other in amore difficult kind of war much in the same degree as justice andtemperance and wisdom when united with courage are better thancourage only for a man cannot be faithful and good in civil strifewithout having all virtue but in the war of which tyrtaeus a mercenary soldier will take his stand and be ready to die athis post and yet they are generally and almost without exceptioninsolent unjust violent men and the most senseless of human will ask what the conclusion is and what i am seeking to prove imaintain that the divine legislator of crete like any other who isworthy of consideration will always and above all things in makinglaws have regard to the greatest virtue which according to loyalty in the hour of danger and may be truly called perfectjustice whereas that virtue which tyrtaeus highly praises is wellenough and was praised by the poet at the right time yet in placeand dignity may be said to be only fourth rate 
 cle stranger we are degrading our inspired lawgiver to a rankwhich is far beneath him 
 ath nay i think that we degrade not him but ourselves if weimagine that lycurgus and minos laid down laws both in lacedaemonand crete mainly with a view to war 
 cle what ought we to say then 
 ath what truth and what justice require of us if i am notmistaken when speaking in behalf of divine thelegislator when making his laws had in view not a part only andthis the lowest part of virtue but all virtue and that he devisedclasses of laws answering to the kinds of virtue not in the way inwhich modern inventors of laws make the classes for they onlyinvestigate and offer laws whenever a want is felt and one man hasa class of laws about allotments and heiresses another aboutassaults others about ten thousand other such matters but wemaintain that the right way of examining into laws is to proceed as wehave now done and i admired the spirit of your exposition for youwere quite right in beginning with virtue and saying that this wasthe aim of the giver of the law but i thought that you went wrongwhen you added that all his legislation had a view only to a part andthe least part of virtue and this called forth my subsequent you allow me then to explain how i should have liked to haveheard you expound the matter 
 cle by all means 
 ath you ought to have said cretan laws are withreason famous among the hellenes for they fulfil the object oflaws which is to make those who use them happy and they confer everysort of good now goods are of two kinds there are human and thereare divine goods and the human hang upon the divine and the statewhich attains the greater at the same time acquires the less or nothaving the greater has neither of the lesser goods the first ishealth the second beauty the third strength including swiftnessin running and bodily agility generally and the fourth is wealth notthe blind god pluto but one who is keen of sight if only he haswisdom for his companion for wisdom is chief and leader of the divinedass of goods and next follows temperance and from the union ofthese two with courage springs justice and fourth in the scale ofvirtue is courage all these naturally take precedence of the othergoods and this is the order in which the legislator must placethem and after them he will enjoin the rest of his ordinances onthe citizens with a view to these the human looking to the the divine looking to their leader mind some of his ordinanceswill relate to contracts of marriage which they make one with then to the procreation and education of children both male andfemale the duty of the lawgiver will be to take charge of hiscitizens in youth and age and at every time of life and to givethem punishments and rewards and in reference to all theirintercourse with one another he ought to consider their pains andpleasures and desires and the vehemence of all their passions heshould keep a watch over them and blame and praise them rightly bythe mouth of the laws themselves also with regard to anger andterror and the other perturbations of the soul which arise out ofmisfortune and the deliverances from them which prosperity the experiences which come to men in diseases or in war orpoverty or the opposite of these in all these states he shoulddetermine and teach what is the good and evil of the condition ofeach in the next place the legislator has to be careful how thecitizens make their money and in what way they spend it and to havean eye to their mutual contracts and dissolutions of voluntary or involuntary he should see how they order allthis and consider where justice as well as injustice is found or iswanting in their several dealings with one another and honour thosewho obey the law and impose fixed penalties on those who the round of civil life is ended and the time has come forthe consideration of the proper funeral rites and honours of the the lawgiver reviewing his work will appoint guardians to presideover these who walk by intelligence others by trueopinion only and then mind will bind together all his ordinancesand show them to be in harmony with temperance and justice and notwith wealth or ambition this is the spirit stranger in which iwas and am desirous that you should pursue the subject and i wantto know the nature of all these things and how they are arranged inthe laws of zeus as they are termed and in those of the pythianapollo which minos and lycurgus gave and how the order of them isdiscovered to his eyes who has experience in laws gained either bystudy or habit although they are far from being to therest of mankind like ourselves 
 cle how shall we proceed stranger 
 ath i think that we must begin again as before and firstconsider the habit of courage and then we will go on and discussanother and then another form of virtue if you please in this way weshall have a model of the whole and with these and similar discourseswe will beguile the way and when we have gone through all thevirtues we will show by the grace of god that the institutions ofwhich i was speaking look to virtue 
 meg very good and suppose that you first criticize this praiser ofzeus and the laws of crete 
 ath i will try to criticize you and myself as well as him for theargument is a common concern tell not first the syssitia andsecondly the gymnasia invented by your legislator with a view to war 
 meg yes 
 ath and what comes third and what fourth for that i think isthe sort of enumeration which ought to be made of the remainingparts of virtue no matter whether you call them parts or what theirname is provided the meaning is clear 
 meg then i or any other lacedaemonian would reply that hunting isthird in order 
 ath let us see if we can discover what comes fourth and fifth 
 meg i think that i can get as far as the fouth head which is thefrequent endurance of pain exhibited among us spartans in fights also in stealing with the prospect of getting agood beating there is too the crypteia or secretservice in which wonderful endurance is people wanderover the whole country by day and by night and even in winter havenot a shoe to their foot and are without beds to lie upon and haveto attend upon themselves marvellous too is the endurance which ourcitizens show in their naked exercises contending against the violentsummer heat and there are many similar practices to speak of whichin detail would be endless 
 ath excellent o lacedaemonian stranger but how ought we to definecourage is it to be regarded only as a combat against fears andpains or also against desires and pleasures and againstflatteries which exercise such a tremendous power that they make thehearts even of respectable citizens to melt like wax 
 meg i should say the latter 
 ath in what preceded as you will remember our cnosian friendwas speaking of a man or a city being inferior to younot cleinias 
 cle i was 
 ath now which is in the truest sense inferior the man who isovercome by pleasure or by pain 
 cle i should say the man who is overcome by pleasure for all mendeem him to be inferior in a more disgraceful sense than the otherwho is overcome by pain 
 ath but surely the lawgivers of crete and lacedaemon have notlegislated for a courage which is lame of one leg able only to meetattacks which come from the left but impotent against the insidiousflatteries which come from the right 
 cle able to meet both i should say 
 ath then let me once more ask what institutions have you in eitherof your states which give a taste of pleasures and do not avoidthem any more than they avoid pains but which set a person in themidst of them and compel or induce him by the prospect of reward toget the better of them where is an ordinance about pleasure similarto that about pain to be found in your laws tell me what there isof this nature among is there which makes your citizenequally brave against pleasure and pain conquering what they ought toconquer and superior to the enemies who are most dangerous andnearest home 
 meg i was able to tell you stranger many laws which were directedagainst pain but i do not know that i can point out any great orobvious examples of similar institutions which are concerned withpleasure there are some lesser provisions however which i mightmention 
 cle neither can i show anything of that sort which is at allequally prominent in the cretan laws 
 ath no wonder my dear friends and if as is very likely in oursearch after the true and good one of us may have to censure the lawsof the others we must not be offended but take kindly what anothersays 
 cle you are quite right athenian stranger and we will do as yousay 
 ath at our time of life cleinias there should be no feeling ofirritation 
 cle certainly not 
 ath i will not at present determine whether he who censures thecretan or lacedaemonian polities is right or wrong but i believe thati can tell better than either of you what the many say about them forassuming that you have reasonably good laws one of the best of themwill be the law forbidding any young men to enquire which of themare right or wrong but with one mouth and one voice they must allagree that the laws are all good for they came from god and anyone who says the contrary is not to be listened to but an old man whoremarks any defect in your laws may communicate his observation to aruler or to an equal in years when no young man is present 
 cle exactly so stranger and like a diviner although not there atthe time you seem to me quite to have hit the meaning of thelegislator and to say what is most true 
 ath as there are no young men present and the legislator has givenold men free licence there will be no impropriety in our discussingthese very matters now that we are alone 
 cle true and therefore you may be as free as you like in yourcensure of our laws for there is no discredit in knowing what iswrong he who receives what is said in a generous and friendlyspirit will be all the better for it 
 ath very good however i am not going to say anything against yourlaws until to the best of my ability i have examined them but i amgoing to raise doubts about them for you are the only people known tous whether greek or barbarian whom the legislator commanded toeschew all great pleasures and amusements and never to touch in the matter of pains or fears which we have just beendiscussing he thought that they who from infancy had always avoidedpains and fears and sorrows when they were compelled to face themwould run away from those who were hardened in them and wouldbecome their subjects now the legislator ought to have consideredthat this was equally true of pleasure he should have said tohimself that if our citizens are from their youth upward unacquaintedwith the greatest pleasures and unused to endure amid the temptationsof pleasure and are not disciplined to refrain from all thingsevil the sweet feeling of pleasure will overcome them just as fearwould overcome the former class and in another and even a worsemanner they will be the slaves of those who are able to endure amidpleasures and have had the opportunity of enjoying them they beingoften the worst of mankind one half of their souls will be a other half free and they will not be worthy to be called in thetrue sense men and freemen tell me whether you assent to my words 
 cle on first hearing what you say appears to be the truth butto be hasty in coming to a conclusion about such important matterswould be very childish and simple 
 ath suppose cleinias and megillus that we consider the virtuewhich follows next of those which we intended to discuss for aftercourage comes temperance what institutions shall we find relating totemperance either in crete or lacedaemon which like your militaryinstitutions differ from those of any ordinary state 
 meg that is not an easy question to answer still i should say thatthe common meals and gymnastic exercises have been excellently devisedfor the promotion both of temperance and courage 
 ath there seems to be a difficulty stranger with regard tostates in making words and facts coincide so that there can be nodispute about them as in the human body the regimen which doesgood in one way does harm in another and we can hardly say that anyone course of treatment is adapted to a particular constitution nowthe gymnasia and common meals do a great deal of good and yet theyare a source of evil in civil troubles as is shown in the case of themilesian and boeotian and thurian youth among whom theseinstitutions seem always to have had a tendency to degrade the ancientand natural custom of love below the level not only of man but ofthe beasts the charge may be fairly brought against your cities aboveall others and is true also of most other states which especiallycultivate gymnastics whether such matters are to be regardedjestingly or seriously i think that the pleasure is to be deemednatural which arises out of the intercourse between men and women butthat the intercourse of men with men or of women with women iscontrary to nature and that the bold attempt was originally due tounbridled lust the cretans are always accused of having inventedthe story of ganymede and zeus because they wanted to justifythemselves in the enjoyment of unnatural pleasures by the practiceof the god whom they believe to have been their lawgiver leavingthe story we may observe that any speculation about laws turns almostentirely on pleasure and pain both in states and in are two fountains which nature lets flow and he who drawsfrom them where and when and as much as he ought is happy andthis holds of men and individuals as well as states and hewho indulges in them ignorantly and at the wrong time is thereverse of happy 
 meg i admit stranger that your words are well spoken and ihardly know what to say in answer to you but still i think that thespartan lawgiver was quite right in forbidding pleasure of the cretanlaws i shall leave the defence to my cnosian friend but the lawsof sparta in as far as they relate to pleasure appear to me to bethe best in the world for that which leads mankind in general intothe wildest pleasure and licence and every other folly the law hasclean driven out and neither in the country nor in towns which areunder the control of sparta will you find revelries and the manyincitements of every kind of pleasure which accompany them and anyone who meets a drunken and disorderly person will immediately havehim most severely punished and will not let him off on anypretence not even at the time of a dionysiac festival although ihave remarked that this may happen at your performances on the they are called and among our tarentine colonists i have seenthe whole city drunk at a dionysiac festival but nothing of thesort happens among us 
 ath o lacedaemonian stranger these festivities are praiseworthywhere there is a spirit of endurance but are very senseless when theyare under no regulations in order to retaliate an athenian hasonly to point out the licence which exists among your women to allsuch accusations whether they are brought against the us or you there is one answer which exonerates the practice inquestion from impropriety when a stranger expresses wonder at thesingularity of what he sees any inhabitant will naturally not o stranger this is our custom and you may verylikely have some other custom about the same things now we arespeaking my friends not about men in general but about the meritsand defects of the lawgivers themselves let us then discourse alittle more at length about intoxication which is a very importantsubject and will seriously task the discrimination of the am not speaking of drinking or not drinking wine at all but ofintoxication are we to follow the custom of the scythians andpersians and carthaginians and celts and iberians and are all warlike nations or that of your countrymen for you say altogether abstain but the scythians and men and women drink unmixed wine which they pour on theirgarments and this they think a happy and glorious institution thepersians again are much given to other practices of luxury which youreject but they have more moderation in them than the thracians andscythians 
 meg o best of men we have only to take arms into our hands and wesend all these nations flying before us 
 ath nay my good friend do not say that there have been as therealways will be flights and pursuits of which no account can be therefore we cannot say that victory or defeat in battle affordsmore than a doubtful proof of the goodness or badness of when the greater states conquer and enslave the lesser as thesyracusans have done the locrians who appear to be people in their part of the world or as the athenianshave done the ceans and there are ten thousand other instances of thesame sort of thing all this is not to the point let us endeavourrather to form a conclusion about each institution in itself and saynothing at present of victories and defeats let us only say thatsuch and such a custom is honourable and another not and firstpermit me to tell you how good and bad are to be estimated inreference to these very matters 
 meg how do you mean 
 ath all those who are ready at a notice to praise orcensure any practice which is matter of discussion seem to me toproceed in a wrong way let me give you an illustration of what may suppose a person to be praising wheat as a good kindof food whereupon another person instantly blames wheat without everenquiring into its effect or use or in what way or to whom orwith what or in what state and how wheat is to be given and that isjust what we are doing in this discussion at the very mention ofthe word intoxication one side is ready with their praises and theother with their censures which is absurd for either side adducetheir witnesses and approvers and some of us think that we speak withauthority because we have many witnesses and others because theysee those who abstain conquering in battle and this again is disputedby us now i cannot say that i shall be satisfied if we go ondiscussing each of the remaining laws in the same way and aboutthis very point of intoxication i should like to speak in another i hold to be the right one for if number is to be thecriterion are there not myriads upon myriads of nations ready todispute the point with you who are only two cities 
 meg i shall gladly welcome any method of enquiry which is right 
 ath let me put the matter a person to praise thekeeping of goats and the creatures themselves as capital things tohave and then some one who had seen goats feeding without agoatherd in cultivated spots and doing mischief were to censure agoat or any other animal who has no keeper or a bad keeper wouldthere be any sense or justice in such censure 
 meg certainly not 
 ath does a captain require only to have nautical knowledge in orderto be a good captain whether he is or not what do you say 
 meg i say that he is not a good captain if although he havenautical skill he is liable to 
 ath and what would you say of the commander of an army will hebe able to command merely because he has military skill if he be acoward who when danger comes is sick and drunk with fear 
 meg impossible 
 ath and what if besides being a coward he has no skill 
 meg he is a miserable fellow not fit to be a commander of men butonly of old women 
 ath and what would you say of some one who blames or praises anysort of meeting which is intended by nature to have a ruler and iswell enough when under his presidency the critic however hasnever seen the society meeting together at an orderly feast underthe control of a president but always without a ruler or with a observers of this class praise or blame such meetings arewe to suppose that what they say is of any value 
 meg certainly not if they have never seen or been present atsuch a meeting when rightly ordered 
 ath reflect may not banqueters and banquets be said toconstitute a kind of meeting 
 meg of course 
 ath and did any one ever see this sort of convivial meeting rightlyordered of course you two will answer that you have never seen themat all because they are not customary or lawful in your i have come across many of them in many different places andmoreover i have made enquiries about them wherever i went as i maysay and never did i see or hear of anything of the kind which wascarried on altogether rightly in some few particulars they might beright but in general they were utterly wrong 
 cle what do you mean stranger by this remark explain for we asyou say from our inexperience in such matters might very likelynot know even if they came in our way what was right or wrong insuch societies 
 ath likely enough then let me try to be your instructor you wouldacknowledge would you not that in all gatherings of man kind ofwhatever sort there ought to be a leader 
 cle certainly i should 
 ath and we were saying just now that when men are at war theleader ought to be a brave man 
 cle we were 
 ath the brave man is less likely than the coward to be disturbed byfears 
 cle that again is true 
 ath and if there were a possibility of having a general of anarmy who was absolutely fearless and imperturbable should we not byall means appoint him 
 cle assuredly 
 ath now however we are speaking not of a general who is tocommand an army when foe meets foe in time of war but of one whois to regulate meetings of another sort when friend meets friend intime of peace 
 cle true 
 ath and that sort of meeting if attended with drunkenness isapt to be unquiet 
 cle certainly the reverse of quiet 
 ath in the first place then the revellers as well as the soldierswill require a ruler 
 cle to be sure no men more so 
 ath and we ought if possible to provide them with a quiet ruler 
 cle of course 
 ath and he should be a man who understands society for his duty isto preserve the friendly feelings which exist among the company at thetime and to increase them for the future by his use of the occasion 
 cle very true 
 ath must we not appoint a sober man and a wise to be our masterof the revels for if the ruler of drinkers be himself young anddrunken and not only by some special good fortune willhe be saved from doing some great evil 
 cle it will be by a singular good fortune that he is saved 
 ath now suppose such associations to be framed in the best waypossible in states and that some one blames the very fact of may very likely be right but if he blames a practicewhich he only sees very much mismanaged he shows in the first placethat he is not aware of the mismanagement and also not aware thateverything done in this way will turn out to be wrong because donewithout the superintendence of a sober ruler do you not see that adrunken pilot or a drunken ruler of any sort will ruin in short of which he has the direction 
 cle the last remark is very true stranger and i see quite clearlythe advantage of an army having a good will give victoryin war to his followers which is a very great advantage and so ofother things but i do not see any similar advantage which eitherindividuals or states gain from the good management of a feast andi want you to tell me what great good will be effected supposing thatthis drinking ordinance is duly established 
 ath if you mean to ask what great good accrues to the state fromthe right training of a single youth or of a single thequestion is put in that form we cannot deny that the good is not verygreat in any particular instance but if you ask what is the good ofeducation in general the answer is education makes goodmen and that good men act nobly and conquer their enemies in they are good education certainly gives victory althoughvictory sometimes produces forgetfulness of education for many havegrown insolent from victory in war and this insolence hasengendered in them innumerable evils and many a victory has beenand will be suicidal to the victors but education is never suicidal 
 cle you seem to imply my friend that convivial meetings whenrightly ordered are an important element of education 
 ath certainly i do 
 cle and can you show that what you have been saying is true 
 ath to be absolutely sure of the truth of matters concerningwhich there are many opinions is an attribute of the gods not givento man stranger but i shall be very happy to tell you what ithink especially as we are now proposing to enter on a discussionconcerning laws and constitutions 
 cle your opinion stranger about the questions which are now beingraised is precisely what we want to hear 
 ath very good i will try to find a way of explaining my you shall try to have the gift of understanding me but firstlet me make an apology the athenian citizen is reputed among allthe hellenes to be a great talker whereas sparta is renowned forbrevity and the cretans have more wit than words now i am afraidof appearing to elicit a very long discourse out of very smallmaterials for drinking indeed may appear to be a slight matter andyet is one which cannot be rightly ordered according to correct principles of music these are necessary to anyclear or satisfactory treatment of the subject and music again runsup into education generally and there is much to be said about allthis what would you say then to leaving these matters for thepresent and passing on to some other question of law 
 meg o athenian stranger let me tell you what perhaps you do notknow that our family is the proxenus of your state i imagine thatfrom their earliest youth all boys when they are told that they arethe proxeni of a particular state feel kindly towards their secondand this has certainly been my own feeling i can well remember fromthe days of my boyhood how when any lacedaemonians praised or blamedthe athenians they used to say to megillus how ill or howwell as the case might be has your state treated us and havingalways had to fight your battles against detractors when i heard youassailed i became warmly attached to you and i always like to hearthe athenian tongue spoken the common saying is quite true that agood athenian is more than ordinarily good for he is the only man whois freely and genuinely good by the divine inspiration of his ownnature and is not manufactured therefore be assured that i shalllike to hear you say whatever you have to say 
 cle yes stranger and when you have heard me speak say boldlywhat is in your thoughts let me remind you of a tie which unitesyou to crete you must have heard here the story of the prophetepimenides who was of my family and came to athens ten yearsbefore the persian war in accordance with the response of the offered certain sacrifices which the god commanded theathenians were at that time in dread of the persian invasion and hesaid that for ten years they would not come and that when theycame they would go away again without accomplishing any of theirobjects and would suffer more evil than they inflicted at thattime my forefathers formed ties of hospitality with you thusancient is the friendship which i and my parents have had for you 
 ath you seem to be quite ready to listen and i am also ready toperform as much as i can of an almost impossible task which i willnevertheless attempt at the outset of the discussion let me definethe nature and power of education for this is the way by which ourargument must travel onwards to the god dionysus 
 cle let us proceed if you please 
 ath well then if i tell you what are my notions of you consider whether they satisfy you 
 cle let us hear 
 ath according to my view any one who would be good at anythingmust practise that thing from his youth upwards both in sport andearnest in its several branches for example he who is to be agood builder should play at building houses he who isto be a good husbandman at tilling the ground and those who have thecare of their education should provide them when young with mimictools they should learn beforehand the knowledge which they willafterwards require for their art for example the future carpentershould learn to measure or apply the line in play and the futurewarrior should learn riding or some other exercise for the teacher should endeavour to direct the inclinationsand pleasures by the help of amusements to their final aim inlife the most important part of education is right training in thenursery the soul of the child in his play should be guided to thelove of that sort of excellence in which when he grows up to manhoodhe will have to be perfected do you agree with me thus far 
 cle certainly 
 ath then let us not leave the meaning of education ambiguous at present when we speak in terms of praise or blameabout the of each person we call one man educated andanother uneducated although the uneducated man may be sometimesvery well educated for the calling of a retail trader or of a captainof a ship and the like for we are not speaking of education inthis narrower sense but of that other education in virtue fromyouth upwards which makes a man eagerly pursue the ideal perfectionof citizenship and teaches him how rightly to rule and how to is the only education which upon our view deserves the other sort of training which aims at the acquisition of wealthor bodily strength or mere cleverness apart from intelligence andjustice is mean and illiberal and is not worthy to be callededucation at all but let us not quarrel with one another about aword provided that the proposition which has just been granted holdgood to wit that those who are rightly educated generally becomegood men neither must we cast a slight upon education which is thefirst and fairest thing that the best of men can ever have and liable to take a wrong direction is capable of this work of reformation is the great business of every manwhile he lives 
 cle very true and we entirely agree with you 
 ath and we agreed before that they are good men who are able torule themselves and bad men who are not 
 cle you are quite right 
 ath let me now proceed if i can to clear up the subject alittle further by an illustration which i will offer you 
 cle proceed 
 ath do we not consider each of ourselves to be one 
 cle we do 
 ath and each one of us has in his bosom two counsellors bothfoolish and also antagonistic of which we call the one the other pain 
 cle exactly 
 ath also there are opinions about the future which have thegeneral name of expectations and the specific name of fear whenthe expectation is of pain and of hope when of pleasure andfurther there is reflection about the good or evil of them and embodied in a decree by the state is called law 
 cle i am hardly able to follow you proceed however as if i were 
 meg i am in the like case 
 ath let us look at the matter thus may we not conceive each ofus living beings to be a puppet of the gods either their playthingonly or created with a of the two we cannot certainlyknow but we do know that these affections in us are like cords andstrings which pull us different and opposite ways and to oppositeactions and herein lies the difference between virtue and to the argument there is one among these cords which everyman ought to grasp and never let go but to pull with it against allthe rest and this is the sacred and golden cord of reason calledby us the common law of the state there are others which are hard andof iron but this one is soft because golden and there are severalother kinds now we ought always to cooperate with the lead of thebest which is law for inasmuch as reason is beautiful and not violent her rule must needs have ministers in order to helpthe golden principle in vanquishing the other principles and thus themoral of the tale about our being puppets will not have been lost andthe meaning of the expression superior or inferior to a become clearer and the individual attaining to right reasonin this matter of pulling the strings of the puppet should liveaccording to its rule while the city receiving the same from somegod or from one who has knowledge of these things should embody it ina law to be her guide in her dealings with herself and with otherstates in this way virtue and vice will be more clearly distinguishedby us and when they have become clearer education and otherinstitutions will in like manner become clearer and in particularthat question of convivial entertainment which may seem have been a very trifling matter and to have taken a great manymore words than were necessary 
 cle perhaps however the theme may turn out not to be unworthyof the length of discourse 
 ath very good let us proceed with any enquiry which really bearson our present object 
 cle proceed 
 ath suppose that we give this puppet of ours will be theeffect on him 
 cle having what in view do you ask that question 
 ath nothing as yet but i ask generally when the puppet is broughtto the drink what sort of result is likely to follow i willendeavour to explain my meaning more clearly what i am now askingis the drinking of wine heighten and increase pleasuresand pains and passions and loves 
 cle very greatly 
 ath and are perception and memory and opinion and and increased do not these qualities entirely desert a manif he becomes saturated with drink 
 cle yes they entirely desert him 
 ath does he not return to the state of soul in which he was whena young child 
 cle he does 
 ath then at that time he will have the least control over himself 
 cle the least 
 ath and will he not be in a most wretched plight 
 cle most wretched 
 ath then not only an old man but also a drunkard becomes a secondtime a child 
 cle well said stranger 
 ath is there any argument which will prove to us that we ought toencourage the taste for drinking instead of doing all we can toavoid it 
 cle i suppose that there is you at any rate were just nowsaying that you were ready to maintain such a doctrine 
 ath true i was and i am ready still seeing that you have bothdeclared that you are anxious to hear me 
 cle to sure we are if only for the strangeness of the asserts that a man ought of his own accord to plunge intoutter degradation 
 ath are you speaking of the soul 
 cle yes 
 ath and what would you say about the body my friend are you notsurprised at any one of his own accord bringing upon himselfdeformity leanness ugliness decrepitude 
 cle certainly 
 ath yet when a man goes of his own accord to a shop andtakes medicine is he not aware that soon and for many daysafterwards he will be in a state of body which he would die ratherthan accept as the permanent condition of his life are not thosewho train in gymnasia at first beginning reduced to a state ofweakness 
 cle yes all that is well known 
 ath also that they go of their own accord for the sake of thesubsequent benefit 
 cle very good 
 ath and we may conceive this to be true in the same way of otherpractices 
 cle certainly 
 ath and the same view may be taken of the pastime of drinking we are right in supposing that the same good effect follows 
 cle to be sure 
 ath if such convivialities should turn out to have any advantageequal in importance to that of gymnastic they are in their verynature to be preferred to mere bodily exercise inasmuch as theyhave no accompaniment of pain 
 cle true but i hardly think that we shall be able to discoverany such benefits to be derived from them 
 ath that is just what we must endeavour to show and let me ask youa we not distinguish two kinds of fear which are verydifferent 
 cle what are they 
 ath there is the fear of expected evil 
 cle yes 
 ath and there is the fear of an evil reputation we are afraidof being thought evil because we do or say some dishonourablething which fear we and all men term shame 
 cle certainly 
 ath these are the two fears as i called them one of which isthe opposite of pain and other fears and the opposite also of thegreatest and most numerous sort of pleasures 
 cle very true 
 ath and does not the legislator and every one who is good foranything hold this fear in the greatest honour this is what he termsreverence and the confidence which is the reverse of this he termsinsolence and the latter he always deems to be a very great evil bothto individuals and to states 
 cle true 
 ath does not this kind of fear preserve us in many importantways what is there which so surely gives victory and safety in there are two things which give before fear of disgrace before friends 
 cle there are 
 ath then each of us should be fearless and also fearful and why weshould be either has now been determined 
 cle certainly 
 ath and when we want to make any one fearless we and the law bringhim face to face with many fears 
 cle clearly 
 ath and when we want to make him rightly fearful must we notintroduce him to shameless pleasures and train him to take up armsagainst them and to overcome them or does this principle apply tocourage only and must he who would be perfect in valour fight againstand overcome his own natural if he be unpractisedand inexperienced in such conflicts he will not be half the man whichhe might have are we to suppose that with temperance it isotherwise and that he who has never fought with the shameless andunrighteous temptations of his pleasures and lusts and conqueredthem in earnest and in play by word deed and act will still beperfectly temperate 
 cle a most unlikely supposition 
 ath suppose that some god had given a to men andthat the more a man drank of this the more he regarded himself atevery draught as a child of misfortune and that he fearedeverything happening or about to happen to him and that at last themost courageous of men utterly lost his presence of mind for a only came to himself again when he had slept off the influenceof the draught 
 cle but has such a draught stranger ever really been knownamong men 
 ath no but if there had been might not such a draught havebeen of use to the legislator as a test of courage might we not goand say to him o legislator whether you are legislating for thecretan or for any other state would you not like to have atouchstone of the courage and cowardice of your citizens 
 cle i should will be the answer of every one 
 ath and you would rather have a touchstone in which there is norisk and no great danger than the reverse 
 cle in that proposition every one may safely agree 
 ath and in order to make use of the draught you would lead themamid these imaginary terrors and prove them when the affection offear was working upon them and compel them to be and admonishing them and also honouring them butdishonouring any one who will not be persuaded by you to be in allrespects such as you command him and if he underwent the trial welland manfully you would let him go unscathed but if ill you wouldinflict a punishment upon him or would you abstain from using thepotion altogether although you have no reason for abstaining 
 cle he would be certain stranger to use the potion 
 ath this would be a mode of testing and training which would bewonderfully easy in comparison with those now in use and might beapplied to a single person or to a few or indeed to any he would do well who provided himself with the potion only ratherthan with any number of other things whether he preferred to be byhimself in solitude and there contend with his fears because hewas ashamed to be seen by the eye of man until he was perfect ortrusting to the force of his own nature and habits and believing thathe had been already disciplined sufficiently he did not hesitate totrain himself in company with any number of others and display hispower in conquering the irresistible change effected by virtue being such that he never in any instance fell intoany great unseemliness but was always himself and left off before hearrived at the last cup fearing that he like all other men might beovercome by the potion 
 cle yes stranger in that last case too he might equally showhis 
 ath let us return to the lawgiver and say to is certainly no such which man has either receivedfrom the gods or himself discovered for witchcraft has no place atour board but is there any potion which might serve as a test ofoverboldness and excessive and indiscreet boasting 
 cle i suppose that he will say that wine is such apotion 
 ath is not the effect of this quite the opposite of the effect ofthe other when a man drinks wine he begins to be better pleasedwith himself and the more he drinks the more he is filled full ofbrave hopes and conceit of his power and at last the string of histongue is loosened and fancying himself wise he is brimming overwith lawlessness and has no more fear or respect and is ready todo or say anything 
 cle i think that every one will admit the truth of yourdescription 
 meg certainly 
 ath now let us remember as we were saying that there are twothings which should be cultivated in the soul first the greatestcourage secondly the greatest fear 
 cle which you said to be characteristic of reverence if i am notmistaken 
 ath thank you for reminding me but now as the habit of courageand fearlessness is to be trained amid fears let us considerwhether the opposite quality is not also to be trained amongopposites 
 cle that is probably the case 
 ath there are times and seasons at which we are by nature more thancommonly valiant and bold now we ought to train ourselves on theseoccasions to be as free from impudence and shamelessness aspossible and to be afraid to say or suffer or do anything that isbase 
 cle true 
 ath are not the moments in which we are apt to be bold andshameless such as we are under the influence of pride ignorance avarice cowardice or when wealth and all the intoxicating workings of pleasure madden is better adapted than the festive use of wine in the firstplace to test and in the second place to train the character of aman if care be taken in the use of it what is there cheaper or moreinnocent for do but consider which is the greater yourather test a man of a morose and savage nature which is the sourceof ten thousand acts of injustice by making bargains with him at arisk to yourself or by having him as a companion at the festival ofdionysus or would you if you wanted to apply a touchstone to a manwho is prone to love entrust your wife or your sons or daughters tohim perilling your dearest interests in order to have a view of thecondition of his soul i might mention numberless cases in whichthe advantage would be manifest of getting to know a character insport and without paying dearly for experience and i do notbelieve that either a cretan or any other man will doubt that such atest is a fair test and safer cheaper and speedier than any other 
 cle that is certainly true 
 ath and this knowledge of the natures and habits of soulswill be of the greatest use in that art which has the management ofthem and that art if i am not mistaken is politics 
 cle exactly so

 book ii 
 
 athenian stranger and now we have to consider whether the insightinto human nature is the only benefit derived from well orderedpotations or whether there are not other advantages great and much tobe desired the argument seems to imply that there are but how and inwhat way these are to be attained will have to be consideredattentively or we may be entangled in error 
 cleinias proceed 
 ath let me once more recall our doctrine of right education i am not mistaken depends on the due regulation of convivialintercourse 
 cle you talk rather grandly 
 ath pleasure and pain i maintain to be the first perceptions ofchildren and i say that they are the forms under which virtue andvice are originally present to them as to wisdom and true and fixedopinions happy is the man who acquires them even when declining inyears and we may say that he who possesses them and the blessingswhich are contained in them is a perfect man now i mean by educationthat training which is given by suitable habits to the first instinctsof virtue in pleasure and friendship and pain andhatred are rightly implanted in souls not yet capable ofunderstanding the nature of them and who find them after they haveattained reason to be in harmony with her this harmony of thesoul taken as a whole is virtue but the particular training inrespect of pleasure and pain which leads you always to hate whatyou ought to hate and love what you ought to love from thebeginning of life to the end may be separated off and in my be rightly called education 
 cle i think stranger that you are quite right in all that youhave said and are saying about education 
 ath i am glad to hear that you agree with me for indeed thediscipline of pleasure and pain which when rightly ordered is aprinciple of education has been often relaxed and corrupted inhuman life and the gods pitying the toils which our race is bornto undergo have appointed holy festivals wherein men alternaterest with labour and have given them the muses and apollo the leaderof the muses and dionysus to be companions in their revels thatthey may improve their education by taking part in the festivals ofthe gods and with their help i should like to know whether acommon saying is in our opinion true to nature or not for men saythat the young of all creatures cannot be quiet in their bodies orin their voices they are always wanting to move and cry out someleaping and skipping and overflowing with sportiveness and delight atsomething others uttering all sorts of cries but whereas theanimals have no perception of order or disorder in their is of rhythm or harmony as they are called to us the as we say have been appointed to be our companions in the given the pleasurable sense of harmony and rhythm and so theystir us into life and we follow them joining hands together indances and songs and these they call choruses which is a termnaturally expressive of cheerfulness shall we begin then with theacknowledgment that education is first given through apollo and themuses what do you say 
 cle i assent 
 ath and the uneducated is he who has not been trained in thechorus and the educated is he who has been well trained 
 cle certainly 
 ath and the chorus is made up of two parts dance and song 
 cle true 
 ath then he who is well educated will be able to sing and dancewell 
 cle i suppose that he will 
 ath let us see what are we saying 
 cle what 
 ath he sings well and dances well now must we add that he singswhat is good and dances what is good 
 cle let us make the addition 
 ath we will suppose that he knows the good to be good and thebad to be bad and makes use of them accordingly which now is thebetter trained in dancing and who is able to move his bodyand to use his voice in what is understood to be the right manner buthas no delight in good or hatred of evil or he who is incorrect ingesture and voice but is right in his sense of pleasure and pain andwelcomes what is good and is offended at what is evil 
 cle there is a great difference stranger in the two kinds ofeducation 
 ath if we three know what is good in song and dance then wetruly know also who is educated and who is uneducated but if we certainly shall not know wherein lies the safeguard ofeducation and whether there is any or not 
 cle true 
 ath let us follow the scent like hounds and go in pursuit ofbeauty of figure and melody and song and dance if these escape will be no use in talking about true education whether hellenicor barbarian 
 cle yes 
 ath and what is beauty of figure or beautiful melody when a manlysoul is in trouble and when a cowardly soul is in similar case arethey likely to use the same figures and gestures or to give utteranceto the same sounds 
 cle how can they when the very colours of their faces differ 
 ath good my friend i may observe however in passing that inmusic there certainly are figures and there are melodies and music isconcerned with harmony and rhythm so that you may speak of a melodyor figure having good rhythm or good term is correctenough but to speak metaphorically of a melody or figure having colour as the masters of choruses do is not you can speak of the melodies or figures of the brave and thecoward praising the one and censuring the other and not to betedious let us say that the figures and melodies which are expressiveof virtue of soul or body or of images of virtue are withoutexception good and those which are expressive of vice are the reverseof good 
 cle your suggestion is excellent and let us answer that thesethings are so 
 ath once more are all of us equally delighted with every sort ofdance 
 cle far otherwise 
 ath what then leads us astray are beautiful things not thesame to us all or are they the same in themselves but not in ouropinion of them for no one will admit that forms of vice in the danceare more beautiful than forms of virtue or that he himself delightsin the forms of vice and others in a muse of another character andyet most persons say that the excellence of music is to give pleasureto our souls but this is intolerable and blasphemous there a much more plausible account of the delusion 
 cle what 
 ath the adaptation of art to the characters of men choricmovements are imitations of manners occurring in various particular is imitated and those towhom the words or songs or dances are suited either by nature orhabit or both cannot help feeling pleasure in them and applaudingthem and calling them beautiful but those whose natures or ways orhabits are unsuited to them cannot delight in them or applaud they call them base there are others again whose natures areright and their habits wrong or whose habits are right and theirnatures wrong and they praise one thing but are pleased atanother for they say that all these imitations are pleasant butnot good and in the presence of those whom they think wise theyare ashamed of dancing and singing in the baser manner or ofdeliberately lending any countenance to such proceedings and have a secret pleasure in them 
 cle very true 
 ath and is any harm done to the lover of vicious dances or any good done to the approver of the opposite sort of pleasure 
 cle i think that there is 
 ath i think is not the word but i would say rather i amcertain for must they not have the same effect as when a manassociates with bad characters whom he likes and approves rather thandislikes and only censures playfully because he has a suspicion ofhis own badness in that case he who takes pleasure in them willsurely become like those in whom he takes pleasure even though hebe ashamed to praise them and what greater good or evil can anydestiny ever make us undergo 
 cle i know of none 
 ath then in a city which has good laws or in future ages is tohave them bearing in mind the instruction and amusement which aregiven by music can we suppose that the poets are to be allowed toteach in the dance anything which they themselves like in the wayof rhythm or melody or words to the young children of parents is the poet to train his choruses as hepleases without reference to virtue or vice 
 cle that is surely quite unreasonable and is not to be thought of 
 ath and yet he may do this in almost any state with the exceptionof egypt 
 cle and what are the laws about music and dancing in egypt 
 ath you will wonder when i tell you long ago they appear to haverecognized the very principle of which we are now young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains ofvirtue these they fixed and exhibited the patterns of them intheir temples and no painter or artist is allowed to innovate uponthem or to leave the traditional forms and invent new ones to thisday no alteration is allowed either in these arts or in music atall and you will find that their works of art are painted ormoulded in the same forms which they had ten thousand is literally true and no ancientpaintings and sculptures are not a whit better or worse than thework of but are made with just the same skill 
 cle how extraordinary 
 ath i should rather say how statesmanlike how worthy of alegislator i know that other things in egypt are nat so well butwhat i am telling you about music is true and deserving ofconsideration because showing that a lawgiver may institutemelodies which have a natural truth and correctness without any fearof failure to do this however must be the work of god or of adivine person in egypt they have a tradition that their ancientchants which have been preserved for so many ages are thecomposition of the goddess isis and therefore as i was saying ifa person can only find in any way the natural melodies he mayconfidently embody them in a fixed and legal form for the love ofnovelty which arises out of pleasure in the new and weariness of theold has not strength enough to corrupt the consecrated song anddance under the plea that they have become antiquated at any are far from being corrupted in egypt 
 cle your arguments seem to prove your point 
 ath may we not confidently say that the true use of music and ofchoral festivities is as follows we rejoice when we think that weprosper and again we think that we prosper when we rejoice 
 cle exactly 
 ath and when rejoicing in our good fortune we are unable to bestill 
 cle true 
 ath our young men break forth into dancing and singing and wewho are their elders deem that we are fulfilling our part in life whenwe look on at them having lost our agility we delight in theirsports and because we love to think of our formerselves and gladly institute contests for those who are able to awakenin us the memory of our youth 
 cle very true 
 ath is it altogether unmeaning to say as the common people doabout festivals that he should be adjudged the wisest of men and thewinner of the palm who gives us the greatest amount of pleasure andmirth for on such occasions and when mirth is the order of theday ought not he to be honoured most and as i was saying bearthe palm who gives most mirth to the greatest number now is this atrue way of speaking or of acting 
 cle possibly 
 ath but my dear friend let us distinguish between differentcases and not be hasty in forming a judgment one way ofconsidering the question will be to imagine a festival at whichthere are entertainments of all sorts including gymnastic equestrian contests the citizens are assembled prizes areoffered and proclamation is made that any one who likes may enter thelists and that he is to bear the palm who gives the most pleasureto the is to be no regulation about the manner he who is most successful in giving pleasure is to be crownedvictor and deemed to be the pleasantest of the candidates what islikely to be the result of such a proclamation 
 cle in what respect 
 ath there would be various exhibitions one man like homer willexhibit a rhapsody another a performance on the lute one will have atragedy and another a comedy nor would there be anything astonishingin some one imagining that he could gain the prize by exhibiting suppose these competitors to meet and not these innumerable others as well can you tell me who ought to be thevictor 
 cle i do not see how any one can answer you or pretend to he has heard with his own ears the several competitors thequestion is absurd 
 ath well then if neither of you can answer shall i answer thisquestion which you deem so absurd 
 cle by all means 
 ath if very small children are to determine the question they willdecide for the puppet show 
 cle of course 
 ath the older children will be advocates of comedy educated young men and people in general will favour tragedy 
 cle very likely 
 ath and i believe that we old men would have the greatestpleasure in hearing a rhapsodist recite well the iliad and odyssey orone of the hesiodic poems and would award the victory to him would really be the is the question 
 cle yes 
 ath clearly you and i will have to declare that those whom we oldmen adjudge victors ought to win for our ways are far and away betterthan any which at present exist anywhere in the world 
 cle certainly 
 ath thus far i too should agree with the many that theexcellence of music is to be measured by pleasure but the pleasuremust not be that of chance persons the fairest music is that whichdelights the best and best educated and especially that whichdelights the one man who is in virtue and education andtherefore the judges must be men of character for they will requireboth wisdom and courage the true judge must not draw hisinspiration from the theatre nor ought he to be unnerved by theclamour of the many and his own incapacity nor again knowing thetruth ought he through cowardice and unmanliness carelessly todeliver a lying judgment with the very same lips which have justappealed to the gods before he judged he is sitting not as thedisciple of the theatre but in his proper place as theirinstructor and he ought to be the enemy of all pandering to thepleasure of the spectators the ancient and common custom of still prevails in italy and sicily did certainly leave thejudgment to the body of spectators who determined the victor byshow of hands but this custom has been the destruction of thepoets for they are now in the habit of composing with a view toplease the bad taste of their judges and the result is that thespectators instruct also it has been the ruin of thetheatre they ought to be having characters put before them betterthan their own and so receiving a higher pleasure but now by theirown act the opposite result follows what inference is to be drawnfrom all this shall i tell you 
 cle what 
 ath the inference at which we arrive for the third or fourth timeis that education is the constraining and directing of youthtowards that right reason which the law affirms and which theexperience of the eldest and best has agreed to be truly right inorder then that the soul of the child may not be habituated tofeel joy and sorrow in a manner at variance with the law and thosewho obey the law but may rather follow the law and rejoice and sorrowat the same things as the order i say to produce thiseffect chants appear to have been invented which really enchant andare designed to implant that harmony of which we speak and becausethe mind of the child is incapable of enduring serious are called plays and songs and are performed in play just aswhen men are sick and ailing in their bodies their attendants givethem wholesome diet in pleasant meats and drinks but unwholesome dietin disagreeable things in order that they may learn as they like the one and to dislike the other and similarly the truelegislator will persuade and if he cannot persuade will compelthe poet to express as he ought by fair and noble words in hisrhythms the figures and in his melodies the music of temperateand brave and in every way good men 
 cle but do you really imagine stranger that this is the way inwhich poets generally compose in states at the present day as faras i can observe except among us and among the are no regulations like those of which you speak in otherplaces novelties are always being introduced in dancing and inmusic generally not under the authority of any law but at theinstigation of lawless pleasures and these pleasures are so farfrom being the same as you describe the egyptian to be or having thesame principles that they are never the same 
 ath most true cleinias and i daresay that i may have expressedmyself obscurely and so led you to imagine that i was speaking ofsome really existing state of things whereas i was only saying whatregulations i would like to have about music and hence there occurreda misapprehension on your part for when evils are far gone andirremediable the task of censuring them is never pleasant althoughat times necessary but as we do not really differ will you let meask you whether you consider such institutions to be more prevalentamong the cretans and lacedaemonians than among the other hellenes 
 cle certainly they are 
 ath and if they were extended to the other hellenes would it be animprovement on the present state of things 
 cle a very great improvement if the customs which prevail amongthem were such as prevail among us and the lacedaemonians and such asyou were just now saying ought to prevail 
 ath let us see whether we understand one not theprinciples of education and music which prevail among you asfollows you compel your poets to say that the good man if he betemperate and just is fortunate and happy and this whether he begreat and strong or small and weak and whether he be rich or on the other hand if he have a wealth passing that of cinyras ormidas and be unjust he is wretched and lives in misery as thepoet says and with truth i sing not i care not about him whoaccomplishes all noble things not having justice let him near and stretches out his hand against his enemies be a justman but if he be unjust i would not have him look calmly uponbloody death nor surpass in swiftness the thracian boreas and letno other thing that is called good ever be his for the goods of whichthe many speak are not really good first in the catalogue is placedhealth beauty next wealth third and then innumerable others as forexample to have a keen eye or a quick ear and in general to haveall the senses perfect or again to be a tyrant and do as youlike and the final consummation of happiness is to have acquiredall these things and when you have acquired them to become at onceimmortal but you and i say that while to the just and holy all thesethings are the best of possessions to the unjust they are even health the greatest of evils for in truth to havesight and hearing and the use of the senses or to live at allwithout justice and virtue even though a man be rich in all goods of fortune is the greatest of evils if life beimmortal but not so great if the bad man lives only a very shorttime these are the truths which if i am not mistaken you willpersuade or compel your poets to utter with suitable accompaniments ofharmony and rhythm and in these they must train up your youth am inot right for i plainly declare that evils as they are termed aregoods to the unjust and only evils to the just and that goods aretruly good to the good but evil to the evil let me ask again areyou and i agreed about this 
 cle i think that we partly agree and partly do not 
 ath when a man has health and wealth and a tyranny which lasts andwhen he is preeminent in strength and courage and has the gift ofimmortality and none of the evils which goods but only the injustice and insolence of his own an one you are i suspect unwilling to believe that he ismiserable rather than happy 
 cle that is quite true 
 ath once more suppose that he be valiant and strong andhandsome and rich and does throughout his whole life whatever helikes still if he be unrighteous and insolent would not both of youagree that he will of necessity live basely you will surely grantso much 
 cle certainly 
 ath and an evil life too 
 cle i am not equally disposed to grant that 
 ath will he not live painfully and to his own disadvantage 
 cle how can i possibly say so 
 ath how then may heaven make us to be of one mind for now weare of two to me dear cleinias the truth of what i am saying isas plain as the fact that crete is an island and if i were alawgiver i would try to make the poets and all the citizens speakin this strain and i would inflict the heaviest penalties on anyone in all the land who should dare to say that there are bad menwho lead pleasant lives or that the profitable and gainful is onething and the just another and there are many other matters aboutwhich i should make my citizens speak in a manner different from thecretans and lacedaemonians of this age and i may say indeed fromthe world in general for tell me my good friends by zeus and apollotell me if i were to ask these same gods who were your the most just life also the pleasantest or are there two of which is the justest and the other the theywere to reply that there are two and thereupon i proceeded to would be the right way of pursuing the enquiry which are who lead the justest or those who lead thepleasantest life and they replied those who lead would be a very strange answer which i should notlike to put into the mouth of the gods the words will come withmore propriety from the lips of fathers and legislators and thereforei will repeat my former questions to one of them and suppose him tosay again that he who leads the pleasantest life is the to that i my father did you not wish me to live ashappily as possible and yet you also never ceased telling me that ishould live as justly as possible now here the giver of the he be legislator or father will be in a dilemma and willin vain endeavour to be consistent with himself but if he were todeclare that the justest life is also the happiest every onehearing him would enquire if i am not mistaken what is that good andnoble principle in life which the law approves and which issuperior to pleasure for what good can the just man have which isseparated from pleasure shall we say that glory and fame coming fromgods and men though good and noble are nevertheless infamy pleasant certainly not sweet legislator or shall wesay that the of wrong and there being no wrong done isgood and honourable although there is no pleasure in it and that thedoing wrong is pleasant but evil and base 
 cle impossible 
 ath the view which identifies the pleasant and the pleasant and thejust and the good and the noble has an excellent moral and religioustendency and the opposite view is most at variance with the designsof the legislator and is in his opinion infamous for no one if hecan help will be persuaded to do that which gives him more painthan pleasure but as distant prospects are apt to make us in childhood the legislator will try to purge away thedarkness and exhibit the truth he will persuade the citizens in someway or other by customs and praises and words that just and unjustare shadows only and that injustice which seems opposed tojustice when contemplated by the unjust and evil man appears pleasantand the just most unpleasant but that from the just point ofview the very opposite is the appearance of both of them 
 cle true 
 ath and which may be supposed to be the truer ofthe inferior or of the better soul 
 cle surely that of the better soul 
 ath then the unjust life must not only be more base and also more unpleasant than the just and holy life 
 cle that seems to be implied in the present argument 
 ath and even supposing this were otherwise and not as the argumenthas proven still the lawgiver who is worth anything if he everventures to tell a lie to the young for their good could not invent amore useful lie than this or one which will have a better effect inmaking them do what is right not on compulsion but voluntarily 
 cle truth stranger is a noble thing and a lasting but a thing ofwhich men are hard to be persuaded 
 ath and yet the story of the sidonian cadmus which is soimprobable has been readily believed and also innumerable othertales 
 cle what is that story 
 ath the story of armed men springing up after the sowing ofteeth which the legislator may take as a proof that he can persuadethe minds of the young of anything so that he has only to reflect andfind out what belief will be of the greatest public advantage andthen use all his efforts to make the whole community utter one and thesame word in their songs and tales and discourses all their life if you do not agree with me there is no reason why you should notargue on the other side 
 cle i do not see that any argument can fairly be raised by eitherof us against what you are now saying 
 ath the next suggestion which i have to offer is that all ourthree choruses shall sing to the young and tender souls of in their strains all the noble thoughts of which we havealready spoken or are about to speak and the sum of them shall the life which is by the gods deemed to be the happiest is alsothe shall affirm this to be a most certain truth and theminds of our young disciples will be more likely to receive thesewords of ours than any others which we might address to them 
 cle i assent to what you say 
 ath first will enter in their natural order the sacred choircomposed of children which is to sing lustily the layto the whole city next will follow the choir of young men under theage of thirty who will call upon the god paean to testify to thetruth of their words and will pray him to be gracious to the youthand to turn their hearts thirdly the choir of elder men who arefrom thirty to sixty years of age will also sing there remainthose who are too old to sing and they will tell the same virtues as with the voice of an oracle 
 cle who are those who compose the third choir stranger for i donot clearly understand what you mean to say about them 
 ath and yet almost all that i have been saying has said with a viewto them 
 cle will you try to be a little plainer 
 ath i was speaking at the commencement of our discourse as youwill remember of the fiery nature of young creatures i said thatthey were unable to keep quiet either in limb or voice and thatthey called out and jumped about in a disorderly manner and that noother animal attained to any perception of order but man only nowthe order of motion is called rhythm and the order of the voice inwhich high and low are duly mingled is called harmony and bothtogether are termed choric song and i said that the gods had pityon us and gave us apollo and the muses to be our playfellows andleaders in the dance and dionysus as i dare say that you willremember was the third 
 cle i quite remember 
 ath thus far i have spoken of the chorus of apollo and the i have still to speak of the remaining chorus which is that ofdionysus 
 cle how is that arranged there is something strange at any rateon first hearing in a dionysiac chorus of old men if you really meanthat those who are above thirty and may be fifty or from fifty tosixty years of age are to dance in his honour 
 ath very true and therefore it must be shown that there is goodreason for the proposal 
 cle certainly 
 ath are we agreed thus far 
 cle about what 
 ath that every man and boy slave and free both sexes and thewhole city should never cease charming themselves with the strains ofwhich we have spoken and that there should be every sort of changeand variation of them in order to take away the effect of sameness sothat the singers may always receive pleasure from their hymns and maynever weary of them 
 cle every one will agree 
 ath where then will that best part of our city which by reasonof age and intelligence has the greatest influence sing thesefairest of strains which are to do so much good shall we be sofoolish as to let them off who would give us the most beautiful andalso the most useful of songs 
 cle but says the argument we cannot let them off 
 ath then how can we carry out our purpose with decorum will thisbe the way 
 cle what 
 ath when a man is advancing in years he is afraid and reluctant has no pleasure in his own performances and if compulsion isused he will be more and more ashamed the older and more discreet not this true 
 cle certainly 
 ath well and will he not be yet more ashamed if he has to stand upand sing in the theatre to a mixed if moreover when heis required to do so like the other choirs who contend for have been trained under a singing master he is pinched andhungry he will certainly have a feeling of shame and discomfort whichwill make him very unwilling to exhibit 
 cle no doubt 
 ath how then shall we reassure him and get him to sing shall webegin by enacting that boys shall not taste wine at all until they areeighteen years of age we will tell them that fire must not bepoured upon fire whether in the body or in the soul until they beginto go to is a precaution which has to be taken against theexcitableness of they may taste wine in moderationup to the age of thirty but while a man is young he should abstainaltogether from intoxication and from excess of wine when at has reached forty years after dinner at a public mess he mayinvite not only the other gods but dionysus above all to the mysteryand festivity of the elder men making use of the wine which he hasgiven men to lighten the sourness of old age that in age we may renewour youth and forget our sorrows and also in order that the natureof the soul like iron melted in the fire may become softer and somore impressible in the first place will not any one who is thusmellowed be more ready and less ashamed to do not say beforea large audience but before a moderate company nor yet amongstrangers but among his familiars and as we have often said tochant and to enchant 
 cle he will be far more ready 
 ath there will be no impropriety in our using such a method ofpersuading them to join with us in song 
 cle none at all 
 ath and what strain will they sing and what muse will they strain should clearly be one suitable to them 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what strain is suitable for heroes shall they sing achoric strain 
 cle truly stranger we of crete and lacedaemon know no strainother than that which we have learnt and been accustomed to sing inour chorus 
 ath i dare say for you have never acquired the knowledge of themost beautiful kind of song in your military way of life which ismodelled after the camp and is not like that of dwellers in you have your young men herding and feeding together like youngcolts no one takes his own individual colt and drags him away fromhis fellows against his will raging and foaming and gives him agroom to attend to him alone and trains and rubs him downprivately and gives him the qualities in education which will makehim not only a good soldier but also a governor of a state and ofcities such an one as we said at first would be a greater warriorthan he of whom tyrtaeus sings and he would honour courageeverywhere but always as the fourth and not as the first part ofvirtue either in individuals or states 
 cle once more stranger i must complain that you depreciate ourlawgivers 
 ath not intentionally if at all my good friend but whither theargument leads thither let us follow for if there be indeed somestrain of song more beautiful than that of the choruses or thepublic theatres i should like to impart it to those who as we ashamed of these and want to have the best 
 cle certainly 
 ath when things have an accompanying charm either the best thingin them is this very charm or there is some rightness or utilitypossessed by example i should say that eating and the use of food in general have an accompanying charm which wecall pleasure but that this rightness and utility is just thehealthfulness of the things served up to us which is their truerightness 
 cle just so 
 ath thus too i should say that learning has a certainaccompanying charm which is the pleasure but that the right and theprofitable the good and the noble are qualities which the truthgives to it 
 cle exactly 
 ath and so in the imitative they succeed in makinglikenesses and are accompanied by pleasure may not their works besaid to have a charm 
 cle yes 
 ath but equal proportions whether of quality or quantity andnot pleasure speaking generally would give them truth or rightness 
 cle yes 
 ath then that only can be rightly judged by the standard ofpleasure which makes or furnishes no utility or truth or on the other hand is productive of any hurtful quality but existssolely for the sake of the accompanying charm and the term most appropriately applied to it when these other qualities areabsent 
 cle you are speaking of harmless pleasure are you not 
 ath yes and this i term amusement when doing neither harm norgood in any degree worth speaking of 
 cle very true 
 ath then if such be our principles we must assert thatimitation is not to be judged of by pleasure and false opinion andthis is true of all equality for the equal is not equal or thesymmetrical symmetrical because somebody thinks or likes they are to be judged of by the standard of truth and by no otherwhatever 
 cle quite true 
 ath do we not regard all music as representative and imitative 
 cle certainly 
 ath then when any one says that music is to be judged of bypleasure his doctrine cannot be admitted and if there be any musicof which pleasure is the criterion such music is not to be sought outor deemed to have any real excellence but only that other kind ofmusic which is an imitation of the good 
 cle very true 
 ath and those who seek for the best kind of song and music oughtnot to seek for that which is pleasant but for that which is the truth of imitation consists as we were saying in renderingthe thing imitated according to quantity and quality 
 cle certainly 
 ath and every one will admit that musical compositions are allimitative and representative will not poets and spectators and actorsall agree in this 
 cle they will 
 ath surely then he who would judge correctly must know what eachcomposition is for if he does not know what is the character andmeaning of the piece and what it represents he will never discernwhether the intention is true or false 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and will he who does not know what is true be able todistinguish what is good and bad my statement is not very perhaps you will understand me better if i put the matter inanother way 
 cle how 
 ath there are ten thousand likenesses of objects of sight 
 cle yes 
 ath and can he who does not know what the exact object is whichis imitated ever know whether the resemblance is truthfully mean for example whether a statue has the proportions of a the true situation of the parts what those proportions are andhow the parts fit into one another in due order also their coloursand conformations or whether this is all confused in the you think that any one can know about this who does not knowwhat the animal is which has been imitated 
 cle impossible 
 ath but even if we know that the thing pictured or sculptured isa man who has received at the hand of the artist all his proper partsand colours and shapes must we not also know whether the work isbeautiful or in any respect deficient in beauty 
 cle if this were not required stranger we should all of us bejudges of beauty 
 ath very true and may we not say that in everything in drawing music or any other art he who is to be acompetent judge must possess three must know in thefirst place of what the imitation is secondly he must know thatit is true and thirdly that it has been well executed in words andmelodies and rhythms 
 cle certainly 
 ath then let us not faint in discussing the peculiar difficultyof music music is more celebrated than any other kind of therefore requires the greatest care of them all for if a manmakes a mistake here he may do himself the greatest injury bywelcoming evil dispositions and the mistake may be very difficultto discern because the poets are artists very inferior in characterto the muses themselves who would never fall into the monstrous errorof assigning to the words of men the gestures and songs of after combining the melodies with the gestures of freemen wouldthey add on the rhythms of slaves and men of the baser sort with the rhythms and gestures of freemen would theyassign to them a melody or words which are of an opposite would they mix up the voices and sounds of animals and of menand instruments and every other sort of noise as if they were allone but human poets are fond of introducing this sort of inconsistentmixture and so make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of those orpheus says are ripe for true pleasure the experienced see allthis confusion and yet the poets go on and make still further havocby separating the rhythm and the figure of the dance from themelody setting bare words to metre and also separating the melodyand the rhythm from the words using the lyre or the flute when there are no words it is very difficult to recognize themeaning of the harmony and rhythm or to see that any worthy object isimitated by them and we must acknowledge that all this sort of aims only at swiftness and smoothness and a brutish noise anduses the flute and the lyre not as the mere accompaniments of thedance and song is exceedingly coarse and tasteless the use of eitherinstrument when unaccompanied leads to every sort of irregularityand trickery this is all rational enough but we are consideringnot how our choristers who are from thirty to fifty years of age andmay be over fifty are not to use the muses but how they are to usethem and the considerations which we have urged seem to show inwhat way these fifty choristers who are to sing may beexpected to be better trained for they need to have a quickperception and knowledge of harmonies and rhythms otherwise howcan they ever know whether a melody would be rightly sung to thedorian mode or to the rhythm which the poet has assigned to it 
 cle clearly they cannot 
 ath the many are ridiculous in imagining that they know what isin proper harmony and rhythm and what is not when they can only bemade to sing and step in rhythm by force it never occurs to them thatthey are ignorant of what they are doing now every melody is rightwhen it has suitable harmony and rhythm and wrong when unsuitable 
 cle that is most certain 
 ath but can a man who does not know a thing as we were that the thing is right 
 cle impossible 
 ath then now as would appear we are making the discovery that choristers whom we hereby invite and although theyare their own masters compel to sing must be educated to such anextent as to be able to follow the steps of the rhythm and the notesof the song that they may know the harmonies and rhythms and be ableto select what are suitable for men of their age and character tosing and may sing them and have innocent pleasure from their ownperformance and also lead younger men to welcome with dutiful delightgood dispositions having such training they will attain a moreaccurate knowledge than falls to the lot of the common people or evenof the poets themselves for the poet need not know the third whether the imitation is good or not though he can hardlyhelp knowing the laws of melody and rhythm but the aged chorus mustknow all the three that they may choose the best and that which isnearest to the best for otherwise they will never be able to charmthe souls of young men in the way of virtue and now the originaldesign of the argument which was intended to bring eloquent aid to thechorus of dionysus has been accomplished to the best of ourability and let us see whether we were should imagine that adrinking assembly is likely to become more and more tumultuous asthe drinking goes on this as we were saying at first will certainlybe the case 
 cle certainly 
 ath every man has a more than natural elevation his heart isglad within him and he will say anything and will be restrained bynobody at such a time he fancies that he is able to rule over himselfand all mankind 
 cle quite true 
 ath were we not saying that on such occasions the souls of thedrinkers become like iron heated in the fire and grow softer andyounger and are easily moulded by him who knows how to educate andfashion them just as when they were young and that this fashioner ofthem is the same who prescribed for them in the days of their the good legislator and that he ought to enact laws of thebanquet which when a man is confident bold and impudent andunwilling to wait his turn and have his share of silence and drinking and music will change his character into laws as will infuse into him a just and noble will take up arms at the approach of insolence being thatdivine fear which we have called reverence and shame 
 cle true 
 ath and the guardians of these laws and with themare the calm and sober generals of the drinkers and without theirhelp there is greater difficulty in fighting against drink than infighting against enemies when the commander of an army is nothimself calm and he who is unwilling to obey them and thecommanders of dionysiac feasts who are more than sixty years of suffer a disgrace as great as he who disobeys militaryleaders or even greater 
 cle right 
 ath if then drinking and amusement were regulated in this not the companions of our revels be improved they would partbetter friends than they were and not as now enemies their wholeintercourse would be regulated by law and observant of it and thesober would be the leaders of the drunken 
 cle i think so too if drinking were regulated as you propose 
 ath let us not then simply censure the gift of dionysus as badand unfit to be received into the state for wine has manyexcellences and one one about which there is adifficulty in speaking to the many from a fear of their misconceivingand misunderstanding what is said 
 cle to what do you refer 
 ath there is a tradition or story which has somehow crept aboutthe world that dionysus was robbed of his wits by his stepmotherhere and that out of revenge he inspires bacchic furies and dancingmadnesses in others for which reason he gave men wine suchtraditions concerning the gods i leave to those who think that theymay be safely uttered i only know that no animal at birth is matureor perfect in intelligence and in the intermediate period in whichhe has not yet acquired his own proper sense he rages and roarswithout rhyme or reason and when he has once got on his legs he jumpsabout without rhyme or reason and this as you will remember hasbeen already said by us to be the origin of music and gymnastic 
 cle to be sure i remember 
 ath and did we not say that the sense of harmony and rhythmsprang from this beginning among men and that apollo and the musesand dionysus were the gods whom we had to thank for them 
 cle certainly 
 ath the other story implied that wine was given man out of in order to make him mad but our present doctrine on thecontrary is that wine was given him as a balm and in order toimplant modesty in the soul and health and strength in the body 
 cle that stranger is precisely what was said 
 ath then half the subject may now be considered to have beendiscussed shall we proceed to the consideration of the other half 
 cle what is the other half and how do you divide the subject 
 ath the whole choral art is also in our view the whole ofeducation and of this art rhythms and harmonies form the partwhich has to do with the voice 
 cle yes 
 ath the movement of the body has rhythm in common with the movementof the voice but gesture is peculiar to it whereas song is simplythe movement of the voice 
 cle most true 
 ath and the sound of the voice which reaches and educates the have ventured to term music 
 cle we were right 
 ath and the movement of the body when regarded as an amusement wetermed dancing but when extended and pursued with a view to theexcellence of the body this scientific training may be calledgymnastic 
 cle exactly 
 ath music which was one half of the choral art may be said tohave been completely discussed shall we proceed to the other halfor not what would you like 
 cle my good friend when you are talking with a cretan andlacedaemonian and we have discussed music and not gymnastic whatanswer are either of us likely to make to such an enquiry 
 ath an answer is contained in your question and i understand andaccept what you say not only as an answer but also as a command toproceed with gymnastic 
 cle you quite understand me do as you say 
 ath i will and there will not be any difficulty in speakingintelligibly to you about a subject with which both of you are farmore familiar than with music 
 cle there will not 
 ath is not the origin of gymnastics too to be sought in thetendency to rapid motion which exists in all animals man as wewere saying having attained the sense of rhythm created and inventeddancing and melody arousing and awakening rhythm both unitedformed the choral art 
 cle very true 
 ath and one part of this subject has been already discussed byus and there still remains another to be discussed 
 cle exactly 
 ath i have first a final word to add to my discourse about you will allow me to do so 
 cle what more have you to say 
 ath i should say that if a city seriously means to adopt thepractice of drinking under due regulation and with a view to theenforcement of temperance and in like manner and on the sameprinciple will allow of other pleasures designing to gain thevictory over them in this way all of them may be used but if thestate makes drinking an amusement only and whoever likes may drinkwhenever he likes and with whom he likes and add to this any otherindulgences i shall never agree or allow that this city or this manshould practise drinking i would go further than the cretans andlacedaemonians and am disposed rather to the law of thecarthaginians that no one while he is on a campaign should be allowedto taste wine at all but that he should drink water during all thattime and that in the city no slave male or female should ever drinkwine and that no magistrates should drink during their year ofoffice nor should pilots of vessels or judges while on duty tastewine at all nor any one who is going to hold a consultation about anymatter of importance nor in the daytime at all unless in consequenceof exercise or as medicine nor again at night when any one eitherman or woman is minded to get children there are numberless othercases also in which those who have good sense and good laws oughtnot to drink wine so that if what i say is true no city will needmany vineyards their husbandry and their way of life in generalwill follow an appointed order and their cultivation of the vine willbe the most limited and the least common of their employments andthis stranger shall be the crown of my discourse about wine ifyou agree 
 cle excellent we agree

 book iii 
 
 athenian stranger enough of this and what then is to be regardedas the origin of government will not a man be able to judge of itbest from a point of view in which he may behold the progress ofstates and their transitions to good or evil 
 cleinias what do you mean 
 ath i mean that he might watch them from the point of view of observe the changes which take place in them during infinite ages 
 cle how so 
 ath why do you think that you can reckon the time which haselapsed since cities first existed and men were citizens of them 
 cle hardly 
 ath but are sure that it must be vast and incalculable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and have not thousands and thousands of cities come intobeing during this period and as many perished and has not each ofthem had every form of government many times over now growing smaller and again improving or declining 
 cle to be sure 
 ath let us endeavour to ascertain the cause of these changes forthat will probably explain the first origin and development of formsof government 
 cle very good you shall endeavour to impart your thoughts to we will make an effort to understand you 
 ath do you believe that there is any truth in ancient traditions 
 cle what traditions 
 ath the traditions about the many destructions of mankind whichhave been occasioned by deluges and pestilences and in many otherways and of the survival of a remnant 
 cle every one is disposed to believe them 
 ath let us consider one of them that which was caused by thefamous deluge 
 cle what are we to observe about it 
 ath i mean to say that those who then escaped would only be sparks of the human race preserved on the tops ofmountains 
 cle clearly 
 ath such survivors would necessarily be unacquainted with thearts and the various devices which are suggested to the dwellers incities by interest or ambition and with all the wrongs which theycontrive against one another 
 cle very true 
 ath let us suppose then that the cities in the plain and on were utterly destroyed at that time 
 cle very good 
 ath would not all implements have then perished and every otherexcellent invention of political or any other sort of wisdom haveutterly disappeared 
 cle why yes my friend and if things had always continued as theyare at present ordered how could any discovery have ever been madeeven in the least particular for it is evident that the arts wereunknown during ten thousand times ten thousand years and no more thana thousand or two thousand years have elapsed since the discoveries ofdaedalus orpheus and marsyas and olympus inventedmusic and amphion the to speak of numberless otherinventions which are but of yesterday 
 ath have you forgotten cleinias the name of a friend who isreally of yesterday 
 cle i suppose that you mean epimenides 
 ath the same my friend he does indeed far overleap the heads ofall mankind by his invention for he carried out in practice as youdeclare what of old hesiod only preached 
 cle yes according to our tradition 
 ath after the great destruction may we not suppose that thestate of man was something of this the beginning of thingsthere was a fearful illimitable desert and a vast expanse of land aherd or two of oxen would be the only survivors of the animal there might be a few goats these too hardly enough to maintainthe shepherds who tended them 
 cle true 
 ath and of cities or governments or legislation about which we arenow talking do you suppose that they could have any recollection atall 
 cle none whatever 
 ath and out of this state of things has there not sprung all thatwe now are and have cities and governments and arts and laws anda great deal of vice and a great deal of virtue 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath why my good friend how can we possibly suppose that those whoknew nothing of all the good and evil of cities could have attainedtheir full development whether of virtue or of vice 
 cle i understand your meaning and you are quite right 
 ath but as time advanced and the race multiplied the world cameto be what the world is 
 cle very true 
 ath doubtless the change was not made all in a moment but littleby little during a very long period of time 
 cle a highly probable supposition 
 ath at first they would have a natural fear ringing in theirears which would prevent their descending from the heights into theplain 
 cle of course 
 ath the fewness of the survivors at that time would have madethem all the more desirous of seeing one another but then the meansof travelling either by land or sea had been almost entirely i may say with the loss of the arts and there was greatdifficulty in getting at one another for iron and brass and allmetals were jumbled together and had disappeared in the chaos nor wasthere any possibility of extracting ore from them and they hadscarcely any means of felling timber even if you suppose that someimplements might have been preserved in the mountains they mustquickly have worn out and vanished and there would be no more of themuntil the art of metallurgy had again revived 
 cle there could not have been 
 ath in how many generations would this be attained 
 cle clearly not for many generations 
 ath during this period and for some time afterwards all thearts which require iron and brass and the like would disappear 
 cle certainly 
 ath faction and war would also have died out in those days and formany reasons 
 cle how would that be 
 ath in the first place the desolation of these primitive men wouldcreate in them a feeling of affection and towards oneanother and secondly they would have no occasion to quarrel abouttheir subsistence for they would have pasture in abundance exceptjust at first and in some particular cases and from they would obtain the greater part of their food in aprimitive age having plenty of milk and flesh moreover they wouldprocure other food by the chase not to be despised either in quantityor quality they would also have abundance of clothing and dwellings and utensils either capable of standing on the fireor not for the plastic and weaving arts do not require any use ofiron and god has given these two arts to man in order to providehim with all such things that when reduced to the last human race may still grow and increase hence in those daysmankind were not very poor nor was poverty a cause of differenceamong them and rich they could not have been having neither gold at that time was their condition and the community whichhas neither poverty nor riches will always have the noblestprinciples in it there is no insolence or injustice nor there any contentions or envyings and therefore they were also because they were what is called and when theywere told about good and evil they in their simplicity believedwhat they heard to be very truth and practised it no one had thewit to suspect another of a falsehood as men do now but what theyheard about gods and men they believed to be true and livedaccordingly and therefore they were in all respects such as we havedescribed them 
 cle that quite accords with my views and with those of my friendhere 
 ath would not many generations living on in a simple ruder perhaps and more ignorant of the arts in particular of those of land or naval warfare and likewise ofother arts termed in cities legal practices and party including all conceivable ways of hurting one another in wordand inferior to those who lived before the deluge orto the men of our day in these respects would they not i say besimpler and more manly and also more temperate and altogether morejust the reason has been already explained 
 cle very true 
 ath i should wish you to understand that what has preceded and whatis about to follow has been and will be said with the intentionof explaining what need the men of that time had of laws and whowas their lawgiver 
 cle and thus far what you have said has been very well said 
 ath they could hardly have wanted lawgivers as yet nothing of thatsort was likely to have existed in their days for they had no lettersat this early period they lived by habit and the customs of theirancestors as they are called 
 cle probably 
 ath but there was already existing a form of government which if iam not mistaken is generally termed a lordship and this stillremains in many places both among hellenes and barbarians and is thegovernment which is declared by homer to have prevailed among thecyclopes 
 they have neither councils nor judgments but they dwell in hollowcaves on the tops of high mountains and every one gives law to hiswife and children and they do not busy themselves about one another 
 cle that seems to be a charming poet of yours i have read someother verses of his which are very clever but i do not know muchof him for foreign poets are very little read among the cretans 
 megillus but they are in lacedaemon and he appears to be theprince of them all the manner of life however which he describes isnot spartan but rather ionian and he seems quite to confirm what youare saying when he traces up the ancient state of mankind by the helpof tradition to barbarism 
 ath yes he does confirm it and we may accept his witness to thefact that such forms of government sometimes arise 
 cle we may 
 ath and were not such states composed of men who had been dispersedin single habitations and families by the poverty which attended thedevastations and did not the eldest then rule among them becausewith them government originated in the authority of a father and amother whom like a flock of birds they followed forming onetroop under the patriarchal rule and sovereignty of their of all sovereignties is the most just 
 cle very true 
 ath after this they came together in greater numbers and increasedthe size of their cities and betook themselves to husbandry first ofall at the foot of the mountains and made enclosures of loose wallsand works of defence in order to keep off wild beasts thuscreating a single large and common habitation 
 cle yes at least we may suppose so 
 ath there is another thing which would probably happen 
 cle what 
 ath when these larger habitations grew up out of the lesseroriginal ones each of the lesser ones would survive in the family would be under the rule of the eldest and owing totheir separation from one another would have peculiar customs inthings divine and human which they would have received from theirseveral parents who had educated them and these customs would inclinethem to order when the parents had the element of order in theirnature and to courage when they had the element of courage and theywould naturally stamp upon their children and upon their their own likings and as we are saying they would findtheir way into the larger society having already their own peculiarlaws 
 cle certainly 
 ath and every man surely likes his own laws best and the laws ofothers not so well 
 cle true 
 ath then now we seem to have stumbled upon the beginnings oflegislation 
 cle exactly 
 ath the next step will be that these persons who have met select some arbiters who will review the laws of all of will publicly present such as they approve to the chiefs wholead the tribes and who are in a manner their kings allowing them tochoose those which they think best these persons will themselves becalled legislators and will appoint the magistrates framing somesort of aristocracy or perhaps monarchy out of the dynasties orlordships and in this altered state of the government they will live 
 cle yes that would be the natural order of things 
 ath then now let us speak of a third form of government inwhich all other forms and conditions of polities and cities concur 
 cle what is that 
 ath the form which in fact homer indicates as following the third form arose when as he says dardanus founded dardania 
 for not as yet had the holy ilium been built on the plain to be acity of speaking men but they were still dwelling at the foot indeed in these verses and in what he said of the cyclopes hespeaks the words of god and nature for poets are a divine race andoften in their strains by the aid of the muses and the graces theyattain truth 
 cle yes 
 ath then now let us proceed with the rest of our tale which willprobably be found to illustrate in some degree our we do so 
 cle by all means 
 ath ilium was built when they descended from the mountain in alarge and fair plain on a sort of low hill watered by many riversdescending from ida 
 cle such is the tradition 
 ath and we must suppose this event to have taken place many agesafter the deluge 
 ath a marvellous forgetfulness of the former destruction wouldappear to have come over them when they placed their town right undernumerous streams flowing from the heights trusting for their securityto not very high hills either 
 cle there must have been a long interval clearly 
 ath and as population increased many other cities would beginto be inhabited 
 cle doubtless 
 ath those cities made war against sea as well as that time men were ceasing to be afraid of the sea 
 cle clearly 
 ath the achaeans remained ten years and overthrew troy 
 cle true 
 ath and during the ten years in which the achaeans were besiegingilium the homes of the besiegers were falling into an evil youth revolted and when the soldiers returned to their owncities and families they did not receive them properly and as theyought to have done and numerous deaths murders exiles were theconsequence the exiles came again under a new name no longerachaeans but name which they derived from dorieus for itwas he who gathered them together the rest of the story is told byyou lacedaemonians as part of the history of sparta 
 meg to be sure 
 ath thus after digressing from the original subject of laws intomusic and the argument has providentially comeback to the same point and presents to us another handle for we havereached the settlement of lacedaemon which as you truly say is inlaws and in institutions the sister of crete and we are all thebetter for the digression because we have gone through variousgovernments and settlements and have been present at the foundationof a first second and third state succeeding one another ininfinite time and now there appears on the horizon a fourth stateor nation which was once in process of settlement and has continuedsettled to this day if out of all this we are able to discernwhat is well or ill settled and what laws are the salvation andwhat are the destruction of cities and what changes would make astate happy o megillus and cleinias we may now begin again unlesswe have some fault to find with the previous discussion 
 meg if some god stranger would promise us that our new enquiryabout legislation would be as good and full as the present i would goa great way to hear such another and would think that a day as longas we are now approaching the longest day of the tooshort for the discussion 
 ath then i suppose that we must consider this subject 
 meg certainly 
 ath let us place ourselves in thought at the moment when lacedaemonand argos and messene and the rest of the peloponnesus were all incomplete subjection megillus to your ancestors for afterwards asthe legend informs us they divided their army into three settled three cities argos messene lacedaemon 
 meg true 
 ath temenus was the king of argos cresphontes of and eurysthenes of lacedaemon 
 meg certainly 
 ath to these kings all the men of that day made oath that theywould assist them if any one subverted their kingdom 
 meg true 
 ath but can a kingship be destroyed or was any other form ofgovernment ever destroyed by any but the rulers themselves noindeed by zeus have we already forgotten what was said a littlewhile ago 
 meg no 
 ath and may we not now further confirm what was then mentioned forwe have come upon facts which have brought us back again to the sameprinciple so that in resuming the discussion we shall not beenquiring about an empty theory but about events which actuallyhappened the case was as royal heroes made oath tothree cities which were under a kingly government and the cities tothe kings that both rulers and subjects should govern and be governedaccording to the laws which were common to all of them the rulerspromised that as time and the race went forward they would not maketheir rule more arbitrary and the subjects said that if the rulersobserved these conditions they would never subvert or permit othersto subvert those kingdoms the kings were to assist kings andpeoples when injured and the peoples were to assist peoples and kingsin like manner is not this the fact 
 meg yes 
 ath and the three states to whom these laws were given whethertheir kings or any others were the authors of them had thereforethe greatest security for the maintenance of their constitutions 
 meg what security 
 ath that the other two states were always to come to the rescueagainst a rebellious third 
 meg true 
 ath many persons say that legislators ought to impose such lawsas the mass of the people will be ready to receive but this is justas if one were to command gymnastic masters or physicians to treator cure their pupils or patients in an agreeable manner 
 meg exactly 
 ath whereas the physician may often be too happy if he canrestore health and make the body whole without any very greatinfliction of pain 
 meg certainly 
 ath there was also another advantage possessed by the men of thatday which greatly lightened the task of passing laws 
 meg what advantage 
 ath the legislators of that day when they equalized the great accusation which generally arises in legislation ifa person attempts to disturb the possession of land or to abolishdebts because he sees that without this reform there can never be anyreal equality now in general when the legislator attempts to make anew settlement of such matters every one meets him with the cry is not to disturb vested with imprecationsthat he is introducing agrarian laws and cancelling of debts untila man is at his wits end whereas no one could quarrel with thedorians for distributing the was nothing to hinder as for debts they had none which were considerable or of oldstanding 
 meg very true 
 ath but then my good friends why did the settlement andlegislation of their country turn out so badly 
 meg how do you mean and why do you blame them 
 ath there were three kingdoms and of these two quicklycorrupted their original constitution and laws and the only one whichremained was the spartan 
 meg the question which you ask is not easily answered 
 ath and yet must be answered when we are enquiring about laws thisbeing our old sober game of play whereby we beguile the way asi was saying when we first set out on our journey 
 meg certainly and we must find out why this was 
 ath what laws are more worthy of our attention than those whichhave regulated such cities or what settlements of states aregreater or more famous 
 meg i know of none 
 ath can we doubt that your ancestors intended these institutionsnot only for the protection of peloponnesus but of all thehellenes in case they were attacked by the barbarian for theinhabitants of the region about ilium when they provoked by theirinsolence the trojan war relied upon the power of the assyrians andthe empire of ninus which still existed and had a great prestige thepeople of those days fearing the united assyrian empire just as we nowfear the great king and the second capture of troy was a seriousoffence against them because troy was a portion of the assyrianempire to meet the danger the single army was distributed betweenthree cities by the royal brothers sons of fair device asit seemed and a far better arrangement than the expedition againsttroy for firstly the people of that day had as they thought inthe heraclidae better leaders than the pelopidae in the next considered that their army was superior in valour to that whichwent against troy for although the latter conquered the were themselves conquered by the bydorians may we not suppose that this was the intention with which themen of those days framed the constitutions of their states 
 meg quite true 
 ath and would not men who had shared with one another many were governed by a single race of royal brothers and had takenthe advice of oracles and in particular of the delphian apollo belikely to think that such states would be firmly and lastinglyestablished 
 meg of course they would 
 ath yet these institutions of which such great expectations wereentertained seem to have all rapidly vanished away with theexception as i was saying of that small part of them which existedin this third part has never to this day ceased warringagainst the two others whereas if the original idea had been carriedout and they had agreed to be one their power would have beeninvincible in war 
 meg no doubt 
 ath but what was the ruin of this glorious confederacy here is asubject well worthy of consideration 
 meg certainly no one will ever find more striking instances oflaws or governments being the salvation or destruction of great andnoble interests than are here presented to his view 
 ath then now we seem to have happily arrived at a real andimportant question 
 meg very true 
 ath did you never remark sage friend that all men and weourselves at this moment often fancy that they see some beautifulthing which might have effected wonders if any one had only knownhow to make a right use of it in some way and yet this mode oflooking at things may turn out after all to be a mistake and notaccording to nature either in our own case or in any other 
 meg to what are you referring and what do you mean 
 ath i was thinking of my own admiration of the aforesaidheracleid expedition which was so noble and might have had suchwonderful results for the hellenes if only rightly used and i wasjust laughing at myself 
 meg but were you not right and wise in speaking as you did andwe in assenting to you 
 ath perhaps and yet i cannot help observing that any one whosees anything great or powerful immediately has the the owner only knew how to use his great and noblepossession how happy would he be and what great results would heachieve 
 meg and would he not be justified 
 ath reflect in what point of view does this sort of praiseappear just first in reference to the question in thethen commanders had known how to arrange their army properly howwould they have attained success would not this have been the would have bound them all firmly together and preserved themfor ever giving them freedom and dominion at pleasure combinedwith the power of doing in the whole world hellenic and they and their descendants desired what other aim would theyhave had 
 meg very good 
 ath suppose any one were in the same way to express hisadmiration at the sight of great wealth or family honour or the would praise them under the idea that through them he wouldattain either all or the greater and chief part of what he desires 
 meg he would 
 ath well now and does not the argument show that there is onecommon desire of all mankind 
 meg what is it 
 ath the desire which a man has that all things if anyrate things come to pass in accordance with his 
 meg certainly 
 ath and having this desire always and at every time of life inyouth in manhood in age he cannot help always praying for thefulfilment of it 
 meg no doubt 
 ath and we join in the prayers of our friends and ask for themwhat they ask for themselves 
 meg we do 
 ath dear is the son to the younger to the elder 
 meg of course 
 ath and yet the son often prays to obtain things which the fatherprays that he may not obtain 
 meg when the son is young and foolish you mean 
 ath yes or when the father in the dotage of age or the heat ofyouth having no sense of right and justice prays with fervour underthe influence of feelings akin to those of theseus when he cursedthe unfortunate hippolytus do you imagine that the son having asense of right and justice will join in his prayers 
 meg i understand you to mean that a man should not desire or bein a hurry to have all things according to his wish for his wishmay be at variance with his reason but every state and everyindividual ought to pray and strive for wisdom 
 ath yes and i remember and you will remember what i said atfirst that a statesman and legislator ought to ordain laws with aview to wisdom while you were arguing that the good lawgiver ought toorder all with a view to war and to this i replied that there werefour virtues but that upon your view one of them only was the aimof legislation whereas you ought to regard all virtue and especiallythat which comes first and is the leader of all the meanwisdom and mind and opinion having affection and desire in theirtrain and now the argument returns to the same point and i sayonce more in jest if you like or in earnest if you like that theprayer of a fool is full of danger being likely to end in theopposite of what he desires and if you would rather receive mywords in earnest i am willing that you should and you will find isuspect as i have said already that not cowardice was the cause ofthe ruin of the dorian kings and of their whole design norignorance of military matters either on the part of the rulers orof their subjects but their misfortunes were due to their generaldegeneracy and especially to their ignorance of the most importanthuman affairs that was then and is still and always will be thecase as i will endeavour if you will allow me to make out anddemonstrate as well as i am able to you who are my friends in thecourse of the argument 
 cle pray go on are troublesome but wewill show not in word but in deed how greatly we prize your we will give them our best attention and that is the way in whicha freeman best shows his approval or disapproval 
 meg excellent cleinias let us do as you say 
 cle by all means if heaven wills go on 
 ath well then proceeding in the same train of thought i say thatthe greatest ignorance was the ruin of the dorian power and that then ignorance is ruin and if this be true the legislator mustendeavour to implant wisdom in states and banish ignorance to theutmost of his power 
 cle that is evident 
 ath then now consider what is really the greatest ignorance ishould like to know whether you and megillus would agree with me inwhat i am about to say for my opinion is 
 cle what 
 ath that the greatest ignorance is when a man hates that which henevertheless thinks to be good and noble and loves and embracesthat which he knows to be unrighteous and evil this disagreementbetween the sense of pleasure and the judgment of reason in the soulis in my opinion the worst ignorance and also the greatest becauseaffecting the great mass of the human soul for the principle whichfeels pleasure and pain in the individual is like the mass or populacein a state and when the soul is opposed to knowledge or reason which are her natural lords that i call folly just asin the state when the multitude refuses to obey their rulers andthe laws or again in the individual when fair reasonings havetheir habitation in the soul and yet do no good but rather thereverse of good all these cases i term the worst ignorance whetherin individuals or in states you will understand stranger that iam speaking of something which is very different from the ignorance ofhandicraftsmen 
 cle yes my friend we understand and agree 
 ath let us then in the first place declare and affirm that thecitizen who does not know these things ought never to have any kind ofauthority entrusted to him he must be stigmatized as ignorant eventhough he be versed in calculation and skilled in all sorts ofaccomplishments and feats of mental dexterity and the opposite areto be called wise even although in the words of the proverb theyknow neither how to read nor how to swim and to them as to men ofsense authority is to be committed for o my friends how canthere be the least shadow of wisdom when there is no harmony there isnone but the noblest and greatest of harmonies may be truly said tobe the greatest wisdom and of this he is a partaker who livesaccording to reason whereas he who is devoid of reason is thedestroyer of his house and the very opposite of a saviour of thestate he is utterly ignorant of political wisdom let this i was saying be laid down by us 
 cle let it be so laid down 
 ath i suppose that there must be rulers and subjects in states 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what are the principles on which men rule and obey incities whether great or small and similarly in families what arethey and how many in number is there not one claim of authoritywhich is always of fathers and mothers and in general ofprogenitors to rule over their offspring 
 cle there is 
 ath next follows the principle that the noble should rule overthe ignoble and thirdly that the elder should rule and theyounger obey 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and fourthly that slaves should be ruled and their mastersrule 
 cle of course 
 ath fifthly if i am not mistaken comes the principle that thestronger shall rule and the weaker be ruled 
 cle that is a rule not to be disobeyed 
 ath yes and a rule which prevails very widely among all is according to nature as the theban poet pindar once said andthe sixth principle and the greatest of all is that the wise shouldlead and command and the ignorant follow and obey and yet o thoumost wise pindar as i should reply him this surely is not contraryto nature but according to nature being the rule of law over willingsubjects and not a rule of compulsion 
 cle most true 
 ath there is a seventh kind of rule which is awarded by lot and isdear to the gods and a token of good fortune he on whom the lot fallsis a ruler and he who fails in obtaining the lot goes away and is thesubject and this we affirm to be quite just 
 cle certainly 
 ath then now as we say playfully to any of those who lightlyundertake the making of laws you see legislator the principlesof government how many they are and that they are naturallyopposed to each other there we have discovered a ofseditions to which you must attend and first we will ask you toconsider with us how and in what respect the kings of argos andmessene violated these our maxims and ruined themselves and the greatand famous hellenic power of the olden time was it because they didnot know how wisely hesiod spoke when he said that the half is oftenmore than the whole his meaning was that when to take the wholewould be dangerous and to take the half would be the safe andmoderate course then the moderate or better was more than theimmoderate or worse 
 cle very true 
 ath and may we suppose this immoderate spirit to be more fatal whenfound among kings than when among peoples 
 cle the probability is that ignorance will be a disorder especiallyprevalent among kings because they lead a proud and luxurious life 
 ath is it not palpable that the chief aim of the kings of that timewas to get the better of the established laws and that they werenot in harmony with the principles which they had agreed to observe byword and oath this want of harmony may have had the appearance ofwisdom but was really as we assert the greatest ignorance andutterly overthrew the whole empire by dissonance and harsh discord 
 cle very likely 
 ath good and what measures ought the legislator to have then takenin order to avert this calamity truly there is no great wisdom inknowing and no great difficulty in telling after the evil hashappened but to have foreseen the remedy at the time would have takena much wiser head than ours 
 meg what do you mean 
 ath any one who looks at what has occurred with you may easily know and may easily say what ought to have beendone at that time 
 meg speak a little more clearly 
 ath nothing can be clearer than the observation which i am about tomake 
 meg what is it 
 ath that if any one gives too great a power to anything toolarge a sail to a vessel too much food to the body too muchauthority to the mind and does not observe the mean everything isoverthrown and in the wantonness of excess runs in the one case todisorders and in the other to injustice which is the child ofexcess i mean to say my dear friends that there is no soul ofman young and irresponsible who will be able to sustain thetemptation of arbitrary one who will not under suchcircumstances become filled with folly that worst of diseases andbe hated by his nearest and dearest friends when this happens hiskingdom is undermined and all his power vanishes from him andgreat legislators who know the mean should take heed of the danger asfar as we can guess at this distance of time what happened was asfollows 
 meg what 
 ath a god who watched over sparta seeing into the future gaveyou two families of kings instead of one and thus brought you morewithin the limits of moderation in the next place some humanwisdom mingled with divine power observing that the constitution ofyour government was still feverish and excited tempered your inbornstrength and pride of birth with the moderation which comes of the power of your elders equal with that of thekings in the most important matters but your third that your government was still swelling and foaming anddesirous to impose a curb upon it instituted the ephors whosepower he made to resemble that of magistrates elected by lot and bythis arrangement the kingly office being compounded of the rightelements and duly moderated was preserved and was the means ofpreserving all the rest since if there had been only the originallegislators temenus cresphontes and their contemporaries as far asthey were concerned not even the portion of aristodemus would havebeen preserved for they had no proper experience in legislation orthey would surely not have imagined that oaths would moderate ayouthful spirit invested with a power which might be converted intoa tyranny now that god has instructed us what sort of governmentwould have been or will be lasting there is no wisdom as i havealready said in judging after the event there is no difficulty inlearning from an example which has already occurred but if any onecould have foreseen all this at the time and had been able tomoderate the government of the three kingdoms and unite them into might have saved all the excellent institutions which were thenconceived and no persian or any other armament would have dared toattack us or would have regarded hellas as a power to be despised 
 cle true 
 ath there was small credit to us cleinias in defeating the discredit was not that the conquerors did not win gloriousvictories both by land and sea but what in my opinion broughtdiscredit was first of all the circumstance that of the three citiesone only fought on behalf of hellas and the two others were soutterly good for nothing that the one was waging a mighty waragainst lacedaemon and was thus preventing her from renderingassistance while the city of argos which had the precedence at thetime of the distribution when asked to aid in repelling thebarbarian would not answer to the call or give aid many thingsmight be told about hellas in connection with that war which are farfrom honourable nor indeed can we rightly say that hellasrepelled the invader for the truth is that unless the atheniansand lacedaemonians acting in concert had warded off the impendingyoke all the tribes of hellas would have been fused in a chaos ofhellenes mingling with one another of barbarians mingling withhellenes and hellenes with barbarians just as nations who are nowsubject to the persian power owing to unnatural separations andcombinations of them are dispersed and scattered and live cleinias and megillus are the reproaches which we have to makeagainst statesmen and legislators as they are called past andpresent if we would analyse the causes of their failure and find outwhat else might have been done we said for instance just there ought to be no great and unmixed powers and this was underthe idea that a state ought to be free and wise and harmonious andthat a legislator ought to legislate with a view to this end nor isthere any reason to be surprised at our continually proposing aims forthe legislator which appear not to be always the same but we shouldconsider when we say that temperance is to be the aim or wisdom is tobe the aim or friendship is to be the aim that all these aims arereally the same and if so a variety in the modes of expression oughtnot to disturb us 
 cle let us resume the argument in that spirit and now speaking offriendship and wisdom and freedom i wish that you would tell me atwhat in your opinion the legislator should aim 
 ath hear me then there are two mother forms of states fromwhich the rest may be truly said to be derived and one of them may becalled monarchy and the other democracy the persians have the highestform of the one and we of the other almost all the rest as i wassaying are variations of these now if you are to have liberty andthe combination of friendship with wisdom you must have both theseforms of government in a measure the argument emphatically declaresthat no city can be well governed which is not made up of both 
 cle impossible 
 ath neither the one if it be exclusively and excessivelyattached to monarchy nor the other if it be similarly attached tofreedom observes moderation but your states the laconian andcretan have more of it and the same was the case with theathenians and persians of old time but now they have less shall itell you why 
 cle by all means if it will tend to elucidate our subject 
 ath hear was a time when the persians had more ofthe state which is a mean between slavery and freedom in the reign ofcyrus they were freemen and also lords of many others the rulers gavea share of freedom to the subjects and being treated as equals thesoldiers were on better terms with their generals and showedthemselves more ready in the hour of danger and if there was any wiseman among them who was able to give good counsel he imparted hiswisdom to the public for the king was not jealous but allowed himfull liberty of speech and gave honour to those who could advisehim in any matter and the nation waxed in all respects because therewas freedom and friendship and communion of mind among them 
 cle that certainly appears to have been the case 
 ath how then was this advantage lost under cambyses and againrecovered under darius shall i try to divine 
 cle the enquiry no doubt has a bearing upon our subject 
 ath i imagine that cyrus though a great and patriotic general hadnever given his mind to education and never attended to the orderof his household 
 cle what makes you say so 
 ath i think that from his youth upwards he was a soldier andentrusted the education of his children to the women and they broughtthem up from their childhood as the favourites of fortune who wereblessed already and needed no more blessings they thought thatthey were happy enough and that no one should be allowed to opposethem in any way and they compelled every one to praise all thatthey said or did this was how they brought them up 
 cle a splendid education truly 
 ath such an one as women were likely to give them and especiallyprincesses who had recently grown rich and in the absence of the who were occupied in wars and dangers and had no time to lookafter them 
 cle what would you expect 
 ath their father had possessions of cattle and sheep and manyherds of men and other animals but he did not consider that thoseto whom he was about to make them over were not trained in his owncalling which was persian for the persians are of arugged land which is a stern mother and well fitted to producesturdy race able to live in the open air and go without sleep andalso to fight if fighting is required he did not observe that hissons were trained differently through the blessing of beingroyal they were educated in the median fashion by women and led to their becoming such as people do become when they arebrought up unreproved and so after the death of cyrus his the fulness of luxury and licence took the kingdom and firstone slew the other because he could not endure a rival the slayer himself mad with wine and brutality losthis kingdom through the medes and the eunuch as they called despised the folly of cambyses 
 cle so runs the tale and such probably were the facts 
 ath yes and the tradition says that the empire came back to thepersians through darius and the seven chiefs 
 cle true 
 ath let us note the rest of the story observe that darius was notthe son of a king and had not received a luxurious education when hecame to the throne being one of the seven he divided the countryinto seven portions and of this arrangement there are some shadowytraces still remaining he made laws upon the principle of introducinguniversal equality in the order of the state and he embodied in hislaws the settlement of the tribute which cyrus a feeling of friendship and community among all the attaching the people to him with money and gifts hence his armiescheerfully acquired for him countries as large as those which cyrushad left behind him darius was succeeded by his son xerxes and heagain was brought up in the royal and luxurious fashion might wenot most justly say o darius how came you to bring up xerxes in thesame way in which cyrus brought up cambyses and not to see hisfatal mistake for xerxes being the creation of the sameeducation met with much the same fortune as cambyses and from thattime until now there has never been a really great king among thepersians although they are all called great and their degeneracyis not to be attributed to chance as i maintain the reason is ratherthe evil life which is generally led by the sons of very rich androyal persons for never will boy or man young or old excel invirtue who has been thus educated and this i say is what thelegislator has to consider and what at the present moment has to beconsidered by us justly may you o lacedaemonians be praised inthat you do not give special honour or a special education to wealthrather than to poverty or to a royal rather than to a privatestation where the divine and inspired lawgiver has not originallycommanded them to be given for no man ought to have in a state because he surpasses others in wealth any more thanbecause he is swift of foot or fair or strong unless he have somevirtue in him nor even if he have virtue unless he have thisparticular virtue of temperance 
 meg what do you mean stranger 
 ath i suppose that courage is a part of virtue 
 meg to be sure 
 ath then now hear and judge for you like to havefor a or neighbour a very courageous man who had nocontrol over himself 
 meg heaven forbid 
 ath or an artist who was clever in his profession but a rogue 
 meg certainly not 
 ath and surely justice does not grow apart from temperance 
 meg impossible 
 ath any more than our pattern wise man whom we exhibited as havinghis pleasures and pains in accordance with and corresponding to truereason can be intemperate 
 meg no 
 ath there is a further consideration relating to the due andundue award of honours in states 
 meg what is it 
 ath i should like to know whether temperance without the othervirtues existing alone in the soul of man is rightly to be praisedor blamed 
 meg i cannot tell 
 ath and that is the best answer for whichever alternative youhad chosen i think that you would have gone wrong 
 meg i am fortunate 
 ath very good a quality which is a mere appendage of things whichcan be praised or blamed does not deserve an expression of is best passed over in silence 
 meg you are speaking of temperance 
 ath yes but of the other virtues that which having this appendageis also most beneficial will be most deserving of honour and nextthat which is beneficial in the next degree and so each of themwill be rightly honoured according to a regular order 
 meg true 
 ath and ought not the legislator to determine these classes 
 meg certainly he should 
 ath suppose that we leave to him the arrangement of details butthe general division of laws according to their importance into afirst and second and third class we who are lovers of law may makeourselves 
 meg very good 
 ath we maintain then that a state which would be safe andhappy as far as the nature of man allows must and ought todistribute honour and dishonour in the right way and the right way isto place the goods of the soul first and highest in the assuming temperance to be the condition of them and toassign the second place to the goods of the body and the thirdplace to money and property and it any legislator or state departsfrom this rule by giving money the place of honour or in any waypreferring that which is really last may we not say that he or thestate is doing an unholy and unpatriotic thing 
 meg yes let that be plainly declared 
 ath the consideration of the persian governments led us thus far toenlarge we remarked that the persians grew worse and worse and weaffirm the reason of this to have been that they too muchdiminished the freedom of the people and introduced too much ofdespotism and so destroyed friendship and community of feeling andwhen there is an end of these no longer do the governors govern onbehalf of their subjects or of the people but on behalf ofthemselves and if they think that they can gain ever so small anadvantage for themselves they devastate cities and send fire anddesolation among friendly races and as they hate ruthlessly andhorribly so are they hated and when they want the people to fightfor them they find no community of feeling or willingness to risktheir lives on their behalf their untold myriads are useless tothem on the field of battle and they think that their salvationdepends on the employment of mercenaries and strangers whom they if they were in want of more men and they cannot help beingstupid since they proclaim by actions that the ordinarydistinctions of right and wrong which are made in a state are atrifle when compared with gold and silver 
 meg quite true 
 ath and now enough of the persians and their presentmaladministration of their government which is owing to the excess ofslavery and despotism among them 
 meg good 
 ath next we must pass in review the government of attica in likemanner and from this show that entire freedom and the absence ofall superior authority is not by any means so good as government byothers when properly limited which was our ancient athenianconstitution at the time when the persians made their attack onhellas or speaking more correctly on the whole continent of were four classes arranged according to a property reverence was our queen and mistress and made us willing tolive in obedience to the laws which then prevailed also thevastness of the persian armament both by sea and on land caused ahelpless terror which made us more and more the servants of ourrulers and of the laws and for all these reasons an exceeding harmonyprevailed among us about ten years before the naval engagement atsalamis datis came leading a persian host by command of was expressly directed against the athenians and orders to carry them away captive and these orders he was toexecute under pain of death now datis and his myriads soon becamecomplete masters of eretria and he sent a fearful report to athensthat no eretrian had escaped him for the soldiers of datis had joinedhands and netted the whole of eretria and this report whether wellor ill founded was terrible to all the hellenes and above all to theathenians and they dispatched embassies in all directions but no onewas willing to come to their relief with the exception of thelacedaemonians and they either because they were detained by themessenian war which was then going on or for some other reason ofwhich we are not told came a day too late for the battle of a while the news arrived of mighty preparations being made andinnumerable threats came from the king then as time went on arumour reached us that darius had died and that his son who wasyoung and had come to the throne and was persisting in hisdesign the athenians were under the impression that the wholeexpedition was directed against them in consequence of the battleof marathon and hearing of the bridge over the hellespont and thecanal of athos and the host of ships considering that there was nosalvation for them either by land or by sea for there was no one tohelp them and remembering that in the first expedition when thepersians destroyed eretria no one came to their help or would riskthe danger of an alliance with them they thought that this wouldhappen again at least on land nor when they looked to the they descry any hope of salvation for they were attacked by athousand vessels and more one chance of safety remained slightindeed and desperate but their only one they saw that on theformer occasion they had gained a seemingly impossible victory andborne up by this hope they found that their only refuge was inthemselves and in the gods all these things created in them thespirit of friendship there was the fear of the moment and therewas that higher fear which they had acquired by obedience to theirancient laws and which i have several times in the precedingdiscourse called reverence of which the good man ought to be awilling servant and of which the coward is independent andfearless if this fear had not possessed them they would never havemet the enemy or defended their temples and sepulchres and theircountry and everything that was near and dear to them as they little by little they would have been all scattered and dispersed 
 meg your words athenian are quite true and worthy of yourselfand of your country 
 ath they are true megillus and to you who have inherited thevirtues of your ancestors i may properly speak of the actions of thatday and i would wish you and cleinias to consider whether my wordshave not also a bearing on legislation for i am not discoursingonly for the pleasure of talking but for the to remark that the experience both of ourselves and thepersians was in a certain sense the same for as they led theirpeople into utter servitude so we too led ours into all now how shall we proceed for i would like you to observe thatour previous arguments have good deal to say for themselves 
 meg true but i wish that you would give us a fuller explanation 
 ath i will under the ancient laws my friends the people wasnot as now the master but rather the willing servant of the laws 
 meg what laws do you mean 
 ath in the first place let us speak of the laws about to say such music as then order that we may trace thegrowth of the excess of freedom from the beginning now music wasearly divided among us into certain kinds and manners one sortconsisted of prayers to the gods which were called hymns and therewas another and opposite sort called lamentations and anothertermed paeans and another celebrating the birth of dionysus believe dithyrambs and they used the actual word laws ornomoi for another kind of song and to this they added the all these and others were duly distinguished norwere the performers allowed to confuse one style of music withanother and the authority which determined and gave judgment andpunished the disobedient was not expressed in a hiss nor in the mostunmusical shouts of the multitude as in our days nor in applause andclapping of hands but the directors of public instruction insistedthat the spectators should listen in silence to the end and boysand their tutors and the multitude in general were kept quiet by ahint from a stick such was the good order which the multitude werewilling to observe they would never have dared to give judgment bynoisy cries and then as time went on the poets themselvesintroduced the reign of vulgar and lawless innovation they were menof genius but they had no perception of what is just and lawful inmusic raging like bacchanals and possessed with lamentations with hymns and paeans with the sounds of the flute on the lyre and making onegeneral confusion ignorantly affirming that music has no whether good or bad can only be judged of rightly by thepleasure of the hearer and by composing such licentious works andadding to them words as licentious they have inspired the multitudewith lawlessness and boldness and made them fancy that they can judgefor themselves about melody and song and in this way the theatresfrom being mute have become vocal as though they had understanding ofgood and bad in music and poetry and instead of an aristocracy anevil sort of theatrocracy has grown up for if the democracy whichjudged had only consisted of educated persons no fatal harm wouldhave been done but in music there first arose the universal conceitof omniscience and general came followingafterwards and men fancying that they knew what they did not no longer any fear and the absence of fear begetsshamelessness for what is this shamelessness which is so evil athing but the insolent refusal to regard the opinion of the better byreason of an sort of liberty 
 meg very true 
 ath consequent upon this freedom comes the other freedom ofdisobedience to rulers and then the attempt to escape the control andexhortation of father mother elders and when near the end thecontrol of the laws also and at the very end there is the contempt ofoaths and pledges and no regard at all for the theyexhibit and imitate the old so called titanic nature and come tothe same point as the titans when they rebelled against god leading alife of endless evils but why have i said all this i ask becausethe argument ought to be pulled up from time to time and not beallowed to run away but held with bit and bridle and then we shallnot as the proverb says fall off our ass let us then once moreask the question to what end has all this been said 
 meg very good 
 ath this then has been said for the sake 
 meg of what 
 ath we were maintaining that the lawgiver ought to have threethings in view first that the city for which he legislates should befree and secondly be at unity with herself and thirdly should were our principles were they not 
 meg certainly 
 ath with a view to this we selected two kinds of government thedespotic and the other the most free and now we are consideringwhich of them is the right form we took a mean in both cases ofdespotism in the one and of liberty in the other and we saw thatin a mean they attained their perfection but that when they werecarried to the extreme of either slavery or licence neither partywere the gainers 
 meg very true 
 ath and that was our reason for considering the settlement of thedorian army and of the city built by dardanus at the foot of themountains and the removal of cities to the seashore and of ourmention of the first men who were the survivors of the deluge andall that was previously said about music and drinking and whatpreceded was said with the view of seeing how a state might be bestadministered and how an individual might best order his own life andnow megillus and cleinias how can we put to the proof the value ofour words 
 cle stranger i think that i see how a proof of their value maybe obtained this discussion of ours appears to me to have beensingularly fortunate and just what i at this moment want mostauspiciously have you and my friend megillus come in my way for iwill tell you what has happened to me and i regard the coincidence asa sort of omen the greater part of crete is going to send out acolony and they have entrusted the management of the affair to thecnosians and the cnosian government to me and nine others and theydesire us to give them any laws which we please whether taken fromthe cretan model or from any other and they do not mind about theirbeing foreign if they are better grant me then this favour whichwill also be a gain to us make a selection from whathas been said and then let us imagine a state of which we willsuppose ourselves to be the original founders thus we shall proceedwith our enquiry and at the same time i may have the use of theframework which you are constructing for the city which is incontemplation 
 ath good news cleinias if megillus has no objection you maybe sure that i will do all in my power to please you 
 cle thank you 
 meg and so will i 
 cle excellent and now let us begin to frame the state

 book iv 
 
 athenian stranger and now what will this city be i do not mean toask what is or will hereafter be the name of the place that may bedetermined by the accident of locality or of the original or fountain or some local deity may give the sanction of a nameto the city but i do want to know what the situationis whether maritime or inland 
 cleinias i should imagine stranger that the city of which weare speaking is about eighty stadia distant from the sea 
 ath and are there harbours on the seaboard 
 cle excellent harbours stranger there could not be better 
 ath alas what a prospect and is the surrounding countryproductive or in need of importations 
 cle hardly in need of anything 
 ath and is there any neighbouring state 
 cle none whatever and that is the reason for selecting theplace in days of old there was a migration of the inhabitants andthe region has been deserted from time immemorial 
 ath and has the place a fair proportion of hill and plain andwood 
 cle like the rest of crete in that 
 ath you mean to say that there is more rock than plain 
 cle exactly 
 ath then there is some hope that your citizens may be virtuous hadyou been on the sea and well provided with harbours and an importingrather than a producing country some mighty saviour would have beenneeded and lawgivers more than mortal if you were ever to have achance of preserving your state from degeneracy and discordance ofmanners but there is comfort in the eighty stadia although the seais too near especially if as you say the harbours are so we may be content the sea is pleasant enough as a dailycompanion but has indeed also a bitter and brackish the streets with merchants and shopkeepers and begetting inthe souls of men uncertain and unfaithful the stateunfriendly and unfaithful both to her own citizens and also toother nations there is a consolation therefore in the countryproducing all things at home and yet owing to the ruggedness ofthe soil not providing anything in great abundance had there beenabundance there might have been a great export trade and a greatreturn of gold and silver which as we may safely affirm has themost fatal results on a state whose aim is the attainment of justand noble sentiments this was said by us if you remember in theprevious discussion 
 cle i remember and am of opinion that we both were and are inthe right 
 ath well but let me ask how is the country supplied with timberfor 
 cle there is no fir of any consequence nor pine and not muchcypress and you will find very little or whichshipwrights always require for the interior of ships 
 ath these are also natural advantages 
 cle why so 
 ath because no city ought to be easily able to imitate itsenemies in what is mischievous 
 cle how does that bear upon any of the matters of which we havebeen speaking 
 ath remember my good friend what i said at first about the cretanlaws that they look to one thing only and this as you bothagreed was war and i replied that such laws in so far as theytended to promote virtue were good but in that they regarded apart only and not the whole of virtue i disapproved of them and nowi hope that you in your turn will follow and watch me if i legislatewith a view to anything but virtue or with a view to a part of virtueonly for i consider that the true lawgiver like an archer aims onlyat that on which some eternal beauty is always attending anddismisses everything else whether wealth or any other benefit whenseparated from virtue i was saying that the imitation of enemieswas a bad thing and i was thinking of a case in which a maritimepeople are harassed by enemies as the athenians were by minos i donot speak from any desire to recall past grievances but he as weknow was a great naval potentate who compelled the inhabitants ofattica to pay him a cruel tribute and in those days they had no shipsof war as they now have nor was the country filled and therefore they could not readily build them hencethey could not learn how to imitate their enemy at sea and in thisway becoming sailors themselves directly repel their enemies betterfor them to have lost many times over the seven youths than and stationary troops should have been turned intosailors and accustomed to be often leaping on shore and again tocome running back to their ships or should have fancied that therewas no disgrace in not awaiting the attack of an enemy and dyingboldly and that there were good reasons and plenty of them for aman throwing away his arms and betaking himself to isnot dishonourable as people say at certain times this is thelanguage of naval warfare and is anything but worthy of extraordinarypraise for we should not teach bad habits least of all to the bestpart of the citizens you may learn the evil of such a practice fromhomer by whom odysseus is introduced rebuking agamemnon because hedesires to draw down the ships to the sea at a time when theachaeans are hard pressed by the gets angry with him andsays 
 who at a time when the battle is in full cry biddest to drag ships into the sea that the prayers of the trojans maybe accomplished yet more and high ruin falls upon us for theachaeans will not maintain the battle when the ships are drawn intothe sea but they will look behind and will cease from strife in thatthe counsel which you give will prove see that he quite knew triremes on the sea in the neighbourhoodof fighting men to be an might be trained in that wayto fly from a herd of deer moreover naval powers which owe theirsafety to ships do not give honour to that sort of warlike excellencewhich is most deserving of it for he who owes his safety to the pilotand the captain and the oarsman and all sorts of rather inferiorpersons cannot rightly give honour to whom honour is due but howcan a state be in a right condition which cannot justly award honour 
 cle it is hardly possible i admit and yet stranger we cretansare in the habit of saying that the battle of salamis was thesalvation of hellas 
 ath why yes and that is an opinion which is widely spread bothamong hellenes and barbarians but megillus and i say rather that thebattle of marathon was the beginning and the battle of plataea thecompletion of the great deliverance and that these battles by landmade the hellenes better whereas the of salamis i may as well put them both them nobetter if i may say so without offence about the battles which helpedto save us and in estimating the goodness of a state we regardboth the situation of the country and the order of the that the mere preservation and continuance of life isnot the most honourable thing for men as the vulgar think but thecontinuance of the best life while we live and that again if i amjot mistaken is remark which has been made already 
 cle yes 
 ath then we have only to ask whether we are taking the course whichwe acknowledge to be the best for the settlement and legislation ofstates 
 cle the best by far 
 ath and now let me proceed to another question who are to be thecolonists may any one come out of all crete and is the idea that thepopulation in the several states is too numerous for the means ofsubsistence for i suppose that you are not going to send out ageneral invitation to any hellene who likes to come and yet i observethat to your country settlers have come from argos and aegina andother parts of hellas tell me then whence do you draw your recruitsin the present enterprise 
 cle they will come from all crete and of other will be most acceptable for as you truly are cretans of argive descent and the race of cretans which hasthe highest character at the present day is the gortynian and thishas come from gortys in the peloponnesus 
 ath cities find colonization in some respects easier if thecolonists are one race which like a swarm of bees is sent out froma single country either when friends leave friends owing to somepressure of population or other similar necessity or when a portionof a state is driven by factions to emigrate and there have beenwhole cities which have taken flight when utterly conquered by asuperior power in war this however which is in one way an advantageto the colonist or legislator in another point of view creates adifficulty there is an element of friendship in the community ofrace and language and language and laws and in common templesand rites of worship but colonies which are of this homogeneoussort are apt to kick against any laws or any form of constitutiondiffering from that which they had at home and although the badnessof their own laws may have been the cause of the factions whichprevailed among them yet from the force of habit they would fainpreserve the very customs which were their ruin and the leader of thecolony who is their legislator finds them troublesome andrebellious on the other hand the conflux of several populationsmight be more disposed to listen to new laws but then to make themcombine and pull together as they say of horses is a mostdifficult task and the work of years and yet there is nothingwhich tends more to the improvement of mankind than legislation andcolonization 
 cle no doubt but i should like to know why you say so 
 ath my good friend i am afraid that the course of myspeculations is leading me to say something depreciatory oflegislators but if the word be to the purpose there can be noharm and yet why am i disquieted for i believe that the sameprinciple applies equally to all human things 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath i was going to say that man never legislates but accidentsof all sorts which legislate for us in all sorts of ways theviolence of war and the hard necessity of poverty are constantlyoverturning governments and changing laws and the power of discasehas often caused innovations in the state when there have beenpestilences or when there has been a succession of bad seasonscontinuing during many years any one who sees all this naturallyrushes to the conclusion of which i was speaking that no mortallegislates in anything but that in human affairs chance is almosteverything and this may be said of the arts of the sailor and thepilot and the physician and the general and may seem to be wellsaid and yet there is another thing which may be said with equaltruth of all of them 
 cle what is it 
 ath that god governs all things and that chance and with him in the government of human affairs there a third and less extreme view that art should be there i should say that in a storm there must surely be a greatadvantage in having the aid of the art you would agree 
 cle yes 
 ath and does not a like principle apply to legislation as well asto other things even supposing all the conditions to be favourablewhich are needed for the happiness of the state yet the truelegislator must from time to time appear on the scene 
 cle most true 
 ath in each case the artist would be able to pray rightly forcertain conditions and if these were granted by fortune he wouldthen only require to exercise his art 
 cle certainly 
 ath and all the other artists just now mentioned if they werebidden to offer up each their special prayer would do so 
 cle of course 
 ath and the legislator would do likewise 
 cle i believe that he would 
 ath come legislator we will say to him what are theconditions which you require in a state before you can organize ought he to answer this question shall i give his answer 
 cle yes 
 ath he will me a state which is governed by a tyrant andlet the tyrant be young and have a good memory let him be quick atlearning and of a courageous and noble nature let him have thatquality which as i said before is the inseparable companion of allthe other parts of virtue if there is to be any good in them 
 cle i suppose megillus that this companion virtue of which thestranger speaks must be temperance 
 ath yes cleinias temperance in the vulgar sense not that whichin the forced and exaggerated language of some philosophers iscalled prudence but that which is the natural gift of children andanimals of whom some live continently and others incontinently butwhen isolated was as we said hardly worth reckoning in the catalogueof goods i think that you must understand my meaning 
 cle certainly 
 ath then our tyrant must have this as well as the otherqualities if the state is to acquire in the best manner and in theshortest time the form of government which is most conducive tohappiness for there neither is nor ever will be a better orspeedier way of establishing a polity than by a tyranny 
 cle by what possible arguments stranger can any man persuadehimself of such a monstrous doctrine 
 ath there is surely no difficulty in seeing cleinias what is inaccordance with the order of nature 
 cle you would assume as you say a tyrant who was quick at learning having a good memory courageous of anoble nature 
 ath yes and you must add fortunate and his good fortune must bethat he is the contemporary of a great legislator and that some happychance brings them together when this has been accomplished godhas done all that he ever does for a state which he desires to beeminently prosperous he has done second best for a state in whichthere are two such rulers and third best for a state in which thereare three the difficulty increases with the increase anddiminishes with the diminution of the number 
 cle you mean to say i suppose that the best government isproduced from a tyranny and originates in a good lawgiver and anorderly tyrant and that the change from such a tyranny into a perfectform of government takes place most easily less easily when from anoligarchy and in the third degree from a democracy is not thatyour meaning 
 ath not so i mean rather to say that the change is best made outof a tyranny and secondly out of a monarchy and thirdly out ofsome sort of democracy fourth in the capacity for improvement comesoligarchy which has the greatest difficulty in admitting of such achange because the government is in the hands of a number ofpotentates i am supposing that the legislator is by nature of thetrue sort and that his strength is united with that of the chiefmen of the state and when the ruling element is numerically at the same time very strong as in a tyranny there the change islikely to be easiest and most rapid 
 cle how i do not understand 
 ath and yet i have repeated what i am saying a good many times buti suppose that you have never seen a city which is under a tyranny 
 cle no and i cannot say that i have any great desire to see one 
 ath and yet where there is a tyranny you might certainly see thatof which i am now speaking 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that you might see how without trouble and in no verylong period of time the tyrant if he wishes can change themanners of a state he has only to go in the direction of virtue or ofvice whichever he prefers he himself indicating by his example thelines of conduct praising and rewarding some actions and reprovingothers and degrading those who disobey 
 cle but how can we imagine that the citizens in general will atonce follow the example set to them and how can he have this powerboth of persuading and of compelling them 
 ath let no one my friends persuade us that there is any quickerand easier way in which states change their laws than when therulers lead such changes never have nor ever will come to pass inany other way the real impossibility or difficulty is of anothersort and is rarely surmounted in the course of ages but when once itis surmounted ten thousand or rather all blessings follow 
 cle of what are you speaking 
 ath the difficulty is to find the divine love of temperate and justinstitutions existing in any powerful forms of government whetherin a monarchy or oligarchy of wealth or of birth you might as wellhope to reproduce the character of nestor who is said to haveexcelled all men in the power of speech and yet more in histemperance this however according to the tradition was in thetimes of troy in our own days there is nothing of the sort but ifsuch an one either has or ever shall come into being or is nowamong us blessed is he and blessed are they who hear the wise wordsthat flow from his lips and this may be said of power in the supreme power in man coincides with the greatest wisdom andtemperance then the best laws and the best constitution come intobeing but in no other way and let what i have been saying beregarded as a kind of sacred legend or oracle and let this be ourproof that in one point of view there may be a difficulty for a cityto have good laws but that there is another point of view in whichnothing can be easier or sooner effected granting our supposition 
 cle how do you mean 
 ath let us try to amuse ourselves old boys as we are bymoulding in words the laws which are suitable to your state 
 cle let us proceed without delay 
 ath then let us invoke god at the settlement of our state may hehear and be propitious to us and come and set in order the stateand the laws 
 cle may he come 
 ath but what form of polity are we going to give the city 
 cle tell us what you mean a little more clearly do you mean someform of democracy or oligarchy or aristocracy or monarchy for wecannot suppose that you would include tyranny 
 ath which of you will first tell me to which of these classes hisown government is to be referred 
 megillus ought i to answer first since i am the elder 
 cle perhaps you should 
 meg and yet stranger i perceive that i cannot say without morethought what i should call the government of lacedaemon for it seemsto me to be like a power of our ephors is marvellouslytyrannical and sometimes it appears to me to be of all cities themost democratical and who can reasonably deny that it is anaristocracy we have also a monarchy which is held for life and issaid by all mankind and not by ourselves only to be the most ancientof all monarchies and therefore when asked on a sudden i cannotprecisely say which form of government the spartan is 
 cle i am in the same difficulty megillus for i do not feelconfident that the polity of cnosus is any of these 
 ath the reason is my excellent friends that you really havepolities but the states of which we were just now speaking are merelyaggregations of men dwelling in cities who are the subjects andservants of a part of their own state and each of them is named afterthe dominant power they are not polities at all but if states are tobe named after their rulers the true state ought to be called bythe name of the god who rules over wise men 
 cle and who is this god 
 ath may i still make use of fable to some extent in the hopethat i may be better able to answer your question shall i 
 cle by all means 
 ath in the primeval world and a long while before the citiescame into being whose settlements we have described there is saidto have been in the time of cronos a blessed rule and life of whichthe of existing states is a copy 
 cle it will be very necessary to hear about that 
 ath i quite agree with you and therefore i have introduced thesubject 
 cle most appropriately and since the tale is to the point youwill do well in giving us the whole story 
 ath i will do as you suggest there is a tradition of the happylife of mankind in days when all things were spontaneous and of this the reason is said to have been as knewwhat we ourselves were declaring that no human nature invested withsupreme power is able to order human affairs and not overflow withinsolence and wrong which reflection led him to appoint not men butdemigods who are of a higher and more divine race to be the kingsand rulers of our cities he did as we do with flocks of sheep andother tame animals for we do not appoint oxen to be the lords ofoxen or goats of goats but we ourselves are a superior race andrule over them in like manner god in his love of mankind placedover us the demons who are a superior race and they with greatcase and pleasure to themselves and no less to us taking care us andgiving us peace and reverence and order and justice never the tribes of men happy and united and this tradition whichis true declares that cities of which some mortal man and not godis the ruler have no escape from evils and toils still we must doall that we can to imitate the life which is said to have existed inthe days of cronos and as far as the principle of immortality dwellsin us to that we must hearken both in private and public life andregulate our cities and houses according to law meaning by the veryterm law the distribution of mind but if either a single person oran oligarchy or a democracy has a soul eager after pleasures to be filled with them yet retaining none of perpetually afflicted with an endless and insatiable disorder andthis evil spirit having first trampled the laws under foot becomesthe master either of a state or of an as i wassaying salvation is hopeless and now cleinias we have toconsider whether you will or will not accept this tale of mine 
 cle certainly we will 
 ath you are you there are of said to be as manyforms of laws as there are of governments and of the latter we havealready mentioned all those which are commonly recognized now youmust regard this as a matter of importance for what isto be the standard of just and unjust is once more the point atissue men say that the law ought not to regard either militaryvirtue or virtue in general but only the interests and power andpreservation of the established form of government this is thought bythem to be the best way of expressing the natural definition ofjustice 
 cle how 
 ath justice is said by them to be the interest of the stronger 
 cle speak plainer 
 ath i they say the governing power makes whateverlaws have authority in any state 
 cle true 
 ath well they would add and do you suppose that tyranny ordemocracy or any other conquering power does not make thecontinuance of the power which is possessed by them the first orprincipal object of their laws 
 cle how can they have any other 
 ath and whoever transgresses these laws is punished as by the legislator who calls the laws just 
 cle naturally 
 ath this then is always the mode and fashion in which justiceexists 
 cle certainly if they are correct in their view 
 ath why yes this is one of those false principles of governmentto which we were referring 
 cle which do you mean 
 ath those which we were examining when we spoke of who ought togovern whom did we not arrive at the conclusion that parents ought togovern their children and the elder the younger and the noble theignoble and there were many other principles if you remember andthey were not always consistent one principle was this very principleof might and we said that pindar considered violence natural andjustified it 
 cle yes i remember 
 ath consider then to whom our state is to be entrusted for thereis a thing which has occurred times without number in states 
 cle what thing 
 ath that when there has been a contest for power those who gainthe upper hand so entirely monopolize the government as to refuse allshare to the defeated party and their live watchingone another the ruling class being in perpetual fear that some onewho has a recollection of former wrongs will come into power andrise up against them now according to our view such governments arenot polities at all nor are laws right which are passed for thegood of particular classes and not for the good of the whole which have such laws are not polities but parties and theirnotions of justice are simply unmeaning i say this because i amgoing to assert that we must not entrust the government in yourstate to any one because he is rich or because he possesses any otheradvantage such as strength or stature or again birth but he who ismost obedient to the laws of the state he shall win the palm andto him who is victorious in the first degree shall be given thehighest office and chief ministry of the gods and the second to himwho bears the second palm and on a similar principle shall all theother be assigned to those who come next in order and when i call therulers servants or ministers of the law i give them this name not forthe sake of novelty but because i certainly believe that upon suchservice or ministry depends the well or of the state forthat state in which the law is subject and has no authority iperceive to be on the highway to ruin but i see that the state inwhich the law is above the rulers and the rulers are the inferiors ofthe law has salvation and every blessing which the gods can confer 
 cle truly stranger you see with the keen vision of age 
 ath why yes every man when he is young has that sort of visiondullest and when he is old keenest 
 cle very true 
 ath and now what is to be the next step may we not suppose thecolonists to have arrived and proceed to make our speech to them 
 cle certainly 
 ath friends we say to as the old tradition in his hand the beginning middle and end of all that according to his nature in a straight line towards theaccomplishment of his end justice always accompanies him and isthe punisher of those who fall short of the divine law to justice hewho would be happy holds fast and follows in her company with allhumility and order but he who is lifted up with pride or elated bywealth or rank or beauty who is young and foolish and has a soulhot with insolence and thinks that he has no need of any guide orruler but is able himself to be the guide of others he i say isleft deserted of god and being thus deserted he takes to himothers who are like himself and dances about throwing all thingsinto confusion and many think that he is a great man but in ashort time he pays a penalty which justice cannot but approve andis utterly destroyed and his family and city with him that human things are thus ordered what should a wise man door think or not do or think 
 cle every man ought to make up his mind that he will be one ofthe followers of god there can be no doubt of that 
 ath then what life is agreeable to god and becoming in hisfollowers one only expressed once for all in the old saying agrees with like with measure measure but things which haveno measure agree neither with themselves nor with the things whichhave now god ought to be to us the measure of all things and notman as men commonly say protagoras the words are far more trueof him and he who would be dear to god must as far as is like him and such as he is wherefore the temperate man is thefriend of god for he is like him and the intemperate man is unlikehim and different from him and unjust and the same applies to otherthings and this is the conclusion which is also the noblest andtruest of all for the good man to offer sacrifice tothe gods and hold converse with them by means of prayers andofferings and every kind of service is the noblest and best of allthings and also the most conducive to a happy life and very fitand meet but with the bad man the opposite of this is true forthe bad man has an impure soul whereas the good is pure and from onewho is polluted neither good man nor god can without improprietyreceive gifts wherefore the unholy do only waste their much serviceupon the gods but when offered by any holy man such service ismost acceptable to them this is the mark at which we ought to what weapons shall we use and how shall we direct them in thefirst place we affirm that next after the olympian gods and thegods of the state honour should be given to the gods below theyshould receive everything in even and of the second choice and illomen while the odd numbers and the first choice and the things oflucky omen are given to the gods above by him who would rightlyhit the mark of piety next to these gods a wise man will doservice to the demons or spirits and then to the heroes and afterthem will follow the private and ancestral gods who are worshipped asthe law prescribes in the places which are sacred to them nextcomes the honour of living parents to whom as is meet we have topay the first and greatest and oldest of all debts considering thatall which a man has belongs to those who gave him birth and broughthim up and that he must do all that he can to minister to in his property secondly in his person and thirdly in hissoul in return for the endless care and travail which they bestowedupon him of old in the days of his infancy and which he is now topay back to them when they are old and in the extremity of their all his life long he ought never to utter or to have unbecoming word to them for of light and fleeting words thepenalty is most severe nemesis the messenger of justice isappointed to watch over all such matters when they are angry and wantto satisfy their feelings in word or deed he should give way to a father who thinks that he has been wronged by his son may bereasonably expected to be very angry at their death the mostmoderate funeral is best neither exceeding the customary expense noryet falling short of the honour which has been usually shown by theformer generation to their parents and let a man not forget to paythe yearly tribute of respect to the dead honouring them chiefly byomitting nothing that conduces to a perpetual remembrance of them andgiving a reasonable portion of his fortune to the dead doing living after this manner we shall receive our reward from thegods and those who are above us the demons and we shall spendour days for the most part in good hope and how a man ought toorder what relates to his descendants and his kindred and friendsand and the rites of hospitality taught by the intercourse which arises out of all these duties with aview to the embellishment and orderly regulation of his own i say the laws as we proceed with them will persuading and partly when natures do not yield to thepersuasion of custom chastising them by might and right and willthus render our state if the gods with us prosperousand happy but of what has to be said and must be said by thelegislator who is of my way of thinking and yet if said in theform of law would be out of this i think that he may givea sample for the instruction of himself and of those for whom he islegislating and then when as far as he is able he has gonethrough all the preliminaries he may proceed to the work oflegislation now what will be the form of such prefaces there may bea difficulty in including or describing them all under a singleform but i think that we may get some notion of them if we canguarantee one thing 
 cle what is that 
 ath i should wish the citizens to be as readily persuaded to virtueas possible this will surely be the aim of the legislator in allhis laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath the proposal appears to me to be of some value and i thinkthat a person will listen with more gentleness and to theprecepts addressed to him by the legislator when his soul is notaltogether unprepared to receive them even a little done in the wayof conciliation gains his ear and is always worth having for thereis no great inclination or readiness on the part of mankind to be madeas good or as quickly good as possible the case of the manyproves the wisdom of hesiod who says that the road to wickedness issmooth and can be travelled without perspiring because it is sovery short 
 but before virtue the immortal gods have placed the sweat of long and steep is the way thither and rugged at first but whenyou have reached the top although difficult before it is then easy 
 cle yes and he certainly speaks well 
 ath very true and now let me tell you the effect which thepreceding discourse has had upon me 
 cle proceed 
 ath suppose that we have a little conversation with the say to legislator speak if you know what we ought to sayand do you can surely tell 
 cle of course he can 
 ath did we not hear you just now saying that the legislator oughtnot to allow the poets to do what they liked for that they wouldnot know in which of their words they went against the laws to thehurt of the state 
 cle that is true 
 ath may we not fairly make answer to him on behalf of the poets 
 cle what answer shall we make to him 
 ath that the poet according to the tradition which has everprevailed among us and is accepted of all men when he sits down onthe tripod of the muse is not in his right mind like a allows to flow out freely whatever comes in and his art beingimitative he is often compelled to represent men of oppositedispositions and thus to contradict himself neither can he tellwhether there is more truth in one thing that he has said than inanother this is not the case in a law the legislator must give nottwo rules about the same thing but one only take an example fromwhat you have just been saying of three kinds of funerals there isone which is too extravagant another is too niggardly the third is amean and you choose and approve and order the last withoutqualification but if i had an extremely rich wife and she bade mebury her and describe her burial in a poem i should praise theextravagant sort and a poor miserly man who had not much money tospend would approve of the niggardly and the man of moderatemeans who was himself moderate would praise a moderate you in the capacity of legislator must not barely say amoderate funeral but you must define what moderation is and howmuch unless you are definite you must not suppose that you arespeaking a language that can become law 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is our legislator to have no preface to his laws but tosay at once do this avoid then holding the penalty interrorem to go on to another law offering never a word of advice orexhortation to those for whom he is legislating after the manner ofsome doctors for of doctors as i may remind you some have agentler others a ruder method of cure and as children ask the doctorto be gentle with them so we will ask the legislator to cure ourdisorders with the gentlest remedies what i mean to say is thatbesides doctors there are doctors servants who are also styleddoctors 
 cle very true 
 ath and whether they are slaves or freemen makes no acquire their knowledge of medicine by obeying and observingtheir masters empirically and not according to the natural way oflearning as the manner of freemen is who have learned scientificallythemselves the art which they impart scientifically to their are aware that there are these two classes of doctors 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and did you ever observe that there are two classes of patientsin states slaves and freemen and the slave doctors run about andcure the slaves or wait for them in the ofthis sort never talk to their patients individually or let themtalk about their own individual complaints the slave doctorprescribes what mere experience suggests as if he had exactknowledge and when he has given his orders like a tyrant herushes off with equal assurance to some other servant who is so he relieves the master of the house of the care of hisinvalid slaves but the other doctor who is a freeman attends andpractises upon freemen and he carries his enquiries far back andgoes into the nature of the disorder he enters into discourse withthe patient and with his friends and is at once getting informationfrom the sick man and also instructing him as far as he is he will not prescribe for him until he has first convinced him atlast when he has brought the patient more and more under hispersuasive influences and set him on the road to health he attemptsto effect a cure now which is the better way of proceeding in aphysician and in a trainer is he the better who accomplishes his endsin a double way or he who works in one way and that the ruder andinferior 
 cle i should say stranger that the double way is far better 
 ath should you like to see an example of the double and singlemethod in legislation 
 cle certainly i should 
 ath what will be our first law will not the the order of by making regulations for states about births 
 cle he will 
 ath in all states the birth of children goes back to the connectionof marriage 
 cle very true 
 ath and according to the true order the laws relating to marriageshould be those which are first determined in every state 
 cle quite so 
 ath then let me first give the law of marriage in a simple form itmay run as man shall marry between the ages of thirty or if he does not he shall pay such and such a fine orshall suffer the loss of such and such privileges this would be thesimple law about marriage the double law would run manshall marry between the ages of thirty and consideringthat in a manner the human race naturally partakes of every man is by nature inclined to desire to the utmost for thedesire of every man that he may become famous and not lie in thegrave without a name is only the love of continuance now mankind arecoeval with all time and are ever following and will ever course of time and so they are immortal because they children behind them and partake of immortality in theunity of generation and for a man voluntarily to deprive himself ofthis gift as he deliberately does who will not have a wife orchildren is impiety he who obeys the law shall be free and shallpay no fine but he who is disobedient and does not marry when hehas arrived at the age of shall pay a yearly fine of acertain amount in order that he may not imagine his celibacy to bringease and profit to him and he shall not share in the honours whichthe young men in the state give to the aged comparing now the twoforms of the law you will be able to arrive at a judgment about anyother they should be double in length even when they have to persuade as well as threaten or whether theyshall only threaten and be of half the length 
 meg the shorter form stranger would be more in accordance withlacedaemonian custom although for my own part if any one were toask me which i myself prefer in the state i should certainlydetermine in favour of the longer and i would have every law madeafter the same pattern if i had to choose but i think thatcleinias is the person to be consulted for his is the state whichis going to use these laws 
 cle thank you megillus 
 ath whether in the abstract words are to be many or few is avery foolish question the best form and not the shortest is to beapproved nor is length at all to be regarded of the two forms of lawwhich have been recited the one is not only twice as good inpractical usefulness as the other but the case is like that of thetwo kinds of doctors which i was just now mentioning and yetlegislators never appear to have considered that they have twoinstruments which they might use in andforce for in dealing with the rude and uneducated multitude they usethe one only as far as they can they do not mingle persuasion withcoercion but employ force pure and simple moreover there is a thirdpoint sweet friends which ought to be and never is regarded in ourexisting laws 
 cle what is it 
 ath a point arising out of our previous discussion which comesinto my mind in some mysterious way all this time from early dawnuntil noon have we been talking about laws in this charmingretreat now we are going to promulgate our laws and what haspreceded was only the prelude of them why do i mention this for all discourses and vocal exercises have preludes andovertures which are a sort of artistic beginnings intended to helpthe strain which is to be performed lyric measures and music of everyother kind have preludes framed with wonderful care but of thetruer and higher strain of law and politics no one has ever yetuttered any prelude or composed or published any as though there wasno such thing in nature whereas our present discussion seems to me toimply that there double laws of which we were speaking arenot exactly double but they are in two parts the law and the preludeof the law the arbitrary command which was compared to thecommands of doctors whom we described as of the meaner sort wasthe law pure and simple and that which preceded and was described byour friend here as being hortatory only was although in fact anexhortation likewise analogous to the preamble of a discourse fori imagine that all this language of conciliation which the legislatorhas been uttering in the preface of the law was intended to creategoodwill in the person whom he addressed in order that by reasonof this he might more intelligently receive his is to say the law and therefore in my way of speaking this ismore rightly described as the preamble than as the matter of thelaw and i must further proceed to observe that to all his to each separately the legislator should prefix a preamble heshould remember how great will be the difference between as they have or have not such preambles as in the casealready given 
 cle the lawgiver if he asks my opinion will certainly legislatein the form which you advise 
 ath i think that you are right cleinias in affirming that alllaws have preambles and that throughout the whole of this work oflegislation every single law should have a suitable preamble at thebeginning for that which is to follow is most important and it makesall the difference whether we clearly remember the preambles or we should be wrong in requiring that all laws small and greatalike should have preambles of the same kind any more than all songsor speeches although they may be natural to all they are notalways necessary and whether they are to be employed or not has ineach case to be left to the judgment of the speaker or the in the present instance of the lawgiver 
 cle that i think is most true and now stranger without delay letus return to the argument and as people say in play make a secondand better beginning if you please with the principles which we havebeen laying down which we never thought of regarding as a preamblebefore but of which we may now make a preamble and not merelyconsider them to be chance topics of discourse let us that we have a preamble about the honour of the gods and therespect of parents enough has been already said and we may proceedto the topics which follow next in order until the preamble is deemedby you to be complete and after that you shall go through the lawsthemselves 
 ath i understand you to mean that we have made a sufficientpreamble about gods and and about parents living or now you would have us bring the rest of the subject into the lightof day 
 cle exactly 
 ath after this as is meet and for the interest of us all i thespeaker and you the listeners will try to estimate all thatrelates to the souls and bodies and properties of the citizens asregards both their occupations and arrive as far as in us lies atthe nature of education these then are the topics which follow nextin order

 book v 
 
 athenian stranger listen all ye who have just now heard the lawsabout gods and about our dear all the things whicha man has next to the gods his soul is the most divine and mosttruly his own now in every man there are two parts the better andsuperior which rules and the worse and inferior which serves andthe ruling part of him is always to be preferred to the i am right in bidding every one next to the gods who areour masters and those who in order follow them the demons tohonour his own soul which every one seems to honour but no onehonours as he ought for honour is a divine good and no evil thing ishonourable and he who thinks that he can honour the soul by word orgift or any sort of compliance without making her in any way to honour her but honours her not at all for example everyman from his very boyhood fancies that he is able to knoweverything and thinks that he honours his soul by praising her andhe is very ready to let her do whatever she may like but i mean tosay that in acting thus he injures his soul and is far from honouringher whereas in our opinion he ought to honour her as second only tothe gods again when a man thinks that others are to be blamed andnot himself for the errors which he has committed from time totime and the many and great evils which befell him in is always fancying himself to be exempt and innocent he isunder the idea that he is honouring his soul whereas the very reverseis the fact for he is really injuring her and when disregarding theword and approval of the legislator he indulges in pleasure thenagain he is far from honouring her he only dishonours her andfills her full of evil and remorse or when he does not endure tothe end the labours and fears and sorrows and pains which thelegislator approves but gives way before them then by does not honour the soul but by all such conduct he makes her tobe dishonourable nor when he thinks that life at any price is a he honour her but yet once more he dishonours her for thesoul having a notion that the world below is all evil he yields toher and does not resist and teach or convince her that for aught sheknows the world of the gods below instead of being evil may bethe greatest of all goods again when any one prefers beauty tovirtue what is this but the real and utter dishonour of the soul forsuch a preference implies that the body is more honourable than thesoul and this is false for there is nothing of earthly birth whichis more honourable than the heavenly and he who thinks otherwise ofthe soul has no idea how greatly he undervalues this wonderfulpossession nor again when a person is willing or not unwilling toacquire dishonest gains does he then honour his soul with he sells her glory and honour for a small piece of all the gold which is under or upon the earth is not enough togive in exchange for virtue in a word i may say that he who does notestimate the base and evil the good and noble according to thestandard of the legislator and abstain in every possible way from theone and practise the other to the utmost of his power does not knowthat in all these respects he is most foully and disgracefully abusinghis soul which is the divinest part of man for no one as i may considers that which is declared to be the greatest penalty to grow into the likeness of bad men andgrowing like them to fly from the conversation of the good and be cutoff from them and cleave to and follow after the company of thebad and he who is joined to them must do and suffer what such menby nature do and say to one suffering which is not justicebut retribution for justice and the just are noble whereasretribution is the suffering which waits upon injustice and whether aman escape or endure this he is the former case becausehe is not cured while in the latter he perishes in order that therest of mankind may be saved 
 speaking generally our glory is to follow the better and improvethe inferior which is susceptible of improvement as far as this ispossible and of all human possessions the soul is by nature mostinclined to avoid the evil and track out and find the chief when a man has found he should take up his abode with it duringthe remainder of his life wherefore the soul also is second ornext to god in honour and third as every one will perceive comesthe honour of the body in natural order having determined this wehave next to consider that there is a natural honour of the that of honours some are true and some are counterfeit todecide which are which is the business of the legislator and he isuspect would intimate that they are as is not tobe given to the fair body or to the strong or the swift or thetall or to the healthy body although many may think more than to their opposites but the mean states of all thesehabits are by far the safest and most moderate for the one extrememakes the soul braggart and insolent and the other illiberal andbase and money and property and distinction all go to the sametune the excess of any of these things is apt to be a source ofhatreds and divisions among states and individuals and the defectof them is commonly a cause of slavery and therefore i would nothave any one fond of heaping up riches for the sake of his order that he may leave them as rich as possible for thepossession of great wealth is of no use either to them or to thestate the condition of youth which is free from flattery and atthe same time not in need of the necessaries of life is the bestand most harmonious of all being in accord and agreement with ournature and making life to be most entirely free from sorrow letparents then bequeath to their children not a heap of riches butthe spirit of reverence we indeed fancy that they will inheritreverence from us if we rebuke them when they show a want ofreverence but this quality is not really imparted to them by thepresent style of admonition which only tells them that the youngought always to be reverential a sensible legislator will ratherexhort the elders to reverence the younger and above all to take heedthat no young man sees or hears one of themselves doing or sayinganything disgraceful for where old men have no shame there young menwill most certainly be devoid of reverence the best way of trainingthe young is to train yourself at the same time not to admonish to be always carrying out your own admonitions in practice he whohonours his kindred and reveres those who share in the same godsand are of the same blood and family may fairly expect that thegods who preside over generation will be propitious to him and willquicken his seed and he who deems the services which his friendsand acquaintances do for him greater and more important than theythemselves deem them and his own favours to them less than theirsto him will have their in the intercourse of life andsurely in his relations to the state and his fellow citizens he is byfar the best who rather than the olympic or any other victory ofpeace or war desires to win the palm of obedience to the laws ofhis country and who of all mankind is the person reputed to haveobeyed them best through life in his relations to strangers a manshould consider that a contract is a most holy thing and that allconcerns and wrongs of strangers are more directly dependent on theprotection of god than wrongs done to citizens for the no kindred and friends is more to be pitied by gods and also he who is most able to avenge him is most zealousin his cause and he who is most able is the genius and the god of thestranger who follow in the train of zeus the god of strangers andfor this reason he who has a spark of caution in him will do hisbest to pass through life without sinning against the stranger and ofoffences committed whether against strangers or against suppliants is the greatest for the god who witnessedto the agreement made with the suppliant becomes in a specialmanner the guardian of the sufferer and he will certainly notsuffer unavenged 
 thus we have fairly described the manner in which a man is to actabout his parents and himself and his own affairs and in relationto the state and his friends and kindred both in what concernshis own countrymen and in what concerns the stranger we will nowconsider what manner of man he must be who would best pass throughlife in respect of those other things which are not matters of of praise and blame only in which praise and blame educate a make him more tractable and amenable to the laws which are aboutto be imposed 
 truth is the beginning of every good thing both to gods and he who would be blessed and happy should be from the first apartaker of the truth that he may live a true man as long aspossible for then he can be trusted but he is not to be trustedwho loves voluntary falsehood and he who loves involuntaryfalsehood is a fool neither condition is enviable for theuntrustworthy and ignorant has no friend and as time advances hebecomes known and lays up in store for himself isolation in crabbedage when life is on the wane so that whether his children or friendsare alive or not he is equally of honour is he whodoes no injustice and of more than twofold honour if he not onlydoes no injustice himself but hinders others from doing any thefirst may count as one man the second is worth many men because heinforms the rulers of the injustice of others and yet more highlyto be esteemed is he who with the rulers in correcting thecitizens as far as he shall be proclaimed the great and perfectcitizen and bear away the palm of virtue the same praise may begiven about temperance and wisdom and all other goods which may beimparted to others as well as acquired by a man for himself he whoimparts them shall be honoured as the man of men and he who iswilling yet is not able may be allowed the second place but hewho is jealous and will not if he can help allow others to partakein a friendly way of any good is deserving of blame the which he has is not to be undervalued by us because it ispossessed by him but must be acquired by us also to the utmost of ourpower let every man then freely strive for the prize of virtue andlet there be no envy for the unenvious nature increases the greatnessof himself contends in the race blasting the fair fame ofno man but the envious who thinks that he ought to get the better bydefaming others is less energetic himself in the pursuit of truevirtue and reduces his rivals to despair by his unjust slanders ofthem and so he makes the whole city to enter the arena untrained inthe practice of virtue and diminishes her glory as far as in himlies now every man should be valiant but he should also be the cruel or hardly curable or altogether incurable acts ofinjustice done to him by others a man can only escape by fighting anddefending himself and conquering and by never ceasing to punish no man who is not of a noble spirit is able to accomplish this asto the actions of those who do evil but whose evil is curable in thefirst place let us remember that the unjust man is not unjust ofhis own free will for no man of his own free will would choose topossess the greatest of evils and least of all in the most honourablepart of himself and the soul as we said is of a truth deemed by allmen the most honourable in the soul then which is the mosthonourable part of him no one if he could help would admit orallow to continue the greatest of evils the unrighteous and viciousare always to be pitied in any case and one can afford to forgiveas well as pity him who is curable and refrain and calm not getting into a passion like a woman and but upon him who is incapable of reformation and whollyevil the vials of our wrath should be poured out wherefore i saythat good men ought when occasion demands to be both gentle andpassionate 
 of all evils the greatest is one which in the souls of most men isinnate and which a man is always excusing in himself and nevercorrecting mean what is expressed in the saying that every man bynature is and ought to be his own friend whereas the excessivelove of self is in reality the source to each man of all offences forthe lover is blinded about the beloved so that he judges wrongly ofthe just the good and the honourable and thinks that he oughtalways to prefer himself to the truth but he who would be a great manought to regard not himself or his interests but what is the just act be his own or that of another through asimilar error men are induced to fancy that their own ignorance iswisdom and thus we who may be truly said to know nothing thinkthat we know all things and because we will not let others act for usin what we do not know we are compelled to act amiss let every man avoid excess of and condescend tofollow a better man than himself not allowing any false shame tostand in the way there are also minor precepts which are oftenrepeated and are quite as useful a man should recollect them andremind himself of them for when a stream is flowing out there shouldbe water flowing in too and recollection flows in while wisdom isdeparting therefore i say that a man should refrain from excesseither of laughter or tears and should exhort his neighbour to do thesame he should veil his immoderate sorrow or joy and seek tobehave with propriety whether the genius of his good fortuneremains with him or whether at the crisis of his fate when heseems to be mounting high and steep places the gods oppose him insome of his enterprises still he may ever hope in the case of goodmen that whatever afflictions are to befall them in the future godwill lessen and that present evils he will change for the better andas to the goods which are the opposite of these evils he will notdoubt that they will be added to them and that they will befortunate such should be hopes and such should be theexhortations with which they admonish one another never losing anopportunity but on every occasion distinctly reminding themselves andothers of all these things both in jest and earnest 
 enough has now been said of divine matters both as touching thepractices which men ought to follow and as to the sort of persons whothey ought severally to be but of human things we have not as yetspoken and we must for to men we are discoursing and not to and pains and desires are a part of human nature and onthem every mortal being must of necessity hang and depend with themost eager interest and therefore we must praise the noblest only as the fairest in appearance but as being one which if aman will only taste and not while still in his youth desert foranother he will find to surpass also in the very thing which we allof us mean in having a greater amount of pleasure and less ofpain during the whole of life and this will be plain if a man hasa true taste of them as will be quickly and clearly seen but what isa true taste that we have to learn from the pointbeing what is according to nature and what is not according tonature one life must be compared with another the more pleasurablewith the more painful after this desire to havepleasure but we neither desire nor choose pain and the neutral statewe are ready to take in exchange not for pleasure but for pain andwe also wish for less pain and greater pleasure but less pleasure andgreater pain we do not wish for and an equal balance of either wecannot venture to assert that we should desire and all these differor do not differ severally in number and magnitude and intensity andequality and in the opposites of these when regarded as objects ofchoice in relation to desire and such being the necessary order ofthings we wish for that life in which there are many great andintense elements of pleasure and pain and in which the pleasuresare in excess and do not wish for that in which the opposites again do we wish for that in which the clements of either aresmall and few and feeble and the pains exceed and when as i saidbefore there is a balance of pleasure and pain in life this is to beregarded by us as the balanced life while other lives are preferredby us because they exceed in what we like or are rejected by usbecause they exceed in what we dislike all the lives of men may beregarded by us as bound up in these and we must also consider whatsort of lives we by nature desire and if we wish for any others isay that we desire them only through some ignorance and inexperienceof the lives which actually exist 
 now what lives are they and how many in which having searched outand beheld the objects of will and desire and their opposites andmaking of them a law choosing i say the dear and the pleasant andthe best and noblest a man may live in the happiest way possible letus say that the temperate life is one kind of life and the rationalanother and the courageous another and the healthful another and tothese four let us oppose four other foolish the intemperate the diseased he who knows the temperate life willdescribe it as in all things gentle having gentle pains and gentlepleasures and placid desires and loves not insane whereas theintemperate life is impetuous in all things and has violent pains andpleasures and vehement and stinging desires and loves utterlyinsane and in the temperate life the pleasures exceed the in the intemperate life the pains exceed the pleasures ingreatness and number and frequency hence one of the two lives isnaturally and necessarily more pleasant and the other more he who would live pleasantly cannot possibly choose to liveintemperately and if this is true the inference clearly is that noman is voluntarily intemperate but that the whole multitude of menlack temperance in their lives either from ignorance or from want or both and the same holds of the diseased andhealthy life they both have pleasures and pains but in health thepleasure exceeds the pain and in sickness the pain exceeds thepleasure now our intention in choosing the lives is not that thepainful should exceed but the life in which pain is exceeded bypleasure we have determined to be the more pleasant life and weshould say that the temperate life has the elements both of pleasureand pain fewer and smaller and less frequent than the intemperate andthe wise life than the foolish life and the life of courage thanthe life of cowardice one of each pair exceeding in pleasure andthe other in pain the courageous surpassing the cowardly and thewise exceeding the foolish and so the one dass of lives exceeds theother class in pleasure the temperate and courageous and wise andhealthy exceed the cowardly and foolish and intemperate and diseasedlives and generally speaking that which has any virtue whether ofbody or soul is pleasanter than the vicious life and far superior inbeauty and rectitude and excellence and reputation and causes him wholives accordingly to be infinitely happier than the opposite 
 enough of the preamble and now the laws should follow or to speakmore correctly outline of them as then in the case of a web or anyother tissue the warp and the woof cannot be made of the samematerials but the warp is necessarily superior as being stronger andhaving a certain character of firmness whereas the woof is softer andhas a proper degree of a similar manner those who areto hold great offices in states should be distinguished truly in eachcase from those who have been but slenderly proven by education letus suppose that there are two parts in the constitution of a creation of offices the other the laws which are assigned to themto administer 
 but before all this comes the following or herdsman or breeder of horses or the like when he hasreceived his animals will not begin to train them until he has firstpurified them in a manner which befits a community of animals he willdivide the healthy and unhealthy and the good breed and the badbreed and will send away the unhealthy and badly bred to other tend the rest reflecting that his labours will be vain and haveno effect either on the souls or bodies of those whom nature andill nurture have corrupted and that they will involve indestruction the pure and healthy nature and being of every otheranimal if he should neglect to purify them now the case of otheranimals is not so are only worth introducing for thesake of illustration but what relates to man is of the highestimportance and the legislator should make enquiries and indicatewhat is proper for each one in the way of purification and of anyother procedure take for example the purification of a many kinds of purification some easier and others more some of them and the best and most difficult of them thelegislator if he be also a despot may be able to effect but thelegislator who not being a despot sets up a new government andlaws even if he attempt the mildest of purgations may thinkhimself happy if he can complete his work the best kind ofpurification is painful like similar cures in medicine involvingrighteous punishment and inflicting death or exile in the last in this way we commonly dispose of great sinners who areincurable and are the greatest injury of the whole state but themilder form of purification is as men who havenothing and are in want of food show a disposition to follow theirleaders in an attack on the property of the who are thenatural plague of the state are sent away by the legislator in afriendly spirit as far as he is able and this dismissal of them iseuphemistically termed a colony and every legislator shouldcontrive to do this at once our present case however is there is no need to devise any colony or purifying separationunder the circumstances in which we are placed but as when manystreams flow together from many sources whether springs or mountaintorrents into a single lake we ought to attend and take care thatthe confluent waters should be perfectly clear and in order to effectthis should pump and draw off and divert impurities so in everypolitical arrangement there may be trouble and danger but seeingthat we are now only discoursing and not acting let our selectionbe supposed to be completed and the desired purity attained touchingevil men who want to join and be citizens of our state after we havetested them by every sort of persuasion and for a sufficient will prevent them from coming but the good we will to the utmostof our ability receive as friends with open arms 
 another piece of good fortune must not be forgotten which as wewere saying the heraclid colony had and which is also wehave escaped division of land and the abolition of debts for theseare always a source of dangerous contention and a city which isdriven by necessity to legislate upon such matters can neither allowthe old ways to continue nor yet venture to alter them we musthave recourse to prayers so to speak and hope that a slight changemay be cautiously effected in a length of time and such a changecan be accomplished by those who have abundance of land and havingalso many debtors are willing in a kindly spirit to share withthose who are in want sometimes remitting and sometimes fast in a path of moderation and deeming poverty to be theincrease of a desires and not the diminution of his this is the great beginning of salvation to a state and upon thislasting basis may be erected afterwards whatever political order issuitable under the circumstances but if the change be based upon anunsound principle the future administration of the country will befull of difficulties that is a danger which as i am saying isescaped by us and yet we had better say how if we had not might have escaped and we may venture now to assert that noother way of escape whether narrow or broad can be devised butfreedom from avarice and a sense of this rock our cityshall be built for there ought to be no disputes among citizens aboutproperty if there are quarrels of long standing among them nolegislator of any degree of sense will proceed a step in thearrangement of the state until they are settled but that they to whomgod has given as he has to us to be the founders of a new state asyet free from they should create themselves enmities bytheir mode of distributing lands and houses would be superhuman follyand wickedness 
 how then can we rightly order the distribution of the land in thefirst place the number of the citizens has to be determined and alsothe number and size of the divisions into which they will have to beformed and the land and the houses will then have to be apportionedby us as fairly as we can the number of citizens can only beestimated satisfactorily in relation to the territory and theneighbouring states the territory must be sufficient to maintain acertain number of inhabitants in a moderate way of than thisis not required and the number of citizens should be sufficient todefend themselves against the injustice of their neighbours andalso to give them the power of rendering efficient aid to theirneighbours when they are wronged after having taken a survey oftheirs and their neighbours territory we will determine the limitsof them in fact as well as in theory and now let us proceed tolegislate with a view to perfecting the form and outline of our number of our citizens shall be this will be a convenientnumber and these shall be owners of the land and protectors of theallotment the houses and the land will be divided in the same way sothat every man may correspond to a lot let the whole number befirst divided into two parts and then into three and the number isfurther capable of being divided into four or five parts or anynumber of parts up to ten every legislator ought to know so mucharithmetic as to be able to tell what number is most likely to beuseful to all cities and we are going to take that number whichcontains the greatest and most regular and unbroken series ofdivisions the whole of number has every possible division and thenumber can be divided by exactly divisors and tenof these proceed without interval from one to ten this will furnishnumbers for war and peace and for all contracts and taxes and divisions of the land these properties ofnumber should be ascertained at leisure by those who are bound bylaw to know them for they are true and should be proclaimed at thefoundation of the city with a view to use whether the legislatoris establishing a new state or restoring an old and decayed one inrespect of gods and temples which are to be built ineach city and the gods or after whom they are to he be a man of sense he will make no change in anythingwhich the oracle of delphi or dodona or the god ammon or anyancient tradition has sanctioned in whatever manner whether byapparitions or reputed inspiration of heaven in obedience to whichmankind have established sacrifices in connection with mystic originating on the spot or derived from tyrrhenia or cyprus orsome other place and on the strength of which traditions they haveconsecrated oracles and images and altars and temples andportioned out a sacred domain for each of them the least part ofall these ought not to be disturbed by the legislator but he shouldassign to the several districts some god or or hero the distribution of the soil should give to these first theirchosen domain and all things fitting that the inhabitants of theseveral districts may meet at fixed times and that they may readilysupply their various wants and entertain one another with become friends and acquaintances for there is no greater goodin a state than that the citizens should be known to one another whennot light but darkness and ignorance of each charactersprevails among them no one will receive the honour of which he isdeserving or the power or the justice to which he is fairly in every state above all things every man should takeheed that he have no deceit in him but that he be always true andsimple and that no deceitful person take any advantage of him 
 the next move in our pastime of legislation like the withdrawalof the stone from the holy line in the game of draughts being anunusual one will probably excite wonder when mentioned for thefirst time and yet if a man will only reflect and weigh the matterwith care he will see that our city is ordered in a manner not the best is the second best perhaps also some one may notapprove this form because he thinks that such a constitution is illadapted to a legislator who has not despotic power the truth is thatthere are three forms of government the best the second and thethird best which we may just mention and then leave the selection tothe ruler of the settlement following this method in the presentinstance let us speak of the states which are respectively and third in excellence and then we will leave the choiceto cleinias now or to any one else who may hereafter have to make asimilar choice among constitutions and may desire to give to hisstate some feature which is congenial to him and which he approvesin his own country 
 the first and highest form of the state and of the government and ofthe law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancientsaying that friends have all things in common whether there isanywhere now or will ever be this communion of women and childrenand of property in which the private and individual is altogetherbanished from life and things which are by nature private such aseyes and ears and hands have become common and in some way see andhear and act in common and all men express praise and blame andfeel joy and sorrow on the same occasions and whatever laws there areunite the city to the all this is possible or not isay that no man acting upon any other principle will ever constitutea state which will be truer or better or more exalted in such a state is governed by gods or sons of gods one or morethan one happy are the men who living after this manner dwellthere and therefore to this we are to look for the pattern of thestate and to cling to this and to seek with all our might for onewhich is like this the state which we have now in hand when be nearest to immortality and the only one which takes the secondplace and after that by the grace of god we will complete the thirdone and we will begin by speaking of the nature and origin of thesecond 
 let the citizens at once distribute their land and houses and nottill the land in common since a community of goods goes beyondtheir proposed origin and nurture and education but in making thedistribution let the several possessors feel that their particularlots also belong to the whole city and seeing that the earth is theirparent let them tend her more carefully than children do theirmother for she is a goddess and their queen and they are hermortal subjects such also are the feelings which they ought toentertain to the gods and of the country and in orderthat the distribution may always remain they ought to considerfurther that the present number of families should be always neither increased nor diminished this may be secured for thewhole city in the following the possessor of a lot leavethe one of his children who is his best beloved and one only to bethe heir of his dwelling and his successor in the duty of ministeringto the gods the state and the family as well the living members ofit as those who are departed when he comes into the inheritance butof his other children if he have more than one he shall give thefemales in marriage according to the law to be hereafter the males he shall distribute as sons to those citizens who haveno children and are disposed to receive them or if there should benone such and particular individuals have too many children maleor female or too few as in the case of all these caseslet the highest and most honourable magistracy created by us judge anddetermine what is to be done with the redundant or deficient anddevise a means that the number of houses shall always remainthe same there are many ways of regulating numbers for they inwhom generation is affluent may be made to refrain and on theother hand special care may be taken to increase the number of birthsby rewards and stigmas or we may meet the evil by the elder mengiving advice and administering rebuke to the this waythe object may be attained and if after all there be very greatdifficulty about the equal preservation of the houses andthere be an excess of citizens owing to the too great love of thosewho live together and we are at our wits end there is still the olddevice often mentioned by us of sending out a colony which willpart friends with us and be composed of suitable persons if onthe other hand there come a wave bearing a deluge of disease or aplague of war and the inhabitants become much fewer than theappointed number by reason of bereavement we ought not to introducecitizens of spurious birth and education if this can be even god is said not to be able to fight against necessity 
 wherefore let us suppose this high argument of ours to addressus in the following of men cease not to honouraccording to nature similarity and equality and sameness andagreement as regards number and every good and noble quality all observe the aforesaid number throughout life in thesecond place do not disparage the small and modest proportions of theinheritances which you received in the distribution by buying andselling them to one another for then neither will the god who gaveyou the lot be your friend nor will the legislator and indeed thelaw declares to the disobedient that these are the terms upon which hemay or may not take the lot in the first place the earth as he isinformed is sacred to the gods and in the next place priests andpriestesses will offer up prayers over a first and second and even athird sacrifice that he who buys or sells the houses or lands whichhe has received may suffer the punishment which he deserves andthese their prayers they shall write down in the temples on tabletsof for the instruction of posterity moreover theywill set a watch over all these things that they may be which has the sharpest eyes shall keep watch that anyinfringement of these commands may be discovered and punished asoffences both against the law and the god how great is the benefit ofsuch an ordinance to all those cities which obey and are administeredaccordingly no bad man can ever know as the old proverb says butonly a man of experience and good habits for in such an order ofthings there will not be much opportunity for making money no maneither ought or indeed will be allowed to exercise any ignobleoccupation of which the vulgarity is a matter of reproach to afreeman and should never want to acquire riches by any such means 
 further the law enjoins that no private man shall be allowed topossess gold and silver but only coin for daily use which isalmost necessary in dealing with artisans and for payment ofhirelings whether slaves or immigrants by all those persons whorequire the use of them wherefore our citizens as we say shouldhave a coin passing current among themselves but not accepted amongthe rest of mankind with a view however to expeditions and journeysto other embassies or for any other occasion which mayarise of sending out a herald the state must also possess a commonhellenic currency if a private person is ever obliged to go him have the consent of the magistrates and go and if when hereturns he has any foreign money remaining let him give the surplusback to the treasury and receive a corresponding sum in the localcurrency and if he is discovered to appropriate it let it beconfiscated and let him who knows and does not inform be subject tocurse and dishonour equally him who brought the money and also to afine not less in amount than the foreign money which has beenbrought back in marrying and giving in marriage no one shall give orreceive any dowry at all and no one shall deposit money withanother whom he does not trust as a friend nor shall he lend moneyupon interest and the borrower should be under no obligation to repayeither capital or interest that these principles are best any onemay see who compares them with the first principle and intention ofa state the intention as we affirm of a reasonable statesman isnot what the many declare to be the object of a good that the state for the true interests of which he isadvising should be as great and as rich as possible and shouldpossess gold and silver and have the greatest empire by sea they imagine to be the real object of legislation at thesame time adding inconsistently that the true legislator desiresto have the city the best and happiest possible but they do not seethat some of these things are possible and some of them areimpossible and he who orders the state will desire what ispossible and will not indulge in vain wishes or attempts toaccomplish that which is impossible the citizen must indeed behappy and good and the legislator will seek to make him so butvery rich and very good at the same time he cannot be not atleast in the sense in which the many speak of riches for they meanby the rich the few who have the most valuable possessions althoughthe owner of them may quite well be a rogue and if this is true ican never assent to the doctrine that the rich man will be be good as well as rich and good in a high degree and rich in ahigh degree at the same time he cannot be some one will ask whynot and we shall acquisitions which come fromsources which are just and unjust indifferently are more thandouble those which come from just sources only and the sums which areexpended neither honourably nor disgracefully are only half asgreat as those which are expended honourably and on honourablepurposes thus if the one acquires double and spends half theother who is in the opposite case and is a good man cannot possibly bewealthier than he the am speaking of the saver and not of not always bad he may indeed in some cases be utterly as i was saying a good man he never is for he who receivesmoney unjustly as well as justly and spends neither nor be a rich man if he be also thrifty on the other hand theutterly bad is in general profligate and therefore very poor whilehe who spends on noble objects and acquires wealth by just meansonly can hardly be remarkable for riches any more than he can bevery poor our statement then is true that the very rich are notgood and if they are not good they are not happy but the intentionof our laws was that the citizens should be as happy as may be and asfriendly as possible to one another and men who are always at lawwith one another and amongst whom there are many wrongs done cannever be friends to one another but only those among whom crimesand lawsuits are few and slight therefore we say that gold and silverought not to be allowed in the city nor much of the vulgar sort oftrade which is carried on by lending money or rearing the meanerkinds of live stock but only the produce of agriculture and onlyso much of this as will not compel us in pursuing it to neglect thatfor the sake of which riches mean soul and body whichwithout gymnastics and without education will never be worthanything and therefore as we have said not once but many care of riches should have the last place in our thoughts forthere are in all three things about which every man has an the interest about money when rightly regarded is the thirdand lowest of them midway comes the interest of the body of all that of the soul and the state which we aredescribing will have been rightly constituted if it ordains honoursaccording to this scale but if in any of the laws which have beenordained health has been preferred to temperance or wealth to healthand temperate habits that law must clearly be wrong wherefore legislator ought often to impress upon himself do i want and do i attain my aim or do i miss themark in this way and in this way only he ma acquit himself andfree others from the work of legislation 
 let the allottee then hold his lot upon the conditions which we havementioned 
 it would be well that every man should come to the colony having allthings equal but seeing that this is not possible and one man willhave greater possessions than another for many reasons and inparticular in order to preserve equality in special crises of thestate qualifications of property must be unequal in order thatoffices and contributions and distributions may be proportioned to thevalue of each wealth and not solely to the virtue of hisancestors or himself nor yet to the strength and beauty of hisperson but also to the measure of his wealth or poverty and so bya law of inequality which will be in proportion to his wealth hewill receive honours and offices as equally as possible and therewill be no quarrels and disputes to which end there should be fourdifferent standards appointed according to the amount of should be a first and a second and a third and a fourth which the citizens will be placed and they will be called by theseor similar names they may continue in the same rank or pass intoanother in any individual case on becoming richer from being poorer from being richer the form of law which i should propose asthe natural sequel would be as a state which is desirousof being saved from the greatest of all faction butrather should exist among the citizens neitherextreme poverty nor again excess of wealth for both are productiveof both these evils now the legislator should determine what is to bethe limit of poverty or wealth let the limit of poverty be thevalue of the lot this ought to be preserved and no ruler nor anyone else who aspires after a reputation for virtue will allow the lotto be impaired in any case this the legislator gives as a he will permit a man to acquire double or triple or as much asfour times the amount of this but if a person have yet greaterriches whether he has found them or they have been given to he has made them in business or has acquired by any stroke offortune that which is in excess of the measure if he give back thesurplus to the state and to the gods who are the patrons of thestate he shall suffer no penalty or loss of reputation but if hedisobeys this our law any one who likes may inform against him andreceive half the value of the excess and the delinquent shall pay asum equal to the excess out of his own property and the other half ofthe excess shall belong to the gods and let every possession of everyman with the exception of the lot be publicly registered beforethe magistrates whom the law appoints so that all suits about moneymay be easy and quite simple 
 the next thing to be noted is that the city should be placed asnearly as possible in the centre of the country we should choose aplace which possesses what is suitable for a city and this may easilybe imagined and described then we will divide the city into twelveportions first founding temples to hestia to zeus and to a spot which we will call the acropolis and surround with acircular wall making the division of the entire city and countryradiate from this point the twelve portions shall be equalized by theprovision that those which are of good land shall be smaller whilethose of inferior quality shall be larger the number of the lotsshall be and each of them shall be divided into two and everyallotment shall be composed of two such sections one of land near thecity the other of land which is at a distance this arrangement shallbe carried out in the following manner the section which is nearthe city shall be added to that which is on borders and form one the portion which is next nearest shall be added to the portionwhich is next farthest and so of the rest moreover in the twosections of the lots the same principle of equalization of the soilought to be maintained the badness and goodness shall becompensated by more and less and the legislator shall divide thecitizens into twelve parts and arrange the rest of their property asfar as possible so as to form twelve equal parts and there shallbe a registration of all after this they shall assign twelve lotsto twelve gods and call them by their names and dedicate to each godtheir several portions and call the tribes after them and they shalldistribute the twelve divisions of the city in the same way in whichthey divided the country and every man shall have two in the centre of the country and the other at the of the manner of settlement 
 now we ought by all means to consider that there can never be such ahappy concurrence of circumstances as we have described neither canall things coincide as they are wanted men who will not takeoffence at such a mode of living together and will endure all theirlife long to have their property fixed at a moderate limit and tobeget children in accordance with our ordinances and will allowthemselves to be deprived of gold and other things which thelegislator as is evident from these enactments will certainly forbidthem and will endure further the situation of the land with thecity in the middle and dwellings round this is as if thelegislator were telling his dreams or making a city and citizens ofwax there is truth in these objections and therefore every oneshould take to heart what i am going to say once more then thelegislator shall appear and address my friends he will say tous do not suppose me ignorant that there is a certain degree oftruth in your words but i am of opinion that in matters which arenot present but future he who exhibits a pattern of that at whichhe aims should in nothing fall short of the fairest and truest andthat if he finds any part of this work impossible of execution heshould avoid and not execute it but he should contrive to carry outthat which is nearest and most akin to it you must allow thelegislator to perfect his design and when it is perfected you shouldjoin with him in considering what part of his legislation is expedientand what will arouse opposition for surely the artist who is to bedeemed worthy of any regard at all ought always to make his 
 having determined that there is to be a distribution into twelveparts let us now see in what way this may be accomplished there isno difficulty in perceiving that the twelve parts admit of thegreatest number of divisions of that which they include or inseeing the other numbers which are consequent upon them and areproduced out of them up to wherefore the law ought to orderphratries and demes and villages and also military ranks andmovements as well as coins and measures dry and liquid and as to be commensurable and agreeable to one another nor shouldwe fear the appearance of minuteness if the law commands that all thevessels which a man possesses should have a common measure when weconsider generally that the divisions and variations of numbers have ause in respect of all the variations of which they are in themselves and as measures of height and depth and in allsounds and in motions as well those which proceed in a straightdirection upwards or downwards as in those which go round and legislator is to consider all these things and to bid thecitizens as far as possible not to lose sight of numerical no single instrument of youthful education has such mightypower both as regards domestic economy and politics and in the the study of arithmetic above all arithmetic stirs up him whois by nature sleepy and dull and makes him quick to learn and aided by art divine he makes progress quite beyond hisnatural powers all such things if only the legislator by other lawsand institutions can banish meanness and covetousness from thesouls of men so that they can use them properly and to their owngood will be excellent and suitable instruments of education butif he cannot he will unintentionally create in them instead ofwisdom the habit of craft which evil tendency may be observed in theegyptians and phoenicians and many other races through the generalvulgarity of their pursuits and acquisitions whether some unworthylegislator theirs has been the cause or some impediment of chanceor nature for we must not fail to observe o megillus and there is a difference in places and that some beget better menand others worse and we must legislate accordingly some places aresubject to strange and fatal influences by reason of diverse winds andviolent heats some by reason of waters or again from the characterof the food given by the earth which not only affects the bodies ofmen for good or evil but produces similar results in their souls andin all such qualities those spots excel in which there is a divineinspiration and in which the have their appointed lots andare propitious not adverse to the settlers in them to all thesematters the legislator if he have any sense in him will attend asfar as man can and frame his laws accordingly and this is whatyou cleinias must do and to matters of this kind you must turn yourmind since you are going to colonize a new country 
 cleinias your words athenian stranger are excellent and i will do as you say

 book vi 
 
 athenian stranger and now having made an end of the preliminarieswe will proceed to the appointment of magistracies 
 cleinias very good 
 ath in the ordering of a state there are two parts first thenumber of the magistracies and the mode of establishing them when they have been established laws again will have tobe provided for each of them suitable in nature and number butbefore electing the magistrates let us stop a little and say a word inseason about the election of them 
 cle what have you got to say 
 ath this is what i have to say every one can see that althoughthe work of legislation is a most important matter yet if city superadd to good laws unsuitable offices not onlywill there be no use in having the good only will they beridiculous and useless but the greatest political injury and evilwill accrue from them 
 cle of course 
 ath then now my friend let us observe what will happen in theconstitution of out intended state in the first place you willacknowledge that those who are duly appointed to magisterial their families should severally have given satisfactory proofof what they are from youth upward until the time of election in thenext place those who are to elect should have been trained inhabits of law and be well educated that they may have a rightjudgment and may be able to select or reject men whom they approve ordisapprove as they are worthy of either but how can we imaginethat those who are brought together for the first time and arestrangers to one another and also uneducated will avoid makingmistakes in the choice of magistrates 
 cle impossible 
 ath the matter is serious and excuses will not serve the turn iwill tell you then what you and i will have to do since you as youtell me with nine others have offered to settle the new state onbehalf of the people of crete and i am to help you by the inventionof the present romance i certainly should not like to leave thetale wandering all over the world without a headless monsteris such a hideous thing 
 cle excellent stranger 
 ath yes and i will be as good as my word 
 cle let us by all means do as you propose 
 ath that we will by the grace of god if old age will onlypermit us 
 cle but god will be gracious 
 ath yes and under his guidance let us consider further point 
 cle what is it 
 ath let us remember what a courageously mad and daring creationthis our city is 
 cle what had you in your mind when you said that 
 ath i had in my mind the free and easy manner in which we areordaining that the inexperienced colonists shall receive our laws nowa man need not be very wise cleinias in order to see that no one caneasily receive laws at their first imposition but if we couldanyhow wait until those who have been imbued with them from have been nurtured in them and become habituated to them taketheir part in the public elections of the state i say if thiscould be accomplished and rightly accomplished by any way i think that there would be very little danger atthe end of the time of a state thus trained not being permanent 
 cle a reasonable supposition 
 ath then let us consider if we can find any way out of thedifficulty for i maintain cleinias that the cnosians above all theother cretans should not be satisfied with barely discharging theirduty to the colony but they ought to take the utmost pains toestablish the offices which are first created by them in the bestand surest manner above all this applies to the selection of theguardians of the law who must be chosen first of all and with thegreatest care the others are of less importance 
 cle what method can we devise of electing them 
 ath this will be the of the cretans i shall say tothem inasmuch as the cnosians have precedence over the otherstates they should in common with those who join this a body of in all nineteen of them being takenfrom the settlers and the remainder from the citizens of cnosus ofthose latter the cnosians shall make a present to your colony and youyourself shall be one of the eighteen and shall become a citizen ofthe new state and if you and they cannot be persuaded to go thecnosians may fairly use a little violence in order to make you 
 cle but why stranger do not you and megillus take a part in ournew city 
 ath o cleinias athens is proud and sparta too and they are botha long way off but you and likewise the other colonists areconveniently situated as you describe i have been speaking of the wayin which the new citizens may be best managed under presentcircumstances but in if the city continues to the election be on this wise all who are horse or footsoldiers or have seen military service at the proper ages when theywere severally fitted for it shall share in the election ofmagistrates and the election shall be held in whatever temple thestate deems most venerable and every one shall carry his vote tothe altar of the god writing down on a tablet the name of theperson for whom he votes and his name and his tribe andward and at the side he shall write his own name in like one who pleases may take away any tablet which he does not thinkproperly filled up and exhibit it in the agara for a period of notless than thirty days the tablets which are judged to be first tothe number of shall be shown by the magistrates to the wholecity and the citizens shall in like manner select from these thecandidates whom they prefer and this second selection to thenumber of shall be again exhibited to the citizens in the any one who pleases select whom pleases out of the walkingthrough the parts of victims and let them choose for magistratesand proclaim the seven and thirty who have the greatest number ofvotes but who cleinias and megillus will order for us in the colonyall this matter of the magistrates and the scrutinies of them ifwe reflect we shall see that cities which are in process ofconstruction like ours must have some such persons who cannotpossibly be elected before there are any magistrates and yet theymust be elected in some way and they are not to be inferior the best possible for as the proverb says a good beginning ishalf the business and to have begun well is praised by all and inmy opinion is a great deal more than half the business and hasnever been praised by any one enough 
 cle that is very true 
 ath then let us recognize the difficulty and make clear to our ownminds how the beginning is to be accomplished there is only oneproposal which i have to offer and that is one which under ourcircumstances is both necessary and expedient 
 cle what is it 
 ath i maintain that this colony of ours has a father and are no other than the colonizing state well i know that manycolonies have been and will be at enmity with their parents butin early days the child as in a family loves and is beloved even ifthere come a time later when the tie is broken still while he isin want of education he naturally loves his parents and is beloved bythem and flies to his relatives for protection and finds in them hisonly natural allies in time of need and this parental feeling alreadyexists in the cnosians as is shown by their care of the new city andthere is a similar feeling on the part of the young city towardscnosus and i repeat what i was there is no harm inrepeating a good the cnosians should take a common interestin all these matters and choose as far as they can the eldest andbest of the colonists to the number of not less than a hundred andlet there be another hundred of the cnosians themselves these i their arrival should have a joint care that the magistrates shouldbe appointed according to law and that when they are appointed theyshould undergo a scrutiny when this has been effected the cnosiansshall return home and the new city do the best she can for her ownpreservation and happiness i would have the now andin all future time chosen to fulfil the following the first place be the guardians of the law and secondly of theregisters in which each one registers before the magistrate the amountof his property excepting four minae which are allowed to citizens ofthe first class three allowed to the second two to the third anda single mina to the fourth and if any one despising the laws forthe sake of gain be found to possess anything more which has not beenregistered let all that he has in excess be confiscated and lethim be liable to a suit which shall be the reverse of honourable orfortunate and let any one who will indict him on the charge ofloving base gains and proceed against him before the guardians of thelaw and if he be cast let him lose his share of the publicpossessions and when there is any public distribution let him havenothing but his original lot and let him be written down acondemned man as long as he lives in some place in which any onewho pleases can read about his onces the guardian of the law shallnot hold office longer than twenty years and shall not be less thanfifty years of age when he is elected or if he is elected when heis sixty years of age he shall hold office for ten years only andupon the same principle he must not imagine that he will be permittedto hold such an important office as that of guardian of the laws afterhe is seventy years of age if he live so long 
 these are the three first ordinances about the guardians of the the work of legislation progresses each law in turn will assign tothem their further duties and now we may proceed in order to speak ofthe election of other officers for generals have to be elected andthese again must have their ministers commanders and colonels ofhorse and commanders of brigades of foot who would be more rightlycalled by their popular name of brigadiers the guardians of the lawshall propose as generals men who are natives of the city and aselection from the candidates proposed shall be made by those whoare or have been of the age for military service and if one who isnot proposed is thought by somebody to be better than one who him name whom he prefers in the place of whom and make oaththat he is better and propose him and whichever of them isapproved by vote shall be admitted to the final selection and thethree who have the greatest number of votes shall be appointedgenerals and superintendents of military affairs after previouslyundergoing a scrutiny like the guardians of the law and let thegenerals thus elected propose twelve brigadiers one for each there shall be a right of counterproposal as in the case of thegenerals and the voting and decision shall take place in the sameway until the prytanes and council are elected the guardians ofthe law shall convene the assembly in some holy spot which is suitableto the purpose placing the hoplites by themselves and the cavalry bythemselves and in a third division all the rest of the army allare to vote for the generals and for the colonels of horse butthe brigadiers are to be voted for only by those who carry the hoplites let the body of cavalry choose phylarchs forthe generals but captains of light troops or archers or any otherdivision of the army shall be appointed by the generals forthemselves there only remains the appointment of officers of shall be proposed by the same persons who proposed the the election and the of other candidates shall bearranged in the same way as in the case of the generals and let thecavalry vote and the infantry look on at the election the two whohave the greatest number of votes shall be the leaders of all thehorse disputes about the voting may be raised once or twice but ifthe dispute be raised a third time the officers who preside at theseveral elections shall decide 
 the council shall consist of x members will be aconvenient number for if we divide the whole number intofour parts of ninety each we get ninety counsellors for each all the citizens shall select candidates from the firstclass they shall be compelled to vote and if they do not shallbe duly fined when the candidates have been selected some oneshall mark them down this shall be the business of the first day andon the following day candidates shall be selected from the secondclass in the same manner and under the same conditions as on theprevious day and on the third day a selection shall be made fromthe third class at which every one may if he likes vote and thethree first classes shall be compelled to vote but the fourth andlowest class shall be under no compulsion and any member of thisclass who does not vote shall not be punished on the fourth daycandidates shall be selected from the fourth and smallest shall be selected by all but he who is of the fourth class shallsuffer no penalty nor he who is of the third if he be not willing tovote but he who is of the first or second class if he does notvote shall be who is of the second class shall pay a fineof triple the amount which was exacted at first and he who is ofthe first class quadruple on the fifth day the rulers shall bring outthe names noted down for all the citizens to see and every man shallchoose out of them under pain if he do not of suffering the firstpenalty and when they have chosen out of each of the classes theyshall choose of them by lot who shall undergo are to form the council for the year 
 the mode of election which has been described is in a mean betweenmonarchy and democracy and such a mean the state ought always toobserve for servants and masters never can be friends nor good andbad merely because they are declared to have equal privileges for tounequals equals become unequal if they are not harmonized by both by reason of equality and by reason of inequality citiesare filled with seditions the old saying that equality makesfriendship is happy and also true but there is obscurity andconfusion as to what sort of equality is meant for there are twoequalities which are called by the same name but are in reality inmany ways almost the opposite of one another one of them may beintroduced without difficulty by any state or any legislator in thedistribution of honours this is the rule of measure weight andnumber which regulates and apportions them but there is anotherequality of a better and higher kind which is not so easilyrecognized this is the judgment of zeus among men it avails butlittle that little however is the source of the greatest good toindividuals and states for it gives to the greater more and to theinferior less and in proportion to the nature of each and above honour always to the greater virtue and to the less less andto either in proportion to their respective measure of virtue andeducation and this is justice and is ever the true principle ofstates at which we ought to aim and according to this rule order thenew city which is now being founded and any other city which may behereafter founded to this the legislator should to theinterests of tyrants one or more or to the power of the people butto justice always which as i was saying the distribution of naturalequality among unequals in each case but there are times at whichevery state is compelled to use the words just equal in asecondary sense in the hope of escaping in some degree from equity and indulgence are infractions of the perfect and strictrule of justice and this is the reason why we are obliged to usethe equality of the lot in order to avoid the discontent of thepeople and so we invoke god and fortune in our prayers and begthat they themselves will direct the lot with a view to supremejustice and therefore although we are compelled to use bothequalities we should use that into which the element of chance entersas seldom as possible 
 thus o my friends and for the reasons given should a state actwhich would endure and be saved but as a ship sailing on the seahas to be watched night and day in like manner a city also is sailingon a sea of politics and is liable to all sorts of insidiousassaults and therefore from morning to night and from night tomorning rulers must join hands with rulers and watchers withwatchers receiving and giving up their trust in a perpetualsuccession now a multitude can never fulfil a duty of this sortwith anything like energy moreover the greater number of thesenators will have to be left during the greater part of the year toorder their concerns at their own homes they will therefore have tobe arranged in twelve portions answering to the twelve months andfurnish guardians of the state each portion for a single month theirbusiness is to be at hand and receive any foreigner or citizen whocomes to them whether to give information or to put one of thosequestions to which when asked by other cities a city should give ananswer and to which if she ask them herself she should receive ananswer or again when there is a likelihood of internal are always liable to happen in some form or other they will ifthey can prevent their occurring or if they have already lose time in making them known to the city and healing the also this which is the presiding body of the state oughtalways to have the control of their assemblies and of thedissolutions of them ordinary as well as extraordinary all this isto be ordered by the twelfth part of the council which is always tokeep watch together with the other officers of the state during oneportion of the year and to rest during the remaining eleven portions 
 thus will the city be fairly ordered and now who is to have thesuperintendence of the country and what shall be the that the whole city and the entire country have been both ofthem divided into twelve portions ought there not to be appointedsuperintendents of the streets of the city and of the houses andbuildings and harbours and the agora and fountains and sacreddomains and temples and the like 
 cle to be sure there ought 
 ath let us assume then that there ought to be servants of thetemples and priests and priestesses there must also besuperintendents of roads and buddings who will have a care of they may do no harm and also of beasts both within theenclosure and in the suburbs three kinds of officers will thus haveto be appointed in order that the city may be suitably providedaccording to her needs those who have the care of the city shall becalled wardens of the city and those who have the care of the agorashall be called wardens of the agora and those who have the care ofthe temples shall be called priests those who hold hereditary officesas priests or priestesses shall not be disturbed but if there be fewor none such as is probable at the foundation of a new and priestesses shall be appointed to be servants of thegods who have no servants some of our officers shall be others appointed by lot those who are of the people and those whoare not of the people mingling in a friendly manner in every place andcity that the state may be as far as possible of one mind theofficers of the temples shall be appointed by lot in this way theirelection will be committed to god that he may do what is agreeable tohim and he who obtains a lot shall undergo a scrutiny first as towhether he is sound of body and of legitimate birth and in the secondplace in order to show that he is of a perfectly pure family notstained with homicide or any similar impiety in his own person andalso that his father and mother have led a similar unstained life nowthe laws about all divine things should be brought from delphi andinterpreters appointed under whose direction they should be used thetenure of the priesthood should always be for a year and no he who will duly execute the sacred office according to thelaws of religion must be not less than sixty years of lawsshall be the same about priestesses as for the interpreters theyshall be appointed the twelve tribes be distributed intogroups of four and let each group select four one out of eachtribe within the group three times and let the three who have thegreatest number of votes out of the twelve appointed by eachgroup after undergoing a scrutiny nine in all be sent to order that the god may return one out of each triad their ageshall be the same as that of the priests and the scrutiny of themshall be conducted in the same manner let them be interpreters forlife and when any one dies let the four tribes select another fromthe tribe of the deceased moreover besides priests and must be treasurers who will take charge of the property ofthe several temples and of the sacred domains and shall haveauthority over the produce and the letting of them and three ofthem shall be chosen from the highest classes for the greater two for the lesser and one for the least of all the manner oftheir election and the scrutiny of them shall be the same as that ofthe generals this shall be the order of the temples 
 let everything have a guard as far as possible let the defence ofthe city be commited to the generals and taxiarchs and phylarchs and prytanes and the wardens of the city and of theagora when the election of them has been completed the defence ofthe country shall be provided for as entire land has beenalready distributed into twelve as nearly as possible equal parts andlet the tribe allotted to a division provide annually for it fivewardens of the country and commanders of the watch and let eachbody of five have the power of selecting twelve others out of theyouth of their own shall be not less than of age and not more than thirty and let there be allotted tothem severally every month the various districts in order that theymay all acquire knowledge and experience of the whole country theterm of service for commanders and for watchers shall continueduring two years after having had their stations allotted to will go from place to place in regular order making theirround from left to right as their commanders direct them when ispeak of going to the right i mean that they are to go to theeast and at the commencement of the second year in order that asmany as possible of the guards may not only get a knowledge of thecountry at any one season of the year but may also have experience ofthe manner in which different places are affected at different seasonsof the year their then commanders shall lead them again towards theleft from place to place in succession until they have completed thesecond year in the third year other wardens of the country shall bechosen and commanders of the watch five for each division who are tobe the superintendents of the bands of twelve while on service ateach station their attention shall be directed to the the first place they shall see that the country is wellprotected against enemies they shall trench and dig wherever thisis required and as far as they can they shall by fortificationskeep off the in order to prevent them from doing anyharm to the country or the property they shall use the beasts ofburden and the labourers whom they find on the spot these will betheir instruments whom they will superintend taking them as far aspossible at the times when they are not engaged in their regularbusiness they shall make every part of the country inaccessible toenemies and as accessible as possible to friends there shall be waysfor man and beasts of burden and for cattle and they shall takecare to have them always as smooth as they can and shall provideagainst the rains doing harm instead of good to the land when theycome down from the mountains into the hollow dells and shall keepin the overflow by the help of works and ditches in order that thevalleys receiving and drinking up the rain from heaven and providingfountains and streams in the fields and regions which lieunderneath may furnish even to the dry places plenty of good fountains of water whether of rivers or of springs shall beornamented with plantations and buildings for beauty and let thembring together the streams in subterraneous channels and make allthings plenteous and if there be a sacred grove or dedicated precinctin the neighbourhood they shall conduct the water to the actualtemples of the gods and so beautify them at all seasons of theyear everywhere in such places the youth shall make gymnasia forthemselves and warm baths for the aged placing by them abundanceof dry wood for the benefit of those labouring under weary frame of the rustic worn with toil will receive a kindlywelcome far better than he would at the hands of a not

 after the wardens of the country we have to speak of the electionof wardens of the agora and of the city the wardens of the countrywere sixty in number and the wardens of the city will be three andwill divide the twelve parts of the city into three like theformer they shall have care of the ways and of the different highroads which lead out of the country into the city and of thebuildings that they may be all made according to of thewaters which the guardians of the supply preserve and convey to being taken that they may reach the fountains pure andabundant and be both an ornament and a benefit to the city thesealso should be men of influence and at leisure to take care of thepublic interest let every man propose as warden of the city any onewhom he likes out of the highest class and when the vote has beengiven on them and the number is reduced to the six who have thegreatest number of votes let the electing officers choose by lotthree out of the six and when they have undergone a scrutiny let themhold office according to the laws laid down for them next let thewardens of the agora be elected in like manner out of the first andsecond class five in number ten are to be first elected and outof the ten five are to be chosen by lot as in the election of thewardens of the when they have undergone a scrutiny areto be declared magistrates every one shall vote for every one and hewho will not vote if he be informed against before the be fined fifty drachmae and shall also be deemed a bad any one who likes go to the assembly and to the general shall be compulsory to go on citizens of the first and secondclass and they shall pay a fine of ten drachmae if they be foundnot answering to their names at the assembly the third and fourthclass shall be under no compulsion and shall be let off without afine unless the magistrates have commanded all to be present inconsequence of some urgent necessity the wardens of the agora shallobserve the order appointed by law for the agora and shall have thecharge of the temples and fountains which are in the agora and theyshall see that no one injures anything and punish him who stripes and bonds if he be a slave or stranger but if he be acitizen who misbehaves in this way they shall have the powerthemselves of inflicting a fine upon him to the amount of a hundreddrachmae or with the consent of the wardens of the city up todouble that amount and let the wardens of the city have a similarpower of imposing punishments and fines in their own department andlet them impose fines by their own department and let them imposefines by their own authority up to a mina or up to two minae withthe consent of the wardens of the agora 
 in the next place it will be proper to appoint directors of musicand gymnastic two kinds of the one kind the business willbe education of the other the superintendence of contests inspeaking of education the law means to speak of those who have thecare of order and instruction in gymnasia and schools and of thegoing to school and of school buildings for boys and girls and inspeaking of contests the law refers to the judges of gymnastics andof music these again are divided into two classes the one havingto do with music the other with gymnastics and the same who judge ofthe gymnastic contests of men shall judge of horses but in musicthere shall be one set of judges of solo singing and of of rhapsodists players on the harp the flute and the another who shall judge of choral song first of all we mustchoose directors for the choruses of boys and men and they shall follow in the amusement of the dance and for ourother musical arrangements one director will be enough for thechoruses and he should be not less than forty years of age onedirector will also be enough to introduce the solo singers and togive judgment on the competitors and he ought not to be less thanthirty years of age the director and manager of the choruses shall beelected after the following any persons who commonlytake an interest in such matters go to the meeting and be fined ifthey do not go the guardians of the law shall judge of theirfault but those who have no interest shall not be compelled theelector shall propose as director some one who understands he in the scrutiny may be challenged on the one part by thosewho say he has no skill and defended on the other hand by those whosay that he has ten are to be elected by vote and he of the tenwho is chosen by lot shall undergo a scrutiny and lead the chorusesfor a year according to law and in like manner the competitor whowins the lot shall be leader of the solo and concert music for thatyear and he who is thus elected shall deliver the award to thejudges in the next place we have to choose judges in the contests ofhorses and of men these shall be selected from the third and alsofrom the second class of citizens and three first classes shall becompelled to go to the election but the lowest may stay away withimpunity and let there be three elected by lot out of the twentywho have been chosen previously and they must also have the voteand approval of the examiners but if any one is rejected in thescrutiny at any ballot or decision others shall be chosen in the samemanner and undergo a similar scrutiny 
 there remains the minister of the education of youth male andfemale he too will rule according to law one such minister will besufficient and he must be fifty years old and have children lawfullybegotten both boys and girls by preference at any rate one or theother he who is elected and he who is the elector should considerthat of all the great offices of state this is the greatest forthe first shoot of any plant if it makes a good start towards theattainment of its natural excellence has the greatest effect on itsmaturity and this is not only true of plants but of animals wild andtame and also of men man as we say is a tame or civilizedanimal nevertheless he requires proper instruction and a fortunatenature and then of all animals he becomes the most divine and mostcivilized but if he be insufficiently or ill educated he is themost savage of earthly creatures wherefore the legislator ought notto allow the education of children to become a secondary or accidentalmatter in the first place he who would be rightly provident aboutthem should begin by taking care that he is elected who of all thecitizens is in every way best him the legislator shall do hisutmost to appoint guardian and superintendent to this end all themagistrates with the exception of the council and prytanes shallgo to the temple of apollo and elect by ballot him of the guardiansof the law whom they severally think will be the best superintendentof education and he who has the greatest number of votes after hehas undergone a scrutiny at the hands of all the magistrates whohave been his electors with the exception of the guardians of hold office for five years and in the sixth year letanother be chosen in like manner to fill his office 
 if any one dies while he is holding a public office and more thanthirty days before his term of office expires let those whosebusiness it is elect another to the office in the same manner asbefore and if any one who is entrusted with orphans dies let therelations both on the and side who are residingat home including cousins appoint another guardian within tendays or be fined a drachma a day for neglect to do so 
 a city which has no regular courts of law ceases to be a city andagain if a judge is silent and says no more in preliminaryproceedings than the litigants as is the case in arbitrations hewill never be able to decide justly wherefore a multitude of judgeswill not easily judge well nor a few if they are bad the point indispute between the parties should be made clear and time anddeliberation and repeated examination greatly tend to clear updoubts for this reason he who goes to law with another should gofirst of all to his neighbours and friends who know best the questionsat issue and if he be unable to obtain from them a satisfactorydecision let him have recourse to another court and if the twocourts cannot settle the matter let a third put an end to the suit 
 now the establishment of courts of justice may be regarded as achoice of magistrates for every magistrate must also be a judge ofsome things and the judge though he be not a magistrate yet incertain respects is a very important magistrate on the day on which heis determining a suit regarding then the judges also asmagistrates let us say who are fit to be judges and of what they areto be judges and how many of them are to judge in each suit let thatbe the supreme tribunal which the litigants appoint in common forthemselves choosing certain persons by agreement and let there betwo other tribunals one for private causes when a citizen accusesanother of wronging him and wishes to get a decision the other forpublic causes in which some citizen is of opinion that the public hasbeen wronged by an individual and is willing to vindicate thecommon interests and we must not forget to mention how the judges areto be qualified and who they are to be in the first place let therebe a tribunal open to all private persons who are trying causes oneagainst another for the third time and let this be composed the officers of state as well annual as those holdingoffice for a longer period when the new year is about to commence inthe month following after the summer solstice on the last day but oneof the year shall meet in some temple and calling god to dedicate one judge from every magistracy to be choosing in each office him who seems to them to bethe best and whom they deem likely to decide the causes of during the ensuing year in the best and holiestmanner and when the election is completed a scrutiny shall be heldin the presence of the electors themselves and if any one be rejectedanother shall be chosen in the same manner those who have undergonethe scrutiny shall judge the causes of those who have declined theinferior courts and shall give their vote openly the councillors andother magistrates who have elected them shall be required to behearers and spectators of the causes and any one else may bepresent who pleases if one man charges another with havingintentionally decided wrong let him go to the guardians of the lawand lay his accusation before them and he who is found guilty in sucha case shall pay damages to the injured party equal to half theinjury but if he shall appear to deserve a greater penalty thejudges shall determine what additional punishment he shall suffer andhow much more he ought to pay to the public treasury and to the partywho brought the suit 
 in the judgment of offences against the state the people ought toparticipate for when any one wrongs the state all are wronged andmay reasonably complain if they are not allowed to share in thedecision such causes ought to originate with the people and theought also to have the final decision of them but the trial of themshall take place before three of the highest magistrates upon whomthe plaintiff and the defendant shall agree and if they are notable to come to an agreement themselves the council shall chooseone of the two proposed and in private suits too as far as ispossible all should have a share for he who has no share in theadministration of justice is apt to imagine that he has no share inthe state at all and for this reason there shall be a court of law inevery tribe and the judges shall be chosen by shall givetheir decisions at once and shall be inaccessible to final judgment shall rest with that court which as we been established in the most incorruptible form of which humanthings admit this shall be the court established for those who areunable to get rid of their suits either in the courts of neighbours orof the tribes 
 thus much of the courts of law which as i was saying cannot beprecisely defined either as being or not being offices asuperficial sketch has been given of them in which some things havebeen told and others omitted for the right place of an exactstatement of the laws respecting suits under their several be at the end of the body of us then expect themat the end hitherto our legislation has been chiefly occupied withthe appointment of offices perfect unity and exactness extendingto the whole and every particular of political be attained to the full until the discussion shall have abeginning middle and end and is complete in every part atpresent we have reached the election of magistrates and this may beregarded as a sufficient termination of what preceded and now thereneed no longer be any delay or hesitation in beginning the work oflegislation 
 cle i like what you have said i particularly likeyour manner of tacking on the beginning of your new discourse to theend of the former one 
 ath thus far then the old rational pastime has gone offwell 
 cle you mean i suppose their serious and noble pursuit 
 ath perhaps but i should like to know whether you and i are agreedabout a certain thing 
 cle about what thing 
 ath you know the endless labour which painters expend upon are always putting in or taking out colours or whateverbe the term which artists employ they seem as if they would nevercease touching up their works which are always being made brighterand more beautiful 
 cle i know something of these matters from report although ihave never had any great acquaintance with the art 
 ath no matter we may make use of the that some one had a mind to paint a figure inthe most beautiful manner in the hope that his work instead of losingwould always improve as time went you not see that being amortal unless he leaves some one to succeed him who will correctthe flaws which time may introduce and be able to add what is leftimperfect through the defect of the artist and who will furtherbrighten up and improve the picture all his great labour will lastbut a short time 
 cle true 
 ath and is not the aim of the legislator similar first he desiresthat his laws should be written down with all possible exactness inthe second place as time goes on and he has made an actual trial ofhis decrees will he not find omissions do you imagine that thereever was a legislator so foolish as not to know that many things arenecessarily omitted which some one coming after him must the constitution and the order of government is not to to improve in the state which he has established 
 cle assuredly that is the sort of thing which every one woulddesire 
 ath and if any one possesses any means of accomplishing this byword or deed or has any way great or small by which he can teach aperson to understand how he can maintain and amend the laws he shouldfinish what he has to say and not leave the work incomplete 
 cle by all means 
 ath and is not this what you and i have to do at the presentmoment 
 cle what have we to do 
 ath as we are about to legislate and have chosen our guardians ofthe law and are ourselves in the evening of life and they ascompared with us are young men we ought not only to legislate forthem but to endeavour to make them not only guardians of the lawbut legislators themselves as far as this is possible 
 cle certainly if we can 
 ath at any rate we must do our best 
 cle of course 
 ath we will say to friends and saviours of our laws inlaying down any law there are many particulars which we shall this cannot be helped at the same time we will do our utmostto describe what is important and will give an outline which youshall fill up and i will explain on what principle you are to and cleinias and i have often spoken to one anothertouching these matters and we are of opinion that we have spokenwell and we hope that you will be of the same mind with us andbecome our disciples and keep in view the things which in ourunited opinion the legislator and guardian of the law ought to keep inview there was one main point about which we were a energies throughout life should be devoted to the acquisition ofthe virtue proper to a man whether this was to be gained by study orhabit or some mode of acquisition or desire or opinion this applies equally to men and women old and of all should always be such as i have described anything whichmay be an impediment the good man ought to show that he utterlydisregards and if at last necessity plainly compels him to be anoutlaw from his native land rather than bow his neck to the yoke ofslavery and be ruled by inferiors and he has to fly an exile he mustbe and endure all such trials rather than accept another form ofgovernment which is likely to make men worse these are ouroriginal principles and do you now fixing your eyes upon thestandard of what a man and a citizen ought or ought not to and blame the those which have not this power ofmaking the citizen better but embrace those which have and withgladness receive and live in them bidding a long farewell to otherinstitutions which aim at goods as they are termed of a differentkind 
 let us proceed to another class of laws beginning with theirfoundation in religion and we must first return to the entire number had and has a great many convenientdivisions and the number of the tribes which was a twelfth part ofthe whole being correctly formed by x x also has them and not only is the whole numberdivisible by twelve but also the number of each tribe is divisible bytwelve now every portion should be regarded by us as a sacred gift ofheaven corresponding to the months and to the revolution of theuniverse every city has a guiding and sacred principle given bynature but in some the division or distribution has been more rightthan in others and has been more sacred and fortunate in ouropinion nothing can be more right than the selection of the number which may be divided by all numbers from one to twelve withthe single exception of eleven and that admits of a very easycorrection for if turning to the dividend we deduct twofamilies the defect in the division is cured and the truth of thismay be easily proved when we have leisure but for the to the mere assertion of this principle let us divide thestate and assigning to each portion some god or son of a god letus give them altars and sacred rites and at the altars let us holdassemblies for sacrifice twice in the assemblies forthe tribes and twelve for the city according to their divisions thefirst in honour of the gods and divine things and the second topromote friendship and better acquaintance as the phrase is andevery sort of good fellowship with one another for people must beacquainted with those into whose families and whom they marry and withthose to whom they give in marriage in such matters as far aspossible a man should deem it all important to avoid a mistake andwith this serious purpose let games be instituted in which youthsand maidens shall dance together seeing one another and being seennaked at a proper age and on a suitable occasion nottransgressing the rules of modesty 
 the directors of choruses will be the superintendents and regulatorsof these games and they together with the guardians of the law willlegislate in any matters which we have omitted for as we said wherethere are numerous and minute details the legislator must leave outsomething and the annual officers who have experience and knowwhat is wanted must make arrangements and improvements year byyear until such enactments and provisions are sufficientlydetermined a ten years experience of sacrifices and dances ifextending to all particulars will be quite sufficient and if thelegislator be alive they shall communicate with him but if he be deadthen the several officers shall refer the omissions which come undertheir notice to the guardians of the law and correct them untilall is perfect and from that time there shall be no more they shall establish and use the new laws with the others whichthe legislator originally gave them and of which they are never ifthey can help to change aught or if some necessity overtakesthem the magistrates must be called into counsel and the wholepeople and they must go to all the oracles of the gods and if theyare all agreed in that case they may make the change but if they arenot agreed by no manner of means and any one who dissents shallprevail as the law ordains 
 whenever any one over years of age having seen and beenseen by others believes himself to have found a marriage connectionwhich is to his mind and suitable for the procreation of him marry if he be still under the age of let him first hear how he ought to seek after what is suitable andappropriate for as cleinias says every law should have a suitableprelude 
 cle you recollect at the right moment stranger and do not missthe opportunity which the argument affords of saying a word in season 
 ath i thank you we will say to him who is born of good son you ought to make such a marriage as wise men would they would advise you neither to avoid a poor marriage norspecially to desire a rich one but if other things are to honour inferiors and with them to form be for the benefit of the city and of the families which areunited for the equable and symmetrical tends infinitely more tovirtue than the unmixed and he who is conscious of being tooheadstrong and carried away more than is fitting in all hisactions ought to desire to become the relation of orderly he who is of the opposite temper ought to seek the oppositealliance let there be one word concerning all manshall follow not after the marriage which is most pleasing tohimself but after that which is most beneficial to the state forsomehow every one is by nature prone to that which is likest tohimself and in this way the whole city becomes unequal in propertyand in disposition and hence there arise in most states the veryresults which we least desire to happen now to add to the law anexpress provision not only that the rich man shall not marry into therich family nor the powerful into the family of the powerful butthat the slower natures shall be compelled to enter into marriage withthe quicker and the quicker with the slower may awaken anger as wellas laughter in the minds of many for there is a difficulty inperceiving that the city ought to be well mingled like a cup in whichthe maddening wine is hot and fiery but when chastened by a soberergod receives a fair associate and becomes an excellent andtemperate drink yet in marriage no one is able to see that the sameresult occurs wherefore also the law must let alone such matters butwe should try to charm the spirits of men into believing theequability of their disposition to be of more importancethan equality in excessive fortune when they marry and him who is toodesirous of making a rich marriage we should endeavour to turn asideby reproaches not however by any compulsion of written law 
 let this then be our exhortation concerning marriage and let usremember what was said a man should cling toimmortality and leave behind him children to be theservants of god in his place for ever all this and much more may betruly said by way of prelude about the duty of marriage but if aman will not listen and remains unsocial and alien among and is still unmarried at years of him pay a yearly who of the highest class shall pay afine of a hundred drachmae and he who is of the second dass a fine ofseventy drachmae the third class shall pay sixty drachmae and thefourth thirty drachmae and let the money be sacred to here he whodoes not pay the fine annually shall owe ten times the sum whichthe treasurer of the goddess shall exact and if he fails in doing him be answerable and give an account of the money at hisaudit he who refuses to marry shall be thus punished in money andalso be deprived of all honour which the younger show to the no young man voluntarily obey him and if he attempt to punish anyone let every one come to the rescue and defend the injured he who is present and does not come to the rescue shall bepronounced by the law to be a coward and a bad citizen of themarriage portion i have already spoken and again i say for theinstruction of poor men that he who neither gives nor receives a dowryon account of poverty has a compensation for the citizens of ourstate are provided with the necessaries of life and wives will beless likely to be insolent and husbands to be mean and subservient tothem on account of property and he who obeys this law will do a nobleaction but he who will not obey and gives or receives more thanfifty drachmae as the price of the marriage garments if he be of thelowest or more than a mina or a mina if he be of thethird or second classes or two minae if he be of the highest owe to the public treasury a similar sum and that which isgiven or received shall be sacred to here and zeus and let thetreasurers of these gods exact the money as was said before about the treasurers of here were to exact the money orpay the fine themselves 
 the betrothal by a father shall be valid in the first degree thatby a grandfather in the second degree and in the third by brothers who have the same father but if there arenone of these alive the betrothal by a mother shall be valid inlike manner in cases of unexampled fatality the next of kin andthe guardians shall have authority what are to be the rites beforemarriages or any other sacred acts relating either to or past marriages shall be referred to the interpreters andhe who follows their advice may be satisfied touching the marriagefestival they shall assemble not more than five male and fivefemale friends of both families and a like number of members of thefamily of either sex and no man shall spend more than his meanswill allow he who is of the richest class may spend a whois of the second half a mina and in the same proportion as thecensus of each decreases all men shall praise him who is obedientto the law but he who is disobedient shall be punished by theguardians of the law as a man wanting in true taste anduninstructed in the laws of bridal song drunkenness is alwaysimproper except at the festivals of the god who gave wine andpeculiarly dangerous when a man is engaged in the business ofmarriage at such a crisis of their lives a bride and bridegroom oughtto have all their wits about ought to take care that theiroffspring may be born of reasonable beings for on what day or nightheaven will give them increase who can say moreover they oughtnot to begetting children when their bodies are dissipated byintoxication but their offspring should be compact and solid quietand compounded properly whereas the drunkard is all abroad in all hisactions and beside himself both in body and soul wherefore drunken man is bad and unsteady in sowing the seed of is likely to beget offspring who will be unstable anduntrustworthy and cannot be expected to walk straight either inbody or mind hence during the whole year and all his life long andespecially while he is begetting children ought to take care andnot intentionally do what is injurious to health or what involvesinsolence and wrong for he cannot help leaving the impression ofhimself on the souls and bodies of his offspring and he begetschildren in every way inferior and especially on the day and night ofmarriage should a man abstain from such things for the is also a god dwelling in man preserves all things if itmeet with proper respect from each individual he who marries isfurther to consider that one of the two houses in the lot is thenest and nursery of his young and there he is to marry and make ahome for himself and bring up his children going away from his fatherand mother for in friendships there must be some degree of desire inorder to cement and bind together diversities of character butexcessive intercourse not having the desire which is created bytime insensibly dissolves friendships from a feeling of a man and his wife shall leave to his and her father andmother their own and themselves go as to a colony anddwell there and visit and be visited by their parents and they shallbeget and bring up children handing on the torch of life from onegeneration to another and worshipping the gods according to law forever 
 in the next place we have to consider what sort of property will bemost convenient there is no difficulty either in understanding oracquiring most kinds of property but there is great difficulty inwhat relates to slaves and the reason is that we speak about themin a way which is right and which is not right for what we sayabout our slaves is consistent and also inconsistent with our practiceabout them 
 megillus i do not understand stranger what you mean 
 ath i am not surprised megillus for the state of the helots amongthe lacedaemonians is of all hellenic forms of slavery the mostcontroverted and disputed about some approving and some condemningit there is less dispute about the slavery which exists among theheracleots who have subjugated the mariandynians and about thethessalian penestae looking at these and the like examples whatought we to do concerning property in slaves i made a remark inpassing which naturally elicited a question about my meaning fromyou it was know that all would agree that we should have thebest and most attached slaves whom we can get for many a man hasfound his slaves better in every way than brethren or sons and manytimes they have saved the lives and property of their masters andtheir whole tales are well known 
 meg to be sure 
 ath but may we not also say that the soul of the slave is utterlycorrupt and that no man of sense ought to trust them and thewisest of our poets speaking of zeus says 
 zeus takes away half the understanding of men whom theday of slavery persons have got these two different notions of slaves intheir of them utterly distrust their servants and as ifthey were wild beasts chastise them with goads and whips and maketheir souls three times or rather many times as slavish as they others do just the opposite 
 meg true 
 cle then what are we to do in our own country stranger seeingthat there are such differences in the treatment of slaves by theirowners 
 ath well cleinias there can be no doubt that man is a troublesomeanimal and therefore he is not very manageable nor likely tobecome so when you attempt to introduce the necessary and freeman and master 
 cle that is obvious 
 ath he is a troublesome piece of goods as has been often shownby the frequent revolts of the messenians and the great mischiefswhich happen in states having many slaves who speak the same the numerous robberies and lawless life of the italian they are called a man who considers all this is fairly at aloss two remedies alone remain to to have the slaves of thesame country nor if possible speaking the same language in this waythey will more easily be held in subjection secondly we shouldtend them carefully not only out of regard to them but yet moreout of respect to ourselves and the right treatment of slaves is tobehave properly to them and to do to them if possible even morejustice than to those who are our equals for he who naturally andgenuinely reverences justice and hates injustice is discovered inhis dealings with any class of men to whom he can easily be he who in regard to the natures and actions of his slaves isundefiled by impiety and injustice will best sow the seeds ofvirtue in them and this may be truly said of every master andtyrant and of every other having authority in relation to hisinferiors slaves ought to be punished as they deserve and notadmonished as if they were freemen which will only make themconceited the language used to a servant ought always to be that of acommand and we ought not to jest with them whether they are males is a foolish way which many people have of setting uptheir slaves and making the life of servitude more disagreeableboth for them and for their masters 
 cle true 
 ath now that each of the citizens is provided as far aspossible with a sufficient number of suitable slaves who can help himin what he has to do we may next proceed to describe their dwellings 
 cle very good 
 ath the city being new and hitherto uninhabited care ought to betaken of all the buildings and the manner of building each of also of the temples and walls these cleinias were matters whichproperly came before the marriages but as we are only talking thereis no objection to changing the order if however our plan oflegislation is ever to take effect then the house shall precede themarriage if god so will and afterwards we will come to theregulations about marriage but at present we are only describingthese matters in a general outline 
 cle quite true 
 ath the temples are to be placed all round the agora and the wholecity built on the heights in a circle for the sake of defence and forthe sake of purity near the temples are to be placed buildings forthe magistrates and the courts of law in these plaintiff anddefendant will receive their due and the places will be regarded asmost holy partly because they have to do with the holy things andpartly because they are the of holy gods and inthem will be held the courts in which cases of homicide and othertrials of capital offenses may fitly take place as to the i agree with sparta in thinking that they should beallowed to sleep in the earth and that we should not attempt todisinter them there is a poetical saying which is finelyexpressed that walls ought to be of steel and iron and not ofearth besides how ridiculous of us to be sending out our young menannually into the country to dig and to trench and to keep off theenemy by fortifications under the idea that they are not to beallowed to set foot in our territory and then that we shouldsurround ourselves with a wall which in the first place is by nomeans conducive to the health of cities and is also apt to producea certain effeminacy in the minds of the inhabitants inviting mento run thither instead of repelling their enemies and leading them toimagine that their safety is due not to their keeping guard day andnight but that when they are protected by walls and gates thenthey may sleep in safety as if they were not meant to labour and didnot know that true repose comes from labour and that disgracefulindolence and a careless temper of mind is only the renewal oftrouble but if men must have walls the private houses ought to be soarranged from the first that the whole city may be one wall havingall the houses capable of defence by reason of their uniformity andequality towards the streets the form of the city being that of asingle dwelling will have an agreeable aspect and being easilyguarded will be infinitely better for security until the originalbuilding is completed these should be the principal objects of theinhabitants and the wardens of the city should superintend thework and should impose a fine on him who is negligent and in allthat relates to the city they should have a care of cleanliness andnot allow a private person to encroach upon any public property eitherby buildings or excavations further they ought to take care that therains from heaven flow off easily and of any other matters whichmay have to be administered either within or without the city theguardians of the law shall pass any further enactments which theirexperience may show to be necessary and supply any other points inwhich the law may be deficient and now that these matters and thebuildings about the agora and the gymnasia and places ofinstruction and theatres are all ready and waiting for scholarsand spectators let us proceed to the subjects which follow marriagein the order of legislation 
 cle by all means 
 ath assuming that marriages exist already cleinias the mode oflife during the year after marriage before children are born willfollow next in order in what way bride and bridegroom ought to livein a city which is to be superior to other cities is a matter notat all easy for us to determine there have been many difficultiesalready but this will be the greatest of them and the mostdisagreeable to the many still i cannot but say what appears to me tobe right and true cleinias 
 cle certainly 
 ath he who imagines that he can give laws for the public conduct ofstates while he leaves the private life of citizens wholly to takecare of itself who thinks that individuals may pass the day as theyplease and that there is no necessity of order in all things he isay who gives up the control of their private lives and supposesthat they will conform to law in their common and public life ismaking a great mistake why have i made this remark why because i amgoing to enact that the bridegrooms should live at the commontables just as they did before marriage this was a singularitywhen first enacted by the legislator in your parts of the and cleinias as i should suppose on the occasion of somewar or other similar danger which caused the passing of the which would be likely to occur in places and intimes of pressure but when men had once tried and been accustomedto a common table experience showed that the institution greatlyconduced to security and in some such manner the custom of havingcommon tables arose among you 
 cle likely enough 
 ath i said that there may have been singularity and danger inimposing such a custom at first but that now there is not the samedifficulty there is however another institution which is thenatural sequel to this and would be excellent if it existedanywhere but at present it does not the institution of which i amabout to speak is not easily described or executed and would belike the legislator combing wool into the fire as people say orperforming any other impossible and useless feat 
 cle what is the cause stranger of this extreme hesitation 
 ath you shall hear without any fruitless loss of time that whichhas law and order in a state is the cause of every good but thatwhich is disordered or is often the ruin of that whichis and at this point the argument is now waiting forwith you cleinias and megillus the common tables of men are as isaid a and admirable institution but you are mistaken inleaving the women unregulated by law they have no similar institutionof public tables in the light of day and just that part of thehuman race which is by nature prone to secrecy and stealth onaccount of their mean the female been leftwithout regulation by the legislator which is a great mistake consequence of this neglect many things have grown lax amongyou which might have been far better if they had been only regulatedby law for the neglect of regulations about women may not only beregarded as a neglect of half the entire matter but in proportionas nature is inferior to that of men in capacity for that degree the consequence of such neglect is more than twice asimportant the careful consideration of this matter and the arrangingand ordering on a common principle of all our institutions relatingboth to men and women greatly conduces to the happiness of the at present such is the unfortunate condition of mankind thatno man of sense will even venture to speak of common tables inplaces and cities in which they have never been established at how can any one avoid being utterly ridiculous who attempts tocompel women to show in public how much they eat and drink there isnothing at which the sex is more likely to take offence for women areaccustomed to creep into dark places and when dragged out into thelight they will exert their utmost powers of resistance and be fartoo much for the legislator and therefore as i said before inmost places they will not endure to have the truth spoken withoutraising a tremendous outcry but in this state perhaps they may andif we may assume that our whole discussion about the state has notbeen mere idle talk i should like to prove to you if you willconsent to listen that this institution is good and proper but ifyou had rather not i will refrain 
 cle there is nothing which we should both of us like than to hear what you have to say 
 ath very good and you must not be surprised if i go back a we have plenty of leisure and there is nothing to prevent us fromconsidering in every point of view the subject of law 
 cle true 
 ath then let us return once more to what we were saying at man should understand that the human race either had nobeginning at all and will never have an end but always will be andhas been or that it began an immense while ago 
 cle certainly 
 ath well and have there not been constitutions and destructions ofstates and all sorts of pursuits both orderly and disorderly anddiverse desires of meats and drinks always and in all the all sorts of changes of the seasons in which animals may beexpected to have undergone innumerable transformations of themselves 
 cle no doubt 
 ath and may we not suppose that vines appeared which hadpreviously no existence and also olives and the gifts of demeter andher daughter of which one triptolemus was the minister and these existed animals took to devouring each other as theydo still 
 cle true 
 ath again the practice of men sacrificing one another still existsamong many nations while on the other hand we hear of other humanbeings who did not even venture to taste the flesh of a cow and had noanimal sacrifices but only cakes and fruits dipped in honey andsimilar pure offerings but no flesh of animals from these theyabstained under the idea that they ought not to eat them and mightnot stain the altars of the gods with blood for in those days men aresaid to have lived a sort of orphic life having the use of alllifeless things but abstaining from all living things 
 cle such has been the constant tradition and is very likely true 
 ath some one might say to us what is the drift of all this 
 cle a very pertinent question stranger 
 ath and therefore i will endeavour cleinias if i can to draw thenatural inference 
 cle proceed 
 ath i see that among men all things depend upon three wants anddesires of which the end is virtue if they are rightly led bythem or the opposite if wrongly now these are eating and begin at animal has a natural desire for them andis violently excited and rebels against him who says that he must notsatisfy all his pleasures and appetites and get rid of all thecorresponding the third and greatest and sharpest want anddesire breaks out last and is the fire of sexual lust whichkindles in men every species of wantonness and madness and thesethree disorders we must endeavour to master by the three greatprinciples of fear and law and right reason turning them away fromthat which is called pleasantest to the best using the muses andthe gods who preside over contests to extinguish their increase andinflux 
 but to marriage let us speak of the birth of after their birth of their nurture and education in the course ofdiscussion the several laws will be perfected and we shall at lastarrive at the common tables whether such associations are to beconfined to men or extended to women also we shall see better whenwe approach and take a nearer view of them and we may thendetermine what previous institutions are required and will have toprecede them as i said before we shall see them more in detail andshall be better able to lay down the laws which are proper or suitedto them 
 cle very true 
 ath let us keep in mind the words which have now been spoken forhereafter there may be need of them 
 cle what do you bid us keep in mind 
 ath that which we comprehended under the three drinking thirdly the excitement of love 
 cle we shall be sure to remember stranger 
 ath very good then let us now proceed to marriage and teachpersons in what way they shall beget children threatening them ifthey disobey with the terrors of the law 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath the bride and bridegroom should consider that they are toproduce for the state the best and fairest specimens of children whichthey can now all men who are associated any action always succeedwhen they attend and give their mind to what they are doing butwhen they do not give their mind or have no mind they fail whereforelet the bridegroom give his mind to the bride and to the begettingof children and the bride in like manner give her mind to thebridegroom and particularly at the time when their children are notyet born and let the women whom we have chosen be the overseers ofsuch matters and let them in whatever number large or small andat whatever time the magistrates may command assemble every day inthe temple of eileithyia during a third part of the day and beingthere assembled let them inform one another of any one whom they man or woman of those who are begetting the ordinances given at the time when the nuptialsacrifices and ceremonies were performed let the begetting ofchildren and the supervision of those who are begetting themcontinue ten years and no longer during the time when marriage isfruitful but if any continue without children up to this time letthem take counsel with their kindred and with the women holding theoffice of overseer and be divorced for their mutual benefit any dispute arises about what is proper and for theinterest of either party they shall choose ten of the guardians ofthe law and abide by their permission and appointment the women whopreside over these matters shall enter into the houses of the partly by admonitions and partly by threats make them give overtheir folly and error if they persist let the women go and tellthe guardians of the law and the guardians shall prevent them but ifthey too cannot prevent them they shall bring the matter before thepeople and let them write up their names and make oath that theycannot reform such and such an one and let him who is thus writtenup if he cannot in a court of law convict those who have inscribedhis name be deprived of the privileges of a citizen in thefollowing him not go to weddings nor to thethanksgivings after the birth of children and if he go let any onewho pleases strike him with impunity and let the same regulationshold about women let not a woman be allowed to appear abroad orreceive honour or go to nuptial and birthday festivals if she inlike manner be written up as acting disorderly and cannot obtain averdict and if when they themselves have done begetting childrenaccording to the law a man or woman have connection with anotherman or woman who are still begetting children let the samepenalties be inflicted upon them as upon those who are still havinga family and when the time for procreation has passed let the manor woman who refrains in such matters be held in esteem and let thosewho do not refrain be held in the contrary of is to now if the greater part of mankind behave modestly theenactments of law may be left to slumber but if they are enactments having been passed let them be carried into every man the first year is the beginning of life and the timeof birth ought to be written down in the temples of their fathers asthe beginning of existence to every child whether boy or girl letevery phratria have inscribed on a whited wall the names of thesuccessive archons by whom the years are reckoned and near to themlet the living members of the phratria be inscribed and when theydepart life let them be erased the limit of marriageable ages for awoman shall be from sixteen to twenty years at the aman from thirty to years and let a woman hold officeat forty and a man at thirty years let a man go out to war fromtwenty to sixty years and for a woman if there appear any need tomake use of her in military service let the time of service beafter she shall have brought forth children up to fifty years ofage and let regard be had to what is possible and suitable to each

 book vii 
 
 and now assuming children of both sexes to have been born itwill be proper for us to consider in the next place their nurtureand education this cannot be left altogether unnoticed and yet maybe thought a subject fitted rather for precept and admonition than forlaw in private life there are many little things not alwaysapparent arising out of the pleasures and pains and desires ofindividuals which run counter to the intention of the legislator andmake the characters of the citizens various and is anevil in states for by reason of their smallness and frequentoccurrence there would be an unseemliness and want of propriety inmaking them penal by law and if made penal they are thedestruction of the written law because mankind get the habit offrequently transgressing the law in small matters the result isthat you cannot legislate about them and still less can you besilent i speak somewhat darkly but i shall endeavour also to bringmy wares into the light of day for i acknowledge that at presentthere is a want of clearness in what i am saying 
 cleinias very true 
 athenian stranger am i not right in maintaining that a goodeducation is that which tends most to the improvement of mind andbody 
 cle undoubtedly 
 ath and nothing can be plainer than that the fairest bodies arethose which grow up from infancy in the best and straightest manner 
 cle certainly 
 ath and do we not further observe that the first shoot of everyliving thing is by far the greatest and fullest many will evencontend that a man at does not reach twice the heightwhich he attained at five 
 cle true 
 ath well and is not rapid growth without proper and abundantexercise the source endless evils in the body 
 cle yes 
 ath and the body should have the most exercise when it receivesmost nourishment 
 cle but stranger are we to impose this great amount of exerciseupon infants 
 ath nay rather on the bodies of infants still unborn 
 cle what do you mean my good sir in the process of gestation 
 ath exactly i am not at all surprised that you have never heard ofthis very peculiar sort of gymnastic applied to such little although strange i will endeavour to explain to you 
 cle by all means 
 ath the practice is more easy for us to understand than for you byreason of certain amusements which are carried to excess by us atathens not only boys but often older persons are in the habit ofkeeping quails and cocks which they train to fight one another andthey are far from thinking that the contests in which they stir themup to fight with one another are sufficient exercise for in additionto this they carry them about tucked beneath their armpits holdingthe smaller birds in their hands the larger under their arms andgo for a walk of a great many miles for the sake of health that is tosay not their own health but the health of the birds wherebythey prove to any intelligent person that all bodies are benefited byshakings and movements when they are moved without weariness whethermotion proceeds from themselves or is caused by a swing or at on horseback or by other bodies in whatever way moving and thatthus gaining the mastery over food and drink they are able toimpart beauty and health and strength but admitting all this whatfollows shall we make a ridiculous law that the pregnant womanshall walk about and fashion the embryo within as we fashion waxbefore it hardens and after birth swathe the infant for two that we compel nurses under penalty of a legal fine to bealways carrying the children somewhere or other either to thetemples or into the country or to their relations houses untilthey are well able to stand and to take care that their limbs are notdistorted by leaning on them when they are too shouldcontinue to carry them until the infant has completed its thirdyear the nurses should be strong and there should be more than oneof them shall these be our rules and shall we impose a penalty forthe neglect of them no no the penalty of which we were speakingwill fall upon our own heads more than enough 
 cle what penalty 
 ath ridicule and the difficulty of getting the feminine dispositions of the nurses to comply 
 cle then why was there any need to speak of the matter at all 
 ath the reason is that masters and freemen in states when theyhear of it are very likely to arrive at a true conviction thatwithout due regulation of private life in cities stability in thelaying down of laws is hardly to be expected and he who makes thisreflection may himself adopt the laws just now mentioned them may order his house and state well and be happy 
 cle likely enough 
 ath and therefore let us proceed with our legislation until we havedetermined the exercises which are suited to the souls of youngchildren in the same manner in which we have begun to go throughthe rules relating to their bodies 
 cle by all means 
 ath let us assume then as a first principle in relation both tothe body and soul of very young creatures that nursing and movingabout by day and night is good for them all and that the younger theyare the more they will need it infants should live if that werepossible as if they were always rocking at sea this is the lessonwhich we may gather from the experience of nurses and likewise fromthe use of the remedy of motion in the rites of the corybantes forwhen mothers want their restless children to go to sleep they do notemploy rest but on the contrary them in theirarms nor do they give them silence but they sing to them and lapthem in sweet strains and the bacchic women are cured of their frenzyin the same manner by the use of the dance and of music 
 cle well stranger and what is the reason of this 
 ath the reason is obvious 
 cle what 
 ath the affection both of the bacchantes and of the children isan emotion of fear which springs out of an evil habit of the when some one applies external agitation to affections of thissort the motion coming from without gets the better of the terribleand violent internal one and produces a peace and calm in the quiets the restless palpitation of the heart which is a thingmuch to be desired sending the children to sleep and making thebacchantes although they remain awake to dance to the pipe withthe help of the gods to whom they offer acceptable sacrifices andproducing in them a sound mind which takes the place of their to express what i mean in a word there is a good deal to be saidin favour of this treatment 
 cle certainly 
 ath but if fear has such a power we ought to infer from thesefacts that every soul which from youth upward has been familiarwith fears will be made more liable to fear and every one will allowthat this is the way to form a habit of cowardice and not of courage 
 cle no doubt 
 ath and on the other hand the habit of overcoming from our youthupwards the fears and terrors which beset us may be said to be anexercise of courage 
 cle true 
 ath and we may say that the use of exercise and motion in theearliest years of life greatly contributes to create a part ofvirtue in the soul 
 cle quite true 
 ath further a cheerful temper or the reverse may be regardedas having much to do with high spirit on the one hand or withcowardice on the other 
 cle to be sure 
 ath then now we must endeavour to show how and to what extent wemay if we please without difficulty implant either character inthe young 
 cle certainly 
 ath there is a common opinion that luxury makes the disposition ofyouth discontented and irascible and vehemently excited by on the other hand excessive and savage servitude makes men meanand abject and haters of their kind and therefore makes themundesirable associates 
 cle but how must the state educate those who do not as yetunderstand the language of the country and are therefore incapable ofappreciating any sort of instruction 
 ath i will tell you animal that is born is wont to uttersome cry and this is especially the case with man and he is alsoaffected with the inclination to weep more than any other animal 
 cle quite true 
 ath do not nurses when they want to know what an infant by these anything is brought to the infant and he issilent then he is supposed to be pleased but when he weeps andcries out then he is not pleased for tears and cries are theinauspicious signs by which children show what they love and hate nowthe time which is thus spent is no less than three years and is avery considerable portion of life to be passed ill or well 
 cle true 
 ath does not the discontented and ungracious nature appear to youto be full of lamentations and sorrows more than a good man ought tobe 
 cle certainly 
 ath well but if during these three years every possible carewere taken that our nursling should have as little of sorrow and in general of pain as was possible might we not expect in earlychildhood to make his soul more gentle and cheerful 
 cle to be sure especially if we could procure hima variety of pleasures 
 ath there i can no longer agree cleinias you amaze me to bringhim up in such a way would be his utter ruin for the beginning isalways the most critical part of education let us see whether i amright 
 cle proceed 
 ath the point about which you and i differ is of greatimportance and i hope that you megillus will help to decide betweenus for i maintain that the true life should neither seek forpleasures nor on the other hand entirely avoid pains but shouldembrace the middle state which i just spoke of as gentle andbenign and is a state which we by some divine presage and inspirationrightly ascribe to god now i say he among men too who would bedivine ought to pursue after this mean should not rushheadlong into pleasures for he will not be free from pains norshould we allow any one young or old male or female to be thusgiven any more than ourselves and least of all the in infancy more than at any other time the character isengrained by habit nay more if i were not afraid of appearing to beridiculous i would say that a woman during her year of pregnancyshould of all women be most carefully tended and kept from violent orexcessive pleasures and pains and should at that time cultivategentleness and benevolence and kindness 
 cle you need not ask megillus stranger which of us has mosttruly spoken for i myself agree that all men ought to avoid thelife of unmingled pain or pleasure and pursue always a middle having spoken well may i add that you have been well answered 
 ath very good cleinias and now let us all three consider afurther point 
 cle what is it 
 ath that all the matters which we are now describing are commonlycalled by the general name of unwritten customs and what are termedthe laws of our ancestors are all of similar nature and thereflection which lately arose in our minds that we can neither callthese things laws nor yet leave them unmentioned is justified forthey are the bonds of the whole state and come in between the writtenlaws which are or are hereafter to be laid down they are justancestral customs of great antiquity which if they are rightlyordered and made habitual shield and preserve the previously existingwritten law but if they depart from right and fall into they are like the props of builders which slip away out oftheir place and cause a universal part drags another the fair falls because the old foundations areundermined reflecting upon this cleinias you ought to bind togetherthe new state in every possible way omitting nothing whether greator small of what are called laws or manners or pursuits for by thesemeans a city is bound together and all these things are onlylasting when they depend upon one another and therefore we must notwonder if we find that many apparently trifling customs or usages comepouring in and lengthening out our laws 
 cle very true we are disposed to agree with you 
 ath up to the age of three years whether of boy or girl if aperson strictly carries out our previous regulations and makes thema principal aim he will do much for the advantage of the youngcreatures but at three four five and even six years the childishnature will require sports now is the time to get rid of inhim punishing him but not so as to disgrace him we were sayingabout slaves that we ought neither to add insult to punishment soas to anger them nor yet to leave them unpunished lest they and a like rule is to be observed in the case of children at that age have certain natural modes ofamusement which they find out for themselves when they meet and allthe children who are between the ages of three and six ought to meetat the temples the villages the several families of a village unitingon one spot the nurses are to see that the children behave properlyand themselves and all their companies are to be underthe control of twelve matrons one for each company who areannually selected to inspect them from the women previously the women who have authority over marriage whom the guardiansof the law appoint these matrons shall be chosen by the women whohave authority over marriage one out of each tribe all are to beof the same age and let each of them as soon as she is office and go to the temples every day punishing alloffenders male or female who are slaves or strangers by the help ofsome of the public slaves but if any citizen disputes the her bring him before the wardens of the city or if there be nodispute let her punish him herself after the age of six years thetime has arrived for the separation of the boys live withboys and girls in like manner with girls now they must begin boys going to teachers of horsemanship and the use of thebow the javelin and sling and the girls too if they do not any rate until they know how to manage these weapons andespecially how to handle heavy arms for i may note that the practicewhich now prevails is almost universally misunderstood 
 cle in what respect 
 ath in that the right and left hand are supposed to be by naturedifferently suited for our various uses of them whereas no differenceis found in the use of the feet and the lower limbs but in the use ofthe hands we are as it were maimed by the folly of nurses andmothers for although our several limbs are by nature balanced wecreate a difference in them by bad habit in some cases this is ofno consequence as for example when we hold the lyre in the lefthand and the plectrum in the right but it is downright folly to makethe same distinction in other cases the custom of the scythiansproves our error for they not only hold the bow from them with theleft hand and draw the arrow to them with their right but useeither hand for both purposes and there are many similar examplesin charioteering and other things from which we may learn thatthose who make the left side weaker than the right act contrary tonature in the case of the plectrum which is of horn only andsimilar instruments as i was saying it is of no consequence butmakes a great difference and may be of very great importance to thewarrior who has to use iron weapons bows and javelins and thelike above all when in heavy armour he has to fight against heavyarmour and there is a very great difference between one who haslearnt and one who has not and between one who has been trained ingymnastic exercises and one who has not been for as he who isperfectly skilled in the pancratium or boxing or wrestling is notunable to fight from his left side and does not limp and draggle inconfusion when his opponent makes him change his position so fighting and in all other things if i am not like who has these double powers of attack and defenceought not in any case to leave them either unused or untrained ifhe can help and if a person had the nature of geryon or briareus heought to be able with his hundred hands to throw a hundred darts magistrates male and female should see to all these women superintending the nursing and amusements of the the men superintending their education that all of them boys andgirls alike may be sound hand and foot and may not if they canhelp spoil the gifts of nature by bad habits 
 education has two of gymnastic which is concerned withthe body and the other of music which is designed for theimprovement of the soul and gymnastic has also two wrestling and one sort of dancing imitates musical aims at preserving dignity and freedom the other aims atproducing health agility and beauty in the limbs and parts of thebody giving the proper flexion and extension to each of them aharmonious motion being diffused everywhere and forming a suitableaccompaniment to the dance as regards wrestling the tricks whichantaeus and cercyon devised in their systems out of a vain spirit ofcompetition or the tricks of boxing which epeius or amycusinvented are useless and unsuitable for war and do not deserve tohave much said about them but the art of wrestling erect andkeeping free the neck and hands and sides working with energy andconstancy with a composed strength and for the sake are always useful and are not to be neglected but to beenjoined alike on masters and scholars when we reach that part oflegislation and we will desire the one to give their instructionsfreely and the others to receive them thankfully nor again must weomit suitable imitations of war in our choruses here in crete youhave the armed dances if the curetes and the lacedaemonians havethose of the dioscuri and our virgin lady delighting in theamusement of the dance thought it not fit to amuse herself with emptyhands she must be clothed in a complete suit of armour and in thisattire go through the dance and youths and maidens should in everyrespect imitate her esteeming highly the favour of the with a view to the necessities of war and to festiveoccasions it will be right also for the boys until such time as theygo out to war to make processions and supplications to all the godsin goodly array armed and on horseback in dances and or slow offering up prayers to the gods and to the sons of also engaging in contests and preludes of contests if at these objects for these sorts of exercises and no others areuseful both in peace and war and are beneficial alike to states andto private houses but other labours and sports and exercises of thebody are unworthy of freemen o megillus and cleinias 
 i have now completely described the kind of gymnastic which i saidat first ought to be described if you know of any better will youcommunicate your thoughts 
 cle it is not easy stranger to put aside these principles ofgymnastic and wrestling and to enunciate better ones 
 ath now we must say what has yet to be said about the gifts ofthe muses and of apollo before we fancied that we had said that gymnastic alone remained but now we see clearly whatpoints have been omitted and should be first proclaimed of let us proceed to speak 
 cle by all means 
 ath let me tell you once you have heard me say thesame before that caution must be always exercised both by the speakerand by the hearer about anything that is very singular and my tale is one which many a man would be afraid to tell andyet i have a confidence which makes me go on 
 cle what have you to say stranger 
 ath i say that in states generally no one has observed that theplays of childhood have a great deal to do with the permanence or wantof permanence in legislation for when plays are ordered with a viewto children having the same plays and amusing themselves after thesame manner and finding delight in the same playthings the moresolemn institutions of the state are allowed to remain if sports are disturbed and innovations are made in them andthey constantly change and the young never speak of their havingthe same likings or the same established notions of good and badtaste either in the bearing of their bodies or in their dress but hewho devises something new and out of the way in figures and coloursand the like is held in special honour we may truly say that nogreater evil can happen in a state for he who changes the sports issecretly changing the manners of the young and making the old to bedishonoured among them and the new to be honoured and i affirm thatthere is nothing which is a greater injury to all states than sayingor thinking thus will you hear me tell how great i deem the evil tobe 
 cle you mean the evil of blaming antiquity in states 
 ath exactly 
 cle if you are speaking of that you will find in us hearers whoare disposed to receive what you say not unfavourably but mostfavourably 
 ath i should expect so 
 cle proceed 
 ath well then let us give all the greater heed to one the argument affirms that any change whatever except fromevil is the most dangerous of all things this is true in the caseof the seasons and of the winds in the management of our bodies andthe habits of our of all things except as i said the bad he who looks at the constitution of individuals accustomedto eat any sort of meat or drink any drink or to do any work whichthey can get may see that they are at first disordered by them butafterwards as time goes on their bodies grow adapted to them andthey learn to know and like variety and have good health andenjoyment of life and if ever afterwards they are confined again to asuperior diet at first they are troubled with disorders and withdifficulty become habituated to their new food a similar principle wemay imagine to hold good about the minds of men and the natures oftheir souls for when they have been brought up in certain laws whichby some divine providence have remained unchanged during long ages sothat no one has any memory or tradition of their ever having beenotherwise than they are then every one is afraid and ashamed tochange that which is established the legislator must somehow find away of implanting this reverence for antiquity and i would proposethe following are apt to fancy as i was saying when the plays of children are altered they are merely plays notseeing that the most serious and detrimental consequences arise out ofthe change and they readily comply with the wishes instead ofdeterring him not considering that these children who makeinnovations in their games when they grow up to be men will bedifferent from the last generation of children and beingdifferent will desire a different sort of life and under theinfluence of this desire will want other institutions and laws and noone of them reflects that there will follow what i just now called thegreatest of evils to states changes in bodily fashions are no suchserious evils but frequent changes in the praise and censure ofmanners are the greatest of evils and require the utmost prevision 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and now do we still hold to our former assertion thatrhythms and music in general are imitations of good and evilcharacters in men what say you 
 cle that is the only doctrine which we can admit 
 ath must we not then try in every possible way to prevent ouryouth from even desiring to imitate new modes either in dance or must any one be allowed to offer them varieties of pleasures 
 cle most true 
 ath can any of us imagine a better mode of effecting this objectthan that of the egyptians 
 cle what is their method 
 ath to consecrate every sort of dance or melody first we shouldordain for the year what they ought to be andat what time and in honour of what gods sons of gods and heroesthey ought to be celebrated and in the next place what hymnsought to be sung at the several sacrifices and with what dances theparticular festival is to be honoured this has to be arranged atfirst by certain persons and when arranged the whole assembly ofthe citizens are to offer sacrifices and libations to the fates andall the other gods and to consecrate the several odes to gods andheroes and if any one offers any other hymns or dances to any oneof the gods the priests and priestesses acting in concert with theguardians of the law shall with the sanction of religion and thelaw exclude him and he who is excluded if he do not submit shallbe liable all his life long to have a suit of impiety broughtagainst him by any one who likes 
 cle very good 
 ath in the consideration of this subject let us remember what isdue to ourselves 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath i mean that any young man and much more any old one when hesees or hears anything strange or unaccustomed does not at once runto embrace the paradox but he stands considering like a person whois at a place where three paths meet and does not very well knowhis may be alone or he may be walking with others and hewill say to himself and them which is the way and will not moveforward until he is satisfied that he is going right and this is whatwe must do in the present strange discussion on thesubject of law has arisen which requires the utmost we should not at our age be too ready to speak about such greatmatters or be confident that we can say anything certain all in amoment 
 cle most true 
 ath then we will allow time for reflection and decide when we havegiven the subject sufficient consideration but that we may not behindered from completing the natural arrangement of our laws let usproceed to the conclusion of them in due order for very god will the exposition of them when completed may throw lighton our present perplexity 
 cle excellent stranger let us do as you propose 
 ath let us then affirm the paradox that strains of music are ourlaws nomoi and this latter being the name which the ancients gaveto lyric songs they probably would not have very much objected to ourproposed application of the word some one either asleep or have had a dreamy suspicion of their nature and let our decreebe as one in singing or dancing shall offend againstpublic and consecrated models and the general fashion among theyouth any more than he would offend against any other law and he whoobserves this law shall be blameless but he who is disobedient asi was saying shall be punished by the guardians of the laws and bythe priests and priestesses suppose that we imagine this to be ourlaw 
 cle very good 
 ath can any one who makes such laws escape ridicule let us think that our only safety will be in first framing certain modelsfor composers one of these models shall be as when asacrifice is going on and the victims are being burnt according i say any one who may be a son or brother standing byanother at the altar and over the victims horribly blasphemes willnot his words inspire despondency and evil omens and forebodings inthe mind of his father and of his other kinsmen 
 cle of course 
 ath and this is just what takes place in almost all our cities amagistrate offers a public sacrifice and there come in not one butmany choruses who take up a position a little way from the altar andfrom time to time pour forth all sorts of horrible blasphemies onthe sacred rites exciting the souls of the audience with words andrhythms and melodies most sorrowful to hear and he who at themoment when the city is offering sacrifice makes the citizens weepmost carries away the palm of victory now ought we not to forbidsuch strains as these and if ever our citizens must hear suchlamentations then on some unblest and inauspicious day let there bechoruses of foreign and hired minstrels like those hirelings whoaccompany the departed at funerals with barbarous carian is the sort of thing which will be appropriate if we have suchstrains at all and let the apparel of the singers be not circletsand ornaments of gold but the reverse enough of all this i willsimply ask once more whether we shall lay down as one of ourprinciples of song 
 cle what 
 ath that we should avoid every word of evil omen let that kindof song which is of good omen be heard everywhere and always in ourstate i need hardly ask again but shall assume that you agree withme 
 cle by all means that law is approved by the suffrages of us all 
 ath but what shall be our next musical law or type ought notprayers to be offered up to the gods when we sacrifice 
 cle certainly 
 ath and our third law if i am not mistaken will be to theeffect that our poets understanding prayers to be requests which wemake to the gods will take especial heed that they do not bymistake ask for evil instead of good to make such a prayer wouldsurely be too ridiculous 
 cle very true 
 ath were we not a little while ago quite convinced that no silveror golden plutus should dwell in our state 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and what has it been the object of our argument to show did wenot imply that the poets are not always quite capable of knowingwhat is good or evil and if one of them utters a mistaken prayer insong or words he will make our citizens pray for the opposite of whatis good in matters of the highest import than which as i was can be few greater mistakes shall we then propose as one of ourlaws and models relating to the muses 
 cle you explain the law more precisely 
 ath shall we make a law that the poet shall compose nothingcontrary to the ideas of the lawful or just or beautiful or are allowed in the state nor shall he be permitted tocommunicate his compositions to any private individuals until heshall have shown them to the appointed judges and the guardians of thelaw and they are satisfied with them as to the persons whom weappoint to be our legislators about music and as to the director ofeducation these have been already indicated once more then as ihave asked more than once shall this be our third law and do you say 
 cle let it be so by all means 
 ath then it will be proper to have hymns and praises of the with prayers and after the gods prayers and praisesshould be offered in like manner to demigods and heroes suitable totheir several characters 
 cle certainly 
 ath in the next place there will be no objection to a law thatcitizens who are departed and have done good and energetic with their souls or with their bodies and have been obedientto the laws should receive eulogies this will be very fitting 
 cle quite true 
 ath but to honour with hymns and panegyrics those who are stillalive is not safe a man should run his course and make a fairending and then we will praise him and let praise be given equallyto women as well as men who have been distinguished in virtue theorder of songs and dances shall be as are manyancient musical compositions and dances which are excellent andfrom these the city may freely select what is proper andsuitable and they shall choose judges of not less than fifty years ofage who shall make the selection and any of the old poems which theydeem sufficient they shall include any that are deficient oraltogether unsuitable they shall either utterly throw aside orexamine and amend taking into their counsel poets and making use of their poetical genius but explaining to them thewishes of the legislator in order that they may regulate and all choral strains according to the mind of the not allowing them to indulge except in some few matters theirindividual pleasures and fancies now the irregular strain of music isalways made ten thousand times better by attaining to law and rejecting the honeyed however that we mean wholly toexclude pleasure which is the characteristic of all music and if aman be brought up from childhood to the age of discretion and maturityin the use of the orderly and severe music when he hears the oppositehe detests it and calls it illiberal but if trained in the sweet andvulgar music he deems the severer kind cold and displeasing so i was saying before while he who hears them gains no more pleasurefrom the one than from the other the one has the advantage ofmaking those who are trained in it better men whereas the other makesthem worse 
 cle very true 
 ath again we must distinguish and determine on some generalprinciple what songs are suitable to women and what to men andmust assign to them their proper melodies and rhythms it isshocking for a whole harmony to be inharmonical or for a rhythm to beunrhythmical and this will happen when the melody is inappropriate tothem and therefore the legislator must assign to these also theirforms now both sexes have melodies and rhythms which of necessitybelong to them and those of women are clearly enough indicated bytheir natural difference the grand and that which tends tocourage may be fairly called manly but that which inclines tomoderation and temperance may be declared both in law and in ordinaryspeech to be the more womanly quality this then will be the generalorder of them 
 let us now speak of the manner of teaching and imparting them andthe persons to whom and the time when they are severally to beimparted as the shipwright first lays down the lines of the keel andthus as it were draws the ship in outline so do i seek todistinguish the patterns of life and lay down their keels accordingto the nature of different souls seeking truly to consider bywhat means and in what ways we may go through the voyage of lifebest now human affairs are hardly worth considering in earnest andyet we must be in earnest about sad necessity constrains having got thus far there will be a fitness in our completing thematter if we can only find some suitable method of doing so but whatdo i mean some one may ask this very question and quite 
 cle certainly 
 ath i say that about serious matters a man should be serious andabout a matter which is not serious he should not be serious andthat god is the natural and worthy object of our most serious andblessed endeavours for man as i said before is made to be theplaything of god and this truly considered is the best of also every man and woman should walk seriously and passlife in the noblest of pastimes and be of another mind from what theyare at present 
 cle in what respect 
 ath at present they think that their serious suits should be forthe sake of their sports for they deem war a serious must be managed well for the sake of peace but the truth there neither is nor has been nor ever will be eitheramusement or instruction in any degree worth speaking of in is nevertheless deemed by us to be the most serious of ourpursuits and therefore as we say every one of us should live thelife of peace as long and as well as he can and what is the right wayof living are we to live in sports always if so in what kind ofsports we ought to live sacrificing and singing and dancing andthen a man will be able to propitiate the gods and to defendhimself against his enemies and conquer them in battle the type ofsong or dance by which he will propitiate them has been described andthe paths along which he is to proceed have been cut for him hewill go forward in the spirit of the poet 
 telemachus some things thou wilt thyself find in thy heart butother things god will suggest for i deem that thou wast not broughtup without the will of the this ought to be the view of our alumni they ought to thinkthat what has been said is enough for them and that any otherthings their genius and god will suggest to will tell themto whom and when and to what gods severally they are to sacrificeand perform dances and how they may propitiate the deities andlive according to the appointment of nature being for the most partpuppets but having some little share of reality 
 megillus you have a low opinion of mankind stranger 
 ath nay megillus be not amazed but forgive was comparingthem with the gods and under that feeling i spoke let us grant ifyou wish that the human race is not to be despised but is worthyof some consideration 
 next follow the buildings for gymnasia and schools open to are to be in three places in the midst of the city andoutside the city and in the surrounding country also in three shall be schools for horse exercise and large groundsarranged with a view to archery and the throwing of missiles at whichyoung men may learn and practise of these mention has already beenmade and if the mention be not sufficiently explicit let us of them and embody them in laws in these several schoolslet there be dwellings for teachers who shall be brought from foreignparts by pay and let them teach those who attend the schools theart of war and the art of music and the children shall come notonly if their parents please but if they do not please there shallbe compulsory education as the saying is of all and sundry as farthis is possible and the pupils shall be regarded as belonging to thestate rather than to their parents my law would apply to females aswell as males they shall both go through the same exercises i assertwithout fear of contradiction that gymnastic and horsemanship are assuitable to women as to men of the truth of this i am persuadedfrom ancient tradition and at the present day there are said to becountless myriads of women in the neighbourhood of the black sauromatides who not only ride on horseback like men but haveenjoined upon them the use of bows and other weapons equally withthe men and i further affirm that if these things are can be more absurd than the practice which prevails in our owncountry of men and women not following the same pursuits with alltheir strength and with one mind for thus the state instead of beinga whole is reduced to a half but has the same imposts to pay and thesame toils to undergo and what can be a greater mistake for anylegislator to make than this 
 cle very true yet much of what has been asserted by us strangeris contrary to the custom of states still in saying that thediscourse should be allowed to proceed and that when the discussionis completed we should choose what seems best you spoke veryproperly and i now feel compunction for what i have said tell what you would next wish to say 
 ath i should wish to say cleinias as i said before that if thepossibility of these things were not sufficiently proven in fact thenthere might be an objection to the argument but the fact being as ihave said he who rejects the law must find some other ground ofobjection and failing this our exhortation will still hold will any one deny that women ought to share as far as possiblein education and in other ways with men for women do notshare in their whole life with men then they must have some otherorder of life 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what arrangement of life to be found anywhere is preferableto this community which we are now assigning to them shall weprefer that which is adopted by the thracians and many other races whouse their women to till the ground and to be shepherds of theirherds and flocks and to minister to them like shall wedo as we and people in our part of the world together asthe phrase is all our goods and chattels into one dwelling weentrust them to our women who are the stewards of them and whoalso preside over the shuttles and the whole art of spinning or shallwe take a middle course in lacedaemon the girlsshare in gymnastic and music while the women no longeremployed in spinning wool are hard at work weaving the web of will be no cheap or mean employment and in the duty ofserving and taking care of the household and bringing up which they will observe a sort of mean not participating in thetoils of war and if there were any necessity that they should fightfor their city and families unlike the amazons they would beunable to take part in archery or any other skilled use of could they after the example of the goddess carry shield orspear or stand up nobly for their country when it was beingdestroyed and strike terror into their enemies if only becausethey were seen in regular order living as they do they would neverdare at all to imitate the sauromatides who when compared withordinary women would appear to be like men let him who your legislators but i must say what i think the legislatorought to be whole and perfect and not half a man only he ought notto let the female sex live softly and waste money and have no order oflife while he takes the utmost care of the male sex and leaveshalf of life only blest with happiness when he might have made thewhole state happy 
 meg what shall we do cleinias shall we allow a stranger to rundown sparta in this fashion 
 cle yes for as we have given him liberty of speech we must let himgo on until we have perfected the work of legislation 
 meg very true 
 ath then now i may proceed 
 cle by all means 
 ath what will be the manner of life among men who may be supposedto have their food and clothing provided for them in moderation andwho have entrusted the practice of the arts to others and whosehusbandry committed to slaves paying a part of the produce bringsthem a return sufficient for men living temperately who common tables in which the men are placed apart and near themare the common tables of their families of their daughters andmothers which day by day the officers male and female are shall see to the behaviour of the company and so dismissthem after which the presiding magistrate and his attendants shallhonour with libations those gods to whom that day and night arededicated and then go home to men whose lives are thus ordered isthere no work remaining to be done which is necessary and fitting butshall each one of them live fattening like a beast such a life isneither just nor honourable nor can he who lives it fail of meetinghis due and the due reward of the idle fatted beast is that he shouldbe torn in pieces by some other valiant beast whose fatness is worndown by brave deeds and toil these regulations if we duly considerthem will never be exactly carried into execution under presentcircumstances nor as long as women and children and houses and allother things are the private property of individuals but if we canattain the form of polity we shall be very well to men living under this second polity there remains a work tobe accomplished which is far from being small or insignificant but isthe greatest of all works and ordained by the appointment ofrighteous law for the life which may be truly said to be concernedwith the virtue of body and soul is twice or more than twice as fullof toil and trouble as the pursuit after pythian and olympicvictories which debars a man from every employment of life for thereought to be no interfering with the greater work of providingthe necessary exercise and nourishment for the body and instructionand education for the soul night and day are not long enough forthe accomplishment of their perfection and consummation and thereforeto this end all freemen ought to arrange the way in which they willspend their time during the whole course of the day from morning tillevening and from evening till the morning of the next sunrise theremay seem to be some impropriety in the legislator determining minutelythe numberless details of the management of the house includingsuch particulars as the duty of wakefulness in those who are to beperpetual watchmen of the whole city for that any citizen shouldcontinue during the whole of any night in sleep instead of being seenby all his servants always the first to awake and get the regulation is to be called a law or only a be deemed base and unworthy of a freeman also that themistress of the house should be awakened by her handmaidens instead ofherself first awakening them is what the slaves male and female andthe and if that were possible everybody and everythingin the house should regard as base if they rise early they may allof them do much of their public and of their household business asmagistrates in the city and masters and mistresses in their privatehouses before the sun is up much sleep is not required by for our souls or bodies or for the actions which they no one who is asleep is good for anything any more than if hewere dead but he of us who has the most regard for life and reasonkeeps awake as long he can reserving only so much time for sleep asis expedient for health and much sleep is not required if thehabit of moderation be once rightly formed magistrates in stateswho keep awake at night are terrible to the bad whether enemies orcitizens and are honoured and reverenced by the just and are useful to themselves and to the whole state 
 a night which is passed in such a manner in addition to all advantages infuses a sort of courage into the mindsof the citizens when the day breaks the time has arrived for youthto go to their schoolmasters now neither sheep nor any otheranimals can live without a shepherd nor can children be leftwithout tutors or slaves without masters and of all animals theboy is the most unmanageable inasmuch as he has the fountain ofreason in him not yet regulated he is the most and insubordinate of animals wherefore he must be boundwith many bridles in the first place when he gets away frommothers and nurses he must be under the management of tutors onaccount of his childishness and foolishness then again being afreeman he must be controlled by teachers no matter what they by studies but he is also a slave and in that regard any freemanwho comes in his way may punish him and his tutor and hisinstructor if any of them does anything wrong and he who comesacross him and does not inflict upon him the punishment which hedeserves shall incur the greatest disgrace and let the guardian ofthe law who is the director of education see to him who coming inthe way of the offences which we have mentioned does not chastisethem when he ought or chastises them in a way which he ought not lethim keep a sharp and take especial care of the training ofour children directing their natures and always turning them to goodaccording to the law 
 but how can our law sufficiently train the director of for as yet all has been imperfect and nothing has beensaid either clear or satisfactory now as far as possible the lawought to leave nothing to him but to explain everything that hemay be an interpreter and tutor to others about dances and musicand choral strains i have already spoken both to the character of theselection of them and the manner in which they are to be amendedand consecrated but we have not as yet spoken o illustrious guardianof education of the manner in which your pupils are to use thosestrains which are written in prose although you have been informedwhat martial strains they are to learn and practise what relates inthe first place to the learning of letters and secondly to the also to calculation which as we were saying is needful for themall to learn and any other things which are required with a view towar and the management of house and city and looking to the sameobject what is useful in the revolutions of the heavenly and sun and moon and the various regulations about thesematters which are necessary for the whole am speaking of thearrangements of days in periods of months and of months in are to be observed in order that seasons and sacrifices andfestivals may have their regular and natural order and keep thecity alive and awake the gods receiving the honours due to men having a better understanding about them all these my friend have not yet been sufficiently declared to you by thelegislator attend then to what i am now going to weretelling you in the first place that you were not sufficientlyinformed about letters and the objection was to this were never told whether he who was meant to be a respectablecitizen should apply himself in detail to that sort of learning ornot apply himself at all and the same remark holds good of thestudy of the lyre but now we say that he ought to attend to them afair time for a boy of ten years old to spend in letters is threeyears the age of thirteen is the proper time for him to begin tohandle the lyre and he may continue at this for another threeyears neither more nor less and whether his father or himself likeor dislike the study he is not to be allowed to spend more or lesstime in learning music than the law allows and let him who disobeysthe law be deprived of those youthful honours of which we shallhereafter speak hear however first of all what the young oughtto learn in the early years of life and what their instructorsought to teach them they ought to be occupied with their lettersuntil they are to read and write but the acquisition of perfectbeauty or quickness in writinig if nature has not stimulated themto acquire these accomplishments in the given number of years theyshould let alone and as to the learning of compositions committedto writing which are not set to the lyre whether metrical orwithout rhythmical divisions compositions in prose as they aretermed having no rhythm or how dangerous are thewritings handed down to us by many writers of this will youdo with them o most excellent guardians of the law or how can thelawgiver rightly direct you about them i believe that he will be ingreat difficulty 
 cle what troubles you stranger and why are you so perplexed inyour mind 
 ath you naturally ask cleinias and to you and megillus who aremy partners in the work of legislation i must state the moredifficult as well as the easier parts of the task 
 cle to what do you refer in this instance 
 ath i will tell you there is a difficulty in opposing many myriadsof mouths 
 cle well and have we not already opposed the popular voice in manyimportant enactments 
 ath that is quite true and you mean to imply that the roadwhich we are taking may be disagreeable to some but is agreeable to asmany others or if not to as many at any rate to persons not inferiorto the others and in company with them you bid me at whateverrisk to proceed along the path of legislation which has opened out ofour present discourse and to be of good cheer and not to faint 
 cle certainly 
 ath and i do not faint i say indeed that we have a great manypoets writing in hexameter trimeter and all sorts of are serious others who aim only at raising a allmankind declare that the youth who are rightly educated should bebrought up in them and saturated with them some insist that theyshould be constantly hearing them read aloud and always learningthem so as to get by heart entire poets while others select choicepassages and long speeches and make compendiums of them sayingthat these ought to be committed to memory if a man is to be madegood and wise by experience and learning of many things and youwant me now to tell them plainly in what they are right and in whatthey are wrong 
 cle yes i do ath but how can i in one word rightly comprehend all of them i amof opinion and if i am not mistaken there is a general every one of these poets has said many things well and manythings the reverse of well and if this be true then i do affirm thatmuch learning is dangerous to youth 
 cle how would you advise the guardian of the law to act 
 ath in what respect 
 cle i mean to what pattern should he look as his guide inpermitting the young to learn some things and forbidding them to learnothers do not shrink from answering 
 ath my good cleinias i rather think that i am fortunate 
 cle how so 
 ath i think that i am not wholly in want of a pattern for when iconsider the words which we have spoken from early dawn until now andwhich as i believe have been inspired by heaven they appear to meto be quite like a poem when i reflected upon all these words ofours i naturally felt pleasure for of all the discourses which ihave ever learnt or heard either in poetry or prose this seemed tome to be the justest and most suitable for young men to hear icannot imagine any better pattern than this which the guardian ofthe law who is also the director of education can have he cannot dobetter than advise the teachers to teach the young these words and anywhich are of a like nature if he should happen to find them eitherin poetry or prose or if he come across unwritten discourses akinto ours he should certainly preserve them and commit them towriting and first of all he shall constrain the teachers themselvesto learn and approve them and any of them who will not shall notbe employed by him but those whom he finds agreeing in hisjudgment he shall make use of and shall commit to them theinstruction and education of youth and here and on this wise let myfanciful tale about letters and teachers of letters come to an end 
 cle i do not think stranger that we have wandered out of theproposed limits of the argument but whether we are right or not inour whole conception i cannot be very certain 
 ath the truth cleinias may be expected to become clearer when aswe have often said we arrive at the end of the whole discussion aboutlaws 
 cle yes 
 ath and now that we have done with the teacher of letters theteacher of the lyre has to receive orders from us 
 cle certainly 
 ath i think that we have only to recollect our previousdiscussions and we shall be able to give suitable regulationstouching all this part of instruction and education to the teachers ofthe lyre 
 cle to what do you refer 
 ath we were saying if i remember rightly that choristers of dionysus were to be specially quick intheir perceptions of rhythm and musical composition that they mightbe able to distinguish good and bad imitation that is to say theimitation of the good or bad soul when under the influence of the one and displaying the other in hymns and the souls of youth and inviting them to follow and attainvirtue by the way of imitation 
 cle very true 
 ath and with this view the teacher and the learner ought to usethe sounds of the lyre because its notes are pure the player whoteaches and his pupil rendering note for note in unison butcomplexity and variation of notes when the strings give one soundand the poet or composer of the melody gives when theymake concords and harmonies in which lesser and greater and quick or high and low notes are again whenthey make complex variations of rhythms which they adapt to the notesof the that sort of thing is not suited to those who haveto acquire a speedy and useful knowledge of music in three opposite principles are confusing and create a difficulty inlearning and our young men should learn quickly and their merenecessary acquirements are not few or trifling as will be shown indue course let the director of education attend to the principlesconcerning music which we are laying down as to the songs and wordsthemselves which the masters of choruses are to teach and thecharacter of them they have been already described by us and are thesame which when consecrated and adapted to the different said were to benefit cities by affording them an innocentamusement 
 cle that again is true 
 ath then let him who has been elected a director of music receivethese rules from us as containing the very truth and may he prosperin his office let us now proceed to lay down other rules inaddition to the preceding about dancing and gymnastic exercise ingeneral having said what remained to be said about the teaching ofmusic let us speak in like manner about gymnastic for boys and girlsought to learn to dance and practise gymnastic theynot 
 cle yes 
 ath then the boys ought to have dancing masters and the girlsdancing mistresses to exercise them 
 cle very good 
 ath then once more let us summon him who has the chief concern inthe business the superintendent of youth the director ofeducation he will have plenty to do if he is to have the chargeof music and gymnastic 
 cle but how will old man be able to attend to such great charges 
 ath o my friend there will be no difficulty for the law hasalready given and will give him permission to select as his assistantsin this charge any citizens male or female whom he desires and hewill know whom he ought to choose and will be anxious not to make amistake from a due sense of responsibility and from aconsciousness of the importance of his office and also because hewill consider that if young men have been and are well brought all things go swimmingly but if not it is not meet to do we say what will follow lest the regarders of omens shouldtake alarm about our infant state many things have been said by usabout dancing and about gymnastic movements in general for we includeunder gymnastics all military exercises such as archery and allhurling of weapons and the use of the light shield and allfighting with heavy arms and military evolutions and movements ofarmies and encampings and all that relates to horsemanship of allthese things there ought to be public teachers receiving pay from thestate and their pupils should be the men and boys in the state andalso the girls and women who are to know all these things while theyare yet girls they should have practised dancing in arms and the wholeart of women they should apply themselves toevolutions and tactics and the mode of grounding and taking uparms if for no other reason yet in case the whole military forceshould have to leave the city and carry on operations of waroutside that those who will have to guard the young and the rest ofthe city may be equal to the task and on the other hand whenenemies whether barbarian or hellenic come from without withmighty force and make a violent assault upon them and thus compelthem to fight for the possession of the city which is far frombeing an impossibility great would be the disgrace to the state ifthe women had been so miserably trained that they could not fightfor their young as birds will against any creature however die or undergo any danger but must instantly rush to thetemples and crowd at the altars and shrines and bring upon humannature the reproach that of all animals man is the most cowardly 
 cle such a want of education stranger is certainly an unseemlything to happen in a state as well as a great misfortune 
 ath suppose that we carry our law to the extent of saying thatwomen ought not to neglect military matters but that all and female alike shall attend to them 
 cle i quite agree 
 ath of wrestling we have spoken in part but of what i shouldcall the most important part we have not spoken and cannot easilyspeak without showing at the same time by gesture as well as in wordwhat we mean when word and action combine and not till then weshall explain clearly what has been said pointing out that of allmovements wrestling is most akin to the military art and is to bepursued for the sake of this and not this for the sake of wrestling 
 cle excellent 
 ath enough of wrestling we will now proceed to speak of othermovements of the body such motion may be in general called is of two kinds one of nobler figures imitating thehonourable the other of the more ignoble figures imitating the of both these there are two further subdivisions of theserious one kind is of those engaged in war and vehement is the exercise of a noble person and a manly heart the otherexhibits a temperate soul in the enjoyment of prosperity and modestpleasures and may be truly called and is the dance of peace thewarrior dance is different from the peaceful one and may be rightlytermed pyrrhic this imitates the modes of avoiding blows and missilesby dropping or giving way or springing aside or rising up or fallingdown also the opposite postures which are those of action as forexample the imitation of archery and the hurling of javelins andof all sorts of blows and when the imitation is of brave bodies andsouls and the action is direct and muscular giving for the most parta straight movement to the limbs of the i say is thetrue sort but the opposite is not right in the dance of peace whatwe have to consider is whether a man bears himself naturally andgracefully and after the manner of men who duly conform to the before proceeding i must distinguish the dancing about which thereis any doubt from that about which there is no doubt which is thedoubtful kind and how are the two to be distinguished there aredances of the bacchic sort both those in which as they say theyimitate drunken men and which are named after the nymphs and silenuses and satyrs and also those in which purifications aremade or mysteries this sort of dancing cannot berightly defined as having either a peaceful or a warlike character orindeed as having any meaning whatever and may i think be mosttruly described as distinct from the warlike dance and distinctfrom the peaceful and not suited for a city at all there let it so leaving it to lie we will proceed to the dances of war andpeace for with these we are undoubtedly concerned now theunwarlike muse which honours in dance the gods and the sons of thegods is entirely associated with the consciousness of class may be subdivided into two lesser classes of which oneis expressive of an escape from some labour or danger into good andhas greater pleasures the other expressive of preservation andincrease of former good in which the pleasure is less these cases every man when the pleasure is greater moves hisbody more and less when the pleasure is less and again if he bemore orderly and has learned courage from discipline he waves if he be a coward and has no training or he makesgreater and more violent movements and in general when he is speakingor singing he is not altogether able to keep his body still and soout of the imitation of words in gestures the whole art of dancing hasarisen and in these various kinds of imitation one man moves in anorderly another in a disorderly manner and as the ancients may beobserved to have given many names which are according to nature anddeserving of praise so there is an excellent one which they havegiven to the dances of men who in their times of prosperity aremoderate in their giver of names whoever he to them a very true and poetical and rational name when hecalled them emmeleiai or dances of order thus establishing two kindsof dances of the nobler sort the dance of war which he called thepyrrhic and the dance of peace which he called emmeleia or the danceof order giving to each their appropriate and becoming name thesethings the legislator should indicate in general outline and theguardian of the law should enquire into them and search them dancing with music and assigning to the several sacrificialfeasts that which is suitable to them and when he has consecrated allof them in due order he shall for the future change of dance or song thenceforward the city and the citizensshall continue to have the same pleasures themselves being as faras possible alike and shall live well and happily 
 i have described the dances which are appropriate to noble bodiesand generous souls but it is necessary also to consider and knowuncomely persons and thoughts and those which are intended to producelaughter in comedy and have a comic character in respect of and dance and of the imitations which these afford for seriousthings cannot be understood without laughable things nor opposites atall without opposites if a man is really to have intelligence ofeither but he can not carry out both in action if he is to haveany degree of virtue and for this very reason he should learn themboth in order that he may not in ignorance do or say anything whichis ridiculous and out of should command slaves and hiredstrangers to imitate such things but he should never take any seriousinterest in them himself nor should any freeman or freewoman bediscovered taking pains to learn them and there should always be someelement of novelty in the imitation let these then be laid down bothin law and in our discourse as the regulations of laughableamusements which are generally called comedy and if any of theserious poets as they are termed who write tragedy come to us strangers may we go to your city and country or may we shall we bring with us our is your will about shall we answer the divine men i think that ouranswer should be as of strangers we will say to also according to our ability are tragic poets and our tragedyis the best and noblest for our whole state is an imitation of thebest and noblest life which we affirm to be indeed the very truthof tragedy you are poets and we are poets both makers of the samestrains rivals and antagonists in the noblest of dramas which truelaw can alone perfect as our hope is do not then suppose that weshall all in a moment allow you to erect your stage in the agora orintroduce the fair voices of your actors speaking above our permit you to harangue our women and children and the commonpeople about our institutions in language other than our own andvery often the opposite of our own for a state would be mad whichgave you this licence until the magistrates had determined whetheryour poetry might be recited and was fit for publication or o ye sons and scions of the softer muses first of all showyour songs to the magistrates and let them compare them with our if they are the same or better we will give you a chorus but ifnot then my friends we cannot let these then be the customsordained by law about all dances and the teaching of them and letmatters relating to slaves be separated from those relating tomasters if you do not object 
 cle we can have no hesitation in assenting when you put thematter thus 
 ath there still remain three studies suitable for is one of them the measurement of length surface anddepth is the second and the third has to do with the revolutions ofthe stars in relation to one another not every one has need to toilthrough all these things in a strictly scientific manner but only afew and who they are to be we will hereafter indicate at the will be the proper place not to know what is necessary formankind in general and what is the truth is disgraceful to everyone and yet to enter into these matters minutely is neither easy norat all possible for every one but there is something in them which isnecessary and cannot be set aside and probably he who made theproverb about god originally had this in view when he said even god himself can fight against meant if iam not mistaken divine necessity for as to the human necessitiesof which the many speak when they talk in this manner nothing can bemore ridiculous than such an application of the words 
 cle and what necessities of knowledge are there stranger whichare divine and not human 
 ath i conceive them to be those of which he who has no use norany knowledge at all cannot be a god or or hero to able to take any serious thought or charge of them and very unlikea divine man would he be who is unable to count one two three orto distinguish odd and even numbers or is unable to count at reckon night and day and who is totally unacquainted with therevolution of the sun and moon and the other stars there would begreat folly in supposing that all these are not necessary parts ofknowledge to him who intends to know anything about the highestkinds of knowledge but which these are and how many there are ofthem and when they are to be learned and what is to be learnedtogether and what apart and the whole correlation of them must berightly apprehended first and these leading the way we may proceed tothe other parts of knowledge for so necessity grounded in natureconstrains us against which we say that no god contends or ever willcontend 
 cle i think stranger that what you have now said is very true andagreeable to nature 
 ath yes cleinias that is so but it is difficult for thelegislator to begin with these studies at a more convenient time wewill make regulations for them 
 cle you seem stranger to be afraid of our habitual ignorance ofthe subject there is no reason why that should prevent you fromspeaking out 
 ath i certainly am afraid of the difficulties to which youallude but i am still more afraid of those who apply themselves tothis sort of knowledge and apply themselves badly for entireignorance is not so terrible or extreme an evil and is far from beingthe greatest of all too much cleverness and too much with an ill bringing up are far more fatal 
 cle true 
 ath all freemen i conceive should learn as much of these branchesof knowledge as every child in egypt is taught when he learns thealphabet in that country arithmetical games have been invented forthe use of mere children which they learn as a pleasure andamusement they have to distribute apples and garlands using the samenumber sometimes for a larger and sometimes for a lesser number ofpersons and they arrange pugilists and wrestlers as they pairtogether by lot or remain over and show how their turns come innatural order another mode of amusing them is to distributevessels sometimes of gold brass silver and the like intermixedwith one another sometimes of one metal only as i was saying theyadapt to their amusement the numbers in common use and in this waymake more intelligible to their pupils the arrangements andmovements of armies and expeditions in the management of ahousehold they make people more useful to themselves and more wideawake and again in measurements of things which have length andbreadth and depth they free us from that natural ignorance of allthese things which is so ludicrous and disgraceful 
 cle what kind of ignorance do you mean 
 ath o my dear cleinias i like yourself have late in life heardwith amazement of our ignorance in these matters to me we appear tobe more like pigs than men and i am quite ashamed not only ofmyself but of all hellenes 
 cle about what say stranger what you mean 
 ath i will or rather i will show you my meaning by a question anddo you please to answer me you know i suppose what length is 
 cle certainly 
 ath and what breadth is 
 cle to be sure 
 ath and you know that these are two distinct things and that thereis a third thing called depth 
 cle of course 
 ath and do not all these seem to you to be commensurable withthemselves 
 cle yes 
 ath that is to say length is naturally commensurable withlength and breadth with breadth and depth in like manner with depth 
 cle undoubtedly 
 ath but if some things are commensurable and others whollyincommensurable and you think that all things are commensurable whatis your position in regard to them 
 cle clearly far from good 
 ath concerning length and breadth when compared with depth orbreadth when and length when compared with one another are not allthe hellenes agreed that these are commensurable with one in some way 
 cle quite true 
 ath but if they are absolutely incommensurable and yet all of usregard them as commensurable have we not reason to be ashamed ofour compatriots and might we not say to ye best ofhellenes is not this one of the things of which we were saying thatnot to know them is disgraceful and of which to have a bare knowledgeonly is no great distinction 
 cle certainly 
 ath and there are other things akin to these in which there springup other errors of the same family 
 cle what are they 
 ath the natures of commensurable and incommensurable quantitiesin their relation to one another a man who is good for a thingought to be able when he thinks to distinguish them and differentpersons should compete with one another in asking questions whichwill be a fair better and more graceful way of passing their timethan the old game of draughts 
 cle i dare say and these pastimes are not so very unlike a game ofdraughts 
 ath and these as i maintain cleinias are the studies which ouryouth ought to learn for they are innocent and not difficult thelearning of them will be an amusement and they will benefit thestate if anyone is of another mind let him say what he has to say 
 cle certainly 
 ath then if these studies are such as we maintain we will includethem if not they shall be excluded 
 cle assuredly but may we not now stranger prescribe thesestudies as necessary and so fill up the lacunae of our laws 
 ath they shall be regarded as pledges which may be hereafterredeemed and removed from our state if they do not please either uswho give them or you who accept them 
 cle a fair condition 
 ath next let us see whether we are or are not willing that thestudy of astronomy shall be proposed for our youth 
 cle proceed 
 ath here occurs a strange phenomenon which certainly cannot in anypoint of view be tolerated 
 cle to what are you referring 
 ath men say that we ought not to enquire into the supreme god andthe nature of the universe nor busy ourselves in searching out thecauses of things and that such enquiries are impious whereas thevery opposite is the truth 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath perhaps what i am saying may seem paradoxical and atvariance with the usual language of age but when any one has any goodand true notion which is for the advantage of the state and in everyway acceptable to god he cannot abstain from expressing it 
 cle your words are reasonable enough but shall we find any good ortrue notion about the stars 
 ath my good friends at this hour all of us hellenes tell i may use such an expression about those great gods the sun andthe moon 
 cle lies of what nature 
 ath we say that they and divers other stars do not keep the samepath and we call them planets or wanderers 
 cle very true stranger and in the course of my life i haveoften myself seen the morning star and the evening star and diversothers not moving in their accustomed course but wandering out oftheir path in all manner of ways and i have seen the sun and moondoing what we all know that they do 
 ath just so megillus and cleinias and i maintain that ourcitizens and our youth ought to learn about the nature of the godsin heaven so far as to be able to offer sacrifices and pray to themin pious language and not to blaspheme about them 
 cle there you are right if such a knowledge be only attainable andif we are wrong in our mode of speaking now and can be betterinstructed and learn to use better language then i quite agree withyou that such a degree of knowledge as will enable us to speak rightlyshould be acquired by us and now do you try to explain to us yourwhole meaning and we on our part will endeavour to understand you 
 ath there is some difficulty in understanding my meaning but not avery great one nor will any great length of time be required andof this i am myself a proof for i did not know these things long in the days of my youth and yet i can explain them to you in abrief space of time whereas if they had been difficult i couldcertainly never have explained them all old as i am to old menlike yourselves 
 cle true but what is this study which you describe as wonderfuland fitting for youth to learn but of which we are ignorant tryand explain the nature of it to us as clearly as you can 
 ath i will for o my good friends that other doctrine about thewandering of the sun and the moon and the other stars is not thetruth but the very reverse of the truth each of them moves in thesame in many paths but in one only which is circular andthe varieties are only apparent nor are we right in supposing thatthe swiftest of them is the slowest nor conversely that theslowest is the quickest and if what i say is true only justimagine that we had a similar notion about horses running atolympia or about men who ran in the long course and that weaddressed the swiftest as the slowest and the slowest as the sang the praises of the vanquished as though he were that case our praises would not be true nor very agreeableto the runners though they be but men and now to commit the sameerror about the gods which would have been ludicrous and erroneousin the case of not that ludicrous and erroneous 
 cle worse than ludicrous i should say 
 ath at all events the gods cannot like us to be spreading afalse report of them 
 cle most true if such is the fact 
 ath and if we can show that such is really the fact then all thesematters ought to be learned so far as is necessary for the avoidanceof impiety but if we cannot they may be let alone and let this beour decision

 ath enough of laws relating to education and learning buthunting and similar pursuits in like manner claim our attention forthe legislator appears to have a duty imposed upon him which goesbeyond mere legislation there is something over and above law whichlies in a region between admonition and law and has several timesoccurred to us in the course of discussion for example in theeducation of very young children there were things as we are not to be defined and to regard them as matters of positivelaw is a great absurdity now our laws and the whole constitutionof our state having been thus delineated the praise of the virtuouscitizen is not complete when he is described as the person whoserves the laws best and obeys them most but the higher form ofpraise is that which describes him as the good citizen who passesthrough life undefiled and is obedient to the words of the when he is giving laws and when he assigns praise and blame thisis the truest word that can be spoken in praise of a citizen andthe true legislator ought not only to write his laws but also tointerweave with them all such things as seem to him honourable anddishonourable and the perfect citizen ought to seek to strengthenthese no less than the principles of law which are sanctioned bypunishments i will adduce an example which will clear up mymeaning and will be a sort of witness to my words hunting is of wideextent and has a name under which many things are included for thereis a hunting of creatures in the water and of creatures in the there is a great deal of hunting of land animals of all kinds andnot of wild beasts only the hunting after man is also worthy ofconsideration there is the hunting after him in war and there isoften a hunting after him in the way of friendship which is praisedand also blamed and there is thieving and the hunting which ispractised by robbers and that of armies against armies now thelegislator in laying down laws about hunting can neither abstainfrom noting these things nor can he make threatening ordinances whichwill assign rules and penalties about all of them what is he to will have to praise and blame hunting with a view to the exerciseand pursuits of youth and on the other hand the young man mustlisten obediently neither pleasure nor pain should hinder him and heshould regard as his standard of action the praises and injunctions ofthe legislator rather than the punishments which he imposes by being premised there will follow next in order moderate praiseand censure of hunting the praise being assigned to that kind whichwill make the souls of young men better and the censure to that whichhas the opposite effect 
 and now let us address young men in the form of a prayer for theirwelfare o friends we will say to them may no desire or love ofhunting in the sea or of angling or of catching the creatures inthe waters ever take possession of you either when you are awakeor when you are asleep by hook or with weels which latter is avery lazy contrivance and let not any desire of catching men and ofpiracy by sea enter into your souls and make you cruel and lawlesshunters and as to the desire of thieving in town or country may itnever enter into your most passing thoughts nor let the insidiousfancy of catching birds which is hardly worthy of freemen comeinto the head of any youth there remains therefore for our athletesonly the hunting and catching of land animals of which the one sortis called hunting by night in which the hunters sleep in turn and arelazy this is not to be commended any more than that which hasintervals of rest in which the will strength of beasts is subduedby nets and snares and not by the victory of a laborious only the best kind of hunting is allowed at ofquadrupeds which is carried on with horses and dogs and ownpersons and they get the victory over the animals by running themdown and striking them and hurling at them those who have a care ofgodlike manhood taking them with their own hands the praise and blamewhich is assigned to all these things has now been declared and letthe law be as no one hinder these who verily are sacredhunters from following the chase wherever and whither soever theywill but the hunter by night who trusts to his nets and not be allowed to hunt anywhere the fowler in the mountains andwaste places shall be permitted but on cultivated ground and onconsecrated wilds he shall not be permitted and any one who meets himmay stop him as to the hunter in waters he may hunt anywhereexcept in harbours or sacred streams or marshes or pools providedonly that he do not pollute the water with poisonous juices and nowwe may say that all our enactments about education are complete

 book viii 
 
 athenian stranger next with the help of the delphian oracle wehave to institute festivals and make laws about them and to determinewhat sacrifices will be for the good of the city and to what godsthey shall be offered but when they shall be offered and howoften may be partly regulated by us 
 cleinias the 
 ath then we will first determine the number and let the wholenumber be one for every that one magistrate at least willsacrifice daily to some god or on behalf of the city and thecitizens and their possessions and the interpreters and priestesses and prophets shall meet and in company with theguardians of the law ordain those things which the legislator ofnecessity omits and i may remark that they are the very persons whoought to take note of what is omitted the law will say that there aretwelve feasts dedicated to the twelve gods after whom the severaltribes are named and that to each of them they shall sacrificeevery month and appoint choruses and musical and gymnastic them so as to suit the gods and seasons of the year andthey shall have festivals for women distinguishing those whichought to be separated from the festivals and those whichought not further they shall not confuse the infernal deities andtheir rites with the gods who are termed heavenly and their rites butshall separate them giving to pluto his own in the twelfth is sacred to him according to the law to such a deitywarlike men should entertain no aversion but they should honour himas being always the best friend of man for the connection of soul andbody is no way better than the dissolution of them as i am ready tomaintain quite seriously moreover those who would regulate thesematters rightly should consider that our city among existing citieshas fellow either in respect of leisure or comin and of thenecessaries of life and that like an individual she ought to livehappily and those who would live happily should in the first place dono wrong to one another and ought not themselves to be wronged byothers to attain the first is not difficult but there is greatdifficulty in acquiring the power of not being wronged no man can beperfectly secure against wrong unless he has become perfectly cities are like individuals in this for a city if good has a lifeof peace but if evil a life of war within and without wherefore thecitizens ought to practise in time of war but rather whilethey are at peace and every city which has any sense should take thefield at least for one day in every month and for more if themagistrates think fit having no regard to winter cold or summer they should go out en masse including their wives and theirchildren when the magistrates determine to lead forth the wholepeople or in separate portions when summoned by them and they shouldalways provide that there should be games and sacrificial they should have tournaments imitating in as lively a manner asthey can real battles and they should distribute prizes of victoryand valour to the competitors passing censures and encomiums on oneanother according to the characters which they bear in the contestsand their whole life honouring him who seems to be the best andblaming him who is the opposite and let poets celebrate however every poet but only one who in the first place isnot less than fifty years of age nor should he be one who althoughhe may have musical and poetical gifts has never in his life done anynoble or illustrious action but those who are themselves good andalso honourable in the state creators of noble theirpoems be sung even though they be not very musical and let thejudgment of them rest with the instructor of youth and the otherguardians of the laws who shall give them this privilege and theyalone shall be free to sing but the rest of the world shall nothave this liberty nor shall any one dare to sing a song which has notbeen approved by the judgment of the guardians of the laws not evenif his strain be sweeter than the songs of thamyras and orpheus butonly and orpheus but only such poems as have been judged sacred anddedicated to the gods and such as are the works of good men whichpraise of blame has been awarded and which have been deemed tofulfil their design fairly 
 the regulations about and about liberty of speech in poitry oughtto apply equally to men and women the legislator may be supposed toargue the question in his own are my citizens for whom ihave set in order the city are they not competitors in the greatestof all contests and have they not innumerable rivals to be be the natural reply well but if we were training boxers orpancratiasts or any other sort of athletes would they never meetuntil the hour of contest arrived and should we do nothing to prepareourselves previously by daily practice surely if we were boxers weshould have been learning to fight for many days before andexercising ourselves in imitating all those blows and wards which wewere intending to use in the hour of conflict and in order that wemight come as near to reality as possible instead of cestuses weshould put on boxing gloves that the blows and the wards might bepractised by us to the utmost of our power and if there were a lackof competitors the ridicule of fools would ryot deter us from hangingup a lifeless image and practising at that or if we had noadversary at all animate or inanimate should we not venture in thedearth of antagonists to spar by ourselves in what other manner couldwe ever study the art of 
 cle the way which you mention stranger would be the only way 
 ath and shall the warriors of our city who are destined whenoccasion calli to enter the greatest of all contests and to fight fortheir lives and their children and their property and the wholecity be worse prepared than boxers and will the he is afraid that their practising with one another may appearto some ridiculous abstain from commanding them to go out andfight will he not ordain that soldiers shall perform lesser exerciseswithout arms every day making dancing and all gymnastic tend tothis end and also will he not require that they shall practise somegymnastic exercises greater as well as lesser as often as everymonth and that they shall have contests one with another in everypart of the country seizing upon posts and lying in ambush andimitating in every respect the reality of war fighting and hurling javelins and using weapons somewhatdangerous and as nearly as possible like the true ones in order thatthe sport may not be altogether without fear but may have terrors andto a certain degree show the man who has and who has not that the honour and dishonour which are assigned to themrespectively may prepare the whole city for the true conflict oflife if any one dies in these mimic contests the homicide isinvoluntary and we will make the slayer when he has been purifiedaccording to law to be pure of blood considering that if a few menshould die others as good as they will be born but that if fear isdead then the citizens will never find a test of superior and inferiornatures which is a far greater evil to the state than the loss of afew 
 cle we are quite agreed stranger that we should legislate aboutsuch things and that the whole state should practise them supposed 
 ath and what is the reason that dances and contests of this sorthardly ever exist in states at least not to any extent worth speakingof is this due to the ignorance of mankind and their legislators 
 cle perhaps 
 ath certainly not sweet cleinias there are two causes whichare quite enough to account for the deficiency 
 cle what are they 
 ath one cause is the love of wealth which wholly absorbs never for a moment allows them to think of anything but theirown private possessions on this the soul of every citizen hangssuspended and can attend to nothing but his daily gain mankind areready to learn any branch of knowledge and to follow any pursuitwhich tends to this end and they laugh at every is onereason why a city will not be in earnest about such contests or anyother good and honourable pursuit but from an insatiable love of goldand silver every man will stoop to any art or contrivance seemlyor unseemly in the hope of becoming rich and will make noobjection to performing any action holy or unholy and utterlybase if only like a beast he have the power of eating and drinkingall kinds of things and procuring for himself in every sort of waythe gratification of his lusts 
 cle true 
 ath let this then be deemed one of the causes which preventstates from pursuing in an efficient manner the art of war or anyother noble aim but makes the orderly and temperate part of mankindinto merchants and captains of ships and servants and convertsthe valiant sort into thieves and burglars and robbers of temples andviolent tyrannical persons many of whom are not without ability butthey are unfortunate 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath must not they be truly unfortunate whose souls are compelled topass through life always hungering 
 cle then that is one cause stranger but you spoke of another 
 ath thank you for reminding me 
 cle the insatiable life long love of wealth as you were sayingis one clause which absorbs mankind and prevents them from rightlypractising the arts of and now tell me what is theother 
 ath do you imagine that i delay because i am in a perplexity 
 cle no but we think that you are too severe upon temper of which you seem in the present discussion tohave a peculiar dislike 
 ath that is a very fair rebuke cleinias and i will now proceedto the second cause 
 cle proceed 
 ath i say that governments are a concerning which i have often spoken in the previousdiscourse or rather governments they are not for none of themexercises a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects but they may betruly called states of discord in which while the government isvoluntary the subjects always obey against their will and have to becoerced and the ruler fears the subject and will not if he canhelp allow him to become either noble or rich or strong orvaliant or warlike at all these two are the chief causes of almostall evils and of the evils of which i have been speaking they arenotably the causes but our state has escaped both of them for hercitizens have the greatest leisure and they are not subject to oneanother and will i think be made by these laws the reverse oflovers of money such a constitution may be reasonably supposed tobe the only one existing which will accept the education which we havedescribed and the martial pastimes which have been perfectedaccording to our idea 
 cle true 
 ath then next we must remember about all gymnastic only the warlike sort of them are to be practised and to haveprizes of victory and those which are not military are to be givenup the military sort had better be completely described andestablished by law and first let us speak of running and swiftness 
 cle very good 
 ath certainly the most military of all qualities is generalactivity of body whether of foot or hand for escaping or forcapturing an enemy quickness of foot is required but and combat need vigour and strength 
 cle very true 
 ath neither of them can attain their greatest efficiency withoutarms 
 cle how can they 
 ath then our herald in accordance with the prevailing first summon the will appear armed for to anunarmed competitor we will not give a prize and he shall enterfirst who is to run the single course bearing arms next he who is torun the double course third he who is to run the andfourthly he who is to run the long course the fifth whom we be the first sent forth in heavy armour and shall run acourse of sixty stadia to some temple of we will send forthanother whom we will style the more heavily armed to run oversmoother ground there remains the archer and he shall run in thefull equipments of an archer a distance of stadia overmountains and across every sort of country to a temple of apollo andartemis this shall be the order of the contest and we will waitfor them until they return and will give a prize to the conquerorin each 
 cle very good 
 ath let us suppose that there are three kinds of ofboys another of beardless youths and a third of men for theyouths we will fix the length of the contest at and forthe boys at half of the entire course whether they contend as archersor as heavy armed touching the women let the girls who are not grownup compete naked in the stadium and the double course and and the long course and let them run on itself those who are thirteen years of age and upwardsuntil their marriage shall continue to share in contests if they arenot more than twenty and shall be compelled to run up to they shall descend into the arena in suitable dresses let thesebe the regulations about contests in running both for men and women 
 respecting contests of strength instead of wrestling and similarcontests of the heavier sort we will institute conflicts in armour ofone against one and two against two and so on up to ten against to what a man ought not to suffer or do and to what extent inorder to gain the in wrestling the masters of the art havelaid down what is fair and what is not fair so in fighting ought to call in skilful persons who shall judge for us andbe our assessors in the work of legislation they shall say whodeserves to be victor in combats of this sort and what he is not todo or have done to him and in like manner what rule determines who isdefeated and let these ordinances apply to women until they marriedas well as to men the pancration shall have a counterpart in a combatof the light armed they shall contend with bows and with lightshields and with javelins and in the throwing of stones by slingsand by hand and laws shall be made about it and rewards and prizesgiven to him who best fulfils the ordinances of the law 
 next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse we do not need many horses for they cannot be of much use in acountry like crete and hence we naturally do not take great painsabout the rearing of them or about horse races there is no one whokeeps a chariot among us and any rivalry in such matters would bealtogether out of place there would be no sense nor any shadow ofsense in instituting contests which are not after the manner of ourcountry and therefore we give our prizes for single who have not yet cast their teeth and for those who areintermediate and for the horses themselves and thus ourequestrian games will accord with the nature of the country letthem have conflict and rivalry in these matters in accordance with thelaw and let the colonels and generals of horse decide togetherabout all courses and about the armed competitors in them but we havenothing to say to the unarmed either in gymnastic exercises or inthese contests on the other hand the cretan bowman or fights in armour on horseback is useful and therefore we may aswell place a competition of this sort among amusements women arenot to be forced to compete by laws and ordinances but if fromprevious training they have acquired the habit and are strong enoughand like to take part let them do so girls as well as boys and noblame to them 
 thus the competition in gymnastic and the mode of learning it havebeen described and we have spoken also of the toils of the of daily exercises under the superintendence of masters relates to music has been for the most part completed but asto rhapsodes and the like and the contests of choruses which are toperform at feasts all this shall be arranged when the months and daysand years have been appointed for gods and whether everythird year or again every fifth year or in whatever way or mannerthe gods may put into minds the distribution and order ofthem at the same time we may expect that the musical contests willbe celebrated in their turn by the command of the judges and thedirector of education and the guardians of the law meeting togetherfor this purpose and themselves becoming legislators of the times andnature and conditions of the choral contests and of dancing ingeneral what they ought severally to be in language and song andin the admixture of harmony with rhythm and the dance has beenoften declared by the original legislator and his successors ought tofollow him making the games and sacrifices duly to correspond atfitting times and appointing public festivals it is not difficult todetermine how these and the like matters may have a regular again will the alteration of them do any great good or harm tothe state there is however another matter of great importance anddifficulty concerning which god should legislate if there were anypossibility of obtaining from him an ordinance about it but seeingthat divine aid is not to be had there appears to be a need of somebold man who specially honours plainness of speech and will sayoutright what he thinks best for the city and is good and convenient for the whole state amid the corruptionsof human souls opposing the mightiest lusts and having no man hishelper but himself standing alone and following reason only 
 cle what is this stranger that you are saying for we do not asyet understand your meaning 
 ath very likely i will endeavour to explain myself more i came to the subject of education i beheld young men andmaidens holding friendly intercourse with one another and therenaturally arose in my mind a sort of could not helpthinking how one is to deal with a city in which youths and maidensare well nurtured and have nothing to do and are not undergoingthe excessive and servile toils which extinguish wantonness and whoseonly cares during their whole life are sacrifices and festivals anddances how in such a state as this will they abstain from desireswhich thrust many a man and woman into perdition and from whichreason assuming the functions of law commands them to abstain theordinances already made may possibly get the better of most of thesedesires the prohibition of excessive wealth is a very considerablegain in the direction of temperance and the whole education of ouryouth imposes a law of moderation on them moreover the eye of therulers is required always to watch over the young and never to losesight of them and these provisions do as far as human means caneffect anything exercise a regulating influence upon the desires ingeneral but how can we take precautions against the unnatural lovesof either sex from which innumerable evils have come upon individualsand cities how shall we devise a remedy and way of escape out of sogreat a danger truly cleinias here is a difficulty in many wayscrete and lacedaemon furnish a great help to those who make peculiarlaws but in the matter of love as we are alone i must confessthat they are quite against us for if any one following nature shouldlay down the law which existed before the days of laius anddenounce these lusts as contrary to nature adducing the animals asa proof that such unions were monstrous he might prove his point buthe would be wholly at variance with the custom of your they are repugnant to a principle which we say that alegislator should always observe for we are always enquiring which ofour enactments tends to virtue and which not and suppose we grantthat these loves are accounted by law to be honourable or at leastnot disgraceful in what degree will they contribute to virtue willsuch passions implant in the soul of him who is seduced the habit ofcourage or in the soul of the seducer the principle of will ever believe rather who will not blame theeffeminacy of him who yields to pleasures and is unable to hold outagainst them will not all men censure as womanly him who imitates thewoman and who would ever think of establishing such a practice bylaw certainly no one who had in his mind the image of true law howcan we prove that what i am saying is true he who would rightlyconsider these matters must see the nature of friendship and of these loves for they are of two kinds and out ofthe two arises a third kind having the same name and this similarityof name causes all the difficulty and obscurity 
 cle how is that 
 ath dear is the like in virtue to the like and the equal to theequal dear also though unlike is he who has abundance to him who isin want and when either of these friendships becomes excessive weterm the excess love 
 cle very true 
 ath the friendship which arises from contraries is horrible andcoarse and has often no tie of communion but that which arises fromlikeness is gentle and has a tie of communion which lasts throughlife as to the mixed sort which is made up of them both there of all a in determining what he who is possessed by thisthird love desires moreover he is drawn different ways and is indoubt between the two principles the one exhorting him to enjoy thebeauty of youth and the other forbidding him for the one is alover of the body and hungers after beauty like ripe fruit andwould fain satisfy himself without any regard to the character ofthe beloved the other holds the desire of the body to be asecondary matter and looking rather than loving and with his souldesiring the soul of the other in a becoming manner regards thesatisfaction of the bodily love as wantonness he reverences andrespects temperance and courage and magnanimity and wisdom and wishesto live chastely with the chaste object of his affection now the sortof love which is made up of the other two is that which we havedescribed as the third seeing then that there are these three sortsof love ought the law to prohibit and forbid them all to existamong us is it not rather clear that we should wish to have in thestate the love which is of virtue and which desires the belovedyouth to be the best possible and the other two if possible weshould hinder what do you say friend megillus 
 megillus i think stranger that you are perfectly right in whatyou have been now saying 
 ath i knew well my friend that i should obtain your assent whichi accept and therefore have no need to analyse your custom anyfurther cleinias shall be prevailed upon to give me his assent atsome other time enough of this and now let us proceed to the laws 
 meg very good 
 ath upon reflection i see a way of imposing the law which inone respect is easy but in another is of the utmost difficulty 
 meg what do you mean 
 ath we are all aware that most men in spite of their lawlessnatures are very strictly and precisely restrained from intercoursewith the fair and this is not at all against their will but entirelywith their will 
 meg when do you mean 
 ath when any one has a brother or sister who is fair and about ason or daughter the same unwritten law holds and is a most perfectsafeguard so that no open or secret connection ever takes placebetween them nor does the thought of such a thing ever enter at allinto the minds of most of them 
 meg very true 
 ath does not a little word extinguish all pleasures of that sort 
 meg what word 
 ath the declaration that they are unholy hated of god and mostinfamous and is not the reason of this that no one has ever saidthe opposite but every one from his earliest childhood has heardmen speaking in the same manner about them always and in comedy or in the graver language of tragedy when thepoet introduces on the stage a thyestes or an oedipus or a macareushaving secret intercourse with his sister he represents him whenfound out ready to kill himself as the penalty of his sin 
 meg you are very right in saying that tradition if no breath ofopposition ever assails it has a marvellous power 
 ath am i not also right in saying that the legislator who wantsto master any of the passions which master man may easily know howto subdue them he will consecrate the tradition of their evilcharacter among all slaves and freemen women and the will be the surest foundation of the lawwhich he can make 
 meg yes but will he ever succeed in making all mankind use thesame language about them 
 ath a good objection but was i not just now saying that i had away to make men use natural love and abstain from unnatural notintentionally destroying the seeds of human increase or sowing themin stony places in which they will take no root and that i wouldcommand them to abstain too from any female field of increase in whichthat which is sown is not likely to grow now if a law to thiseffect could only be made perpetual and gain an authority such asalready prevents intercourse of parents and a to other sensual desires and conquering them would bethe source of ten thousand blessings for in the first is the appointment of nature and deters men from allfrenzy and madness of love and from all adulteries and immoderate useof meats and drinks and makes them good friends to their own innumerable other benefits would result if such a could only beenforced i can imagine some lusty youth who is standing by andwho on hearing this enactment declares in scurrilous terms that weare making foolish and impossible laws and fills the world with hisoutcry and therefore i said that i knew a way of enacting andperpetuating such a law which was very easy in one respect but inanother most difficult there is no difficulty in seeing that such alaw is possible and in what way for as i was saying theordinance once consecrated would master the soul of every man andterrify him into obedience but matters have now come to such a passthat even then the desired result seems as if it could not beattained just as the continuance of an entire state in the practiceof common meals is also deemed impossible and although this latter ispartly disproven by the fact of their existence among you stilleven in your cities the common meals of women would be regarded asunnatural and impossible i was thinking of the rebelliousness ofthe human heart when i said that the permanent establishment ofthese things is very difficult 
 meg very true 
 ath shall i try and find some sort of persuasive argument whichwill prove to you that such enactments are possible and not beyondhuman nature 
 cle by all means 
 ath is a man more likely to abstain from the pleasures of loveand to do what he is bidden about them when his body is in a goodcondition or when he is in an ill condition and out of training 
 cle he will be far more temperate when he is in training 
 ath and have we not heard of iccus of tarentum who with a view tothe olympic and other contests in his zeal for his art ind alsobecause he was of a manly and temperate disposition never had anyconnection with a woman or a youth during the whole time of histraining and the same is said of crison and astylus and diopompus andmany others and yet cleinias they were far worse educated intheir minds than your and my citizens and in their bodies far morelusty 
 cle no doubt this fact has been often affirmed positively by theancients of these athletes 
 ath and had they courage to abstain from what is ordinarillydeemed a pleasure for the sake of a victory in wrestling running andthe like and shall our young men be incapable of a similarendurance for the sake of a much nobler victory which is thenoblest of all as from their youth upwards we will tell them as we hope into the belief of this by tales andsayings and songs 
 cle of what victory are you speaking 
 ath of the victory over pleasure which if they win they will livehappily or if they are conquered the reverse of happily may we not suppose that the fear of impiety will enablethem to master that which other inferior people have mastered 
 cle i dare say 
 ath and since we have reached this point in our legislation andhave fallen into a difficulty by reason of the vices of mankind iaffirm that our ordinance should simply run in the following citizens ought not to fall below the nature of birds and beasts ingeneral who are born in great multitudes and yet remain until theage for procreation virgin and unmarried but when they have reachedthe proper time of life are coupled male and female and lovinglypair together and live the rest of their lives in holiness andinnocence abiding firmly in their original we willsay to them you should be better than the animals but if they arecorrupted by the other hellenes and the common practice of they see with their eyes and hear with their ears of the love everywhere prevailing among them and they themselves arenot able to get the better of the temptation the guardians of thelaw exercising the functions of lawgivers shall devise a secondlaw against them 
 cle and what law would you advise them to pass if this one failed 
 ath clearly cleinias the one which would naturally follow 
 cle what is that 
 ath our citizens should not allow pleasures to strengthen withindulgence but should by toil divert the aliment and exuberance ofthem into other parts of the body and this will happen if noimmodesty be allowed in the practice of love then they will beashamed of frequent intercourse and they will find pleasure ifseldom enjoyed to be a less imperious mistress they should not befound out doing anything of the sort concealment shall be sanctioned by custom and made law by unwritten prescription onthe other hand to be detected shall be esteemed dishonourable butnot to abstain wholly in this way there will be a second legalstandard of honourable and dishonourable involving a second notion ofright three principles will comprehend all those corrupt natures whomwe call inferior to themselves and who form but one dass and willcompel them not to transgress 
 cle what are they 
 ath the principle of piety the love of honour and the desire ofbeauty not in the body but in the soul these are aspirations but they are the noblest of aspirations if theycould only be realized in all states and god willing in thematter of love we may be able to enforce one of two thatno one shall venture to touch any person of the freeborn or nobleclass except his wedded wife or sow the unconsecrated and bastardseed among harlots or in barren and unnatural lusts or at least wemay abolish altogether the connection of men with men and as towomen if any man has to do with any but those who come into his houseduly married by sacred rites whether they be bought or acquired inany other way and he offends publicly in the face of all shall be right in enacting that he be deprived of civic honours andprivileges and be deemed to be as he truly is a stranger letthis law then whether it is one or ought rather to be called laid down respecting love in general and the intercourse of thesexes which arises out of the desires whether rightly or wronglyindulged 
 meg i for my part stranger would gladly receive this shall speak for himself and tell you what is his opinion 
 cle i will megillus when an opportunity offers at present ithink that we had better allow the stranger to proceed with his laws 
 meg very good 
 ath we had got about as far as the establishment of the commontables which in most places would be difficult but in crete no onewould think of introducing any other custom there might arise aquestion about the manner of they shall be such as theyare here in crete or such as they are in is there athird kind which may be better than either of them the answer to thisquestion might be easily discovered but the discovery would do nogreat good for at present they are very well ordered 
 leaving the common tables we may therefore proceed to the meansof providing food now in cities the means of life are gained in manyways and from divers sources and in general from two sources whereasour city has only one for most of the hellenes obtain their food fromsea and land but our citizens from land only and this makes the taskof the legislator less as many laws will be enough andmuch less than half and they will be of a kind better suited tofree men for he has nothing to do with laws about shipowners andmerchants and retailers and innkeepers and tax collectors and minesand moneylending and compound interest and innumerable to these he gives laws to husbandmen andshepherds and and to the guardians and superintendents oftheir implements and he has already legislated for greater for example respecting marriage and the procreation and nurture ofchildren and for education and the establishment of he must direct his laws to those who provide food and labour inpreparing it 
 let us first of all then have a class of laws which shall becalled the laws of husbandmen and let the first of them be the law ofzeus the god of boundaries let no one shift the boundary line eitherof a who is a neighbour or if he dwells at theextremity of the land of any stranger who is conterminous with that this is truly to move the immovable and everyone should be more willing to move the largest rock which is not alandmark than the least stone which is the sworn mark of friendshipand hatred between neighbours for zeus the god of kindred is thewitness of the citizen and zeus the god of strangers of thestranger and when aroused terrible are the wars which they stirup he who obeys the law will never know the fatal consequences ofdisobedience but he who despises the law shall be liable to adouble penalty the first coming from the gods and the second fromthe law for let no one wilfully remove the boundaries of land and if any one does let him who will inform thelandowners and let them bring him into court and if he beconvicted of the land by stealth or by force let thecourt determine what he ought to suffer or pay in the next small injuries done by neighbours to one another through theirmultiplication may cause a weight of enmity and make neighbourhood avery disagreeable and bitter thing wherefore a man ought to be verycareful of committing any offence against his neighbour andespecially of encroaching on his land for any man mayeasily do harm but not every man can do good to another he whoencroaches on his land and transgresses his make good the damage and to cure him of his impudence and alsoof his meanness he shall pay a double penalty to the injured these and the like matters the wardens of the country shall takecognizance and be the judges of them and assessors of the the more important cases as has been already said the wholenumber of them belonging to any one of the twelve divisions shalldecide and in the lesser cases the commanders or again if anyone pastures his cattle on his land they shall see theinjury and adjudge the penalty and if any one by decoying the possession of swarms and draws them to himself bymaking noises he shall pay the damage or if anyone sets fire tohis own wood and takes no care of his property he shallbe fined at the discretion of the magistrates and if in planting hedoes not leave a fair distance between his own and his he shall be punished in accordance with the enactments ofmany law givers which we may use not deeming it necessary that thegreat legislator of our state should determine all the trifles whichmight be decided by any body for example husbandmen have had ofold excellent laws about waters and there is no reason why weshould propose to divert their course who likes may draw water fromthe of the common stream on to his own land if he donot cut off the spring which clearly belongs to some other he may take the water in any direction which he pleases exceptthrough a house or temple or sepulchre but he must be careful to dono harm beyond the channel and if there be in any place a naturaldryness of the earth which keeps in the rain from heaven andcauses a deficiency in the supply of water let him dig down on hisown land as far as the clay and if at this depth he finds no him obtain water from his neighbours as much as is requiredfor his servants drinking and if his neighbours too are limited intheir supply let him have a fixed measure which shall bedetermined by the wardens of the country this he shall receive eachday and on these terms have a share of his neighbours water ifthere be heavy rain and one of those on the lower ground injures sometiller of the upper ground or some one who has a common wall byrefusing to give the man outlet for water or again if some oneliving on the higher ground recklessly lets off the water on his lowerneighbour and they cannot come to terms with one another let him whowill call in a warden of the city if he be in the city or if he bein the country warden of the country and let him obtain a decisiondetermining what each of them is to do and he who will not abide bythe decision shall suffer for his malignant and morose temper and paya fine to the injured party equivalent to double the value of theinjury because he was unwilling to submit to the magistrates 
 now the participation of fruits shall be ordered on this wise thegoddess of autumn has two gracious gifts one the joy of dionysuswhich is not treasured up the other which nature intends to bestored let this be the law then concerning the fruits of autumn hewho tastes the common or storing fruits of autumn whether grapes orfigs before the season of vintage which coincides with on his own land or on that of him pay fiftydrachmae which shall be sacred to dionysus if he pluck them from hisown land and if from his land a mina and if from anyothers of a mina and he who would gather the or the choice figs as they are now termed if he take themoff his own land let him pluck them how and when he likes but ifhe take them from the ground of others without their leave let him inthat case be always punished in accordance with the law whichordains that he should not move what he has not laid down and if aslave touches any fruit of this sort without the consent of the ownerof the land he shall be beaten with as many blows as there are grapeson the bunch or figs on the let a metic purchase autumnal fruit and then if he pleases he may gather if a stranger is passing along the road and desires to eat lethim take of the choice grapes for himself and a single followerwithout payment as a tribute of hospitality the law howeverforbids strangers from sharing in the sort which is not used foreating and if any one whether he be master or slave takes of themin ignorance let the slave be beaten and the freeman dismissedwith admonitions and instructed to take of the other autumnalfruits which are unfit for making raisins and wine or for laying byas dried figs as to pears and apples and pomegranates andsimilar fruits there shall be no disgrace in taking them he who is caught if he be of less than thirty years of age shallbe struck and beaten off but not wounded and no freeman shall haveany right of satisfaction for such blows of these fruits the strangermay partake just as he may of the fruits of autumn and if anelder who is more than thirty years of age eat of them on thespot let him like the stranger be allowed to partake of all suchfruits but he must carry away nothing if however he will notobey the law let him run risk of failing in the competition ofvirtue in case any one takes notice of his actions before thejudges at the time 
 water is the greatest element of nutrition in gardens but is easilypolluted you cannot poison the soil or the soil or the sun orthe air which are other elements of nutrition in plants or divertthem or steal them but all these things may very likely happen inregard to water which must therefore be protected by law and letthis be the any one intentionally pollutes the water ofanother whether the water of a spring or collected in by poisonous substances or by digging or by theft let theinjured party bring the cause before the wardens of the city andclaim in writing the value of the loss if the accused be found guiltyof injuring the water by deleterious substances let him not onlypay damages but purify the stream or the cistern which contains thewater in such manner as the laws of the interpreters order thepurification to be made by the offender in each case 
 with respect to the gathering in of the fruits of the soil let aman if he pleases carry his own fruits through any place in which heeither does no harm to any one or himself gains three times as muchas his neighbour loses now of these things the magistrates shouldbe cognisant as of all other things in which a man intentionally doesinjury to another or to the property of another by fraud or force inthe use which he makes of his own property all these matters a manshould lay before the magistrates and receive damages supposingthe injury to be not more than three minae or if he have a chargeagainst another which involves a larger amount let him bring his suitinto the public courts and have the punished but if anyof the magistrates appear to adjudge the penalties which he imposes inan unjust spirit let him be liable to pay double to the injuredparty any one may bring the offences of magistrates in anyparticular case before the public courts there are innumerablelittle matters relating to the modes of punishment and applicationsfor suits and summonses and the witnesses to two witnesses should be required for a summons or all such details which cannot be omitted in legislation butare beneath the wisdom of an aged legislator these lesser matters asthey indeed are in comparison with the greater ones let a youngergeneration regulate by law after the patterns which have according to their own experience of the usefulness andnecessity of such laws and when they are duly regulated let therebe no alteration but let the citizens live in the observance of them 
 now of artisans let the regulations be as the firstplace let no citizen or servant of a citizen be occupied inhandicraft arts for he who is to secure and preserve the public orderof the state has an art which requires much study and many kinds ofknowledge and does not admit of being made a secondary hardly any human being is capable of pursuing two professions ortwo arts rightly or of practising one art himself and superintendingsome one else who is practising another let this then be ourfirst principle in the one who is a smith shall also be acarpenter and if he be a carpenter he shall not superintend art rather than his own under the pretext that insuperintending many servants who are working for him he is likelyto superintend them better because more revenue will accrue to himfrom them than from his own art but let every man in the state haveone art and get his living by that let the wardens of the citylabour to maintain this law and if any citizen incline to any otherart than the study of virtue let them punish him with disgrace andinfamy until they bring him back into his own right course and ifany stranger profess two arts let them chastise him with bonds andmoney penalties and expulsion from the state until they compel himto be one only and not many 
 but as touching payments for hire and contracts of work or in caseany one does wrong to any of the citizens or they do wrong to anyother up to fifty drachmae let the wardens of the city decide thecase but if greater amount be involved then let the public courtsdecide according to law let no one pay any duty either on theimportation or exportation of goods and as to frankincense andsimilar perfumes used in the service of the gods which come fromabroad and purple and other dyes which are not produced in thecountry or the materials of any art which have to be imported andwhich are not one should import them nor again shouldany one export anything which is wanted in the country of all thesethings let there be inspectors and superintendents taken from theguardians of the law and they shall be the twelve next in order tothe five seniors concerning arms and all implements which are formilitary purposes if there be need of introducing any art orplant or metal or chains of any kind or animals for use in war letthe commanders of the horse and the generals have authority over theirimportation and exportation the city shall send them out and alsoreceive them and the guardians of the law shall make fit and properlaws about them but let there be no retail trade for the sake either in these or any other articles in the city orcountry at all 
 with respect to food and the distribution of the produce of thecountry the right and proper way seems to be nearly that which is thecustom of crete for all should be required to distribute the fruitsof the soil into twelve parts and in this way consume them let thetwelfth portion of each as for instance of wheat and barley to whichthe rest of the fruits of the earth shall be added as well as theanimals which are for sale in each of the twelve divisions be dividedin due proportion into three parts one part for freemen anotherfor their servants and a third for craftsmen and in general forstrangers whether sojourners who may be dwelling in the city andlike other men must live or those who come on some business whichthey have with the state or with some individual let only this thirdpart of all necessaries be required to be sold out of the no one shall be compelled to sell and how will they bebest distributed in the first place we see clearly that thedistribution will be of equals in one point of view and in anotherpoint of view of unequals 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath i mean that the earth of necessity produces and nourishes thevarious articles of food sometimes better and sometimes worse 
 cle of course 
 ath such being the case let no one of the three portions begreater than either of the other that which is assigned tomasters or to slaves nor again that of the stranger but let thedistribution to all be equal and alike and let every citizen take histwo portions and distribute them among slaves and freemen he havingpower to determine the quantity and quality and what remains he shalldistribute by measure and numb among the animals who have to besustained from the earth taking the whole number of them 
 in the second place our citizens should have separate houses dulyordered and this will be the order proper for men like them thereshall be twelve hamlets one in the middle of each twelfth in each hamlet they shall first set apart a andthe temples of the gods and of their attendant demigods and if therebe any local deities of the magnetes or holy seats of other ancientdeities whose memory has been preserved to these let them paytheir ancient honours but hestia and zeus and athene will havetemples everywhere together with the god who presides in each of thetwelve districts and the first erection of houses shall be aroundthese temples where the ground is highest in order to provide thesafest and most defensible place of retreat for the guards all therest of the country they shall settle in the following make thirteen divisions of the craftsmen one of them they shallestablish in the city and this again they shall subdivide intotwelve lesser divisions among the twelve districts of the city andthe remainder shall be distributed in the country round about andin each village they shall settle various classes of craftsmen with aview to the convenience of the husbandmen and the chief officers ofthe wardens of the country shall superintend all these matters andsee how many of them and which class of them each place fix them where they are likely to be least troublesome and mostuseful to the husbandman and the wardens of the city shall see tosimilar matters in the city 
 now the wardens of the agora ought to see to the details of theagora their first care after the temples which are in the agora havebeen seen to should be to prevent any one from doing any indealings between man and man in the second place as beinginspectors of temperance and violence they should chastise him whorequires chastisement touching articles of gale they should firstsee whether the articles which the citizens are under regulations tosell to strangers are sold to them as the law ordains and let thelaw be as the first day of the month the persons incharge whoever they are whether strangers or slaves who have thecharge on behalf of the citizens shall produce to the strangers theportion which falls to them in the first place a twelfth portionof the stranger shall purchase corn for the whole month andother cereals on the first market day and on the tenth day of themonth the one party shall sell and the other buy liquidssufficient to last during the whole month and on the daythere shall be a sale of animals by those who are willing to sell tothe people who want to buy and of implements and other things whichhusbandmen sell such as skins and all kinds of clothing either wovenor made of felt and other goods of the same sort and which strangersare compelled to buy and purchase of others as to the retail trade inthese things whether of barley or wheat set apart for meal and any other kind of food no one shall sell them to citizens or theirslaves nor shall any one buy of a citizen but let the strangersell them in the market of strangers to artisans and their an exchange of wine and food which is commonly called retailtrade and butchers shall offer for sale parts of dismemberedanimals to the strangers and artisans and their servants let anystranger who likes buy fuel from day to day wholesale from thosewho have the care of it in the country and let him sell to thestrangers as much he pleases and when he pleases as to other goodsand implements which are likely to be wanted they shall sell themin common market at any place which the guardians of the law andthe wardens of the market and city choosing according to theirjudgment shall determine at such places they shall exchange moneyfor goods and goods for money neither party giving credit to theother and he who gives credit must be satisfied whether he obtainhis money not for in such exchanges he will not be protected bylaw but whenever property has been bought or sold greater inquantity or value than is allowed by the law which has determinedwithin what limited a man may increase and diminish his the excess be registered in the books of the guardians of the case of diminution let there be an erasure made and let thesame rule be observed about the registration of the property of themetics any one who likes may come and be a metic on certainconditions a foreigner if he likes and is able to settle may dwellin the land but he must practise an art and not abide more thantwenty years from the time at which he has registered himself andhe shall pay no tax however small except good any other tax for buying and selling but when the twenty yearshave expired he shall take his property with him and depart and ifin the course of these years he should chance to distinguish himselfby any considerable benefit which he confers on the state and hethinks that he can persuade the council and assembly either togrant him delay in leaving the country or to allow him to remainfor the whole of his life let him go and persuade the city andwhatever they assent to at his instance shall take effect for thechildren of the metics being artisans and of fifteen years of the time of their sojourn commence after their fifteenth year andlet them remain for twenty years and then go where they like but anyof them who wishes to remain may do so if he can persuade thecouncil and assembly and if he depart let him erase all theentries which have been made by him in the register kept by themagistrates

 book ix 
 
 next to all the matters which have preceded in the natural orderof legislation will come suits of law of suits those which relateto agriculture have been already described but the more importanthave not been described having mentioned them severally under theirusual names we will proceed to say what punishments are to beinflicted for each offence and who are to be the judges of them 
 cleinias very good 
 athenian stranger there is a sense of disgrace in legislating aswe are about to do for all the details of crime in a state we say is to be well regulated and will be perfectly adapted tothe practice of virtue to assume that in such a state there willarise some one who will be guilty of crimes as heinous as any whichare ever perpetrated in other states and that we must legislate forhim by anticipation and threaten and make laws against him if heshould arise in order to deter him and punish his acts under theidea that he will as i was saying is in a mannerdisgraceful yet seeing that we are not like the ancientlegislators who gave laws to heroes and sons of gods to the popular belief themselves the offspring of the legislating for others who were also the children of divineparents but that we are only men who are legislating for the sonsof men there is no uncharitableness in apprehending that some oneof our citizens may be like a seed which has touched the a heart so hard that it cannot be softened any more thanthose seeds can be softened by fire among our citizens there may bethose who cannot be subdued by all the strength of the laws and fortheir sake though an ungracious task i will proclaim my first lawabout the robbing of temples in case any one should dare to commitsuch a crime i do not expect or imagine that any will ever take the infection but their servants andstrangers and strangers servants may be guilty of many with a view to them especially and yet not without a providenteye to the weakness of human nature generally i will proclaim the lawabout robbers of temples and similar incurable or almost having already agreed that such enactments ought alwaysto have a short prelude we may speak to the criminal whom sometormenting desire by night and by day tempts to go and rob a fewest possible words of admonition and sir wewill say to him the impulse which moves you to rob temples is notan ordinary human malady nor yet a visitation of heaven but amadness which is begotten in a man from ancient and unexpiatedcrimes of his race an this you mustguard with all your might and how you are to guard we will explain toyou when any such thought comes into your mind go and performexpiations go as a suppliant to the temples of the gods who avertevils go to the society of those who are called good men among them tell and yourself try to repeat after them that every manshould honour the noble and the just fly from the company of and turn not back and if your disorder is lightened bythese remedies well and good but if not then acknowledge death tobe nobler than life and depart hence 
 such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts ofunholy and treasonable actions and to him who hearkens to them thelaw has nothing to say but to him who is disobedient when the preludeis over cry with a loud who is taken in the act ofrobbing temples if he be a slave or stranger shall have his evildeed engraven on his face and hands and shall be beaten with asmany stripes as may seem good to the judges and be cast nakedbeyond the borders of the land and if he suffers this punishment hewill probably return to his right mind and be improved for no penaltywhich the law inflicts is designed for evil but always makes himwho suffers either better or not so much worse as he would havebeen but if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionablewrong either in relation to the gods or his parents or the the judge deem him to be incurable remembering that afterreceiving such an excellent education and training from youthupward he has not abstained from the greatest of crimes hispunishment shall be death which to him will be the least of his example will benefit others if he perish ingloriously and becast beyond the borders of the land but let his children andfamily if they avoid the ways of their father have glory and lethonourable mention be made of them as having nobly and manfullyescaped out of evil into good none of them should have their goodsconfiscated to the state for the lots of the citizens ought always tocontinue the same and equal 
 touching the exaction of penalties when a man appears to havedone anything which deserves a fine he shall pay the fine if he haveanything in excess of the lot which is assigned to him but morethan that he shall not pay and to secure exactness let the guardiansof the law refer to the registers and inform the judges of theprecise truth in order that none of the lots may go uncultivatedfor want of money but if any one seems to deserve a greaterpenalty let him undergo a long and public imprisonment and bedishonoured unless some of his friends are willing to be surety forhim and liberate him by assisting him to pay the fine no criminalshall go unpunished not even for a single offence nor if he havefled the country but let the penalty be according to or bonds or blows or degrading places of sitting orstanding or removal to some temple on the borders of the land or lethim pay fines as we said before in cases of death let the judges bethe guardians of the law and a court selected by merit from thelast magistrates but how the causes are to be brought intoto court how the summonses are to be served the like these thingsmay be left to the younger generation of legislators to determine themanner of voting we must determine ourselves 
 let the vote be given openly but before they come to the vote letthe judges sit in order of seniority over against plaintiff anddefendant and let all the citizens who can spare time hear and take aserious interest in listening to such causes first of all theplaintiff shall make one speech and then the defendant shall makeanother and after the speeches have been made the eldest judgeshall begin to examine the parties and proceed to make an adequateenquiry into what has been said and after the oldest has rest shall proceed in order to examine either party as to whathe finds defective in the evidence whether of statement oromission and he who has nothing to ask shall hand over theexamination to another and on so much of what has been said as isto the purpose all the judges shall set their seals and place thewritings on the altar of hestia on the next day they shall meetagain and in like manner put their questions and go through thecause and again set their seals upon the evidence and when they havethree times done this and have had witnesses and evidence shall each of them give a holy vote after promising by hestiathat they will decide justly and truly to the utmost of their so they shall put an end to the suit 
 next after what relates to the gods follows what relates to thedissolution of the by promoting a man to power enslavesthe laws and subjects the city to factions using violence andstirring up sedition contrary to law him we will deem the greatestenemy of the whole state but he who takes no part in suchproceedings and being one of the chief magistrates of the state hasno knowledge of the treason or having knowledge of it by reasonof cowardice does not interfere on behalf of his country such anone we must consider nearly as bad every man who is worth anythingwill inform the magistrates and bring the conspirator to trial formaking a violent and illegal attempt to change the government thejudges of such cases shall be the same as of the robbers of let the whole proceeding be carried on in the same way and thevote of the majority condemn to death but let there be a generalrule that the disgrace and punishment of the father is not to bevisited on the children except in the case of some one whosefather grandfather and have successively undergonethe penalty of death such persons the city shall send away with alltheir possessions to the city and country of their only and wholly their appointed lot and out of the citizenswho have more than one son of not less than ten years of age theyshall select ten whom their father or grandfather by the side shall appoint and let them send to delphi the namesof those who are selected and him whom the god chooses they shallestablish as heir of the house which has failed and may he havebetter fortune than his predecessors 
 cle very good 
 ath once more let there be a third general law respecting thejudges who are to give judgment and the manner of conducting suitsagainst those who are tried on an accusation of treason and asconcerning the remaining or departure of their shallbe one law for all three for the traitor and the robber oftemples and the subverter by violence of the laws of the state for athief whether he steal much or little let there be one law andone punishment for all alike in the first place let him pay doublethe amount of the theft if he be convicted and if he have so muchover and above the he have not he shall be bounduntil he pay the penalty or persuade him has obtained the sentenceagainst him to forgive him but if a person be convicted of a theftagainst the state then if he can persuade the city or if he will payback twice the amount of the theft he shall be set free from hisbonds 
 cle what makes you say stranger that a theft is all the thief may have taken much or little and either fromsacred or secular these are not the only differences then that they are of many kinds ought not thelegislator to adapt himself to them and impose upon them entirelydifferent penalties 
 ath excellent i was running on too fast cleinias and youimpinged upon me and brought me to my senses reminding me of had occurred to mind already that legislation was never yetrightly worked out as i may say in you remember the imagein which i likened the men for whom laws are now made to slaves whoare doctored by slaves for of this you may be very sure that ifone of those empirical physicians who practise medicine withoutscience were to come upon the gentleman physician talking to hisgentleman patient and using the language almost of at the beginning of the disease and discoursing about thewhole nature of the body he would burst into a hearty say what most of those who are called doctors always have attheir fellow he would say you are nothealing the sick man but you are educating him and he does notwant to be made a doctor but to get well 
 cle and would he not be right 
 ath perhaps he would and he might remark upon us that he whodiscourses about laws as we are now doing is giving the citizenseducation and not laws that would be rather a telling observation 
 cle very true 
 ath but we are fortunate 
 cle in what way 
 ath inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws but we maytake into consideration every form of government and ascertain whatis best and what is most needful and how they may both be carriedinto execution and we may also if we please at this very momentchoose what is best or if we prefer what is most we do 
 cle there is something ridiculous stranger in our proposing suchan alternative as if we were legislators simply bound under somegreat necessity which cannot be deferred to the morrow but we as imay by grace of heaven affirm like gatherers of stones orbeginners of some composite work may gather a heap of out of this at our leisure select what is suitable for ourprojected construction let us then suppose ourselves to be atleisure not of necessity building but rather like men who are partlyproviding materials and partly putting them together and we maytruly say that some of our laws like stones are already fixed intheir places and others lie at hand 
 ath certainly in that case cleinias our view of law will be morein accordance with nature for there is another matter affectinglegislators which i must earnestly entreat you to consider 
 cle what is it 
 ath there are many writings to be found in cities and among themthere are composed by legislators as well as by other persons 
 cle to be sure 
 ath shall we give heed rather to the writings of those the like who either in metre or out of metre have recordedtheir advice about the conduct of life and not to the writings oflegislators or shall we give heed to them above all 
 cle yes to them far above all others 
 ath and ought the legislator alone among writers to withhold hisopinion about the beautiful the good and the just and not toteach what they are and how they are to be pursued by those whointend to be happy 
 cle certainly not 
 ath and is it disgraceful for homer and tyrtaeus and other poets tolay down evil precepts in their writings respecting life and thepursuits of men but not so disgraceful for lycurgus and solon andothers who were legislators as well as writers is it not true that ofall the writings to be found in cities those which relate to you unfold and read them ought to be by far the noblest andthe best and should not other writings either agree with them orif they disagree be deemed ridiculous we should consider whether thelaws of states ought not to have the character of loving and wiseparents rather than of tyrants and masters who command and after writing their decrees on walls go their ways and discoursing of laws we should not take the gentler view of themwhich may or may not be any rate we will show ourreadiness to entertain such a view and be prepared to undergowhatever may be the result and may the result be good and if godbe gracious it will be good 
 cle excellent let us do as you say 
 ath then we will now consider accurately as we proposed whatrelates to robbers of temples and all kinds of thefts and offencesin general and we must not be annoyed if in the course oflegislation we have enacted some things and have not made up ourminds about some others for as yet we are not legislators but we maysoon be let us if you please consider these matters 
 cle by all means 
 ath concerning all things honourable and just let us thenendeavour to ascertain how far we are consistent with ourselves andhow far we are inconsistent and how far the many from whom at anyrate we should profess a desire to differ agree and disagree amongthemselves 
 cle what are the inconsistencies which you observe in us 
 ath i will endeavour to explain if i am not mistaken we are allagreed that justice and just men and things and actions are allfair and if a person were to maintain that just men even whenthey are deformed in body are still perfectly beautiful in respect ofthe excellent justice of their minds no one would say that therewas any inconsistency in this 
 cle they would be quite right 
 ath perhaps but let us consider further that if all thingswhich are just are fair and honourable in the term all we mustinclude just sufferings which are the correlatives of just actions 
 cle and what is the inference 
 ath the inference is that a just action in partaking of the justpartakes also in the same degree of the fair and honourable 
 cle certainly 
 ath and must not a suffering which partakes of the just principlebe admitted to be in the same degree fair and honourable if theargument is consistently carried out 
 cle true 
 ath but then if we admit suffering to be just and yetdishonourable and the term dishonourable is applied to not the just and the honourable disagree 
 cle what do you mean 
 ath a thing not difficult to understand the laws which have beenalready enacted would seem to announce principles directly opposedto what we are saying 
 cle to what 
 ath we had enacted if i am not mistaken that the robber oftemples and he who was the enemy of law and order might justly beput to death and we were proceeding to make divers other enactmentsof a similar nature but we stopped short because we saw that thesesufferings are infinite in number and degree and that they are atonce the most just and also the most dishonourable of all if this be true are not the just and the honourable at one timeall the same and at another time in the most diametrical opposition 
 cle such appears to be the case 
 ath in this discordant and inconsistent fashion does the languageof the many rend asunder the honourable and just 
 cle very true stranger 
 ath then now cleinias let us see how far we ourselves areconsistent about these matters 
 cle consistent in what 
 ath i think that i have clearly stated in the former part of thediscussion but if i did not let me now state 
 cle what 
 ath that all bad men are always involuntarily bad and from thismust proceed to draw a further inference 
 cle what is it 
 ath that the unjust man may be bad but that he is bad againsthis will now that an action which is voluntary should be doneinvoluntarily is a contradiction wherefore he who maintains thatinjustice is involuntary will deem that the unjust does injusticeinvoluntarily i too admit that all men do injustice if any contentious or disputatious person says that men are unjustagainst their will and yet that many do injustice willingly i do notagree with him but then how can i avoid being inconsistent withmyself if you cleinias and you megillus say to all this be as you say how about legislating for the city of we legislate or do you advise certainly wewill i should reply then will you determine for them what arevoluntary and what are involuntary crimes and shall we make thepunishments greater of voluntary errors and crimes and less for theinvoluntary or shall we make the punishment of all to be alike underthe idea that there is no such thing as voluntary crime 
 cle very good stranger and what shall we say in answer to theseobjections 
 ath that is a very fair question in the first place let us 
 cle do what 
 ath let us remember what has been well said by us already that ourideas of justice are in the highest degree confused and this in mind let us proceed to ask ourselves once morewhether we have discovered a way out of the difficulty have we everdetermined in what respect these two classes of actions differ fromone another for in all states and by all legislators kinds of actions have been one voluntary theother involuntary and they have legislated about them shall this new word of ours like an oracle of god be onlyspoken and get away without giving any explanation or verification ofitself how can a word not understood be the basis of before proceeding to legislate then we must prove thatthey are two and what is the difference between them that when weimpose the penalty upon either every one may understand our be able in some way to judge whether the penalty is fitly orunfitly inflicted 
 cle i agree with you stranger for one of two things is we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary or wemust show the meaning and truth of this statement 
 ath of these two alternatives the one is quite speak what i believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful andunholy but if acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntaryand involuntary i must endeavour to find some other distinctionbetween them 
 cle very true stranger there cannot be two opinions among us uponthat point 
 ath reflect then there are hurts of various kinds done by thecitizens to one another in the intercourse of life affordingplentiful examples both of the voluntary and involuntary 
 cle certainly 
 ath i would not have any one suppose that all these hurts areinjuries and that these injuries are of two voluntary andthe other involuntary for the involuntary hurts of all men are quiteas many and as great as the voluntary and please to considerwhether i am right or quite wrong in what i am going to say for ideny cleinias and megillus that he who harms another involuntarilydoes him an injury involuntarily nor should i legislate about such anact under the idea that i am legislating for an involuntary i should rather say that such a hurt whether great or small isnot an injury at all and on the other hand if i am right when abenefit is wrongly conferred the author of the benefit may often besaid to injure for i maintain o my friends that the mere givingor taking away of anything is not to be described either as just orunjust but the legislator has to consider whether mankind do goodor harm to one another out of a just principle and intention on thedistinction between injustice and hurt he must fix his eye and whenthere is hurt he must as far as he can make the hurt good by save that which is ruined and raise up that which is make that which is dead or wounded whole and when compensationhas been given for injustice the law must always seek to win over thedoers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings of enmity tothose of friendship 
 cle very good 
 ath then as to unjust hurts and gains also supposing theinjustice to bring gain of these we may heal as many as arecapable of being healed regarding them as diseases of the soul andthe cure of injustice will take the following direction 
 cle what direction 
 ath when any one commits any injustice small or great the lawwill admonish and compel him either never at all to do the like never voluntarily or at any rate in a far less degree and he mustin addition pay for the hurt whether the end is to be attained byword or action with pleasure or pain by giving or taking awayprivileges by means of fines or gifts or in whatsoever way the lawshall proceed to make a man hate injustice and love or not hate thenature of the is quite the noblest work of law but if thelegislator sees any one who is incurable for him he will appoint alaw and a penalty he knows quite well that to such men themselvesthere is no profit in the continuance of their lives and that theywould do a double good to the rest of mankind if they would take theirdeparture inasmuch as they would be an example to other men not tooffend and they would relieve the city of bad citizens in suchcases and in such cases only the legislator ought to inflict deathas the punishment of offences 
 cle what you have said appears to me to be very reasonable butwill you favour me by stating a little more clearly the differencebetween hurt and injustice and the various complications of thevoluntary and involuntary which enter into them 
 ath i will endeavour to do as you the much would be generally said and allowed that one element in hernature is passion which may be described either as a state or apart of her and is hard to be striven against and contended with andby irrational force overturns many things 
 cle very true 
 ath and pleasure is not the same with passion but has anopposite power working her will by persuasion and by the force ofdeceit in all things 
 cle quite true 
 ath a man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause ofcrimes ignorance however may be conveniently divided by thelegislator into two sorts there is simple ignorance which is thesource of lighter offences and double ignorance which is accompaniedby a conceit of wisdom and he who is under the influence of thelatter fancies that he knows all about matters of which he knowsnothing this second kind of ignorance when possessed of power andstrength will be held by the legislator to be the source of great andmonstrous times but when attended with weakness will only resultin the errors of children and old men and these he will treat aserrors and will make laws accordingly for those who commit will be the mildest and most merciful of all laws 
 cle you are perfectly right 
 ath we all of us remark of one man that he is superior topleasure and passion and of another that he is inferior to this is true 
 cle certainly 
 ath but no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us is superiorand another inferior to ignorance 
 cle very true 
 ath we are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilmentof their will although an individual may be often drawn by them inopposite directions at the same time 
 cle yes often 
 ath and now i can define to you clearly and without i mean by the just and unjust according to my notion anger and fear and pleasure and pain and jealousies anddesires tyrannize over the soul whether they do any harm or all this injustice but when the opinion of the best in whateverpart of human nature states or individuals may suppose that todwell has dominion in the soul and orders the life of every man evenif it be sometimes mistaken yet what is done in accordance principle in individuals which obeys this rule and is best forthe whole life of man is to be called just although the hurt done bymistake is thought by many to be involuntary injustice leaving thequestion of names about which we are not going to quarrel and havingalready delineated three sources of error we may begin by recallingthem somewhat more vividly to our of them was of thepainful sort which we denominate anger and fear 
 cle quite right 
 ath there was a second consisting of pleasures and desires and athird of hopes which aimed at true opinion about the best the latterbeing subdivided into three we now get five sources of actions andfor these five we will make laws of two kinds 
 cle what are the two kinds 
 ath there is one kind of actions done by violence and in thelight of day and another kind of actions which are done in darknessand with secret deceit or sometimes both with violence and laws concerning these last ought to have a character of severity 
 cle naturally 
 ath and now let us return from this digression and complete thework of legislation laws have been already enacted by us concerningthe robbers of the gods and concerning traitors and alsoconcerning those who corrupt the laws for the purpose of subvertingthe government a man may very likely commit some of these in a state of madness or when affected by disease or under theinfluence of extreme old age or in a fit of childish no better than a child and if this be made evident to thejudges elected to try the cause on the appeal of the criminal orhis advocate and he be judged to have been in this state when hecommitted the offence he shall simply pay for the hurt which he mayhave done to another but he shall be exempt from other he have slain some one and have on his hands the stain ofblood and in that case he shall go to another land and country andthere dwell for a year and if he return before the expiration ofthe time which the law appoints or even set his foot at all on hisnative land he shall be bound by the guardians of the law in thepublic prison for two years and then go free 
 having begun to speak of homicide let us endeavour to lay down lawsconcerning every different kind of homicides and first of violent and involuntary homicides if any one in anathletic contest and at the public games involuntarily kills afriend and he dies either at the time or afterwards of the blowswhich he has received or if the like misfortune happens to any one inwar or military exercises or mimic contests of which themagistrates enjoin the practice whether with or without arms when hehas been purified according to the law brought from delphi relating tothese matters he shall be innocent and so in the case of their patient dies against their will they shall be held guiltlessby the law and if one slay another with his own hand butunintentionally whether he be unarmed or have some instrument or dartin his hand or if he kill him by administering food or drink or bythe application of fire or cold or by suffocating him whether hedo the deed by his own hand or by the agency of others he shall bedeemed the agent and shall suffer one of the he kill the slave of another in the belief that he ishis own he shall bear the master of the dead man harmless fromloss or shall pay a penalty of twice the value of the dead man whichthe judges shall assess but purifications must be used greater andmore numerous than for those who committed homicide at the are to be the interpreters whom the god appoints shall beauthorized to declare and if a man kills his own slave when he hasbeen purified according to laws he shall be quit of the if a man kills a freeman unintentionally he shall undergo thesame purification as he did who killed the slave but let him notforget also a tale of olden time which is to this whohas suffered a violent end when newly dead if he has had the soul ofa freeman in life is angry with the author of his death and beinghimself full of fear and panic by reason of his violent end when hesees his murderer walking about in his own accustomed haunts he isstricken with terror and becomes disordered and this disorder of by the guilty recollection of is communicated by him withoverwhelming force to the murderer and his deeds wherefore also themurderer must go out of the way of his victim for the entire period ofa year and not himself be found in any spot which was familiar to himthroughout the country and if the dead man be a stranger thehomicide shall be kept from the country of the stranger during alike period if any one voluntarily obeys this law the next of kin tothe deceased seeing all that has happened shall take pity on make peace with him and show him all gentleness but if any oneis disobedient either ventures to go to any of the temples andsacrifice unpurified or will not continue in exile during theappointed time the next of kin to the deceased shall proceedagainst him for murder and if he be convicted every part of hispunishment shall be doubled 
 and if the next of kin do not proceed against the perpetrator of thecrime then the pollution shall be deemed to fall upon his murdered man will fix the guilt upon his kinsman and he whohas a mind to proceed against him may compel him to be absent from hiscountry during five years according to law if a strangerunintentionally kill a stranger who is dwelling in the city he wholikes shall prosecute the cause according to the same rules if hebe a metic let him be absent for a year or if he be an entirestranger in addition to the purification whether he have slain astranger or a metic or a citizen he shall be banished for life fromthe country which is in possession of our laws and if he returncontrary to law let the guardians of the law punish him with let them hand over his property if he have any to him who isnext of kin to the sufferer and if he be wrecked and driven on thecoast against his will he shall take up his abode on the his feet in the sea and watching for an opportunity ofsailing but if he be brought by land and is not his own the magistrate whom he first comes across in the city release himand send him unharmed over the border 
 if any one slays a freeman with his own hand and the deed be done inpassion in the case of such actions we must begin by making adistinction for a deed is done from passion either when men without intention to kill cause the death of another by blows andthe like on a momentary impulse and are sorry for the deedimmediately afterwards or again when after having been insulted indeed or word men pursue revenge and kill a person intentionally andare not sorry for the act and therefore we must assume that thesehomicides are of two kinds both of them arising from passion whichmay be justly said to be in a mean between the voluntary andinvoluntary at the same time they are neither of them anythingmore than a likeness or shadow of either he who treasures up hisanger and avenges himself not immediately and at the moment butwith insidious design and after an interval is like the he who does not treasure up his anger and takes vengeance onthe instant and without malice prepense approaches to theinvoluntary and yet even he is not altogether involuntary but onlythe image or shadow of the involuntary wherefore about homicidescommitted in hot blood there is a difficulty in determining whetherin legislating we shall reckon them as voluntary or as partlyinvoluntary the best and truest view is to regard them respectivelyas likenesses only of the voluntary and involuntary and todistinguish them accordingly as they are done with or withoutpremeditation and we should make the penalties heavier for thosewho commit homicide with angry premeditation and lighter for thosewho do not premeditate but smite upon the instant for that whichis like a greater evil should be punished more severely and thatwhich is like a less evil should be punished less severely this shallbe the rule of our laws 
 cle certainly 
 ath let us any one slays a free man with his ownhand and the deed be done in a moment of anger and withoutpremeditation let the offender suffer in other respects as theinvoluntary homicide would have suffered and also undergo an exile oftwo years that he may learn to school his passions but he whoslays another from passion yet with premeditation shall in otherrespects suffer as the former and to this shall be added an exileof three instead of two punishment is to be longer becausehis passion is greater the manner of their return shall be on thiswise and here the law has difficulty in determining exactly forin some cases the murderer who is judged by the law to be the worsemay really be the less cruel and he who is judged the less cruelmay be really the worse and may have executed the murder in a moresavage manner whereas the other may have been gentler but in generalthe degrees of guilt will be such as we have described them of allthese things the guardians of the law must take ahomicide of either kind has completed his term of exile the guardiansshall send twelve judges to the borders of the land these duringthe interval shall have informed themselves of the actions of thecriminals and they shall judge respecting their pardon and the homicides shall abide by their judgment but if after theyhave returned home any one of them in a moment of anger repeats thedeed let him be an exile and return no more or if he returns lethim suffer as the stranger was to suffer in a similar case he whokills his own slave shall undergo a purification but if he killsthe slave of another in anger he shall pay twice the amount of theloss to his owner and if any homicide is disobedient to the without purification pollutes the agora or the games or thetemples he who pleases may bring to trial the next of kin to the deadman for permitting him and the murderer with him and may compelthe one to exact and the other to suffer a double amount of finesand purifications and the accuser shall himself receive the fine inaccordance with the law if a slave in a fit of passion kills hismaster the kindred of the deceased man may do with the only they do not spare his life whatever they please andthey will be pure or if he kills a freeman who is not his owner shall give up the slave to the relatives of the they shall be under an obligation to put him to death but thismay be done in any manner which they please 
 and if which is a rare occurrence but does sometimes happen afather or a mother in a moment of passion slays a son or daughter byblows or some other violence the slayer shall undergo the samepurification as in other cases and be exiled during three when the exile returns the wife shall separate from the the husband from the wife and they shall never afterwards begetchildren together or live under the same roof or partake of the samesacred rites with those whom they have deprived of a child or of abrother and he who is impious and disobedient in such a case shall bebrought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases if in a fit ofanger a husband kills his wedded wife or the wife her husband theslayer shall undergo the same purification and the term of exileshall be three years and when he who has committed any such crimereturns let him have no communication in sacred rites with hischildren neither let him sit at the same table with them and thefather or son who disobeys shall be liable to be brought to trialfor impiety by any one who pleases if a brother or a sister in afit of passion kills a brother or a sister they shall undergopurification and exile as was the case with parents who killedtheir offspring they shall not come under the same roof or sharein the sacred rites of those whom they have deprived of theirbrethren or of their children 
 and he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to the lawconcerning impiety which relates to these matters if any one is soviolent in his passion against his parents that in the madness of hisanger he dares to kill one of them if the murdered person beforedying freely forgives the murderer let him undergo the purificationwhich is assigned to those who have been guilty of involuntaryhomicide and do as they do and he shall be pure but if he be notacquitted the perpetrator of such a deed shall be amenable to shall be amenable to the extreme punishments for assault andimpiety and robbing of temples for he has robbed his parent of if a man could be slain more than once most justly would he whoin a fit of passion has slain father or mother undergo many can he whom alone of all men even in defence of his life andwhen about to suffer death at the hands of his parents no law willallow to kill his father or his mother who are the authors of hisbeing and whom the legislator will command to endure any extremityrather than do can he i say lawfully receive any otherpunishment let death then be the appointed punishment of him who in afit of passion slays his father or his mother but if brother killsbrother in a civil broil or under other like circumstances if theother has begun and he only defends himself let him be free fromguilt as he would be if he had slain an enemy and the same rule willapply if a citizen kill a citizen or a stranger a stranger or if astranger kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger in lethim be free from guilt in like manner and so in the case of a slavewho has killed a slave but if a slave have killed a freeman let him be subject to the same law as he who haskilled a father and let the law about the remission of penalties inthe case of parricide apply equally to every other remission wheneverany sufferer of his own accord remits the guilt of homicide toanother under the idea that his act was involuntary let theperpetrator of the deed undergo a purification and remain in exile fora year according to law 
 enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary andcommitted in passion we have now to speak of voluntary crimes donewith injustice of every kind and with premeditation through theinfluence of pleasures and desires and jealousies 
 cle very good 
 ath let us first speak as far as we are able of their variouskinds the greatest cause of them is lust which gets the mastery ofthe soul maddened by desire and this is most commonly found toexist where the passion reigns which is strongest and most prevalentamong mass of mankind i mean where the power of wealth breeds endlessdesires of acquisition originating in naturaldisposition and a miserable want of education of this want ofeducation the false praise of wealth which is bruited about bothamong hellenes and barbarians is the cause they deem that to be thefirst of goods which in reality is only the third and in this waythey wrong both posterity and themselves for nothing can be noblerand better than that the truth about wealth should be spoken in that riches are for the sake of the body as the bodyis for the sake of the soul they are good and wealth is intendedby nature to be for the sake of them and is therefore inferior tothem both and third in order of excellence this argument teachesus that he who would be happy ought not to seek to be rich orrather he should seek to be rich justly and temperately and thenthere would be no murders in states requiring to be purged away byother murders but now as i said at first avarice is the chiefestcause and source of the worst trials for voluntary homicide asecond cause is ambition this creates jealousies which aretroublesome companions above all to the jealous man himself and in aless degree to the chiefs of the state and a third cause iscowardly and unjust fear which has been the occasion of many a man is doing or has done something which he desires that no oneshould know him to be doing or to have done he will take the lifeof those who are likely to inform of such things if he have noother means of getting rid of them let this be said as a preludeconcerning crimes of violence in general and i must not omit tomention a tradition which is firmly believed by many and has beenreceived by them from those who are learned in the mysteries they saythat such deeds will be punished in the world below and also thatwhen the perpetrators return to this world they will pay the naturalpenalty which is due to the sufferer and end their lives in likemanner by the hand of another if he who is about to commit murderbelieves this and is made by the mere prelude to dread such apenalty there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the if he will not listen let the following law be declared andregistered against him 
 whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own hand any ofhis kinsmen shall in the first place be deprived of legal he shall not pollute the temples or the agora or the any other place of meeting whether he is forbidden of men ornot for the law which represents the whole state forbids him andalways is and will be in the attitude of forbidding him and if acousin or nearer relative of the deceased whether on the male orfemale side does not prosecute the homicide when he ought and havehim proclaimed an outlaw he shall in the first place be involved inthe pollution and incur the hatred of the gods even as the curseof the law stirs up the voices of men against him and in the secondplace he shall be liable to be prosecuted by any one who is willing toinflict retribution on behalf of the dead and he who would avenge amurder shall observe all the precautionary ceremonies of lavation andany others which the god commands in cases of this kind let himhave proclamation made and then go forth and compel the perpetratorto suffer the execution of justice according to the law now thelegislator may easily show that these things must be accomplished byprayers and sacrifices to certain gods who are concerned with theprevention of murders in states but who these gods are and whatshould be the true manner of instituting such trials with due regardto religion the guardians of the law aided by the the prophets and the god shall determine and when they havedetermined let them carry on the prosecution at law the cause shallhave the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case ofthose who plunder temples let him who is convicted be punished withdeath and let him not be buried in the country of the murdered this would be shameless as well as impious but if he fly and willnot stand his trial let him fly for ever or if he set foot anywhereon any part of the murdered country let any relation of thedeceased or any other citizen who may first happen to meet withhim kill him with impunity or bind and deliver him to those amongthe judges of the case who are magistrates that they may put him todeath and let the prosecutor demand surety of him whom he sureties sufficient in the opinion of the magistrates who trythe cause shall be provided by him and they shall undertake toproduce him at the trial but if he be unwilling or unable toprovide sureties then the magistrates shall take him and keep himin bonds and produce him at the day of trial 
 if a man do not commit a murder with his own hand but contrives thedeath of another and is the author of the deed in intention anddesign and he continues to dwell in the city having his soul notpure of the guilt of murder let him be tried in the same in what relates to the sureties and also if he be foundguilty his body after execution may have burial in his native in all other respects his case shall be as the former and whethera stranger shall kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger or a slave aslave there shall be no difference as touching murder by ownhand or by contrivance except in the matter of sureties and has been said shall be required of the actual murderer only andhe who brings the accusation shall bind them over at the time if aslave be convicted of slaying a freeman voluntarily either by his ownhand or by contrivance let the public executioner take him in thedirection of the sepulchre to a place whence he can see the tomb ofthe dead man and inflict upon him as many stripes as the person whocaught him orders and if he survive let him put him to death and ifany one kills a slave who has done no wrong because he is afraid thathe may inform of some base and evil deeds of his own or for anysimilar reason in such a case let him pay the penalty of murder ashe would have done if he had slain a citizen there are things aboutwhich it is terrible and unpleasant to legislate but impossible notto legislate if for example there should be murders of perpetrated by the hands of kinsmen or by their and purely malicious which most often happen and states and may perhaps occur even in acountry where a man would not expect to find them we must repeat oncemore the tale which we narrated a little while ago in the hope thathe who hears us will be the more disposed to abstain voluntarily onthese grounds from murders which are utterly abominable for the saying or whatever we ought to call it has been plainly set forthby priests of old they have pronounced that the justice whichguards and avenges the blood of kindred follows the law ofretaliation and ordains that he who has done any murderous act shouldof necessity suffer that which he has done he who has slain afather shall himself be slain at some time or other by his mother he shall of necessity take a nature and lose hislife at the hands of his offspring in after ages for where theblood of a family has been polluted there is no other can the pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul which thedeed has given life for life and has propitiated and laid to sleepthe wrath of the whole family these are the retributions of by such punishments men should be deterred but if they are notdeterred and any one should be incited by some fatality to deprivehis father or mother or brethren or children of life voluntarilyand of purpose for him the earthly lawgiver legislates shall be the same proclamations about outlawry andthere shall be the same sureties which have been enacted in the formercases but in his case if he be convicted the servants of the judgesand the magistrates shall slay him at an appointed place without thecity where three ways meet and there expose his body naked andeach of the magistrates on behalf of the whole city shall take a stoneand cast it upon the head of the dead man and so deliver the cityfrom pollution after that they shall bear him to the borders ofthe land and cast him forth unburied according to law and whatshall he suffer who slays him who of all men as they say is hisown best friend i mean the suicide who deprives himself byviolence of his appointed share of life not because the law of thestate requires him nor yet under the compulsion of some painful andinevitable misfortune which has come upon him nor because he hashad to suffer from irremediable and intolerable shame but who fromsloth or want of manliness imposes upon himself an unjust penalty forhim what ceremonies there are to be of purification and burial godknows and about these the next of kin should enquire of theinterpreters and of the laws thereto relating and do according totheir injunctions they who meet their death in this way shall beburied alone and none shall be laid by their side they shall beburied ingloriously in the borders of the twelve portions the land insuch places as are uncultivated and nameless and no column orinscription shall mark the place of their interment and if a beast ofburden or other animal cause the death of any one except in thecase of anything of that kind happening to a competitor in thepublic contests the kinsmen of the deceased shall prosecute theslayer for murder and the wardens of the country such and so manyas the kinsmen appoint shall try the cause and let the beast whencondemned be slain by them and let them cast it beyond the if any lifeless thing deprive a man of life except in the case ofa thunderbolt or other fatal dart sent from the a manis killed by lifeless objects falling upon him or by his fallingupon them the nearest of kin shall appoint the nearest neighbour tobe a judge and thereby acquit himself and the whole family ofguilt and he shall cast forth the guilty thing beyond the has been said about the animals 
 if a man is found dead and his murderer be unknown and after adiligent search cannot be detected there shall be the sameproclamation as in the previous cases and the same interdict on themurderer and having proceeded against him they shall proclaim in theagora by a herald that he who has slain such and such a person andhas been convicted of murder shall not set his foot in the at all in the country of the murdered man and if he appears andis discovered he shall die and be cast forth unburied beyond theborder let this one law then be laid down by us about murder and letcases of this sort be so regarded 
 and now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances themurderer is rightly free from a man catch a thief his house by night to steal and he take and kill him or if heslay a footpad in he shall be guiltless and any one whodoes violence to a free woman or a youth shall be slain with impunityby the injured person or by his or her father or brothers or sons ifa man find his wife suffering violence he may kill the be guiltless in the eye of the law or if a person kill another inwarding off death from his father or mother or children or brethren orwife who are doing no wrong he shall assuredly be guiltless 
 thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul of which he can and without which if he unfortunately bewithout them he cannot live and also concerning are to be inflicted for violent deaths let thusmuch be enacted of the nurture and education of the body we havespoken before and next in order we have to speak of deeds ofviolence voluntary and involuntary which men do to one we will now distinguish as far as we are able according totheir nature and number and determine what will be the suitablepenalties of each and so assign to them their proper place in theseries of our enactments the poorest legislator will have nodifficulty in determining that wounds and mutilations arising out ofwounds should follow next in order after deaths let wounds be dividedas homicides were those which are involuntary andwhich are given in passion or from fear and those inflictedvoluntarily and with premeditation concerning all this we mustmake some such proclamation as the must havelaws and conform to them or their life would be as bad as that ofthe most savage beast and the reason of this is that no is able to know what is best for human society or able and willing to do what is best in the first is a difficulty in apprehending that the true art or politics isconcerned not with private but with public good for public goodbinds together states but private only distracts them and that boththe public and private good as well of individuals as of states isgreater when the state and not the individual is first the second place although a person knows in the abstract that thisis true yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible will never remain firm in his principles or persist in regardingthe public good as primary in the state and the private good assecondary human nature will be always drawing him into avarice andselfishness avoiding pain and pursuing pleasure without any will bring these to the front obscuring the juster and so working darkness in his soul will at last fill with evilsboth him and the whole city for if a man were born so divinely giftedthat he could naturally apprehend the truth he would have no needof laws to rule over him for there is no law or order which isabove knowledge nor can mind without impiety be deemed thesubject or slave of any man but rather the lord of all i speak ofmind true and free and in harmony with nature but then there isno such mind anywhere or at least not much and therefore we mustchoose law and order which are second best these look at things asthey exist for the most part only and are unable to survey thewhole of them and therefore i have spoken as i have 
 and now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or suffer whohas hurt or wounded another any one may easily imagine thequestions which have to be asked in all such did he whom or how or when for there are innumerable particulars ofthis sort which greatly vary from one another and to allow courtsof law to determine all these things or not to determine any of alike impossible there is one particular which they must determinein all question of fact and then again that thelegislator should not permit them to determine what punishment is tobe inflicted in any of these cases but should himself decide them small or great is next to impossible 
 cle then what is to be the inference 
 ath the inference is that some things should be left to courtsof law others the legislator must decide for himself 
 cle and what ought the legislator to decide and what ought he toleave to courts of law 
 ath i may reply that in a state in which the courts are bad andmute because the judges conceal their opinions and decide causesclandestinely or what is worse when they are disorderly and in a theatre clapping or hooting in turn this or that saythat then there is a very serious evil which affects the whole is the necessity of having to legislate for such where the necessity exists the legislator should only allowthem to ordain the penalties for the smallest offences if the statefor which he is legislating be of this character he must take mostmatters into his own hands and speak distinctly but when a statehas good courts and the judges are well trained and scrupulouslytested the determination of the penalties or punishments whichshall be inflicted on the guilty may fairly and with advantage be leftto them and we are not to be blamed for not legislating concerningall that large class of matters which judges far worse educated thanours would be able to determine assigning to each offence what is dueboth to the perpetrator and to the sufferer we believe those for whomwe are legislating to be best able to judge and therefore to them thegreater part may be left at the same time as i have often said weshould exhibit to the judges as we have done the outline and form ofthe punishments to be inflicted and then they will not transgress thejust rule that was an excellent practice which we observed which now that we are resuming the work of legislation may withadvantage be repeated by us 
 let the enactment about wounding be in the following has a purpose and intention to slay another who is not hisenemy and whom the law does not permit him to slay and he woundshim but is unable to kill him he who had the intent and haswounded him is not to be deserves no consideration butshould be regarded as a murderer and be tried for murder still havingrespect to the fortune which has in a manner favoured him and tothe providence which in pity to him and to the wounded man saved theone from a fatal blow and the other from an accursed fate a to this deity and in order not to opposehis such a case the law will remit the punishment of only compel the offender to emigrate to a neighbouring city forthe rest of his life where he shall remain in the enjoyment of allhis possessions but if he have injured the wounded man he shall makesuch compensation for the injury as the court deciding the cause shallassess and the same judges shall decide who would have decided if theman had died of his wounds and if a child intentionally wound hisparents or a servant his master death shall be the penalty and if abrother ora sister intentionally wound a brother or a sister and isfound guilty death shall be the penalty and if a husband wound awife or a wife a husband with intent to kill let him or her undergoperpetual exile if they have sons or daughters who are still guardians shall take care of their property and have charge ofthe children as orphans if their sons are grown up they shall beunder no obligation to support the exiled parent but they shallpossess the property themselves and if he who meets with such amisfortune has no children the kindred of the exiled man to thedegree of sons of cousins both on the male and female side shallmeet together and after taking counsel with the guardians of theand the priests shall appoint a th citizen to be the heir ofthe house considering and reasoning that no house of all the belongs to the inhabitant or to the whole family but is the publicand private property of the state now the state should seek to haveits houses as holy and happy as possible and if any one of the housesbe unfortunate and stained with impiety and the owner leave noposterity but dies unmarried or married and childless havingsuffered death as the penalty of murder or some other crimecommitted against the gods or against his of whichdeath is the penalty distinctly laid down in the law or if any of thecitizens be in perpetual exile and also childless that house shallfirst of all be purified and undergo expiation according to law andthen let the kinsmen of the house as we were just now saying and theguardians of the law meet and consider what family there is in thestate which is of the highest repute for virtue and also for goodfortune in which there are a number of sons from that family letthem take one and introduce him to the father and forefathers of thedead man as their son and for the sake of the omen let him becalled so that he may be the continuer of their family the keeper oftheir hearth and the minister of their sacred rites with betterfortune than his father had and when they have made thissupplication they shall make him heir according to law and theoffending person they shall leave nameless and childless andportionless when calamities such as these overtake him 
 now the boundaries of some things do not touch one another butthere is a borderland which comes in between preventing them fromtouching and we were saying that actions done from passion are ofthis nature and come in between the voluntary and involuntary if aperson be convicted of having inflicted wounds in a passion in thefirst place he shall pay twice the amount of the injury if thewound be curable or if incurable four times the amount of theinjury or if the wound be curable and at the same time cause greatand notable disgrace to the wounded person he shall pay fourfold andwhenever any one in wounding another injures not only the also the city and makes him incapable of defending his countryagainst the enemy he besides the other penalties shall pay apenalty for the loss which the state has incurred and the penaltyshall be that in addition to his own times of service he shall serveon behalf of the disabled person and shall take his place in war he refuse he shall be liable to be convicted by law of refusalto serve the compensation for the injury whether to be twofold orthreefold or fourfold shall be fixed by the judges who convict if in like manner a brother wounds a brother the parents andkindred of either sex including the children of cousins whether onthe male or female side shall meet and when they have judged thecause they shall entrust the assessment of damages to the parents asis natural and if the estimate be disputed then the kinsmen on themale side shall make the estimate or if they cannot they shallcommit the matter to the guardians of the law and when similarcharges of wounding are brought by children against their who are more than sixty years of age having children of theirown not adopted shall be required to decide and if any one isconvicted they shall determine whether he or she ought to die orsuffer some other punishment either greater than death or at anyrate not much less a kinsman of the offender shall not be allowed tojudge the cause not even if he be of the age which is prescribed bythe law if a slave in a fit of anger wound a freeman the owner ofthe slave shall give him up to the wounded man who may do as hepleases with him and if be not give him up he shall himself make goodthe injury and if any one says that the slave and the wounded man areconspiring together let him argue the point and if he is cast heshall pay for the wrong three times over but if he gains his freeman who conspired with the slave shall reliable to an actionfor kidnapping and if any one unintentionally wounds another he shallsimply pay for the harm for no legislator is able to controlchance in such a case the judges shall be the same as those who areappointed in the case of children suing their parents and theyshall estimate the amount of the injury 
 all the preceding injuries and every kind of assault are deeds ofviolence and every man woman or child ought to consider that theelder has the precedence of the younger in honour both among the godsand also among men who would live in security and happiness whereforeit is a foul thing and hateful to the gods to see an elder manassaulted by a younger in the city and it is reasonable that ayoung man when struck by an elder should lightly endure his up in store for himself a like honour when he is old letthis be the one shall reverence his elder in word and shall respect any one who is twenty years older than male or female regarding him or her as his father ormother and he shall abstain from laying hands on any one who is of anage to have been his father or his mother out of reverence to thegods who preside over birth similarly he shall keep his hands froma stranger whether he be an old inhabitant or newly arrived he shallnot venture to correct such an one by blows either as the aggressoror in if he thinks that some stranger has struck him outof wantonness or insolence and ought to be punished he shall takehim to the wardens of the city but let him not strike him that thestranger may be kept far away from the possibility of lifting up hishand against a citizen and let the wardens of the city take theoffender and examine him not forgetting their duty to the god ofstrangers and in case the stranger appears to have struck the citizenunjustly let them inflict upon him as many blows with the scourgeas he has himself inflicted and quell his presumption but if he beinnocent they shall threaten and rebuke the man who arrested him andlet them both go if a person strikes another of the same age orsomewhat older than himself who has no children whether he be an oldman who strikes an old man or a young man who strikes a young man letthe person struck defend himself in the natural way without a weaponand with his hands only he who being more than forty years of to fight with another whether he be the aggressor or in selfdefence shall be regarded as rude and will be a disgraceful punishment and therefore suitableto him the obedient nature will readily yield to such the disobedient who heeds not the prelude shall have the lawready for any man smite another who is older than by twenty or by more years in the first place he who is athand not being younger than the combatants nor their equal in separate them or be disgraced according to law but if he bethe equal in age of the person who is struck or younger he shalldefend the person injured as he would a brother or father or stillolder relative further let him who dares to smite an elder betried for assault as i have said and if he be found guilty lethim be imprisoned for a period of not less than a year or if thejudges approve of a longer period their decision shall be if a stranger or metic smite one who is older by twenty years ormore the same law shall hold about the bystanders assisting and hewho is found guilty in such a suit if he be a stranger but notresident shall be imprisoned during a period of two years and ametic who disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned for three the court assign him a longer term and let him who was presentin any of these cases and did not assist according to law be he be of the highest dass by paying a fine of a mina or if hebe of the second class of fifty drachmas or if of the third a fine of thirty drachmas or if he be of the fourth class by afine of twenty drachmas and the generals and taxiarchs andphylarchs and hipparchs shall form the court in such cases 
 laws are partly framed for the sake of good men in order toinstruct them how they thay live on friendly terms with one partly for the sake of those who refuse to be instructed whosespirit cannot be subdued or softened or hindered from plunginginto evil these are the persons who cause the word to be spoken whichi am about to utter for them the legislator legislates ofnecessity and in the hope that there may be no need of his laws hewho shall dare to lay violent hands upon his father or mother orany still older relative having no fear either of the wrath of thegods above or of the punishments that are spoken of in the worldbelow but transgresses in contempt of ancient and universaltraditions as though he were too wise to believe in them requiressome extreme measure of prevention now death is not the worst thatcan happen to men far worse are the punishments which are said topursue them in the world below but although they are most true work on such souls no prevention for if they had any effectthere would be no slayers of mothers or impious hands lifted upagainst parents and therefore the punishments of this world which areinflicted during life ought not in such cases to fall short ifpossible of the terrors of the world below let our enactment then beas a man dare to strike his father or his mother or theirfathers or mothers he being at the time of sound mind then let anyone who is at hand come to the rescue as has been already said andthe metic or stranger who comes to the rescue shall be called to thefirst place in the games but if he do not come he shall suffer thepunishment of perpetual exile he who is not a metic if he comes tothe rescue shall have praise and if he do not come blame and ifa slave come to the rescue let him be made free but if he do notcome the rescue let him receive strokes of the whip by orderof the wardens of the agora if the occurrence take place in theagora or if somewhere in the city beyond the limits of the agora anywarden of the city is in residence shall punish him or if in thecountry then the commanders of the wardens of the country if thosewho are near at the time be inhabitants of the same place whetherthey be youths or men or women let them come to the rescue anddenounce him as the impious one and he who does not come to therescue shall fall under the curse of zeus the god of kindred and ofancestors according to law and if any one is found guilty ofassaulting a parent let him in the first place be for ever banishedfrom the city into the country and let him abstain from thetemples and if he do not abstain the wardens of the country shallpunish him with blows or in any way which they please and if hereturn he shall be put to death and if any freeman eat or drink orhave any other sort of intercourse with him or only meeting himhave voluntarily touched him he shall not enter into any into the agora nor into the city until he is purified for heshould consider that he has become tainted by a curse and if hedisobeys the law and pollutes the city and the temples contrary tolaw and one of the magistrates sees him and does not indict him whenhe gives in his account this omission shall be a most serious charge 
 if a slave strike a freeman whether a stranger or a citizen letany one who is present come to the rescue or pay the penaltyalready mentioned and let the bystanders bind him and deliver him upto the injured person and he receiving him shall put him in inflict on him as many stripes as he pleases but havingpunished him he must surrender him to his master according to law andnot deprive him of his property let the law be as who strikes a freeman not at the command of the owner shall receive bound from the man whom he has stricken andnot release him until the slave has persuaded the man whom he hasstricken that he ought to be released and let there be the samelaws about women in relation to women about men and women in relationto one another
