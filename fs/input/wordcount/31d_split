 euphoria at helping gryffindor scrape the quidditch cup was such that he settle to anything next day all he wanted to do was talk over the match so harry and hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention grawp not that either of them tried very hard neither was keen to be the one to bring ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion as it was another fine warm day they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room ron was not particularly keen on this idea at firsthe was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every gryffindor who walked past his chair not to mention the occasional outbursts of weasley is our after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good 
 
 they spread their books out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while ron talked them through his first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time 
 
 well i mean already let in that one of so i feeling all that confident but i dunno when bradley came towards me just out of nowhere i thoughtyou can do this and i had about a second to decide which way to fly you know because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop my right obviously his leftbut i had a funny feeling that he was feinting and so i took the chance and flew lefthis right i meanandwellyou saw what happened he concluded modestly sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to thema bunch of gossiping hufflepuffshad heard him and then when chambers came at me about five minutes laterwhat ron asked having stopped at the look on face why are you grinning 
 
 not said harry quickly and looked down at his transfiguration notes attempting to straighten his lace the truth was that ron had just reminded harry forcibly of another gryffindor quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree just glad we won all 
 
 yeah said ron slowly savouring the words we you see the look on face when ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose 
 
 i suppose she cried did she said harry bitterly 
 
 well yeah more out of temper than anything though ron frowned slightly but you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground you 
 
 er said harry 
 
 well actually no ron said hermione with a heavy sigh putting down her book and looking at him apologetically as a matter of fact the only bit of the match harry and i saw was first goal 
 
 carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment you watch he said faintly looking from one to the other you see me make any of those saves 
 
 wellno said hermione stretching out a placatory hand towards him but ron we want to leavewe had to 
 
 yeah said ron whose face was growing rather red how come 
 
 it was hagrid said harry he decided to tell us why been covered in injuries ever since he got back from the giants he wanted us to go into the forest with him we had no choice you know how he gets anyway 
 
 the story was told in five minutes by the end of which indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity 
 
 he brought one back and hid it in the forest 
 
 yep said harry grimly 
 
 no said ron as though by saying this he could make it untrue no he have 
 
 well he has said hermione firmly about sixteen feet tall enjoys ripping up pine trees and knows me she snorted as hermy 
 
 ron gave a nervous laugh 
 
 and hagrid wants us to 
 
 teach him english yeah said harry 
 
 lost his mind said ron in an almost awed voice 
 
 yes said hermione irritably turning a page of intermediate transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagrams showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glasses yes starting to think he has but unfortunately he made harry and me promise 
 
 well just going to have to break your promise all said ron firmly i mean come on got exams and about that far he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger almost touching from being chucked out as it is and anyway remember norbert remember aragog have we ever come off better for mixing with any of monster mates 
 
 i know just thatwe promised said hermione in a small voice 
 
 ron smoothed his hair flat again looking preoccupied 
 
 well he sighed hagrid been sacked yet has he hung on this long maybe hang on till the end of term and we have to go near grawp at all 
 
 the castle grounds were gleaming in the sunlight as though freshly painted the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake the satin green lawns rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze june had arrived but to the this meant only one thing their owls were upon them at last 
 
 their teachers were no longer setting them homework lessons were devoted to revising those topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams the purposeful feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the owls from mind though he did wonder occasionally during potions lessons whether lupin had ever told snape that he must continue giving harry ooclumency tuition if he had then snape had ignored lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring harry this suited harry very well he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with snape and to his relief hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about occlumency she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself and had not laid out any elf clothes for days 
 
 she was not the only person acting oddly as the owls drew steadily nearer ernie macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their revision practices 
 
 how many hours think doing a day he demanded of harry and ron as they queued outside herbology a manic gleam in his eyes 
 
 i dunno said ron a few 
 
 more or less than eight 
 
 less i said ron looking slightly alarmed 
 
 doing eight said ernie puffing out his chest eight or nine getting an hour in before breakfast every day eights my average i can do ten on a good weekend day i did nine and a half on monday not so good on tuesdayonly seven and a quarter then on wednesday 
 
 harry was deeply thankful that professor sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point forcing ernie to abandon his recital 
 
 meanwhile draco malfoy had found a different way to induce panic 
 
 of course not what you know he was heard to tell crabbe and goyle loudly outside potions a few days before the exams were to start who you know now been friendly with the head of the wizarding examinations authority for yearsold griselda had her round for dinner and everthing 
 
 do you think true hermione whispered in alarm to harry and ron 
 
 nothing we can do about it if it is said ron gloomily 
 
 i think true said neville quietly from behind them because griselda marchbanks is a friend of my and never mentioned the 
 
 she like neville asked hermione at once is she strict 
 
 bit like gran really said neville in a subdued voice 
 
 knowing her hurt your chances though will it ron told him encouragingly 
 
 oh i think it will make any difference said neville still more miserably always telling professor marchbanks not as good as my dad well you saw what like at st 
 
 neville looked fixedly at the floor harry ron and hermione glanced at each other but know what to say it was the first time neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital 
 
 meanwhile a flourishing trade in aids to concentration mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth and harry and ron were much tempted by the bottle of brain elixir offered to them by ravenclaw eddie carmichael who swore it was solely responsible for the nine outstanding owls he had gained the previous summer and was offering a whole pint for a mere twelve galleons ron assured harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left hogwarts and got a job but before they could close the deal hermione had confiscated the bottle from carmichael and poured the contents down a toilet 
 
 hermione we wanted to buy that shouted ron 
 
 be stupid she snarled you might as well take harold powdered dragon claw and have done with it 
 
 got powdered dragon claw said ron eagerly 
 
 not any more said hermione i confiscated that too none of these things actually work you know 
 
 dragon claw does work said ron supposed to be incredible really gives your brain a boost you come over all cunning for a few hourshermione let me have a pinch go on it hurt 
 
 this stuff can said hermione grimly had a look at it and actually dried doxy droppings 
 
 this information took the edge off harry and desire for brain stimulants 
 
 they received their examination timetables and details of the procedure for owls during their next transfiguration lesson 
 
 as you can see professor mcgonagall told the class as they copied down the dates and times of their exams from the blackboard your owls are spread over two successive weeks you will sit the theory papers in the mornings and the practice in the afternoons your practical astronomy examination will of course take place at night 
 
 now i must warn you that the most stringent charms have been applied to your examination papers quills are banned from the examination hall as are remembralls detachable cribbing cuffs and ink every year i am afraid to say seems to harbour at least one student who thinks that he or she can get around the wizarding examinations rules i can only hope that it is nobody in gryffindor our newheadmistress professor mcgonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that aunt petunia had whenever she was contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt has asked the heads of house to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severelybecause of course your examination results will reflect upon the new regime at the school 
 
 professor mcgonagall gave a tiny sigh harry saw the nostrils of her sharp nose flare 
 
 however that is no reason not to do your very best you have your own futures to think about 
 
 please professor said hermione her hand in the air when will we find out our results 
 
 an owl will be sent to you some time in july said professcr mcgonagall 
 
 excellent said dean thomas in an audible whisper so we have to worry about it till the holidays 
 
 harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in privet drive in six weeks time waiting for his owl results well he thought dully at least he would be sure of one bit of post that summer 
 
 their first examination theory of charms was scheduled for monday morning harry agreed to test hermione after lunch on sunday but regretted it almost at once she was very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had got the answer completely right finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of achievements in charming 
 
 why you just do it yourself he said firmly handing the book back to her his eyes watering 
 
 meanwhile ron was reading two years worth of charms notes with his fingers in his ears his lips moving soundlessly seamus finnigan was lying flat on his back on the floor reciting the definition of a substantive charm while dean checked it against the standard book of spells grade and parvati and lavender who were practising basic locomotion charms were making their race each other around the edge of the table 
 
 dinner was a subdued affair that night harry and ron did not talk much but ate with gusto having studied hard all day hermione on the other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure ron was just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night when her fork slid from her limp fingers and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate 
 
 oh my goodness she said faintly staring into the entrance hall is that them is that the examiners 
 
 harry and ron whipped around on their bench through the doors to the great hall they could see umbridge standing with a small group of witches and wizards umbridge harry was pleased to see looked rather nervous 
 
 shall we go and have a closer look said ron 
 
 harry and hermione nodded and they hastened towards the double doors into the entrance hall slowing down as they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiners harry thought professor marchbanks must be the tiny stooped witch with a face so lined it looked as though it had been draped in cobwebs umbridge was speaking to her deferentially professor marchbanks seemed to be a little deaf she was answering professor umbridge very loudly considering they were only a foot apart 
 
 journey was fine journey was fine made it plenty of times before she said impatiently now i heard from dumbledore lately she added peering around the hall as though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard no idea where he is i suppose 
 
 none at all said umbridge shooting a malevolent look at harry ron and hermione who were now dawdling around the foot of the stairs as ron pretended to do up his shoelace but i daresay the ministry of magic will track him down soon enough 
 
 i doubt it shouted tiny professor marchbanks not it dumbledore want to be found i should know examined him personally in transfiguration and charms when he did newts did things with a wand never seen before 
 
 yes well said professor umbridge as harry ron and hermione dragged their feet up the marble staircase as slowly as they dared let me show you to the staff room i daresay like a cup of tea after your journey 
 
 it was an uncomfortable sort of an evening everyone was trying to do some revising but nobody seemed to be getting very far harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hours he remembered his careers consultation and furious declaration that she would help him become an auror if it was the last thing she did he wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time was here he knew he was not the only one lying awake but none of the others in the dormitory spoke and finally one by one they fell asleep 
 
 none of the talked very much at breakfast next day either parvati was practising incantations under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched hermione was rereading achievements in charming so fast that her eyes appeared blurred and neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade 
 
 once breakfast was over the fifth and milled around in the entrance hall while the other students went off to lessons then at half past nine they were called forwards class by class to the great hall which had been rearranged exactly as harry had seen it in the pensieve when his father sirius and snape had been taking their owls the four house tables had been removed and replaced instead with many tables for one all facing the end of the hall where professor mcgonagall stood facing them when they were all seated and quiet she said you may begin and turned over an enormous on the desk beside her on which there were also spare quills ink bottles and rolls of parchment 
 
 harry turned over his paper his heart thumping hardthree rows to his right and four seats ahead hermione was already scribblingand lowered his eyes to the first question a give the incantation and b describe the wand movement required to make objects fly 
 
 harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll smiling slightly he bent over the paper and began to write 
 
 well it too bad was it asked hermione anxiously in the entrance hall two hours later still clutching the exam paper not sure i did myself justice on cheering charms i just ran out of time did you put in the for hiccoughs i sure whether i ought to it felt like too muchand on question 
 
 hermione said ron sternly been through this before not going through every exam afterwards bad enough doing them once 
 
 the ate lunch with the rest of the school the four house tables had reappeared for the lunch hour then they trooped off into the small chamber beside the great hall where they were to wait until called for their practical examination as small groups of students were called forwards in alphabetical order those left behind muttered incantations and practised wand movements occasionally poking each other in the back or eye by mistake 
 
 name was called trembling she left the chamber with anthony goldstein gregory goyle and daphne greengrass students who had already been tested did not return afterwards so harry and ron had no idea how hermione had done 
 
 be fine remember she got a hundred and twelve per cent on one of our charms tests said ron 
 
 ten minutes later professor flitwick called parkinson pansypatil padmapatil parvatipotter harry 
 
 good luck said ron quietly harry walked into the great hall clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook 
 
 professor tofty is free potter squeaked professor flitwick who was standing just inside the door he pointed harry towards what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who was sitting behind a small table in a far corner a short distance from professor marchbanks who was halfway through testing draco malfoy 
 
 potter is it said professor tofty consulting his notes and peering over his at harry as he approached the famous potter 
 
 out of the corner of his eye harry distinctly saw malfoy throw a scathing look over at him the malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed harry could not suppress a grin professor tofty smiled back at him encouragingly 
 
 it he said in his quavery old voice no need to be nervous now if i could ask you to take this egg cup and make it do some cartwheels for me 
 
 on the whole harry thought it went rather well his levitation charm was certainly much better than had been though he wished he had not mixed up the incantations for colour change and growth charms so that the rat he was supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and was the size of a badger before harry could rectify his mistake he was glad hermione had not been in the hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterwards he could tell ron though ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened 
 
 there was no time to relax that night they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in revision for transfiguration next day harry went to bed with his head buzzing with complex spell models and theories 
 
 he forgot the definition of a switching spell during his written paper next morning but thought his practical could have been a lot worse at least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana whereas poor hannah abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingos causing the examination to be halted for ten minute while the birds were captured and carried out of the hall 
 
 they had their herbology exam on wednesday other than a small bite from a fanged geranium harry felt he had done reasonably well and then on thursday defence against the dark arts here for the first time harry felt sure he had passed he had no problem with any of the written questions and took particular pleasure during the practical examination in performing all the and defensive spells right in front of umbridge who was watching coolly from near the doors into the entrance hall 
 
 oh bravo cried professor tolty who was examining harry again when harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell very good indeed well i think all potter unless 
 
 he leaned forwards a little 
 
 i heard from my dear friend tiberius ogden that you can produce a patronus for a bonus point 
 
 harry raised his wand looked directly at umbridge and imagined her being sacked 
 
 expecto patronum 
 
 his silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the hall all of the examiners looked around to watch its progress and when it dissolved into silver mist professor tofty clapped his veined and knotted hands enthusiastically 
 
 excellent he said very well potter you may go 
 
 as harry passed umbridge beside the door their eyes met there was a nasty smile playing around her wide slack mouth but he did not care unless he was very much mistaken and he was not planning on telling anybody in case he was he had just achieved an outstanding owl 
 
 on friday harry and ron had a day off while hermione sat her ancient runes exam and as they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from revision they stretched and yawned beside the open window through which warm summer air was wafting as they played wizard chess harry could see hagrid in the distance teaching a class on the edge of the forest he was trying to guess what creatures they were examininghe thought it must be unicorns because the boys seemed to be standing back a littlewhen the portrait hole opened and hermione clambered in looking thoroughly 
 
 how were the runes said ron yawning and stretching 
 
 i ehwaz said hermione furiously it means partnership not mixed it up with eihwaz 
 
 ah well said ron lazily only one mistake it still get 
 
 oh shut up said hermione angrily it could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail and more put another niffler in office i know how they got it through that new door but i just walked past there and umbridge is shrieking her head offby the sound of it it tried to take a chunk out of her leg 
 
 good said harry and ron together 
 
 it is not good said hermione hotly she thinks hagrid doing it remember and we do not want hagrid chucked out 
 
 teaching at the moment she blame him said harry gesturing out of the window 
 
 oh so naive sometimes harry you really think umbridge will wait for proof said hermione who seemed determined to be in a towering temper and she swept off towards the girls dormitories banging the door behind her 
 
 such a lovely girl said ron very quietly prodding his queen forward to beat up one of knights 
 
 bad mood persisted for most of the weekend though harry and ron found it quite easy to ignore as they spent most of saturday and sunday revising for potions on monday the exam which harry had been looking forward to leastand which he was sure would be the downfall of his ambitions to become an auror sure enough he found the written paper difficult though he thought he might have got full marks on the question about polyjuice potion he could describe its effects accurately having taken it illegally in his second year 
 
 the afternoon practical was not as dreadful as he had expected it to be with snape absent from the proceedings he found that he was much more relaxed than he usually was while making potions neville who was sitting very near harry also looked happier than harry had ever seen him during a potions class when professor marchbanks said step away from your cauldrons please the examination is over harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved a good grade but he had with luck avoided a fail 
 
 only four exams left said parvati patil wearily as they headed back to gryffindor common room 
 
 only said hermione snappishly got arithmancy and probably the toughest subject there is 
 
 nobody was foolish enough to snap back so she was unable to vent her spleen on any of them and was reduced to telling off some for giggling too loudly in the common room 
 
 harry was determined to perform well in care of magical creatures exam so as not to let hagrid down the practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the forbidden forest where students were required to correctly identify the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehogs the trick was to offer them all milk in turn knarls highly suspicious creatures whose quills had many magical properties generally went berserk at what they saw as an attempt to poison them then demonstrate correct handling of a bowtruckle feed and clean out a fire crab without sustaining serious burns and choose from a wide selection of food the diet they would give a sick unicorn 
 
 harry could see hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window when examiner a plump little witch this time smiled at him and told him he could leave harry gave hagrid a fleeting before heading back to the castle 
 
 the astronomy theory paper on wednesday morning went well enough harry was not convinced he had got the names of all moons right but was at least confident that none of them was inhabited by mice they had to wait until evening for their practical astronomy the afternoon was devoted instead to divination 
 
 even by low standards in divination the exam went very badly he might as well have tried to see moving pictures on the desktop as in the stubbornly blank crystal ball he lost his head completely during reading saying it looked to him as though professor marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round dark soggy stranger and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head lines on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous tuesday 
 
 well we were always going to fail that one said ron gloomily as they ascended the marble staircase he had just made harry feel rather better by telling him how he had told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball only to look up and realise he had been describing his reflection 
 
 we have taken the stupid subject in the first place said harry 
 
 still at least we can give it up now 
 
 yeah said harry no more pretending we care what happens when jupiter and uranus get too friendly 
 
 and from now on i care if my spell die ron just chucking them in the bin where they belong 
 
 harry laughed just as hermione came running up behind them he stopped laughing at once in case it annoyed her 
 
 well i think done all right in arithmancy she said and harry and ron both sighed with relief just time for a quick look over our before dinner then 
 
 when they reached the top of the astronomy tower at eleven they found a perfect night for stargazing cloudless and still the grounds were bathed in silvery moonlight and there was a slight chill in the air each of them set up his or her telescope and when professor marchbanks gave the word proceeded to fill in the blank they had been given 
 
 professors marchbanks and tofty strolled among them watching as they entered the precise positions of the stars and planets they were observing all was quiet except for the rustle of parchment the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand and the scribbling of many quills half an hour passed then ar hour the little squares of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started to vanish as lights in the castle windows were extinguished 
 
 as harry completed the constellation orion on his chart however the front doors of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he was standing so that light spilled down the stone steps a little way across the lawn harry glanced down as he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadows moving over the brightly lit grass before the doors swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more 
 
 harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it now examining venus he looked down at his chart to enter the planet there but something distracted him pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn if they had not been moving and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked even at this distance harry had a funny feeling he recognised the walk of the squattest of them who seemed to be leading the group 
 
 he could not think why umbridge would be taking a stroll outside after midnight much less accompanied by five others then somebody coughed behind him and he remembered that he was halfway through an exam he had quite forgotten position jamming his eye to his telescope he found it again and was once more about to enter it on his chart when alert for any odd sound he heard a distant knock which echoed through the deserted grounds followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog 
 
 he looked up his heart hammering there were lights on in windows and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them the door opened and he distinctly saw six sharply defined figures walk over the threshold the door closed again and there was silence 
 
 harry felt very uneasy he glanced around to see whether ron or hermione had noticed what he had but professor marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and not wanting to look as though he was sneaking looks at anyone work harry hastily bent over his and pretended to be adding notes to it while really peering over the top of the parapet towards cabin figures were now moving across the cabin windows temporarily blocking the light 
 
 he could feel professor eyes on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope staring up at the moon though he had marked its position an hour ago but as professor marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the astronomy tower several of the people around harry ducked out from behind their telescopes and peered instead in the direction of cabin 
 
 professor tofty gave another dry little cough 
 
 try and concentrate now boys and girls he said softly 
 
 most people returned to their telescopes harry looked to his left hermione was gazing transfixed at cabin 
 
 ahemtwenty minutes to go said professor tofty 
 
 hermione jumped and returned at once to her harry looked down at his own and noticed that he had venus as mars he bent to correct it 
 
 there was a loud bang from the grounds several people cried ouch when they poked themselves in the face with the ends of their telescopes as they hastened to see what was going on below 
 
 door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fists surrounded by six people all of whom judging by the tiny threads of red light they were casting in his direction seemed to be attempting to stun him 
 
 no cried hermione 
 
 my dear said professor tofty in a scandalised voice this is an examination 
 
 but nobody was paying the slightest attention to their any more jets of red light were still flying about beside cabin yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him he was still upright and still as far as harry could see fighting cries and yells echoed across the grounds a man yelled be reasonable hagrid 
 
 hagrid roared reasonable be damned yeh won take me like this dawlish 
 
 harry could see the tiny outline of fang attempting to defend hagrid leaping repeatedly at the wizards surrounding him until a stunning spell caught him and he fell to the ground hagrid gave a howl of fury lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him the man flew what looked like ten feet and did not get up again hermione gasped both hands over her mouth harry looked round at ron and saw that he too was looking scared none of them had ever seen hagrid in a real temper before 
 
 look squealed parvati who was leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front doors had opened again more light was spilling out on to the dark lawn and a single long black shadow was now rippling across the lawn 
 
 now really said professor tofty anxiously only sixteen minutes left you know 
 
 but nobody paid him the slightest attention they were watching the person now sprinting towards the battle beside cabin 
 
 how dare you the figure shouted as she ran how dare you 
 
 mcgonagall whispered hermione 
 
 leave him alone say said professor voice through the darkness on what grounds are you attacking him he has done nothing nothing to warrant such 
 
 hermione parvati and lavender all screamed the figures around the cabin had shot no fewer than four stunners at professor mcgonagall halfway between cabin and castle the red beams collided with her for a moment she looked luminous and glowed an eerie red then she lifted right off her feet landed hard on her back and moved no more 
 
 galloping gargoyles shouted professor tofty who also seemed to have forgotten the exam completely not so much as a warning outrageous behaviour 
 
 cowards bellowed hagrid his voice carried clearly to the top of the tower and several lights flickered back on inside the castle ruddy cowards have some o that an that 
 
 oh my gasped hermione 
 
 hagrid took two massive swipes at his closest attackers judging by their immediate collapse they had been knocked cold harry saw hagrid double over and thought he had finally been overcome by a spell but on the contrary next moment hagrid was standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his backthen harry realised that bangs limp body was draped around his shoulders 
 
 get him get him screamed umbridge but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of fists indeed he was backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleagues and fell over hagrid had turned and begun to run with fang still hung around his neck umbridge sent one last stunning spell after him but it missed and hagrid running towards the distant gates disappeared into the darkness 
 
 there was a long quivering silence as everybody gazed into the grounds then professor voice said feebly um five minutes to go everybody 
 
 though he had only filled in of his chart harry was desperate for the exam to end when it came at last he ron and hermione forced their telescopes haphazardly back into their holders and dashed back down the spiral staircase none of the students were going to bed they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stairs about what they had witnessed 
 
 that evil woman gasped hermione who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage trying to sneak up on hagrid in the dead of night 
 
 she clearly wanted to avoid another scene like said ernie macmillan sagely squeezing over to join them 
 
 hagrid did well he said ron who looked more alarmed than impressed how come all the spells bounced off him 
 
 be his giant blood said hermione shakily its very hard to stun a giant like trolls really tough but poor professor mcgonagall four stunners straight in the chest and not exactly young is she 
 
 dreadful dreadful said ernie shaking his head pompously well off to bed night all 
 
 people around them were drifting away still talking excitedly about what they had just seen 
 
 at least they get to take hagrid off to azkaban said ron i spect gone to join dumbledore he 
 
 i suppose so said hermione who looked tearful oh this is awful i really thought dumbledore would be back before long but now lost hagrid too 
 
 they traipsed back to the gryffindor common room to find it full the commotion out in the grounds had woken several people who had hastened to rouse their friends seamus and dean who had arrived ahead of harry ron and hermione were now telling everyone what they had seen and heard from the top of the astronomy tower 
 
 but why sack hagrid now asked angelina johnson shaking her head not like trelawney been teaching much better than usual this year 
 
 urnbridge hates said hermione bitterly flopping down into an armchair she was always going to try and get hagrid out 
 
 and she thought hagrid was putting nifflers in her office piped up katie bell 
 
 oh blimey said lee jordan covering his mouth me been putting the nifflers in her office fred and george left me a couple been levitating them in through her window 
 
 have sacked him anyway said dean he was too close to dumbledore 
 
 true said harry sinking into an armchair beside 
 
 i just hope professor all right said lavender tearfully 
 
 they carried her back up to the castle we watched through the dormitory window said colin creevey she look very well 
 
 madam pomfrey will sort her out said alicia spinnet firmly never failed yet 
 
 it was nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared harry felt wide awake the image of hagrid sprinting away into the dark was haunting him he was so angry with umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her though suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving skrewts had its merits he fell asleep contemplating hideous revenges and arose from bed three hours later feeling distinctly unrested 
 
 their final exam history of magic was not to take place until that afternoon harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of revision so instead he sat with his head in his hands by the window trying hard not to doze off as he read through some of the stack of notes that hermione had lent him 
 
 the entered the great hall at two and took their places in front of their examination papers harry felt exhausted he just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep then tomorrow he and ron were going to go down to the quidditch pitchhe was going to have a fly on broomand savour their freedom from revision 
 
 turn over your papers said professor marchbanks from the front of the hall flicking over the giant you may begin 
 
 harry stared fixedly at the first question it was several seconds before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it there was a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high windows slowly tortuously he at last began to write an answer 
 
 he was finding it very difficult to remember names and kept confusing dates he simply skipped question four in your opinion did wand legislation contribute to or lead to better control of goblin riots of the eighteenth century thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end he had a stab at question five how was the statute of secrecy breached in and what measures were introduced to prevent a recurrence but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important points he had a feeling vampires had come into the story somewhere 
 
 he looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eyes alighted upon number ten describe the circumstances that led to the formation of the international confederation of wizards and explain why the warlocks of liechtenstein refused to join 
 
 i know this harry thought though his brain felt torpid and slack he could visualise a heading in handwriting the formation of the international confederation of wizards he had read those notes only this morning 
 
 he began to write looking up now and again to check the large on the desk beside professor marchbanks he was sitting right behind parvati patil whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden lights that glistened in it when she moved her head slightly and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it 
 
 the first supreme mugwump of the international confederation of wizards was pierre bonaccord but his appointment was contested by the wizarding community of liechtenstein because 
 
 all around harry quills were scratching on parchment like scurrying burrowing rats the sun was very hot on the back of his head what was it that bonaccord had done to offend the wizards of liechtenstein harry had a feeling it had something to do with trolls he gazed blankly at the back of head again if he could only perform legilimency and open a window in the back of her head and see what it was about trolls that had caused the breach between pierre bonaccord and liechtenstein 
 
 harry closed his eyes and buried his face in his hands so that the glowing red of his eyelids grew dark and cool bonaccord had wanted to stop and give the trolls rights but liechtenstein was having problems with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain trolls that was it 
 
 he opened his eyes they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment slowly he wrote two lines about the trolls then read through what he had done so far it did not seem very informative or detailed yet he was sure notes on the confederation had gone on for pages and pages 
 
 he closed his eyes again trying to see them trying to remember the confederation had met for the first time in france yes he had written that already 
 
 goblins had tried to attend and been ousted he had written that too 
 
 and nobody from liechtenstein had wanted to come 
 
 think he told himself his face in his hands while all around him quills scratched out answers and the sand trickled through the at the front 
 
 he was walking along the cool dark corridor to the department of mysteries again walking with a firm and purposeful tread breaking occasionally into a run determined to reach his destination at last the black door swung open for him as usual and here he was in the circular room with its many doors 
 
 straight across the stone floor and through the second door patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking but no time to explore he must hurry 
 
 he jogged the last few feet to the third door which swung open just like the others 
 
 once again he was in the room full of shelves and glass spheres his heart was beating very fast now he was going to get there this time when he reached number he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows 
 
 but there was a shape on the floor at the very end a black shape moving on the floor like a wounded animal stomach contracted with fear with excitement 
 
 a voice issued from his own mouth a high cold voice empty of any human kindness 
 
 take it for me lift it down now i cannot touch it but you can 
 
 the black shape on the floor shifted a little harry saw a white hand clutching a wand rise at the end of his own arm heard the high cold voice say crucio 
 
 the man on the floor let out a scream of pain attempted to stand but fell back writhing harry was laughing he raised his wand the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motionless 
 
 lord voldemort is waiting 
 
 very slowly his arms trembling the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head his face was bloodstained and gaunt twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance 
 
 have to kill me whispered sirius 
 
 undoubtedly i shall in the end said the cold voice but you will fetch it for me first black you think you have felt pain thus far think again we have hours ahead of us and nobody to hear you scream 
 
 but somebody screamed as voldemort lowered his wand again somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk on to the cold stone floor harry awoke as he hit the ground still yelling his scar on fire as the great hall erupted all around him 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix
