 on the fifth morning or rather afternoon a different step and shorter and this time the person entered the room it was zillah donned in her scarlet shawl with a black silk bonnet on her head and a willow basket swung to her arm 
 eh dear mrs dean she exclaimed well there is a talk about you at gimmerton i never thought but you were sunk in the blackhorse marsh and missy with you till master told me been found and lodged you here what and you must have got on an island sure and how long were you in the hole did master save you mrs dean but not so not been so poorly have you 
 your master is a true scoundrel i replied but he shall answer for it he have raised that tale it shall all be laid bare 
 what do you mean asked zillah not his tale they tell that in the your being lost in the marsh and i calls to earnshaw when i come queer things mr hareton happened since i went off a sad pity of that likely young lass and cant nelly dean he stared i thought he had not heard aught so i told him the rumour the master listened and he just smiled to himself and said if they have been in the marsh they are out now zillah nelly dean is lodged at this minute in your room you can tell her to flit when you go up here is the key the bog water got into her head and she would have run home quite flighty but i fixed her till she came round to her senses you can bid her go to the grange at once if she be able and carry a message from me that her young lady will follow in time to attend the funeral 
 mr edgar is not dead i gasped oh zillah zillah 
 no no sit you down my good mistress she replied right sickly yet not dead doctor kenneth thinks he may last another day i met him on the road and asked 
 instead of sitting down i snatched my outdoor things and hastened below for the way was free on entering the house i looked about for someone to give information of catherine the place was filled with sunshine and the door stood wide open but nobody seemed at hand as i hesitated whether to go off at once or return and seek my mistress a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth linton lay on the settle sole tenant sucking a stick of and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes where is miss catherine i demanded sternly supposing i could frighten him into giving intelligence by catching him thus alone he sucked on like an innocent 
 is she gone i said 
 no he replied upstairs not to go we let her 
 you let her little idiot i exclaimed direct me to her room immediately or make you sing out sharply 
 papa would make you sing out if you attempted to get there he answered he says not to be soft with catherine my wife and shameful that she should wish to leave me he says she hates me and wants me to die that she may have my money but she have it and she go home she never may cry and be sick as much as she pleases 
 he resumed his former occupation closing his lids as if he meant to drop asleep 
 master heathcliff i resumed have you forgotten all kindness to you last winter when you affirmed you loved her and when she brought you books and sung you songs and came many a time through wind and snow to see you she wept to miss one evening because you would be disappointed and you felt then that she was a hundred times too good to you and now you believe the lies your father tells though you know he detests you both and you join him against her fine gratitude is it not 
 the corner of mouth fell and he took the from his lips 
 did she come to wuthering heights because she hated you i continued think for yourself as to your money she does not even know that you will have any and you say sick and yet you leave her alone up there in a strange house you who have felt what it is to be so neglected you could pity your own sufferings and she pitied them too but you pity hers i shed tears master heathcliff you elderly woman and a servant you after pretending such affection and having reason to worship her almost store every tear you have for yourself and lie there quite at ease ah a heartless selfish boy 
 i stay with her he answered crossly not stay by myself she cries so i bear it and she give over though i say call my father i did call him once and he threatened to strangle her if she was not quiet but she began again the instant he left the room moaning and grieving all night long though i screamed for vexation that i sleep 
 is mr heathcliff out i inquired perceiving that the wretched creature had no power to sympathize with his mental tortures 
 in the court he replied talking to dr kenneth who says uncle is dying truly at last glad for i shall be master of the grange after catherine always spoke of it as her house it hers mine papa says everything she has is mine all her nice books are mine she offered to give me them and her pretty birds and her pony minny if i would get the key of our room and let her out but i told her she had nothing to give they were all all mine and then she cried and took a little picture from her neck and said i should have that two pictures in a gold case on one side her mother and on the other uncle when they were young that was said they were mine too and tried to get them from her the spiteful thing let me she pushed me off and hurt me i shrieked frightens heard papa coming and she broke the hinges and divided the case and gave me her portrait the other she attempted to hide but papa asked what was the matter and i explained it he took the one i had away and ordered her to resign hers to me she refused and struck her down and wrenched it off the chain and crushed it with his foot 
 and were you pleased to see her struck i asked having my designs in encouraging his talk 
 i winked he answered i wink to see my father strike a dog or a horse he does it so hard yet i was glad at deserved punishing for pushing me but when papa was gone she made me come to the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside against her teeth and her mouth filling with blood and then she gathered up the bits of the picture and went and sat down with her face to the wall and she has never spoken to me since and i sometimes think she speak for pain i like to think so but a naughty thing for crying continually and she looks so pale and wild afraid of her 
 and you can get the key if you choose i said 
 yes when upstairs he answered but i walk upstairs now 
 in what apartment is it i asked 
 oh he cried i tell you where it is it is our secret nobody neither hareton nor zillah is to know there tired away go away and he turned his face on to his arm and shut his eyes again 
 i considered it best to depart without seeing mr heathcliff and bring a rescue for my young lady from the grange on reaching it the astonishment of my to see me and their joy also was intense and when they heard that their little mistress was safe two or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at mr door but i bespoke the announcement of it myself how changed i found him even in those few days he lay an image of sadness and resignation waiting his death very young he looked though his actual age was one would have called him ten years younger at least he thought of catherine for he murmured her name i touched his hand and spoke 
 catherine is coming dear master i whispered she is alive and well and will be here i hope tonight 
 i trembled at the first effects of this intelligence he half rose up looked eagerly round the apartment and then sank back in a swoon as soon as he recovered i related our compulsory visit and detention at the heights i said heathcliff forced me to go in which was not quite true i uttered as little as possible against linton nor did i describe all his brutal intentions being to add no bitterness if i could help it to his already overflowing cup 
 he divined that one of his purposes was to secure the personal property as well as the estate to his son or rather himself yet why he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master because ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together however he felt that his will had better be altered instead of leaving fortune at her own disposal he determined to put it in the hands of trustees for her use during life and for her children if she had any after her by that means it could not fall to mr heathcliff should linton die 
 having received his orders i dispatched a man to fetch the attorney and four more provided with serviceable weapons to demand my young lady of her jailer both parties were delayed very late the single servant returned first he said mr green the lawyer was out when he arrived at his house and he had to wait two hours for his and then mr green told him he had a little business in the village that must be done but he would be at thrushcross grange before morning the four men came back unaccompanied also they brought word that catherine was ill too ill to quit her room and heathcliff would not suffer them to see her i scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale which i would not carry to my master resolving to take a whole bevy up to the heights at daylight and storm it literally unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us her father shall see her i vowed and vowed again if that devil be killed on his own doorstones in trying to prevent it 
 happily i was spared the journey and the trouble i had gone downstairs at three to fetch a jug of water and was passing through the hall with it in my hand when a sharp knock at the front door made me jump oh it is green i said recollecting green and i went on intending to send somebody else to open it but the knock was repeated not loud and still importunately i put the jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself the harvest moon shone clear outside it was not the attorney my own sweet little mistress sprang on my neck sobbing 
 ellen ellen is papa alive 
 yes i cried yes my angel he is god be thanked you are safe with us again 
 she wanted to run breathless as she was upstairs to mr room but i compelled her to sit down on a chair and made her drink and washed her pale face chafing it into a faint colour with my apron then i said i must go first and tell of her arrival imploring her to say she should be happy with young heathcliff she stared but soon comprehending why i counselled her to utter the falsehood she assured me she would not complain 
 i abide to be present at their meeting i stood outside the chamber door a quarter of an hour and hardly ventured near the bed then all was composed however despair was as silent as her joy she supported him calmly in appearance and he fixed on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy 
 he died blissfully mr lockwood he died so kissing her cheek he murmured 
 i am going to her and you darling child shall come to us and never stirred or spoke again but continued that rapt radiant gaze till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed none could have noticed the exact minute of his death it was so entirely without a struggle 
 whether catherine had spent her tears or whether the grief were too weighty to let them flow she sat there till the sun rose she sat till noon and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed but i insisted on her coming away and taking some repose it was well i succeeded in removing her for at dinner time appeared the lawyer having called at wuthering heights to get his instructions how to behave he had sold himself to mr heathcliff and that was the cause of his delay in obeying my summons fortunately no thought of worldly affairs crossed the mind to disturb him after his arrival 
 mr green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the place he gave all the servants but me notice to quit he would have carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that edgar linton should not be buried beside his wife but in the chapel with his family there was the will however to hinder that and my loud protestations against any infringement of its directions the funeral was hurried over catherine mrs linton heathcliff now was suffered to stay at the grange till her corpse had quitted it 
 she told me that her anguish had at last spurred linton to incur the risk of liberating her she heard the men i sent disputing at the door and she gathered the sense of answer it drove her desperate linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after i left was terrified into fetching the key before his father he had the cunning to unlock and relock the door without shutting it and when he should have gone to bed he begged to sleep with hareton and his petition was granted for once catherine stole out before break of day she dare not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm she visited the empty chambers and examined their windows and luckily lighting on her she got easily out of its lattice and on to the ground by means of the fir tree close by her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape notwithstanding his timid contrivances

 chapter 
 
 like most other young matrons meg began her married life with the determination to be a model housekeeper john should find home a paradise he should always see a smiling face should fare sumptuously every day and never know the loss of a button she brought so much love energy and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but succeed in spite of some obstacles her paradise was not a tranquil one for the little woman fussed was to please and bustled about like a true martha cumbered with many cares she was too tired sometimes even to smile john grew dyspeptic after a course of dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare as for buttons she soon learned to wonder where they went to shake her head over the carelessness of men and to threaten to make him sew them on himself and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better than hers 
 they were very happy even after they discovered that they live on love alone john did not find beauty diminished though she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot nor did meg miss any of the romance from the daily parting when her husband followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry shall i send some veal or mutton for dinner darling the little house ceased to be a glorified bower but it became a home and the young couple soon felt that it was a change for the better at first they played and frolicked over it like children then john took steadily to business feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders and meg laid by her cambric wrappers put on a big apron and fell to work as before said with more energy than discretion 
 while the cooking mania lasted she went through mrs receipt book as if it were a mathematical exercise working out the problems with patience and care sometimes her family were invited in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes or lotty would be privately dispatched with a batch of failures which were to be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little hummels an evening with john over the account books usually produced a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm and a frugal fit would ensue during which the poor man was put through a course of bread pudding hash and coffee which tried his soul although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude before the golden mean was found however meg added to her domestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without a family jar 
 fired a with housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with homemade preserves she undertook to put up her own currant jelly john was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra quantity of sugar for their own currants were ripe and were to be attended to at once as john firmly believed that my wife was equal to anything and took a natural pride in her skill he resolved that she should be gratified and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use home came four dozen delightful little pots half a barrel of sugar and a small boy to pick the currants for her with her pretty hair tucked into a little cap arms bared to the elbow and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib the young housewife fell to work feeling no doubts about her success for she seen hannah do it hundreds of times the array of pots rather amazed her at first but john was so fond of jelly and the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf that meg resolved to fill them all and spend a long day picking boiling straining and fussing over her jelly she did her best she asked advice of mrs cornelius she racked her brain to remember what hannah did that she left undone she reboiled resugared and restrained but that dreadful stuff jell 
 she longed to run home bib and all and ask mother to lend her a hand but john and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with their private worries experiments or quarrels they had laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one but they had held to their resolve and whenever they could get on without help they did so and no one interfered for mrs march had advised the plan so meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day and at five sat down in her kitchen wrung her bedaubed hands lifted up her voice and wept 
 now in the first flush of the new life she had often said my husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he likes i shall always be prepared there shall be no flurry no scolding no discomfort but a neat house a cheerful wife and a good dinner john dear never stop to ask my leave invite whom you please and be sure of a welcome from me 
 how charming that was to be sure john quite glowed with pride to hear her say it and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a superior wife but although they had had company from time to time it never happened to be unexpected and meg had never had an opportunity to distinguish herself till now it always happens so in this vale of tears there is an inevitability about such things which we can only wonder at deplore and bear as we best can 
 if john had not forgotten all about the jelly it really would have been unpardonable in him to choose that day of all the days in the year to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly congratulating himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute and indulging in pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would produce when his pretty wife came running out to meet him he escorted his friend to his mansion with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and husband 
 it is a world of disappointments as john discovered when he reached the dovecote the front door usually stood hospitably open now it was not only shut but locked and mud still adorned the steps the parlor windows were closed and curtained no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza in white with a distracting little bow in her hair or a hostess smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest nothing of the sort for not a soul appeared but a boy asleep under the current bushes 
 afraid something has happened step into the garden scott while i look up mrs brooke said john alarmed at the silence and solitude 
 round the house he hurried led by a pungent smell of burned sugar and mr scott strolled after him with a queer look on his face he paused discreetly at a distance when brooke disappeared but he could both see and hear and being a bachelor enjoyed the prospect mightily 
 in the kitchen reigned confusion and despair one edition of jelly was trickled from pot to pot another lay upon the floor and a third was burning gaily on the stove lotty with teutonic phlegm was calmly eating bread and currant wine for the jelly was still in a hopelessly liquid state while mrs brooke with her apron over her head sat sobbing dismally 
 my dearest girl what is the matter cried john rushing in with awful visions of scalded hands sudden news of affliction and secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden 
 oh john i am so tired and hot and cross and worried been at it till all worn out do come and help me or i shall die and the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word for her pinafore had been baptized at the same time as the floor 
 what worries you dear has anything dreadful happened asked the anxious john tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap which was all askew 
 yes sobbed meg despairingly 
 tell me quick then cry i can bear anything better than that out with it love jelly jell and i know what to do 
 john brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward and the derisive scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal which put the finishing stroke to poor woe 
 is that all fling it out of the window and bother any more about it buy you quarts if you want it but for sake have hysterics for brought jack scott home to dinner and 
 john got no further for meg cast him off and clasped her hands with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair exclaiming in a tone of mingled indignation reproach and dismay 
 a man to dinner and everything in a mess john brooke how could you do such a thing 
 hush in the garden i forgot the confounded jelly but it be helped now said john surveying the prospect with an anxious eye 
 you ought to have sent word or told me this morning and you ought to have remembered how busy i was continued meg petulantly for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled 
 i know it this morning and there was no time to send word for i met him on the way out i never thought of asking leave when you have always told me to do as i liked i never tried it before and hang me if i ever do again added john with an aggrieved air 
 i should hope not take him away at once i see him and there any dinner 
 well i like that the beef and vegetables i sent home and the pudding you promised cried john rushing to the larder 
 i time to cook anything i meant to dine at sorry but i was so busy and tears began again 
 john was a mild man but he was human and after a long work to come home tired hungry and hopeful to find a chaotic house an empty table and a cross wife was not exactly conductive to repose of mind or manner he restrained himself however and the little squall would have blown over but for one unlucky word 
 a scrape i acknowledge but if you will lend a hand pull through and have a good time yet cry dear but just exert yourself a bit and fix us up something to eat both as hungry as hunters so we mind what it is give us the cold meat and bread and cheese we ask for jelly 
 he meant it to be a joke but that one word sealed his fate meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke 
 you must get yourself out of the scrape as you can too used up to exert myself for anyone like a man to propose a bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company i have anything of the sort in my house take that scott up to and tell him away sick dead anything i see him and you two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like you have anything else here and having delivered her defiance all on one breath meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own room 
 what those two creatures did in her absence she never knew but mr scott was not taken up to and when meg descended after they had strolled away together she found traces of a promiscuous lunch which filled her with horror lotty reported that they had eaten a much and greatly laughed and the master bid her throw away all the sweet stuff and hide the pots 
 meg longed to go and tell mother but a sense of shame at her own short comings of loyalty to john who might be cruel but nobody should know it restrained her and after a summary cleaning up she dressed herself prettily and sat down to wait for john to come and be forgiven 
 unfortunately john come not seeing the matter in that light he had carried it off as a good joke with scott excused his little wife as well as he could and played the host so hospitably that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner and promised to come again but john was angry though he did not show it he felt that meg had deserted him in his hour of need it fair to tell a man to bring folks home any time with perfect freedom and when he took you at your word to flame up and blame him and leave him in the lurch to be laughed at or pitied no by george it and meg must know it 
 he had fumed inwardly during the feast but when the flurry was over and he strolled home after seeing scott off a milder mood came over him poor little thing it was hard upon her when she tried so heartily to please me she was wrong of course but then she was young i must be patient and teach her he hoped she had not gone hated gossip and interference for a minute he was ruffled again at the mere thought of it and then the fear that meg would cry herself sick softened his heart and sent him on at a quicker pace resolving to be calm and kind but firm quite firm and show her where she had failed in her duty to her spouse 
 meg likewise resolved to be calm and kind but firm and show him his duty she longed to run to meet him and beg pardon and be kissed and comforted as she was sure of being but of course she did nothing of the sort and when she saw john coming began to hum quite naturally as she rocked and sewed like a lady of leisure in her best parlor 
 john was a little disappointed not to find a tender niobe but feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology he made none only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly relevant remark we are going to have a new moon my dear 
 no objection was equally soothing remark a few other topics of general interest were introduced by mr brooke and by mrs brooke and conversation languished john went to one window unfolded his paper and wrapped himself in it figuratively speaking meg went to the other window and sewed as if new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life neither spoke both looked quite calm and firm and both felt desperately uncomfortable 
 oh dear thought meg married life is very trying and does need infinite patience as well as love as mother says the word mother suggested other maternal counsels given long ago and received with unbelieving protests 
 john is a good man but he has his faults and you must learn to see and bear with them remembering your own he is very decided but never will be obstinate if you reason kindly not oppose impatiently he is very accurate and particular about the good trait though you call him fussy never deceive him by look or word meg and he will give you the confidence you deserve the support you need he has a temper not like flash and then all the white still anger that is seldom stirred but once kindled is hard to quench be careful be very careful not to wake his anger against yourself for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect watch yourself be the first to ask pardon if you both err and guard against the little piques misunderstandings and hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret 
 
 these words came back to meg as she sat sewing in the sunset especially the last this was the first serious disagreement her own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind as she recalled them her own anger looked childish now and thoughts of poor john coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart she glanced at him with tears in her eyes but he did not see them she put down her work and got up thinking i will be the first to say forgive me but he did not seem to hear her she went very slowly across the room for pride was hard to swallow and stood by him but he did not turn his head for a minute she felt as if she really do it then came the thought this is the beginning do my part and have nothing to reproach myself with and stooping sown she softly kissed her husband on the forehead of course that settled it the penitent kiss was better than a world of words and john had her on his knee in a minute saying tenderly 
 it was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots forgive me dear i never will again 
 but he did oh bless you yes hundreds of times and so did meg both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made for family peace was preserved in that little family jar 
 after this meg had mr scott to dinner by special invitation and served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first course on which occasion she was so gay and gracious and made everything go off so charmingly that mr scott told john he was a lucky fellow and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all the way home 
 in the autumn new trials and experiences came to meg sallie moffat renewed her friendship was always running out for a dish of gossip at the little house or inviting that poor dear to come in and spend the day at the big house it was pleasant for in dull weather meg often felt lonely all were busy at home john absent till night and nothing to do but sew or read or potter about so it naturally fell out that meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend seeing pretty things made her long for such and pity herself because she had not got them sallie was very kind and often offered her the coveted trifles but meg declined them knowing that john like it and then this foolish little woman went and did what john disliked even worse 
 she knew her income and she loved to feel that he trusted her not only with his happiness but what some men seem to value money she knew where it was was free to take what she liked and all he asked was that she should keep account of every penny pay bills once a month and remember that she was a poor wife till now she had done well been prudent and exact kept her little account books neatly and showed them to him monthly without fear but that autumn the serpent got into paradise and tempted her like many a modern eve not with apples but with dress meg like to be pitied and made to feel poor it irritated her but she was ashamed to confess it and now and then she tried to console herself by buying something pretty so that sallie think she had to economize she always felt wicked after it for the pretty things were seldom necessaries but then they cost so little it worth worrying about so the trifles increased unconsciously and in the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive 
 but the trifles cost more than one would imagine and when she cast up her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her john was busy that month and left the bills to her the next month he was absent but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up and meg never forgot it a few days before she had done a dreadful thing and it weighed upon her conscience sallie had been buying silks and meg longed for a new one just a handsome light one for parties her black silk was so common and thin things for evening wear were only proper for girls aunt march usually gave the sisters a present of dollars apiece at new that was only a month to wait and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain and she had the money if she only dared to take it john always said what was his was hers but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective but another out of the household fund that was the question sallie had urged her to do it had offered to lend the money and with the best intentions in life had tempted meg beyond her strength in an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely shimmering folds and said a bargain i assure you she answered take it and it was cut off and paid for and sallie had exulted and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence and driven away feeling as if she had stolen something and the police were after her 
 when she got home she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by spreading forth the lovely silk but it looked less silvery now become her after all and the words fifty dollars seemed stamped like a pattern down each breadth she put it away but it haunted her not delightfully as a new dress should but dreadfully like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid when john got out his books that night heart sank and for the first time in her married life she was afraid of her husband the kind brown eyes looked as if they could be stern and though he was unusually merry she fancied he had found her out but mean to let her know it the house bills were all paid the books all in order john had praised her and was undoing the old pocketbook which they called the bank when meg knowing that it was quite empty stopped his hand saying nervously 
 you seen my private expense book yet 
 john never asked to see it but she always insisted on his doing so and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women wanted and made him guess what piping was demand fiercely the meaning of a or wonder how a little thing composed of three rosebuds a bit of velvet and a pair of strings could possibly be a bonnet and cost six dollars that night he looked as if he would like the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her extravagance as he often did being particularly proud of his prudent wife 
 the little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him meg got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of his tired forehead and standing there she said with her panic increasing with every word 
 john dear ashamed to show you my book for really been dreadfully extravagant lately i go about so much i must have things you know and sallie advised my getting it so i did and my new money will partly pay for it but i was sorry after i had done it for i knew think it wrong in me 
 john laughed and drew her round beside him saying goodhumoredly go and hide i beat you if you have got a pair of killing boots rather proud of my feet and mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots if they are good ones 
 that had been one of her last trifles and eye had fallen on it as he spoke oh what will he say when he comes to that awful fifty dollars thought meg with a shiver 
 worse than boots a silk dress she said with the calmness of desperation for she wanted the worst over 
 well dear what is the total as mr mantalini says 
 that sound like john and she knew he was looking up at her with the straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and answer with one as frank till now she turned the page and her head at the same time pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough without the fifty but which was appalling to her with that added for a minute the room was very still then john said she could feel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure 
 well i know that fifty is much for a dress with all the furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days 
 it made or trimmed sighed meg faintly for a sudden recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her 
 yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman but no doubt my wife will look as fine as ned when she gets it john dryly 
 i know you are angry john but i help it i mean to waste your money and i think those little things would count up so i resist them when i see sallie buying all she wants and pitying me because i i try to be contented but it is hard and tired of being poor 
 the last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them but he did and they wounded him deeply for he had denied himself many pleasures for sake she could have bitten her tongue out the minute she had said it for john pushed the books away and got up saying with a little quiver in his voice i was afraid of this i do my best meg if he had scolded her or even shaken her it would not have broken her heart like those few words she ran to him and held him close crying with repentant tears oh john my dear kind boy i mean it it was so wicked so untrue and ungrateful how could i say it oh how could i say it he was very kind forgave her readily and did not utter one reproach but meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be forgotten soon although he might never allude to it again she had promised to love him for better or worse and then she his wife had reproached him with his poverty after spending his earnings recklessly it was dreadful and the worst of it was john went on so quietly afterward just as if nothing had happened except that he stayed in town later and worked at night when she had gone to cry herself to sleep a week or remorse nearly made meg sick and the discovery that john had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat reduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold he had simply said in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change i afford it my dear 
 meg said no more but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with her face buried in the old greatcoat crying as if her heart would break 
 they had a long talk that night and meg learned to love her husband better for his poverty because it seemed to have made a man of him given him the strength and courage to fight his own way and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings and failures of those he loved 
 next day she put her pride in her pocket went to sallie told the truth and asked her to buy the silk as a favor the good natured mrs moffat willingly did so and had the delicacy not to make her a present of it immediately afterward then meg ordered home the greatcoat and when john arrived she put it on and asked him how he liked her new silk gown one can imagine what answer he made how he received his present and what a blissful state of things ensued john came home early meg gadded no more and that greatcoat was put on in the morning by a very happy husband and taken off at night by a most devoted little wife so the year rolled round and at midsummer there came to meg a new experience the deepest and tenderest of a life 
 laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the dovecote one saturday with an excited face and was received with the clash of cymbals for hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the other 
 the little mamma where is everybody why you tell me before i came home began laurie in a loud whisper 
 happy as a queen the dear every soul of em is upstairs a worshipin we want no hurrycanes round now you go into the parlor and send em down to you with which somewhat involved reply hannah vanished chuckling ecstatically 
 presently jo appeared proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon a large pillow face was very sober but her eyes twinkled and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort 
 shut your eyes and hold out your arms she said invitingly 
 laurie backed precipitately into a corner and put his hands behind him with an imploring gesture no thank you rather not i shall drop it or smash it as sure as fate 
 then you see your nevvy said jo decidedly turning as if to go 
 i will i will only you must be responsible for damages and obeying orders laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms a peal of laughter from jo amy mrs march hannah and john caused him to open them the next minute to find himself invested with two babies instead of one 
 no wonder they laughed for the expression of his face was droll enough to convulse a quaker as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that jo sat down on the floor and screamed 
 twins by jupiter was all he said for a minute then turning to the women with an appealing look that was comically piteous he added take em quick somebody going to laugh and i shall drop em 
 jo rescued his babies and marched up and down with one on each are as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending while laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks 
 the best joke of the season it i have told you for i set my heart on surprising you and i flatter myself done it said jo when she got her breath 
 i never was more staggered in my life it fun are they boys what are you going to name them have another look hold me up jo for upon my life one too many for me returned laurie regarding the infants with the air of a big benevolent newfoundland looking at a pair of infantile kittens 
 boy and girl they beauties said the proud papa beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels 
 most remarkable children i ever saw which is which and laurie bent like a to examine the prodigies 
 amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl french fashion so you can always tell besides one has blue eyes and one brown kiss them uncle teddy said wicked jo 
 afraid they like it began laurie with unusual timidity in such matters 
 of course they will they are used to it now do it this minute sir commanded jo fearing he might propose a proxy 
 laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each little cheek that produced another laugh and made the babies squeal 
 there i knew they like it the boy see him kick he hits out with his fists like a good one now then young brooke pitch into a man of your own size will you cried laurie delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist flapping aimlessly about 
 to be named john laurence and the girl margaret after mother and grandmother we shall call her daisey so as not to have two megs and i suppose the mannie will be jack unless we find a better name said amy with interest 
 name him demijohn and call him demi for short said laurie 
 daisy and demi just the thing i knew teddy would do it cried jo clapping her hands

lionfish nov chapter the madness of mr crouchcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry ron and hermione went up to the owlery after breakfast on sunday to send a letter to percy asking as sirius had suggested whether he had seen mr crouch lately they used hedwig because it had been so long since had a job when they had watched her fly out of sight through the owlery window they proceeded down to the kitchen to give dobby his new socks 
 
 the gave them a very cheery welcome bowing and curtsying and bustling around making tea again dobby was ecstatic about his present 
 
 harry potter is too good to dobby he squeaked wiping large tears out of his enormous eyes 
 
 you saved my life with that gillyweed dobby you really did said harry 
 
 no chance of more of those eclairs is there said ron who was looking around at the beaming and bowing 
 
 just had breakfast said hermione irritably but a great silver platter of eclairs was already zooming toward them supported by four elves 
 
 we should get some stuff to send up to snuffles harry muttered 
 
 good idea said ron give pig something to do you give us a bit of extra food could you he said to the surrounding elves and they bowed delightedly and hurried off to get some more 
 
 dobby winky said hermione who was looking around 
 
 winky is over there by the fire miss said dobby quietly his ears drooping slightly 
 
 oh dear said hermione as she spotted winky 
 
 harry looked over at the fireplace too winky was sitting on the same stool as last time but she had allowed herself to become so filthy that she was not immediately distinguishable from the brick behind her her clothes were ragged and unwashed she was clutching a bottle of butterbeer and swaying slightly on her stool staring into the fire as they watched her she gave an enormous hiccup 
 
 winky is getting through six bottles a day now dobby whispered to harry 
 
 well not strong that stuff harry said 
 
 but dobby shook his head tis strong for a sir he said 
 
 winky hiccuped again the elves who had brought the eclairs gave her disapproving looks as they returned to work 
 
 winky is pining harry potter dobby whispered sadly winky wants to go home winky still thinks mr crouch is her master sir and nothing dobby says will persuade her that professor dumbledore is her master now 
 
 hey winky said harry struck by a sudden inspiration walking over to her and bending down you know what mr crouch might be up to do you because stopped turning up to judge the triwizard tournament 
 
 eyes flickered her enormous pupils focused on harry she swayed slightly again and then said m master is stopped hic coming 
 
 yeah said harry we seen him since the first task the daily saying ill 
 
 winky swayed some more staring blurrily at harry 
 
 master hic ill 
 
 her bottom lip began to tremble 
 
 but not sure if true said hermione quickly 
 
 master is needing his hic winky whimpered the elf master cannot hic manage hic all by himself 
 
 other people manage to do their own housework you know winky hermione said severely 
 
 winky hic is not only hic doing housework for mr crouch winky squeaked indignantly swaying worse than ever and slopping butterbeer down her already heavily stained blouse master is hic trusting winky with hic the most important hic the most secret 
 
 what said harry 
 
 but winky shook her head very hard spilling more butterbeer down herself 
 
 winky keeps hic her secrets she said mutinously swaying very heavily now frowning up at harry with her eyes crossed you is hic nosing you is 
 
 winky must not talk like that to harry potter said dobby angrily harry potter is brave and noble and harry potter is not nosy 
 
 he is nosing hic into my hic private and secret hic winky is a good hic winky keeps her silence hic people trying to hic pry and poke hic 
 
 eyelids drooped and suddenly without warning she slid off her stool into the hearth snoring loudly the empty bottle of butterbeer rolled away across the floor half a dozen came hurrying forward looking disgusted one of them picked up the bottle the others covered winky with a large checked tablecloth and tucked the ends in neatly hiding her from view 
 
 we is sorry you had to see that sirs and miss squeaked a nearby elf shaking his head and looking very ashamed we is hoping you will not judge us all by winky sirs and miss 
 
 unhappy said hermione exasperated why you try and cheer her up instead of covering her up 
 
 begging your pardon miss said the bowing deeply again but has no right to be unhappy when there is work to be done and masters to be served 
 
 oh for heavens sake hermione cried listen to me all of you got just as much right as wizards to be unhappy got the right to wages and holidays and proper clothes you have to do everything told look at dobby 
 
 miss will please keep dobby out of this dobby mumbled looking scared the cheery smiles had vanished from the faces of the around the kitchen they were suddenly looking at hermione as though she were mad and dangerous 
 
 we has your extra food squeaked an elf at elbow and he shoved a large ham a dozen cakes and some fruit into arms 
 
 the crowded around harry ron and hermione and began shunting them out of the kitchen many little hands pushing in the smalls of their backs 
 
 thank you for the socks harry potter dobby called miserably from the hearth where he was standing next to the lumpy tablecloth that was winky 
 
 you keep your mouth shut could you hermione said ron angrily as the kitchen door slammed shut behind them they want us visiting them now we tried to get more stuff out of winky about crouch 
 
 oh as if you care about that scoffed hermione you only like coming down here for the food 
 
 it was an irritable sort of day after that harry got so tired of ron and hermione sniping at each other over their homework in the common room that he took food up to the owlery that evening on his own 
 
 pigwidgeon was much too small to carry an entire ham up to the mountain by himself so harry enlisted the help of two school screech owls as well when they had set off into the dusk looking extremely odd carrying the large package between them harry leaned on the windowsill looking out at the grounds at the dark rustling treetops of the forbidden forest and the rippling sails of the durmstrang ship an eagle owl flew through the coil of smoke rising from chimney it soared toward the castle around the owlery and out of sight looking down harry saw hagrid digging energetically in front of his cabin harry wondered what he was doing it looked as though he were making a new vegetable patch as he watched madame maxime emerged from the beauxbatons carriage and walked over to hagrid she appeared to be trying to engage him in conversation hagrid leaned upon his spade but did not seem keen to prolong their talk because madame maxime returned to the carriage shortly afterward 
 
 unwilling to go back to gryffindor tower and listen to ron and hermione snarling at each other harry watched hagrid digging until the darkness swallowed him and the owls around harry began to awake swooshing past him into the night 
 
 
 
 by breakfast the next day and bad moods had burnt out and to relief dark predictions that the would send substandard food up to the gryffindor table because hermione had insulted them proved false the bacon eggs and kippers were quite as good as usual 
 
 when the post owls arrived hermione looked up eagerly she seemed to be expecting something 
 
 percy had time to answer yet said ron we only sent hedwig yesterday 
 
 no not that said hermione taken out a subscription to the daily prophet getting sick of finding everything out from the slytherins 
 
 good thinking said harry also looking up at the owls hey hermione i think in luck 
 
 a gray owl was soaring down toward hermione 
 
 it got a newspaper though she said looking disappointed 
 
 but to her bewilderment the gray owl landed in front of her plate closely followed by four barn owls a brown owl and a tawny 
 
 how many subscriptions did you take out said harry seizing goblet before it was knocked over by the cluster of owls all of whom were jostling close to her trying to deliver their own letter first 
 
 what on earth hermione said taking the letter from the gray owl opening it and starting to read oh really she sputtered going rather red 
 
 up said ron 
 
 oh how ridiculous 
 
 she thrust the letter at harry who saw that it was not handwritten but composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut out of the daily prophet 
 
 you are a wicked girl harry potter deserves 
 better go back where you came from muggle 
 all like it said hermione desperately opening one letter after another harry potter can do much better than the likes of you you deserve to be boiled in frog spawn ouch 
 
 she had opened the last envelope and liquid smelling strongly of petrol gushed over her hands which began to erupt in large yellow boils 
 
 undiluted bubotuber pus said ron picking up the envelope gingerly and sniffing it 
 
 ow said hermione tears starting in her eyes as she tried to rub the pus off her hands with a napkin but her fingers were now so thickly covered in painful sores that it looked as though she were wearing a pair of thick knobbly gloves 
 
 better get up to the hospital wing said harry as the owls around hermione took flight tell professor sprout where gone 
 
 i warned her said ron as hermione hurried out of the great hall cradling her hands i warned her not to annoy rita skeeter look at this one he read out one of the letters hermione had left behind i read in witch weekly about how you are playing harry potter false and that boy has had enough hardship and i will be sending you a curse by next post as soon as i can find a big enough envelope blimey better watch out for herself 
 
 hermione turn up for herbology as harry and ron left the greenhouse for their care of magical creatures class they saw malfoy crabbe and goyle descending the stone steps of the castle pansy parkinson was whispering and giggling behind them with her gang of slytherin girls catching sight of harry pansy called potter have you split up with your girlfriend why was she so upset at breakfast 
 
 harry ignored her he want to give her the satisfaction of knowing how much trouble the witch weekly article had caused 
 
 hagrid who had told them last lesson that they had finished with unicorns was waiting for them outside his cabin with a fresh supply of open crates at his feet heart sank at the sight of the crates surely not another skrewt hatching but when he got near enough to see inside he found himself looking at a number of flurry black creatures with long snouts their front paws were curiously flat like spades and they were blinking up at the class looking politely puzzled at all the attention 
 
 nifflers said hagrid when the class had gathered around yeh find em down mines mostly they like sparkly yeh go look 
 
 one of the nifflers had suddenly leapt up and attempted to bite pansy watch off her wrist she shrieked and jumped backward 
 
 useful little treasure detectors said hagrid happily thought have some fun with em today see over there he pointed at the large patch of freshly turned earth harry had watched him digging from the owlery window buried some gold coins got a prize fer whoever picks the niffler that digs up most jus take off all yer valuables an choose a niffler an get ready ter set em loose 
 
 harry took off his watch which he was only wearing out of habit as it work anymore and stuffed it into his pocket then he picked up a niffler it put its long snout in ear and sniffed enthusiastically it was really quite cuddly 
 
 hang on said hagrid looking down into the crate a spare niffler missin hermione 
 
 she had to go to the hospital wing said ron 
 
 explain later harry muttered pansy parkinson was listening 
 
 it was easily the most fun they had ever had in care of magical creatures the nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water each scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their hands was particularly efficient it had soon filled his lap with coins 
 
 can you buy these as pets hagrid he asked excitedly as his niffler dived back into the soil splattering his robes 
 
 yer mum wouldn be happy ron said hagrid grinning they wreck houses nifflers i reckon nearly got the lot now he added pacing around the patch of earth while the nifflers continued to dive i buried a hundred coins oh there hermione 
 
 hermione was walking toward them across the lawn her hands were very heavily bandaged and she looked miserable pansy parkinson was watching her beadily 
 
 well check how done said hagrid count yer coins an no point tryin ter steal any goyle he added his eyes narrowed leprechaun gold vanishes after a few hours 
 
 goyle emptied his pockets looking extremely sulky it turned out that niffler had been most successful so hagrid gave him an enormous slab of chocolate for a prize the bell rang across the grounds for lunch the rest of the class set off back to the castle but harry ron and hermione stayed behind to help hagrid put the nifflers back in their boxes harry noticed madame maxime watching them out other carriage window 
 
 what yeh done ter your hands hermione said hagrid looking concerned 
 
 hermione told him about the hate mail she had received that morning and the envelope full of bubotuber pus 
 
 aaah don worry said hagrid gently looking down at her i got some o those letters an all after rita skeeter wrote abou me mum a monster an yeh should be put down yer mother killed innocent people an if you had any decency you d jump in a lake 
 
 no said hermione looking shocked 
 
 yeah said hagrid heaving the niffler crates over by his cabin wall jus nutters hermione don open em if yeh get any more chuck em straigh in the fire 
 
 you missed a really good lesson harry told hermione as they headed back toward the castle good nifflers they ron 
 
 ron however was frowning at the chocolate hagrid had given him he looked thoroughly put out about something 
 
 the matter said harry wrong flavor 
 
 no said ron shortly why you tell me about the gold 
 
 what gold said harry 
 
 the gold i gave you at the quidditch world cup said ron the leprechaun gold i gave you for my omnioculars in the top box why you tell me it disappeared 
 
 harry had to think for a moment before he realized what ron was talking about 
 
 oh he said the memory coming back to him at last i dunnoi never noticed it had gone i was more worried about my wand i 
 
 they climbed the steps into the entrance hall and went into the great hall for lunch 
 
 must be nice ron said abruptly when they had sat down and started serving themselves roast beef and yorkshire puddings to have so much money you notice if a pocketful of galleons goes missing 
 
 listen i had other stuff on my mind that night said harry impatiently we all did remember 
 
 i know leprechaun gold vanishes ron muttered i thought i was paying you back you given me that chudley cannon hat for christmas 
 
 forget it all right said harry 
 
 ron speared a roast potato on the end of his fork glaring at it then he said i hate being poor 
 
 harry and hermione looked at each other neither of them really knew what to say 
 
 rubbish said ron still glaring down at his potato i blame fred and george for trying to make some extra money wish i could wish i had a niffler 
 
 well we know what to get you next christmas said hermione brightly then when ron continued to look gloomy she said come on ron it could be worse at least your fingers full of pus hermione was having a lot of difficulty managing her knife and fork her fingers were so stiff and swollen i hate that skeeter woman she burst out savagely get her back for this if the last thing i do 
 
 
 
 hate mail continued to arrive for hermione over the following week and although she followed advice and stopped opening it several of her sent howlers which exploded at the gryffindor table and shrieked insults at her for the whole hall to hear even those people who read witch weekly knew all about the supposed triangle now harry was getting sick of telling people that hermione his girlfriend 
 
 die down though he told hermione if we just ignore got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time 
 
 i want to know how listening into private conversations when supposed to be banned from the grounds said hermione angrily 
 
 hermione hung back in their next defense against the dark arts lesson to ask professor moody something the rest of the class was very eager to leave moody had given them such a rigorous test of that many of them were nursing small injuries harry had such a bad case of twitchy ears he had to hold his hands clamped over them as he walked away from the class 
 
 well definitely not using an invisibility cloak hermione panted five minutes later catching up with harry and ron in the entrance hall and pulling hand away from one of his wiggling ears so that he could hear her moody says he see her anywhere near the judges table at the second task or anywhere near the lake 
 
 hermione is there any point in telling you to drop this said ron 
 
 no said hermione stubbornly i want to know how she heard me talking to viktor and how she found out about mum 
 
 maybe she had you bugged said harry 
 
 bugged said ron blankly whatput fleas on her or something 
 
 harry started explaining about hidden microphones and recording equipment ron was fascinated but hermione interrupted them 
 
 you two ever going to read hogwarts a history 
 
 the point said ron you know it by heart we can just ask you 
 
 all those substitutes for magic muggles use electricity computers and radar and all those things they all go haywire around hogwarts too much magic in the air no using magic to eavesdrop she must i could just find out what it isooh if illegal have her 
 
 we got enough to worry about ron asked her do we have to start a vendetta against rita skeeter as well 
 
 not asking you to help hermione snapped do it on my own 
 
 she marched back up the marble staircase without a backward glance harry was quite sure she was going to the library 
 
 the betting she comes back with a box of hate rita skeeter badges said ron 
 
 hermione however did not ask harry and ron to help her pursue vengeance against rita skeeter for which they were both grateful because their workload was mounting ever higher in the days before the easter holidays harry frankly marveled at the fact that hermione could research magical methods of eavesdropping as well as everything else they had to do he was working just to get through all their homework though he made a point of sending regular food packages up to the cave in the mountain for sirius after last summer harry had not forgotten what it felt like to be continually hungry he enclosed notes to sirius telling him that nothing out of the ordinary had happened and that they were still waiting for an answer from percy 
 
 hedwig return until the end of the easter holidays letter was enclosed in a package of easter eggs that mrs weasley had sent both and were the size of dragon eggs and full of homemade toffee however was smaller than a chicken egg her face fell when she saw it 
 
 your mum read witch weekly by any chance does she ron she asked quietly 
 
 yeah said ron whose mouth was full of toffee gets it for the recipes 
 
 hermione looked sadly at her tiny egg 
 
 you want to see what written harry asked her hastily 
 
 letter was short and irritated 
 
 as i am constantly telling the daily prophet mr crouch is taking a break he is sending in regular owls with instructions no i actually seen him but i think i can be trusted to know my own handwriting i have quite enough to do at the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors please bother me again unless something important happy easter 
 the start of the summer term would normally have meant that harry was training hard for the last quidditch match of the season this year however it was the third and final task in the triwizard tournament for which he needed to prepare but he still know what he would have to do finally in the last week of may professor mcgonagall held him back in transfiguration 
 
 you are to go down to the quidditch field tonight at nine potter she told him mr bagman will be there to tell the champions about the third task 
 
 so at half past eight that night harry left ron and hermione in gryffindor tower and went downstairs as he crossed the entrance hall cedric came up from the hufflepuff common room 
 
 what reckon going to be he asked harry as they went together down the stone steps out into the cloudy night fleur keeps going on about underground tunnels she reckons got to find treasure 
 
 that be too bad said harry thinking that he would simply ask hagrid for a niffler to do the job for him 
 
 they walked down the dark lawn to the quidditch stadium turned through a gap in the stands and walked out onto the field 
 
 they done to it cedric said indignantly stopping dead 
 
 the quidditch field was no longer smooth and flat it looked as though somebody had been building long low walls all over it that twisted and crisscrossed in every direction 
 
 hedges said harry bending to examine the nearest one 
 
 hello there called a cheery voice 
 
 ludo bagman was standing in the middle of the field with krum and fleur harry and cedric made their way toward them climbing over the hedges fleur beamed at harry as he came nearer her attitude toward him had changed completely since he had saved her sister from the lake 
 
 well what think said bagman happily as harry and cedric climbed over the last hedge growing nicely they give them a month and have them twenty feet high worry he added grinning spotting the expressions on and faces have your quidditch field back to normal once the task is over now i imagine you can guess what making here 
 
 no one spoke for a moment then 
 
 maze grunted krum 
 
 right said bagman a maze the third really very straightforward the triwizard cup will be placed in the center of the maze the first champion to touch it will receive full marks 
 
 we seemply ave to get through the maze said fleur 
 
 there will be obstacles said bagman happily bouncing on the balls of his feet hagrid is providing a number of creaturesthen there will be spells that must be brokenall that sort of thing you know now the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze bagman grinned at harry and cedric then mr krum will enterthen miss delacour but all be in with a fighting chance depending how well you get past the obstacles should be fun eh 
 
 harry who knew only too well the kind of creatures that hagrid was likely to provide for an event like this thought it was unlikely to be any fun at all however he nodded politely like the other champions 
 
 very wellif you got any questions go back up to the castle shall we a bit chilly 
 
 bagman hurried alongside harry as they began to wend their way out of the growing maze harry had the feeling that bagman was going to start offering to help him again but just then krum tapped harry on the shoulder 
 
 could i haff a vord 
 
 yeah all right said harry slightly surprised 
 
 vill you valk vith me 
 
 okay said harry curiously 
 
 bagman looked slightly perturbed 
 
 wait for you harry shall i 
 
 no okay mr bagman said harry suppressing a smile i think i can find the castle on my own thanks 
 
 harry and krum left the stadium together but krum did not set a course for the durmstrang ship instead he walked toward the forest 
 
 we going this way for said harry as they passed cabin and the illuminated beauxbatons carriage 
 
 vont to be overheard said krum shortly 
 
 when at last they had reached a quiet stretch of ground a short way from the beauxbatons horses paddock krum stopped in the shade of the trees and turned to face harry 
 
 i vant to know he said glowering vot there is between you and 
 
 harry who from secretive manner had expected something much more serious than this stared up at krum in amazement 
 
 nothing he said but krum glowered at him and harry somehow struck anew by how tall krum was elaborated friends not my girlfriend and she never has been just that skeeter woman making things up 
 
 talks about you very often said krum looking suspiciously at harry 
 
 yeah said harry because were friends 
 
 he quite believe he was having this conversation with viktor krum the famous international quidditch player it was as though the krum thought he harry was an equal a real rival 
 
 you haff neveryou haff not 
 
 no said harry very firmly 
 
 krum looked slightly happier he stared at harry for a few seconds then said you fly very veil i vos votching at the first task 
 
 thanks said harry grinning broadly and suddenly feeling much taller himself i saw you at the quidditch world cup the wronski feint you really 
 
 but something moved behind krum in the trees and harry who had some experience of the sort of thing that lurked in the forest instinctively grabbed arm and pulled him around 
 
 vot is it 
 
 harry shook his head staring at the place where seen movement he slipped his hand inside his robes reaching for his wand 
 
 suddenly a man staggered out from behind a tall oak for a moment harry recognize himthen he realized it was mr crouch 
 
 he looked as though he had been traveling for days the knees of his robes were ripped and bloody his face scratched he was unshaven and gray with exhaustion his neat hair and mustache were both in need of a wash and a trim his strange appearance however was nothing to the way he was behaving muttering and gesticulating mr crouch appeared to be talking to someone that he alone could see he reminded harry vividly of an old tramp he had seen once when out shopping with the dursleys that man too had been conversing wildly with thin air aunt petunia had seized hand and pulled him across the road to avoid him uncle vernon had then treated the family to a long rant about what he would like to do with beggars and vagrants 
 
 he a judge said krum staring at mr crouch he vith your ministry 
 
 harry nodded hesitated for a moment then walked slowly toward mr crouch who did not look at him but continued to talk to a nearby tree 
 
 and when done that weatherby send an owl to dumbledore confirming the number of durmstrang students who will be attending the tournament karkaroff has just sent word there will be twelve 
 
 mr crouch said harry cautiously 
 
 and then send another owl to madame maxime because she might want to up the number of students bringing now made it a round dozendo that weatherby will you will you will 
 
 mr eyes were bulging he stood staring at the tree muttering soundlessly at it then he staggered sideways and fell to his knees 
 
 mr crouch harry said loudly are you all right 
 
 eyes were rolling in his head harry looked around at krum who had followed him into the trees and was looking down at crouch in alarm 
 
 vot is wrong with him 
 
 no idea harry muttered listen better go and get someone 
 
 dumbledore gasped mr crouch he reached out and seized a handful of robes dragging him closer though his eyes were staring over head i needseedumbledore 
 
 okay said harry if you get up mr crouch we can go up to the 
 
 donestupidthing mr crouch breathed he looked utterly mad his eyes were rolling and bulging and a trickle of spittle was sliding down his chin every word he spoke seemed to cost him a terrible effort musttelldumbledore 
 
 get up mr crouch said harry loudly and clearly get up take you to dumbledore 
 
 mr eyes rolled forward onto harry 
 
 whoyou he whispered 
 
 a student at the school said harry looking around at krum for some help but krum was hanging back looking extremely nervous 
 
 nothis whispered crouch his mouth sagging 
 
 no said harry without the faintest idea what crouch was talking about 
 
 
 
 right said harry 
 
 crouch was pulling him closer harry tried to loosen grip on his robes but it was too powerful 
 
 warndumbledore 
 
 get dumbledore if you let go of me said harry just let go mr crouch and get him 
 
 thank you weatherby and when you have done that i would like a cup of tea my wife and son will be arriving shortly we are attending a concert tonight with mr and mrs fudge 
 
 crouch was now talking fluently to a tree again and seemed completely unaware that harry was there which surprised harry so much he notice that crouch had released him 
 
 yes my son has recently gained twelve most satisfactory yes thank you yes very proud indeed now if you could bring me that memo from the andorran minister of magic i think i will have time to draft a response 
 
 you stay here with him harry said to krum get dumbledore be quicker i know where his office is 
 
 he is mad said krum doubtfully staring down at crouch who was still gabbling to the tree apparently convinced it was percy 
 
 just stay with him said harry starting to get up but his movement seemed to trigger another abrupt change in mr crouch who seized him hard around the knees and pulled harry back to the ground 
 
 he whispered his eyes bulging again iescapedmust warnmust tellsee dumbledoremy faultall my faultberthadeadall my faultmy sonmy faulttell dumbledore harry potterthe dark lordstrongerharry potter 
 
 get dumbledore if you let me go mr crouch said harry he looked furiously around at krum help me will you 
 
 looking extremely apprehensive krum moved forward and squatted down next to mr crouch 
 
 just keep him here said harry pulling himself free of mr crouch be back with dumbledore 
 
 hurry you krum called after him as harry sprinted away from the forest and up through the dark grounds they were deserted bagman cedric and fleur had disappeared harry tore up the stone steps through the oak front doors and off up the marble staircase toward the second floor 
 
 five minutes later he was hurtling toward a stone gargoyle standing halfway along an empty corridor 
 
 sher sherbet lemon he panted at it 
 
 this was the password to the hidden staircase to office or at least it had been two years ago the password had evidently changed however for the stone gargoyle did not spring to life and jump aside but stood frozen glaring at harry malevolently 
 
 move harry shouted at it 
 
 but nothing at hogwarts had ever moved just because he shouted at it he knew it was no good he looked up and down the dark corridor perhaps dumbledore was in the staffroom he started running as fast as he could toward the staircase 
 
 potter 
 
 harry skidded to a halt and looked around snape had just emerged from the hidden staircase behind the stone gargoyle the wall was sliding shut behind him even as he beckoned harry back toward him 
 
 what are you doing here potter 
 
 i need to see professor dumbledore said harry running back up the corridor and skidding to a standstill in front of snape instead mr just turned in the asking 
 
 what is this rubbish said snape his black eyes glittering what are you talking about 
 
 mr crouch harry shouted from the ministry ill or something in the forest he wants to see dumbledore just give me the password up to 
 
 the headmaster is busy potter said snape his thin mouth curling into an unpleasant smile 
 
 got to tell dumbledore harry yelled 
 
 you hear me potter 
 
 harry could tell snape was thoroughly enjoying himself denying harry the thing he wanted when he was so panicky 
 
 look said harry angrily crouch right out of his mind he says he wants to warn 
 
 the stone wall behind snape slid open dumbledore was standing there wearing long green robes and a mildly curious expression is there a problem he said looking between harry and snape 
 
 professor harry said sidestepping snape before snape could speak mr crouch is here down in the forest he wants to speak to you 
 
 harry expected dumbledore to ask questions but to his relief dumbledore did nothing of the sort 
 
 lead the way he said promptly and he swept off along the corridor behind harry leaving snape standing next to the gargoyle and looking twice as ugly 
 
 what did mr crouch say harry said dumbledore as they walked swiftly down the marble staircase 
 
 said he wants to warn yousaid done something terriblehe mentioned his sonand bertha jorkinsand and voldemortsomething about voldemort getting stronger 
 
 indeed said dumbledore and he quickened his pace as they hurried out into the 
 
 not acting normally harry said hurrying along beside dumbledore he seem to know where he is he keeps talking like he thinks percy there and then he changes and says he needs to see left him with viktor krum 
 
 you did said dumbledore sharply and he began to take longer strides still so that harry was running to keep up do you know if anybody else saw mr crouch 
 
 no said harry krum and i were talking mr bagman had just finished telling us about the third task we stayed behind and then we saw mr crouch coming out of the forest 
 
 where are they said dumbledore as the beauxbatons carriage emerged from the darkness 
 
 over here said harry moving in front of dumbledore leading the way through the trees he hear voice anymore but he knew where he was going it been much past the beauxbatons carriagesomewhere around here 
 
 viktor harry shouted 
 
 no one answered 
 
 they were here harry said to dumbledore they were definitely somewhere around here 
 
 lumos dumbledore said lighting his wand and holding it up 
 
 its narrow beam traveled from black trunk to black trunk illuminating the ground and then it fell upon a pair of feet 
 
 harry and dumbledore hurried forward krum was sprawled on the forest floor he seemed to be unconscious there was no sign at all of mr crouch dumbledore bent over krum and gently lifted one of his eyelids 
 
 stunned he said softly his glasses glittered in the wandlight as he peered around at the surrounding trees 
 
 should i go and get someone said harry madam pomfrey 
 
 no said dumbledore swiftly stay here 
 
 he raised his wand into the air and pointed it in the direction of cabin harry saw something silvery dart out of it and streak away through the trees like a ghostly bird then dumbledore bent over krum again pointed his wand at him and muttered ennervate 
 
 krum opened his eyes he looked dazed when he saw dumbledore he tried to sit up but dumbledore put a hand on his shoulder and made him lie still 
 
 he attacked me krum muttered putting a hand up to his head the old madman attacked me i vos looking around to see vare potter had gone and he attacked from behind 
 
 lie still for a moment dumbledore said 
 
 the sound of thunderous footfalls reached them and hagrid came panting into sight with fang at his heels he was carrying his crossbow 
 
 professor dumbledore he said his eyes widening harry what the 
 
 hagrid i need you to fetch professor karkaroff said dumbledore his student has been attacked when done that kindly alert professor moody 
 
 no need dumbledore said a wheezy growl here 
 
 moody was limping toward them leaning on his staff his wand lit 
 
 damn leg he said furiously been here happened snape said something about crouch 
 
 crouch said hagrid blankly 
 
 karkaroff please hagrid said dumbledore sharply 
 
 oh yeahright professor said hagrid and he turned and disappeared into the dark trees fang trotting after him 
 
 i know where barty crouch is dumbledore told moody but it is essential that we find him 
 
 onto it growled moody and he pulled out his wand and limped off into the forest 
 
 neither dumbledore nor harry spoke again until they heard the unmistakable sounds of hagrid and fang returning karkaroff was hurrying along behind them he was wearing his sleek silver furs and he looked pale and agitated 
 
 what is this he cried when he saw krum on the ground and dumbledore and harry beside him going on 
 
 i vos attacked said krum sitting up now and rubbing his head mr crouch or votever his name 
 
 crouch attacked you crouch attacked you the triwizard judge 
 
 igor dumbledore began but karkaroff had drawn himself up clutching his furs around him looking livid 
 
 treachery he bellowed pointing at dumbledore it is a plot you and your ministry of magic have lured me here under false pretenses dumbledore this is not an equal competition first you sneak potter into the tournament though he is underage now one of your ministry friends attempts to put my champion out of action i smell and corruption in this whole affair and you dumbledore you with your talk of closer international wizarding links of rebuilding old ties of forgetting old differences what i think of you 
 
 karkaroff spat onto the ground at feet in one swift movement hagrid seized the front of furs lifted him into the air and slammed him against a nearby tree 
 
 apologize hagrid snarled as karkaroff gasped for breath massive fist at his throat his feet dangling in midair 
 
 hagrid no dumbledore shouted his eyes flashing 
 
 hagrid removed the hand pinning karkaroff to the tree and karkaroff slid all the way down the trunk and slumped in a huddle at its roots a few twigs and leaves showered down upon his head 
 
 kindly escort harry back up to the castle hagrid said dumbledore sharply 
 
 breathing heavily hagrid gave karkaroff a glowering look 
 
 maybe better stay here headmaster 
 
 you will take harry back to school hagrid dumbledore repeated firmly take him right up to gryffindor tower and harry i want you to stay there anything you might want to do any owls you might want to send they can wait until morning do you understand me 
 
 er yes said harry staring at him how had dumbledore known that at that very moment he had been thinking about sending pigwidgeon straight to sirius to tell him what had happened 
 
 leave fang with yeh headmaster hagrid said staring menacingly at karkaroff who was still sprawled at the foot of the tree tangled in furs and tree roots stay fang harry 
 
 they marched in silence past the beauxbatons carriage and up toward the castle 
 
 how dare he hagrid growled as they strode past the lake how dare he accuse dumbledore like do anythin like that like dumbledore wanted you in the tournament in the firs place worried i dunno when i seen dumbledore more worried than bin lately an you hagrid suddenly said angrily to harry who looked up at him taken aback what were yeh doin wanderin off with ruddy krum from durmstrang harry coulda jinxed yeh right there couldn he hasn moody taught yeh nothin magine lettin him lure yeh off on yer own 
 
 all right said harry as they climbed the steps into the entrance hall he trying to jinx me he just wanted to talk about hermione 
 
 be havin a few words with her an all said hagrid grimly stomping up the stairs the less you lot ave ter do with these foreigners the happier be yeh can trust any of em

 hagrid was in such a bad mood harry was quite glad to say to him in front of the fat lady he clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where ron and hermione were sitting to tell them what had happened 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter worst memorycontents prev chapter next chapter 
 by order of the ministry of magic 
 
 
 
 dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor has replaced 
 
 albus dumbledore as head of hogwarts school of 
 
 witchcraft and wizardry 
 
 
 
 the above is in accordance with educational decree number 
 
 
 
 signed cornelius oswald fudge minister for magic 
 
 the notices had gone up all around the school overnight but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that dumbledore had overcome two aurors the high inquisitor the minister for magic and his junior assistant to escape no matter where harry went within the castle the sole topic of conversation was flight and though some of the details may have gone awry in the retelling harry overheard one girl assuring another that fudge was now lying in st with a pumpkin for a head it was surprising how accurate the rest of their information was everybody knew for instance that harry and marietta were the only students to have witnessed the scene in office and as marietta was now in the hospital wing harry found himself besieged with requests to give a account 
 
 dumbledore will be back before long said ernie macmillan confidently on the way back from herbology after listening intently to story they keep him away in our second year and they be able to this time the fat friar told me he dropped his voice conspiratorially so that harry ron and hermione had to lean closer to him to hear that umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after searched the castle and grounds for him get past the gargoyle the office has sealed itself against her ernie smirked apparently she had a right little tantrum 
 
 oh i expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the office said hermione viciously as they walked up the stone steps into the entrance hall lording it over all the other teachers the stupid old 
 
 now do you really want to finish that sentence granger 
 
 draco malfoy had slid out from behind the door closely followed by crabbe and goyle his pale pointed face was alight w th malice 
 
 afraid going to have to dock a few points from gryffincor and hufflepuff he drawled 
 
 only teachers who can dock points from houses malfoy said ernie at once 
 
 yeah prefects too remember snarled ron 
 
 i know prefects dock points weasel king sneered maltby crabbe and goyle sniggered but members of the inquisitorial squad 
 
 the what said hermione sharply 
 
 the inquisitorial squad granger said malfoy pointing towards a tiny silver i on his robes just beneath his badge a select group of students who are supportive of the ministry of magic by professor umbridge anyway members of the inquisitorial squad do have the power to dock points so granger have five from you for being rude about our new headmistress macmillan five for contradicting me five because i like you potter weasley your untucked so have another five for that oh yeah i forgot a mudblood granger so ten off for that 
 
 ron pulled out his wand but hermione pushed it away whispering 
 
 wise move granger breathed malfoy new head new times be good now potty weasel king 
 
 laughing heartily he strode away with crabbe and goyle 
 
 he was bluffing said ernie looking appalled he be allowed to dock points that would be ridiculous it would completely undermine the prefect system 
 
 but harry ron and hermione had turned automatically towards the giant set in niches along the wall behind them which recorded the gryffindor and ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead that morning even as they watched stones flew upwards reducing the amounts in the lower bulbs in fact the only glass that seemed unchanged was the one of slytherin 
 
 noticed have you said voice 
 
 he and george had just come down the marble staircase and joined harry ron hermione and ernie in front of the 
 
 malfoy just docked us all about fifty points said harry furiously as they watched several more stones fly upwards from the gryffindor 
 
 yeah montague tried to do us during break said george 
 
 what do you mean tried said ron quickly 
 
 he never managed to get all the words out said fred due to the fact that we forced him into that vanishing cabinet on the first floor 
 
 hermione looked very shocked 
 
 but get into terrible trouble 
 
 not until montague reappears and that could take weeks i dunno where we sent him said fred coolly anyway decided we care about getting into trouble any more 
 
 have you ever asked hermione 
 
 course we have said george never been expelled have we 
 
 always known where to draw the line said fred 
 
 we might have put a toe across it occasionally said george 
 
 but always stopped short of causing real mayhem said fred 
 
 but now said ron tentatively 
 
 well now said george 
 
 what with dumbledore gone said fred 
 
 we reckon a bit of mayhem said george 
 
 is exactly what our dear new head deserves said fred 
 
 you whispered hermione you really love a reason to expel you 
 
 you get it hermione do you said fred smiling at her we care about staying any more walk out right now if we determined to do our bit for dumbledore first so anyway he checked his watch phase one is about to begin get in the great hall for lunch if i were you that way the teachers will see you have had anything to do with it 
 
 anything to do with what said hermione anxiously 
 
 see said george run along now 
 
 fred and george turned away and disappeared into the swelling crowd descending the stairs towards lunch looking highly disconcerted ernie muttered something about unfinished transfiguration homework and scurried away 
 
 i think we should get out of here you know said hermione nervously just in case 
 
 yeah all right said ron and the three of them moved towards the doors to the great hall but harry had barely glimpsed the ceiling of scudding white clouds when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and turning he found himself almost with filch the caretaker he took several hasty steps backwards filch was best viewed at a distance 
 
 the headmistress would like to see you potter he leered 
 
 i do it said harry stupidly thinking of whatever fred and george were planning jowls wobbled with silent laughter 
 
 guilty conscience eh he wheezed follow me 
 
 harry glanced back at ron and hermione who were both looking worried he shrugged and followed filch back into the entrance hall against the tide of hungry students 
 
 filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood he hummed creakily under his breath as they climbed the marble staircase as they reached the first landing he said things are changing around here potter 
 
 noticed said harry coldly 
 
 yerse been telling dumbledore for years and years too soft with you all said filch chuckling nastily you filthy little beasts would never have dropped stink pellets if known i had it in my power to whip you raw would you now nobody would have thought of throwing fanged frisbees down the corridors if i strung you up by the ankles in my office would they but when educational decree number comes in potter be allowed to do them things and asked the minister to sign an order for the expulsion of peeves oh things are going to be very different around here with her in charge 
 
 umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get filch on her side harry thought and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon his knowledge of the secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to that of the weasley twins 
 
 here we are he said leering down at harry as he rapped three times on professor door and pushed it open the potter boy to see you 
 
 office so very familiar to harry from his many detentions was the same as usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letters spelled the word headmistress also his firebolt and fred and cleansweeps which he saw with a pang were chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk 
 
 umbridge was sitting behind the desk busily scribbling on some of her pink parchment but she looked up and smiled widely at their entrance 
 
 thank you argus she said sweetly 
 
 not at all not at all said filch bowing as low as his rheumatism would permit and exiting backwards 
 
 sit said umbridge curtly pointing towards a chair harry sat she continued to scribble for a few moments he watched some of the foul kittens gambolling around the plates over her head wondering what fresh horror she had in store for him 
 
 well now she said finally setting down her quill and surveying him complacently like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly what would you like to drink 
 
 what said harry quite sure he had misheard her 
 
 to drink mr potter she said smiling still more widely tea coffee pumpkin juice 
 
 as she named each drink she gave her short wand a wave and a cup or glass of it appeared on her desk 
 
 nothing thank you said harry 
 
 i wish you to have a drink with me she said her voice becoming dangerously sweet choose one 
 
 fine tea then said harry shrugging 
 
 she got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her back to him she then bustled around the desk with it smiling in a sinisterly sweet fashion 
 
 there she said handing it to him drink it before it gets cold you well now mr potter i thought we ought to have a little chat after the distressing events of last night 
 
 he said nothing she settled herself back into her seat and waited when several long moments had passed in silence she said gaily not drinking up 
 
 he raised the cup to his lips and then just as suddenly lowered it one of the horrible painted kittens behind umbridge had great round blue eyes just like magical one and it had just occurred to harry what would say if he ever heard that harry had drunk anything offered by a known enemy 
 
 the matter said umbridge who was still watching him closely do you want sugar 
 
 no said harry 
 
 he raised the cup to his lips again and pretended to take a sip though keeping his mouth tightly closed smile widened 
 
 good she whispered very good now then she leaned forwards a little where is albus dumbledore 
 
 no idea said harry promptly 
 
 drink up drink up she said still smiling now mr potter let us not play childish games i know that you know where he has gone you and dumbledore have been in this together from the beginning consider your position mr potter 
 
 i know where he is harry repeated 
 
 he pretended to drink again she was watching him very closely 
 
 very well she said though she looked displeased in that case you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of sirius black 
 
 stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that it rattled in its saucer he tilted the cup to his mouth with his lips pressed together so that some of the hot liquid trickled down on to his robes 
 
 i know he said a little too quickly 
 
 mr potter said umbridge let me remind you that it was i who almost caught the criminal black in the gryffindor fire in october i know perfectly well it was you he was meeting and if i had had any proof neither of you would be at large today i promise you i repeat mr potter where is sirius black 
 
 no idea said harry loudly got a clue 
 
 they stared at each other so long that harry felt his eyes watering then umbridge stood up 
 
 very well potter i will take your word for it this time but be warned the might of the ministry stands behind me all channels of communication in and out of this school are being monitored a floo network regulator is keeping watch over every fire in hogwartsexcept my own of course my inquisitorial squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle and mr filch is observing all secret passages in and out of the castle if i find a shred of evidence 
 
 boom 
 
 the very floor of the office shook umbridge slipped sideways clutching her desk for support and looking shocked 
 
 what was 
 
 she was gazing towards the door harry took the opportunity to empty his cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flowers he could hear people running and screaming several floors below 
 
 back to lunch you go potter cried umbridge raising her wand and dashing out of the office harry gave her a few seconds start then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar was 
 
 it was not difficult to find one floor down pandemonium reigned somebody and harry had a very shrewd idea who had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted fireworks 
 
 dragons comprised entirely of green and gold sparks were soaring up and down the corridors emitting loud fiery blasts and bangs as they went catherine wheels five feet in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucers rockets with long tails of brilliant silver stars were ricocheting off the walls sparklers were writing swear words in midair of their own accord firecrackers were exploding like mines everywhere harry looked and instead of burning themselves out fading from sight or fizzling to a halt these pyrotechnical miracles seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched 
 
 filch and umbridge were standing apparently transfixed in horror halfway down the stairs as harry watched one of the larger catherine wheels seemed to decide that what it needed was more room to manoeuvre it whirled towards umbridge and filch with a sinister wheeeeeeeeee they both yelled with fright and ducked and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the grounds meanwhile several of the dragons and a large purple bat that was smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape towards the second floor 
 
 hurry filch hurry shrieked umbridge be all over the school unless we do somethingstupefy 
 
 a jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rockets instead of freezing in midair it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a witch in the middle of a meadow she ran for it just in time reappearing seconds later squashed into the next painting where a couple of wizards playing cards stood up hastily to make room for her 
 
 stun them filch shouted umbridge angrily for all the world as though it had been his incantation 
 
 right you are headmistress wheezed filch who as a squib could no more have stunned the fireworks than swallowed them he dashed to a nearby cupboard pulled out a broom and began swatting at the fireworks in midair within seconds the head of the broom was ablaze 
 
 harry had seen enough laughing he ducked down low ran to a door he knew was concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped through it to find fred and george hiding just behind it listening to umbridge and yells and quaking with suppressed mirth 
 
 impressive harry said quietly grinning very impressive put dr filibuster out of business no problem 
 
 cheers whispered george wiping tears of laughter from his face oh i hope she tries vanishing them next they multiply by ten every time you try 
 
 the fireworks continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon though they caused plenty of disruption particularly the firecrackers the other teachers seem to mind them very much 
 
 dear dear said professor mcgonagall sardonically as one of the dragons soared around her classroom emitting loud bangs and exhaling flame miss brown would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom 
 
 the upshot of it all was that professor umbridge spent her first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her when the final bell rang and they were heading back to gryffindor tower with their bags harry saw with immense satisfaction a dishevelled and umbridge tottering from professor classroom 
 
 thank you so much professor said professor flitwick in his squeaky little voice i could have got rid of the sparklers myself of course but i sure whether or not i had the authority 
 
 beaming he closed his classroom door in her snarling face 
 
 fred and george were heroes that night in the gryffindor common room even hermione fought her way through the excited crowd to congratulate them 
 
 they were wonderful fireworks she said admiringly 
 
 thanks said george looking both surprised and pleased weasleys wildfire only thing is we used our whole stock going to have to start again from scratch now 
 
 it was worth it though said fred who was taking orders from clamouring gryffindors if you want to add your name to the waiting list hermione five galleons for your basic blaze box and twenty for the deflagration deluxe 
 
 hermione returned to the table where harry and ron were sitting staring at their schoolbags as though hoping their homework would spring out and start doing itself 
 
 oh why we have a night off said hermione brightly as a weasley rocket zoomed past the window after all the easter holidays start on friday have plenty of time then 
 
 are you feeling all right ron asked staring at her in disbelief 
 
 now you mention it said hermione happily know i think feeling a bit rebellious 
 
 harry could still hear the distant bangs of escaped firecrackers when he and ron went up to bed an hour later and as he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower still resolutely spelling out the word poo 
 
 he got into bed yawning with his glasses off the occasional firework passing the window had become blurred looking like sparkling clouds beautiful and mysterious against the black sky he turned on to his side wondering how umbridge was feeling about her first day in job and how fudge would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption smiling to himself harry closed his eyes 
 
 the whizzes and bangs of escaped fireworks in the grounds seemed to be growing more distant or perhaps he was simply speeding away from them 
 
 he had fallen right into the corridor leading to the department of mysteries he was speeding towards the plain black door let it open let it open 
 
 it did he was inside the circular room lined with doors he crossed it placed his hand on an identical door and it swung inwards 
 
 now he was in a long rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking there were dancing flecks of light on the walls but he did not pause to investigate he had to go on 
 
 there was a door at the far end it too opened at his touch 
 
 and now he was in a dimly lit room as high and wide as a church full of nothing but rows and rows of towering shelves each laden with small dusty spheres now heart was beating fast with excitement he knew where to go he ran forwards but his footsteps made no noise in the enormous deserted room 
 
 there was something in this room he wanted very very much 
 
 something he wanted or somebody else wanted 
 
 his scar was hurting 
 
 bang 
 
 harry awoke instantly confused and angry the dark dormitory was full of the sound of laughter 
 
 cool said seamus who was silhouetted against the window i think one of those catherine wheels hit a rocket and like they mated come and see 
 
 harry heard ron and dean scramble out of bed for a better look he lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him he felt as though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment he had got so close that time 
 
 glittering pink and silver winged piglets were now soaring past the windows of gryffindor tower harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoops of gryffindors in the dormitories below them his stomach gave a sickening jolt as he remembered that he had occlumency the following evening 
 
 harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what snape was going to say if he found out how much further into the department of mysteries harry had penetrated during his last dream with a surge of guilt he realised that he had not practised occlumency once since their last lesson there had been too much going on since dumbledore had left he was sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried he doubted however whether snape would accept that excuse 
 
 he attempted a little practice during classes that day but it was no good hermione kept asking him what was wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and after all the best moment to empty his brain was not while teachers were firing revision questions at the class 
 
 resigned to the worst he set off for office after dinner halfway across the entrance hall however cho came hurrying up to him 
 
 over here said harry glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with snape and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall where the giant stood was now almost empty are you ok umbridge been asking you about the da has she 
 
 oh no said cho hurriedly no it was only well i just wanted to say harry i never dreamed marietta would tell 
 
 yeah well said harry moodily he did feel cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully it was small consolation that the last he had heard marietta was still up in the hospital wing and madam pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimples 
 
 a lovely person really said cho she just made a mistake 
 
 harry looked at her incredulously 
 
 a lovely person who made a sold us all out including you 
 
 well we all got away we said cho pleadingly you know her mum works for the ministry really difficult for her 
 
 dad works for the ministry too harry said furiously and in case you noticed he got sneak written across his face 
 
 that was a really horrible trick of hermione said cho fiercely she should have told us jinxed that list 
 
 i think it was a brilliant idea said harry coldly cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter 
 
 oh yes i forgot of course if it was darling hermiones idea 
 
 start crying again said harry warningly 
 
 i going to she shouted 
 
 yeah well good he said got enough to cope with at the moment 
 
 go and cope with it then cho said furiously turning on her heel and stalking off 
 
 fuming harry descended the stairs to dungeon and though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more things he should have said to cho about marietta before reaching the dungeon door 
 
 late potter said snape coldly as harry closed the door behind him 
 
 snape was standing with his back to harry removing as usual certain of his thoughts and placing them carefully in pensieve he dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face harry 
 
 so he said have you been practising 
 
 yes harry lied looking carefully at one of the legs of desk 
 
 well soon find out we said snape smoothly wand out potter 
 
 harry moved into his usual position facing snape with the desk between them his heart was pumping last with anger at cho and anxiety about how much snape was about to extract from his mind 
 
 on the count of three then said snape lazily onetwo 
 
 office door banged open and draco malfoy sped in 
 
 professor snape sirohsorry 
 
 malfoy was looking at snape and harry in some surprise 
 
 all right draco said snape lowering his wand potter is here for a little remedial potions 
 
 harry had not seen malfoy look so gleeful since umbridge had turned up to inspect hagrid 
 
 i know he said leering at harry who knew his face was burning he would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at malfoyor even better to hit him with a good curse 
 
 well draco what is it asked snape 
 
 professor umbridge sirshe needs your help said malfoy 
 
 found montague sir turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor 
 
 how did he get in there demanded snape 
 
 i know sir a bit confused 
 
 very well very well potter said snape we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening 
 
 he turned and swept from his office malfoy mouthed remedial potions at harry behind back before following him 
 
 seething harry replaced his wand inside his robes and made to leave the room at least he had more hours in which to practise he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape though it was hard that it came at the expense of malfoy telling the whole school that he needed remedial potions 
 
 he was at the office door when he saw it a patch of shivering light dancing on the doorframe he stopped and stood looking at it reminded of something then he remembered it was a little like the lights he had seen in his dream last night the lights in the second room he had walked through on his journey through the department of mysteries 
 
 he turned around the light was coming from the pensieve sitting on desk the contents were ebbing and swirling within thoughts things he did not want harry to see if he broke through defences accidentally 
 
 harry gazed at the pensieve curiosity welling inside him what was it that snape was so keen to hide from harry 
 
 the silvery lights shivered on the wall harry took two steps towards the desk thinking hard could it possibly be information about the department of mysteries that snape was determined to keep from him 
 
 harry looked over his shoulder his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever how long would it take snape to release montague from the toilet would he come straight back to his office afterwards or accompany montague to the hospital wing surely the latter montague was captain of the slytherin quidditch team snape would want to make sure he was all right 
 
 harry walked the remaining few feet to the pensieve and stood over it gazing into its depths he hesitated listening then pulled out his wand again the office and the corridor beyond were completely silent he gave the contents of the pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand 
 
 the silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast harry leaned forwards over it and saw that it had become transparent he was once again looking down into a room as though through a circular window in the ceiling in fact unless he was much mistaken he was looking down into the great hall 
 
 his breath was actually fogging the surface of thoughts his brain seemed to be in limbo it would be insane to do the thing he was so strongly tempted to do he was trembling snape could be back at any moment but harry thought of anger of jeering face and a reckless daring seized him 
 
 he took a great gulp of breath and plunged his face into the surface of thoughts at once the floor of the office lurched tipping harry into the pensieve 
 
 he was falling through cold blackness spinning furiously as he went and then 
 
 he was standing in the middle of the great hall but the four house tables were gone instead there were more than a hundred smaller tables all facing the same way at each of which sat a student head bent low scribbling on a roll of parchment the only sound was the scratching of quills and the occasional rustle as somebody adjusted their parchment it was clearly exam time 
 
 sunshine was streaming through the high windows on to the bent heads which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light harry looked around carefully snape had to be here somewhere this was his memory 
 
 and there he was at a table right behind harry harry stared had a stringy pallid look about him like a plant kept in the dark his hair was lank and greasy and was flopping on to the table his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment as he scribbled harry moved around behind snape and read the heading of the examination paper defence against the dark artsordinary wizarding level 
 
 so snape had to be fifteen or sixteen around own age his hand was flying across the parchment he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbours and yet his writing was minuscule and cramped 
 
 five more minutes 
 
 the voice made harry jump turning he saw the top of professor head moving between the desks a short distance away professor flitwick was walking past a boy with untidy black hair very untidy black hair 
 
 harry moved so quickly that had he been solid he would have knocked desks flying instead he seemed to slide dreamlike across two aisles and up a third the back of the head drew nearer and he was straightening up now putting down his quill pulling his roll of parchment towards him so as to reread what he had written 
 
 harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his father 
 
 excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes eyes were hazel his nose was slightly longer than and there was no scar on his forehead but they had the same thin face same mouth same eyebrows hair stuck up at the back exactly as did his hands could have been and harry could tell that when james stood up they would be within an inch of each other in height 
 
 james yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair making it even messier than it had been then with a glance towards professor flitwick he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seats behind him 
 
 with another shock of excitement harry saw sirius give james the sirius was lounging in his chair at his ease tilting it back on two legs he was very his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither nor could ever have achieved and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully though he seem to have noticed and two seats along from this stomach gave another pleasurable squirm was remus lupin he looked rather pale and peaky was the full moon approaching and was absorbed in the exam as he reread his answers he scratched his chin with the end of his quill frowning slightly 
 
 so that meant wormtail had to be around here somewhere too and sure enough harry spotted him within seconds a small boy with a pointed nose wormtail looked anxious he was chewing his fingernails staring down at his paper scuffing the ground with his toes every now and then he glanced hopefully at his paper harry stared at wormtail for a moment then back at james who was now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment he had drawn a snitch and was now tracing the letters what did they stand for 
 
 quills down please squeaked professor flitwick that means you too stebbins please remain seated while i collect your parchment accio 
 
 over a hundred rolls of parchment zoomed into the air and into professor outstretched arms knocking him backwards off his feet several people laughed a couple of students at the front desks got up took hold of professor flitwick beneath the elbows and lifted him back on to his feet 
 
 thank you thank you panted professor flitwick very well everybody free to go 
 
 harry looked down at his father who had hastily crossed out the he had been embellishing jumped to his feet stuffed his quill and the exam paper into his bag which he slung over his back and stood waiting for sirius to join him 
 
 harry looked around and glimpsed snape a short way away moving between the tables towards the doors to the entrance hall still absorbed in his own exam paper yet angular he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider and his oily hair was jumping about his face 
 
 a gang of chattering girls separated snape from james sirius and lupin and by planting himself in their midst harry managed to keep snape in sight while straining his ears to catch the voices of james and his friends 
 
 did you like question ten moony asked sirius as they emerged into the entrance hall 
 
 loved it said lupin briskly give five signs that identify the question 
 
 think you managed to get all the signs said james in tones of mock concern 
 
 think i did said lupin seriously as they joined the crowd thronging around the front doors eager to get out into the sunlit grounds one sitting on my chair two wearing my clothes three his remus lupin 
 
 wormtail was the only one who laugh 
 
 i got the snout shape the pupils of the eyes and the tufted tail he said anxiously but i think what else 
 
 how thick are you wormtail said james impatiently you run round with a werewolf once a month 
 
 keep your voice down implored lupin 
 
 harry looked anxiously behind him again snape remained close by still buried in his exam questionsbut this was memory and harry was sure that if snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the grounds he harry would not be able to follow james any further to his intense relief however when james and his three friends strode off down the lawn towards the lake snape followed still poring over the exam paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he was going by keeping a little ahead of him harry managed to maintain a close watch on james and the others 
 
 well i thought that paper was a piece of cake he heard sirius say be surprised if i get outstanding on it at least 
 
 me too said james he put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling golden snitch 
 
 you get that 
 
 nicked it said james casually he started playing with the snitch allowing it to fly as much as a foot away before seizing it again his reflexes were excellent wormtail watched him in awe 
 
 they stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where harry ron and hermione had once spent a sunday finishing their homework and threw themselves down on the grass harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw to his delight that snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bushes he was as deeply immersed in the owl paper as ever which left harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bushes and watch the foursome under the tree the sunlight was dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake on the bank of which the group of laughing girls who had just left the great hall were sitting with their shoes and socks off cooling their feet in the water 
 
 lupin had pulled out a book and was reading sirius stared around at the students milling over the grass looking rather haughty and bored but very handsomely so james was still playing with the snitch letting it zoom further and further away almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second wormtail was watching him with his mouth open every time james made a particularly difficult catch wormtail gasped and applauded after five minutes of this harry wondered why james tell wormtail to get a grip on himself but james seemed to be enjoying the attention harry noticed that his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair as though to keep it from getting too tidy and he also kept looking over at the girls by the edge 
 
 put that away will you said sirius finally as james made a fine catch and wormtail let out a cheer before wormtail wets himself with excitement 
 
 wormtail turned slightly pink but james grinned 
 
 if it bothers you he said stuffing the snitch back in his pocket harry had the distinct impression that sirius was the only one for whom james would have stopped showing off 
 
 bored said sirius wish it was full moon 
 
 you might said lupin darkly from behind his book still got transfiguration if bored you could test me here and he held out his book 
 
 but sirius snorted i need to look at that rubbish i know it all 
 
 liven you up padfoot said james quietly look who it is head turned he became very still like a dog that has scented a rabbit 
 
 excellent he said softly snivellus 
 
 harry turned to see what sirius was looking at 
 
 snape was on his feet again and was stowing the owl paper in his bag as he left the shadows of the bushes and set off across the grass sirius and james stood up 
 
 lupin and wormtail remained sitting lupin was still staring down at his book though his eyes were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrows wormtail was looking from sirius and james to snape with a look of avid anticipation on his face 
 
 all right snivellus said james loudly 
 
 snape reacted so fast it was as though he had been expecting an attack dropping his bag he plunged his hand inside his robes and his wand was halfway into the air when james shouted expelliarmus 
 
 wand flew twelve feet into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him sirius let out a bark of laughter 
 
 impedimenta he said pointing his wand at snape who was knocked off his feet halfway through a dive towards his own fallen wand 
 
 students all around had turned to watch some of them had got to their feet and were edging nearer some looked apprehensive others entertained 
 
 snape lay panting on the ground james and sirius advanced on him wands raised james glancing over his shoulder at the girls at the edge as he went wormtail was on his feet now watching hungrily edging around lupin to get a clearer view 
 
 the exam go snivelly said james 
 
 i was watching him his nose was touching the parchment said sirius viciously be great grease marks all over it they be able to read a word 
 
 several people watching laughed snape was clearly unpopular wormtail sniggered shrilly snape was trying to get up but the jinx was still operating on him he was struggling as though bound by invisible ropes 
 
 youwait he panted staring up at james with an expression of purest loathing you wait 
 
 wait for what said sirius coolly you going to do snivelly wipe your nose on us 
 
 snape let out a stream of mixed swear words and hexes but with his wand ten feet away nothing happened 
 
 wash out your mouth said james coldly scourgify 
 
 pink soap bubbles streamed from mouth at once the froth was covering his lips making him gag choking him 
 
 leave him alone 
 
 james and sirius looked round free hand immediately jumped to his hair 
 
 it was one of the girls from the lake edge she had thick dark red hair that fell to her shoulders and startlingly green eyes 
 
 mother 
 
 all right evans said james and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant deeper more mature 
 
 leave him alone lily repeated she was looking at james with every sign of great dislike he done to you 
 
 well said james appearing to deliberate the point more the fact that he exists if you know what i mean 
 
 many of the surrounding students laughed sirius and wormtail included but lupin still apparently intent on his book and nor did lily 
 
 you think funny she said coldly but just an arrogant bullying toerag potter leave him alone 
 
 i will if you go out with me evans said james quickly go on go out with me and never lay a wand on old snivelly again 
 
 behind him the impediment jinx was wearing off snape was beginning to inch towards his fallen wand spitting out soapsuds as he crawled 
 
 i go out with you if it was a choice between you and the giant squid said lily 
 
 bad luck prongs said sirius briskly and turned back to snape oi 
 
 but too late snape had directed his wand straight at james there was a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of face spattering his robes with blood james whirled about a second flash of light later snape was hanging in the air his robes falling over his head to reveal skinny pallid legs and a pair of greying underpants 
 
 many people in the small crowd cheered sirius james and wormtail roared with laughter 
 
 lily whose furious expression had twitched for an instant as though she was going to smile said let him down 
 
 certainly said james and he jerked his wand upwards snape fell into a crumpled heap on the ground disentangling himself from his robes he got quickly to his feet wand up but sirius said petrificus totalus and snape keeled over again rigid as a board 
 
 leave him alone lily shouted she had her own wand out now james and sirius eyed it warily 
 
 ah evans make me hex you said james earnestly 
 
 take the curse off him then 
 
 james sighed deeply then turned to snape and muttered the 
 
 there you go he said as snape struggled to his feet lucky evans was here snivellus 
 
 i need help from filthy little mudbloods like her 
 
 lily blinked 
 
 fine she said coolly i bother in future and wash your pants if i were you snivellus 
 
 apologise to evans james roared at snape his wand pointed threateningly at him 
 
 i want you to make him apologise lily shouted rounding on james as bad as he is 
 
 what yelped james never call you 
 
 messing up your hair because you think it looks cool to look like just got off your broomstick showing off with that stupid snitch walking down corridors and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it you make me sick 
 
 she turned on her heel and hurried away 
 
 evans james shouted after her hey evans 
 
 but she look back 
 
 what is it with her said james trying and failing to look as though this was a throwaway question of no real importance to him 
 
 reading between the lines say she thinks a bit conceited mate said sirius 
 
 right said james who looked furious now right 
 
 there was another flash of light and snape was once again hanging in the air 
 
 who wants to see me take off pants 
 
 but whether james really did take off pants harry never found out a hand had closed tight over his upper arm closed with a grip wincing harry looked round to see who had hold of him and saw with a thrill of horror a fully grown snape standing right beside him white with rage 
 
 having fun 
 
 harry felt himself rising into the air the day evaporated around him he was floating upwards through icy blackness hand still tight upon his upper arm then with a swooping feeling as though he had turned in midair his feet hit the stone floor of dungeon and he was standing again beside the pensieve on desk in the shadowy potion study 
 
 so said snape gripping arm so tightly hand was starting to feel numb so been enjoying yourself potter 
 
 said harry trying to free his arm 
 
 it was scary lips were shaking his face was white his teeth were bared 
 
 amusing man your father he said snape shaking harry so hard his glasses slipped down his nose 
 
 
 
 snape threw harry from him with all his might harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor 
 
 you will not repeat what you saw to anybody snape bellowed 
 
 no said harry getting to his feet as far from snape as he could no of course i w 
 
 get out get out i want to see you in this office ever again 
 
 and as harry hurtled towards the door a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head he wrenched the door open and hew along the corridor stopping only when he had put three floors between himself and snape there he leaned against the wall panting and rubbing his bruised arm 
 
 he had no desire at all to return to gryffindor tower so early nor to tell ron and hermione what he had just seen what was making harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers knew exactly how snape had felt as his father had taunted him and that judging from what he had just seen his father had been every bit as arrogant as snape had always told him

lionfish nov chapter flight of the princecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry felt as though he too were hurtling through space it had not happened it could not have happened 
 
 out of here quickly said snape 
 
 he seized malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest greyback and the squat brother and sister followed the latter both panting excitedly as they vanished through the door harry realized he could move again what was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic but horror and shock he threw the invisibility cloak aside as the death eater last to leave the tower top was disappearing through the door 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 the death eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground rigid as a waxwork but he had barely hit the floor when harry was clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase 
 
 terror tore at heart he had to get to dumbledore and he had to catch snape somehow the two things were linked he could reverse what had happened if he had them both together dumbledore could not have died 
 
 he leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed his wand raised the dimly lit corridor was full of dust half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in and a battle was raging before him but even as he attempted to make out who were fighting whom he heard the hated voice shout over time to go and saw snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor he and malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed as harry plunged after them one of the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him it was the werewolf fenrir he was on top of harry before harry could raise his wand harry fell backward with filthy matted hair in his face the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth hot greedy breath at his throat 
 
 petrificus totalus 
 
 harry felt greyback collapse against him with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him he ducked and ran headfirst into the fight his feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled there were two bodies lying there lying facedown in a pool of blood but there was no time to investigate harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy death eater amycus who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodged them amycus was giggling enjoying the sport cruciocrucioyou dance forever pretty 
 
 impedimenta yelled harry 
 
 his jinx hit amycus in the chest he gave a piglike squeal of pain was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall slid down it and fell out of sight behind ron professor mcgonagall and lupin each of whom was battling a separate death eater beyond them harry saw tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in all directions so that they ricocheted off the walls around them cracking stone shattering the nearest window 
 
 harry where did you come from ginny cried but there was no time to answer her he put his head down and sprinted forward narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head showering them all in bits of wall snape must not escape he must catch up with snape 
 
 take that shouted professor mcgonagall and harry glimpsed the female death eater alecto sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head her brother right behind her he launched himself after them but his foot caught on something and next moment he was lying across legs looking around he saw pale round face flat against the floor 
 
 neville are you 
 
 right muttered neville who was clutching his stomach harry snape n malfoy ran past 
 
 i know on it said harry aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond death eater who was causing most of the chaos the man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face he wheeled around staggered and then pounded away after the brother and sister harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor ignoring the bangs issuing from behind him the yells of the others to come back and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know 
 
 he skidded around the corner his trainers slippery with blood snape had an immense head start was it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the room of requirement or had the order made steps to secure it to prevent the death eaters retreating that way he could hear nothing but his own pounding feet his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing death eaters was heading toward the front doorsperhaps the room of requirement was indeed blocked 
 
 he skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded he saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at them but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing who ran screeching into neighboring paintings as he leapt the wreckage of armor harry heard more shouts and screams other people within the castle seemed to have awoken 
 
 he pelted toward a shortcut hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on snape and malfoy who must surely have reached the grounds by now remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and hufflepuffs stood 
 
 harry we heard a noise and someone said something about the dark mark began ernie macmillan 
 
 out of the way yelled harry knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase the oak front doors had been blasted open there were smears of blood on the flagstones and several terrified students stood huddled against the walls one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces the giant gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse and the rubies within were still falling with a loud rattle onto the flagstones below 
 
 harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds he could just make out three figures racing across the lawn heading for the gates beyond which they could disapparateby the looks of them the huge blond death eater and some way ahead of him snape and malfoy 
 
 the cold night air ripped at lungs as he tore after them he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry he did not know what it was but continued to run not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse 
 
 another flash shouts retaliatory jets of light and harry understood hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the death eaters escaping and though every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said not hagrid not hagrid too 
 
 something caught harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward his face smacking the ground blood pouring out of both nostrils he knew even as he rolled over his wand ready that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him 
 
 impedimenta he yelled as he rolled over again crouching close to the dark ground and miraculously his jinx hit one of them who stumbled and fell tripping up the other harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after snape 
 
 and now he saw the vast outline of hagrid illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds the blond death eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper but immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him snape and malfoy however were still running they would soon be beyond the gates able to disapparate 
 
 harry tore past hagrid and his opponent took aim at back and yelled stupefy 
 
 he missed the jet of red light soared past head snape shouted run draco and turned twenty yards apart he and harry looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously 
 
 cruc 
 
 but snape parried the curse knocking harry backward off his feet before he could complete it harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge death eater behind him yelled incendio harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them house was on fire 
 
 in there yer evil hagrid bellowed 
 
 cruc yelled harry for the second time aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight but snape blocked the spell again harry could see him sneering 
 
 no unforgivable curses from you potter he shouted over the rushing of the flames yells and the wild yelping of the trapped fang you got the nerve or the ability 
 
 roared but snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm 
 
 fight back harry screamed at him fight back you cowardly 
 
 coward did you call me potter shouted snape your father would never attack me unless it was four on one what would you call him i wonder 
 
 stupe 
 
 blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed potter sneered snape deflecting the curse once more now come he shouted at the huge death eater behind harry it is time to be gone before the ministry turns up 
 
 impedi 
 
 but before he could finish this jinx excruciating pain hit harry he keeled over in the grass someone was screaming he would surely die of this agony snape was going to torture him to death or madness 
 
 no roared voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as it had started harry lay curled on the dark grass clutching his wand and panting somewhere overhead snape was shouting have you forgotten our orders potter belongs to the dark lordwe are to leave him go go 
 
 and harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous death eater obeyed running toward the gates harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage in that instant he cared not whether he lived or died pushing himself to his feet again he staggered blindly toward snape the man he now hated as much as he hated voldemort himself 
 
 sectum 
 
 snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again but harry was mere feet away now and he could see face clearly at last he was no longer sneering or jeering the blazing flames showed a face full of rage mustering all his powers of concentration harry thought levi 
 
 no potter screamed snape there was a loud bang and harry was soaring backward hitting the ground hard again and this time his wand flew out of his hand he could hear hagrid yelling and fang howling as snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay wandless and defenseless as dumbledore had been pale face illuminated by the flaming cabin was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed dumbledore 
 
 you dare use my own spells against me potter it was i who invented themi the prince and turn my inventions on me like your filthy father would you i think so no 
 
 harry had dived for his wand snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the darkness and out of sight 
 
 kill me then panted harry who felt no fear at all but only rage and contempt kill me like you killed him you coward 
 
 screamed snape and his face was suddenly demented inhuman as though he was in as much pain as the yelping howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them call me coward 
 
 and he slashed at the air harry felt a whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars buckbeak had flown at snape who staggered backward as the claws slashed at him as harry raised himself into a sitting position his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground he saw snape running as hard as he could the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as harry had never heard him screech 
 
 harry struggled to his feet looking around groggily for his wand hoping to give chase again but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass discarding twigs he knew it would be too late and sure enough by the time he had located his wand he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates snape had managed to disapparate just beyond the boundaries 
 
 hagrid muttered harry still dazed looking around hagrid 
 
 he stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames carrying fang on his back with a cry of thankfulness harry sank to his knees he was shaking in every limb his body ached all over and his breath came in painful stabs 
 
 yeh all righ harry yeh all righ speak ter me harry 
 
 huge hairy face was swimming above harry blocking out the stars harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair he put out a hand and felt reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him 
 
 all right panted harry are you 
 
 course i am take that ter finish me 
 
 hagrid put his hands under arms and raised him up with such force that feet momentarily left the ground before hagrid set him upright again he could see blood trickling down cheek from a deep cut under one eye which was swelling rapidly 
 
 we should put out your house said harry the aguamenti 
 
 knew it was summat like that mumbled hagrid and he raised a smoldering pink flowery umbrella and said aguamenti 
 
 a jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip harry raised his wand arm which felt like lead and murmured aguamenti too together he and hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished 
 
 s not too bad said hagrid hopefully a few minutes later looking at the smoking wreck nothin dumbledore won be able to put right 
 
 harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name in the silence and the stillness horror rose inside him 
 
 hagrid 
 
 i was bindin up a couple o bowtruckle legs when i heard em coming said hagrid sadly still staring at his wrecked cabin bin burnt ter twigs poor little things 
 
 hagrid 
 
 but what happened harry i jus saw them death eaters runnin down from the castle but what the ruddy hell was snape doin with em he gonewas he chasin them 
 
 he harry cleared his throat it was dry from panic and the smoke hagrid he killed 
 
 killed said hagrid loudly staring down at harry snape killed yeh on abou harry 
 
 dumbledore said harry snape killed dumbledore 
 
 hagrid simply looked at him the little of his face that could be seen completely blank uncomprehending 
 
 dumbledore what harry 
 
 dead snape killed him 
 
 don say that said hagrid roughly snape kill dumbledoredon be stupid harry made yeh say tha 
 
 i saw it happen 
 
 yeh couldn have 
 
 i saw it hagrid 
 
 hagrid shook his head his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic and harry knew that hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head that he was confused perhaps by the of a jinx 
 
 what musta happened was dumbledore musta told snape ter go with them death eaters hagrid said confidently i suppose gotta keep his cover look get yeh back up ter the school come on harry 
 
 harry did not attempt to argue or explain he was still shaking uncontrollably hagrid would find out soon enough too soon as they directed their steps back toward the castle harry saw that many of its windows were lit now he could imagine clearly the scenes inside as people moved from room to room telling each other that death eaters had got in that the mark was shining over hogwarts that somebody must have been killed 
 
 the oak front doors stood open ahead of them light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn slowly uncertainly people were creeping down the steps looking around nervously for some sign of the death eaters who had fled into the night eyes however were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower he imagined that he could see a black huddled mass lying in the grass there though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought body must lie however he saw people beginning to move toward it 
 
 they all lookin at said hagrid as he and harry approached the castle front fang keeping as close as he could to their ankles that lyin on the grass hagrid added sharply heading now toward the foot of the astronomy tower where a small crowd was congregating see it harry right at the foot of the tower under where the mark blimey yeh don think someone got thrown 
 
 hagrid fell silent the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud harry walked alongside him feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour had hit him though in an oddly detached way as though somebody near him was suffering them what was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feeling in his chest 
 
 he and hagrid moved dreamlike through the murmuring crowd to the very front where the dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap 
 
 harry heard moan of pain and shock but he did not stop he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him 
 
 harry had known there was no hope from the moment that the full curse dumbledore had placed upon him lifted known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead but there was still no preparation for seeing him here broken the greatest wizard harry had ever or would ever meet 
 
 eyes were closed but for the strange angle of his arms and legs he might have been sleeping harry reached out straightened the spectacles upon the crooked nose and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth that never again would dumbledore speak to him never again could he help 
 
 the crowd murmured behind harry after what seemed like a long time he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down 
 
 the locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of pocket it had opened perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground and although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already harry knew as he picked it up that there was something wrong 
 
 he turned the locket over in his hands this was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the pensieve nor were there any markings upon it no sign of the ornate s that was supposed to be mark moreover there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been 
 
 automatically without really thinking about what he was doing harry pulled out the fragment of parchment opened it and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him 
 
 to the dark lord 
 
 i know i will be dead long before you read this but i want you to know that it was i who dicovered your secret i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as i can 
 
 i face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more 
 
 
 
 harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant only one thing mattered this was not a horcrux dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing harry crumpled the parchment in his hand and his eyes burned with tears as behind him fang began to howl

 harrys feet touched the road he saw the achingly familiar hogsmeade high street dark shop fronts and the mist line of black mountains beyond the village and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward hogwarts and light spilling from the windows of the three broomsticks and with a lurch of the hear he remembered with piercing accuracy how he had landed here nearly a year before supporting a desperately weak dumbledore all this in a second upon landing c and then even as he relaxed his grip upon rons and hermiones arms it happened 
 
 the air was rent by a scream that sounded like voldemorts when he had realized the cup had been stolen it tore at every nerve in harrys body and he knew that their appearance had caused it 
 
 even as he looked at the other two beneath the cloak the door of the three broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded death eaters dashed into the streets their wands aloft 
 
 harry seized rons wrist as he raised his wand there were too many of them to run even attempting it would have give away their position one of the death eaters raised his wand and the scream stopped still echoing around the distant mountains 
 
 accio cloak roared one of the death eaters harry seized his folds but it made no attempt to escape the summoning charm had not worked on it 
 
 not under your wrapper then potter yelled the death eater who had tried the charm and then to his fellows spread now hes here 
 
 six of the death eaters ran toward them harry ron and hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street and the death eaters missed them by inches they waited in the darkness listening to the footsteps running up and down beams of light flying along the street from the death eaters searching wands 
 
 lets just leave hermione whispered disapparate now 
 
 great idea said ron but before harry could reply a death eater shouted we know you are here potter and theres no getting away well find you 
 
 they were ready for us whispered harry they set up that spell to tell them wed come i reckon theyve done something to keep us here trap us c 
 
 what about dementors called another death eater letem have free rein theyd find him quick enough 
 
 the dark lord wants potter dead by no hands but his c 
 
 an dementors wont kill him the dark lord wants potters life nor his soul hell be easier to kill if hes been kissed first 
 
 there were noises of agreement dread filled harry to repel dementors they would have to produce patronuses which would give them away immediately 
 
 were going to have to try to disapparate harry hermione whispered 
 
 even as she said it he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars which vanished in the pitch blackness he felt hermione take hold of his arm and together they turned on the spot 
 
 the air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid they could not disapparate the death eaters had cast their charms well the cold was biting deeper and deeper into harrys flesh he ron and hermione retreated down the side street groping their way along the wall trying not to make a sound then around the corner gliding noiselessly came dementors ten or more of them visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands could they sense fear in the vicinity harry was sure of it they seemed to be coming more quickly now taking those dragging rattling breaths he detested tasting despair in the air closing in he raised his wand he could not would not suffer the dementors kiss whatever happened afterward it was of ron and hermione that he thought as he whispered expecto patronum 
 
 the silver stag burst from his wand and charged the dementors scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight 
 
 its him down there down there i saw his patronus it was a stag 
 
 the dementors have retreated the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the death eaters were becoming louder but before harry in his panic could decide what to do there was a grinding of bolts nearby a door opened on the of the narrow street and a rough voice said potter in here quick 
 
 he obeyed without hesitation the three of them hurried through the open doorway 
 
 upstairs keep the cloak on keep quiet muttered a tall figure passing them on his way into the street and slammed the door behind him 
 
 harry had had no idea where they were but now he saw by the stuttering light of a single candle the grubby sawdust bar of the hogs head inn they ran behind the counter and through a second doorway which led to a trickery wooden staircase that they climbed as fast as they could the stairs opened into a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant sweetness 
 
 shouts reached from the streets below still wearing the invisibility cloak on they hurried toward the grimy window and looked down their savior whom harry now recognized as the hogs heads barman was the only person not wearing a hood 
 
 so what he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces so what you send dementors down my street ill send a patronus back atem im not havingem near me ive told you that im not having it 
 
 that wasnt your patronus said a death eater that was a stag it was potters 
 
 stag roared the barman and he pulled out a wand stag you idiot c expecto patronum 
 
 something huge and horned erupted from the wand head down it charged toward the high street and out of sight 
 
 thats not what i saw said the death eater though was less certainly curfews been broken you heard the noise one of his companions told the barman someone was out on the streets against regulations c 
 
 if i want to put my cat out i will and be damned to your curfew 
 
 you set off the caterwauling charm 
 
 what if i did going to cart me off to azkaban kill me for sticking my nose out my own front door do it then if you want to but i hope for your sakes you havent pressed your little dark marks and summoned him hes not going to like being called here for me and my old cat is he now 
 
 dont worry about us said one of the death eaters worry about yourself breaking curfew 
 
 and where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pubs closed down what will happen to your little sidelines then 
 
 are you threatening c 
 
 i keep my mouth shut its why you come here isnt it 
 
 i still say i saw a stag patronus shouted the first death eater 
 
 stag roared the barman its a goat idiot 
 
 all right we made a mistake said the second death eater break curfew again and we wont be so lenient 
 
 the death eaters strode back towards the high street hermione moaned with relief wove out from under the cloak and sat down on a chair harry drew the curtains then pulled the cloak off himself and ron they could hear the barman down below rebolting the door of the bar then climbing the stairs 
 
 harrys attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece a small rectangular mirror propped on top of it right beneath the portrait of the girl 
 
 the barman entered the room 
 
 you bloody fools he said gruffly looking from one to the other of them what were you thinking coming here 
 
 thank you said harry you cant thank you enough you saved our lives 
 
 the barman grunted harry approached him looking up into the face trying to see past the long stringy hair beard he wore spectacles behind the dirty lenses the eyes were a piercing brilliant blue 
 
 its your eye ive been seeing in the mirror 
 
 there was a silence in the room harry and the barman looked at each other 
 
 you sent dobby 
 
 the barman nodded and looked around for the elf 
 
 thought hed be with you whereve you left him 
 
 hes dead said harry bellatrix lestrange killed him 
 
 the barman face was impassive after a few moments he said im sorry to hear it i liked that elf 
 
 he turned away lightning lamps with prods of his wand not looking at any of them 
 
 youre aberforth said harry to the mans back 
 
 he neither confirmed or denied it but bent to light the fire 
 
 how did you get this harry asked walking across to siriuss mirror the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before 
 
 bought it from dung bout a year ago said aberforth albus told me what it was been trying to keep an eye out for you 
 
 ron gasped 
 
 the silver doe he said excitedly was that you too 
 
 what are you talking about asked aberforth 
 
 someone sent a doe patronus to us 
 
 brains like that you could be a death eater son havent i just prove my patronus is a goat 
 
 oh said ron yeah well im hungry he added defensively as his stomach gave an enormous rumble 
 
 i got food said aberforth and he sloped out of the room reappearing moments later with a large loaf of bread some cheese and a pewter jug of mead which he set upon a small table in front of the fire 
 
 ravenous they ate and drank and for a while there was sound of chewing 
 
 right then said aberforth when the had eaten their fill and harry and ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs we need to think of the best way to get you out of here cant be done by night you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness caterwauling charms set off theyll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs i dont reckon ill be able to pass of a stag as a goat a second time wait for daybreak when curfew lifts then you can put your cloak back on and set out on foot get right out of hogsmeade up into the mountains and youll be able to disapparate there might see hagrid hes been hiding in a cave up there with grawp ever since they tried to arrest him 
 
 were not leaving said harry we need to get into hogwarts 
 
 dont be stupid boy said aberforth 
 
 weve got to said harry 
 
 what youve got to do said aberforth leaning forward is to get as far from here as from here as you can 
 
 you dont understand there isnt much time weve got to get into the castle dumbledore c i mean your brother c wanted us c 
 
 the firelight made the grimy lenses of aberforths glasses momentarily opaque a bright flat white and harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider aragog 
 
 my brother albus wanted a lot of things said aberforth and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans you get away from this school potter and out of the country if you can forget my brother and his clever schemes hes gone where none of this can hurt him and you dont owe him anything 
 
 you dont understand said harry again 
 
 oh dont i said aberforth quietly you dont think i understood my own brother think you know albus better than i did 
 
 i didnt mean that said harry whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine its he left me a job 
 
 did he now said aberforth nice job i hope pleasant easy sort of thing youd expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves 
 
 ron gave a rather grim laugh hermione was looking strained 
 
 not easy no said harry but ive got to c 
 
 got to why got to hes dead isnt he said aberforth roughly let it go boy before you follow him save yourself 
 
 i cant 
 
 why not 
 
 i c harry felt overwhelmed he could not explain so he took the offensive instead but youre fighting too youre in the order of the phoenix c 
 
 i was said aberforth the order of the phoenix is finished won its over and anyone whos pretending differents kidding themselves itll never be safe for you here potter he wants you too badly so go abroad go into hiding save yourself best take these two with you he jerked a thumb at ron and hermione 
 
 theyll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows theyve been working with you 
 
 i cant leave said harry ive got a job c 
 
 give it to someone else 
 
 i cant its got to be me dumbledore explained it all c 
 
 oh did he now and did he tell you everything was he honest with you 
 
 harry wanted him with all his heart to say yes but somehow the simple word would not rise to his lips aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking 
 
 i knew my brother potter he learned secrecy at our mothers knee secrets and lies thats how we grew up and albus he was a natural 
 
 the old mans eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the mantelpiece it was now harry looked around properly the only picture in the room there was no photograph of albus dumbledore nor of anyone else 
 
 mr dumbledore said hermione rather timidly is that your sister ariana 
 
 yes said aberforth tersely been reading rita skeeter have you missy 
 
 even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that hermione had turned red 
 
 elphias doge mentioned her to us said harry trying to spare hermione 
 
 that old berk muttered aberforth taking another swig of mead thought the sun shone out of my brothers every ocrifice he did well so did plenty of people you three included by the looks of it 
 
 harry kept quiet he did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about dumbledore that had riddled him for months now he had made his choice while he dug dobbys grave he had decided to continue along the winding dangerous path indicated for him by albus dumbledore to accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know but simply to trust he had no desire to doubt again he did not want o hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose he met aberforths gaze which was so strikingly like his brothers the bright blue eyes gave the same impression that they were the object of their scrutiny and harry thought that aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it 
 
 professor dumbledore cared about harry very much said hermione in a low voice 
 
 did he now said aberforth funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state than if hed left em well alone 
 
 what do you mean asked hermione breathlessly 
 
 never you mind said aberforth 
 
 but thats a really serious thing to say said hermione are you c are you talking about your sister 
 
 aberforth glared at her his lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back then he burst into speech 
 
 when my sister was six years old she was attacked by three muggle boys theyd seen her doing magic spying through the back garden hedge she was a kid she couldnt control it no witch or wizard can at that age what they saw scared them i expect they forced their way through the hedge and when she couldnt show them the trick they got a bit carried away trying to stop the little freak doing it 
 
 hermiones eyes were huge in the firelight ron looked slightly sick aberforth stood up tall as albus and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain 
 
 it destroyed her what they did she was never right again she wouldnt use magic but she couldnt get rid of it it turned inward and drove her mad it exploded out of her when she couldnt control it and at times she was strange and dangerous but mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless 
 
 and my father went after the bastards that did it said aberforth and attacked them and they locked him up in azkaban for it he never said why hed done it because the ministry had known what ariana had become shed have been locked up in st mungos for good theyd have seen her as a serious threat to the international statute of secrecy unbalanced like she was with magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldnt keep it in any longer 
 
 we had to keep her safe and quiet we moved house put it about she was ill and my mother looked after her and tried to keep her calm and happy 
 
 i was her favourite he said and as he said it a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through aberforths wrinkles and wrangled beard not albus he was always up in his bedroom when he was home reading his books and counting his prizes keeping up with his correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day 
 
 aberforth succored he didnt want to be bothered with her she liked me best i could get her to eat when she wouldnt do it for my mother i could calm her down when she was in one of her rages and when she was quiet she used to help me feed the goats 
 
 then when she was fourteen see i wasnt there said aberforth if id been there i could have calmed her down she had one of her rages and my mother wasnt as young as she was and it was an accident ariana couldnt control it but my mother was killed 
 
 harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion he did not want to hear any more but aberforth kept talking and harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this whether in fact he had ever spoken about it 
 
 so that put paid to albuss trip round the world with little doge the pair of em came home for my mothers funeral and then doge went off on his own and albus settled down as head of the family ha 
 
 aberforth spat into the fire 
 
 id have looked after her i told him so i didnt care about school id have stayed home and done it 
 
 he told me i had to finish my education and hed take over from my mother bit of a comedown for mr brilliant theres no prizes for looking after your sister stopping her blowing up the house every other day but he did all right for a few weeks till he came 
 
 and now a positively dangerous look crept over aberforths face 
 
 grindelwald and at last my brother had an equal to talk to someone just as bright and talented he was and looking after ariana took a backseat then while they were hatching all their plans for a new wizarding order and looking for hallows and whatever else it was they were so interested in grand plans for the benefit of all wizardkind and if one young girl neglected what did that matter when albus was working for the greater good 
 
 but after a few weeks of it id had enough i had it was nearly time for me to go hack to hogwarts so i told em both of em like i am to you now and aberforth looked downward harry and it took a little imagination to see him as a teenager wiry and angry confronting his elder brother i told him youd better give it up now you cant move her shes in no fit state you cant take her with you wherever it is youre planning to go when youre making your clever speeches trying to whip yourselves up a following he didnt like that said aberforth and his eyes were briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses of his glasses they turned white and blind again grindelwald didnt like that at all he got angry he told me what a stupid little boy i was trying to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother didnt i understand my poor sister wouldnt have to be hidden once theyd changed the world and led the wizards out of hiding and taught the muggles their place 
 
 and there was an argument and i pulled my wand and he pulled out his and i had the cruciatus curse used on me by my brothers best friend c and albus was trying to stop him and then all three of us were dueling and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off she couldnt stand it c 
 
 the color was draining from aberforths face as though he had suffered a mortal wound 
 
 c and i think she wanted to help but she didnt really know what she was doing and i dont know which of us did it it could have been any of us c and she was dead 
 
 his voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair hermiones face was wet with tears and ron was almost as pale as aberforth harry felt nothing but revulsion he wished he had not heard it wished he could wash is mind clean of it 
 
 im so im so sorry hermione whispered 
 
 gone croaked aberforth gone forever 
 
 he wiped his nose on hiss cuff and cleared his throat 
 
 course grindelwald scarpered he had a bit of a track record already back in his own country and he didnt want ariana set to his account too and albus was free wasnt he free of the burden of his sister free to become the greatest wizard of the c 
 
 he was never free said harry 
 
 i beg your pardon said aberforth 
 
 never said harry the night that your brother died he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind he started screaming pleading with someone who wasnt there dont hurt them please hurt me instead 
 
 ron and hermione were staring at harry he had never gone into details about what had happened on the island on the lake 
 
 the events that had taken place after he and dumbledore had returned to hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly 
 
 he thought he was back there with you and grindelwald i know he did said harry remembering dumbledore whispering pleading 
 
 he thought he was watching grindelwald hurting you and ariana it was torture to him if youd seen him then you wouldnt say he was free 
 
 aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands after a long pause he said how can you be sure potter that my brother wasnt more interested in the greater good than in you how can you be sure you arent dispensable just like my little sister 
 
 a shard of ice seemed to pierce harrys heart 
 
 i dont believe it dumbledore loved harry said hermione 
 
 why didnt he tell him to hide then shot back aberforth why didnt he say to him take care of yourself heres how to survive 
 
 because said harry before hermione could answer sometimes youve got to think about more than your own safety sometimes youve got to think about the greater good this is war 
 
 youre seventeen boy 
 
 im of age and im going to keep fighting even if youve given up 
 
 who says ive given up 
 
 the order of the phoenix is finished harry repeated won its over and anyone whos pretending differents kidding themselves 
 
 i dont say i like it but its the truth 
 
 no it isnt said harry your brother knew how to finish and he passed the knowledge on to me im going to keep going until i succeed c or i die dont think i dont know how this might end ive known it for years 
 
 he waited for aberforth to jeer or to argue but he did not he merely moved 
 
 we need to get into hogwarts said harry again if you cant help us well wait till daybreak leave you in peace and try to find a way in ourselves if you can help us c well now would be a great time to mention it 
 
 aberforth remained fixed in his chair gazing at harry with the eye that were so extraordinarily like his brothers at last he cleared his throat got to his feet walked around the little table and approached the portrait of ariana 
 
 you know what to do he said 
 
 she smiled turned and walked away not as people in portraits usually did one of the sides of their frames but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her they watched her slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness 
 
 er c what c began ron 
 
 theres only one way in now said aberforth you must know theyve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends dementors all around the boundary walls regular patrols inside the school from what my sources tell me the place has never been so heavily guarded 
 
 how you expect to do anything once you get inside it with snape in charge and the carrows as his deputies well thats your lookout isnt it you say youre prepared to die 
 
 but what said hermione frowning at arianas picture 
 
 a tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel and now ariana was walking back toward them growing bigger and bigger as she came but there was somebody else with her now someone taller than she was who was limping along looking excited his hair was longer than harry had ever seen he appeared and torn larger and larger the two figures grew until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait 
 
 then the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed and out of it his hair overgrown his face cut his robes ripped clambered the real neville longbottom who gave a roar of delight leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled 
 
 i knew youd come i knew it harry 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the deathly hallows 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 she was good for nothing 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 the mayor stood at the open window he looked smart for his 
 in which he had stuck a and his ruffles were 
 very fine he had shaved his chin uncommonly smooth although he had cut himself slightly and had stuck a piece of newspaper over the 
 place hark ee youngster cried he 
 
 the boy to whom he spoke was no other than the son of a poor 
 who was just going past the house he stopped and 
 respectfully took off his cap the peak of this cap was broken in 
 the middle so that he could easily roll it up and put it in his 
 pocket he stood before the mayor in his poor but clean and 
 clothes with heavy wooden shoes on his feet looking as humble as if it had been the king himself 
 
 you are a good and civil boy said the mayor i suppose your 
 mother is busy washing the clothes down by the river and you are 
 going to carry that thing to her that you have in your pocket it is 
 very bad for your mother how much have you got in it 
 
 only half a quartern stammered the boy in a frightened voice 
 
 and she has had just as much this morning already 
 
 no it was yesterday replied the boy 
 
 two halves make a whole said the mayor good for 
 nothing what a sad thing it is with these people tell your mother 
 she ought to be ashamed of herself you become a drunkard but i expect you will though poor child there go now 
 
 the boy went on his way with his cap in his hand while the wind 
 fluttered his golden hair till the locks stood up straight he 
 turned round the corner of the street into the little lane that led to 
 the river where his mother stood in the water by her washing bench 
 beating the linen with a heavy wooden bar the floodgates at the 
 mill had been drawn up and as the water rolled rapidly on the sheets 
 were dragged along by the stream and nearly overturned the bench 
 so that the was obliged to lean against it to keep it 
 steady i have been very nearly carried away she said it is a 
 good thing that you are come for i want something to strengthen me 
 it is cold in the water and i have stood here six hours have you 
 brought anything for me 
 
 the boy drew the bottle from his pocket and the mother put it 
 to her lips and drank a little 
 
 ah how much good that does and how it warms me she said 
 
 it is as good as a hot meal and not so dear drink a little my boy 
 you look quite pale you are shivering in your thin clothes and 
 autumn has really come oh how cold the water is i hope i shall 
 not be ill but no i must not be afraid of that give me a little 
 more and you may have a sip too but only a sip you must not get 
 used to it my poor dear child she stepped up to the bridge on 
 which the boy stood as she spoke and came on shore the water dripped from the straw mat which she had bound round her body and from her gown i work hard and suffer pain with my poor hands said she but i do it willingly that i may be able to bring you up honestly and truthfully my dear boy 
 
 at the same moment a woman rather older than herself came 
 towards them she was a object lame of one leg and with a large false curl hanging down over one of her eyes which was blind this curl was intended to conceal the blind eye but it made the defect only more visible she was a friend of the laundress and was called among the neighbors lame martha with the curl 
 oh you poor thing how you do work standing there in the water she exclaimed you really do need something to give you a little 
 warmth and yet spiteful people cry out about the few drops you take 
 
 and then martha repeated to the laundress in a very few minutes 
 all that the mayor had said to her boy which she had overheard and 
 she felt very angry that any man could speak as he had done of a 
 mother to her own child about the few drops she had taken and she 
 was still more angry because on that very day the mayor was going to have a at which there would be wine strong rich 
 wine drunk by the bottle many will take more than they ought but 
 they call that drinking they are all right you are good for 
 nothing indeed cried martha indignantly 
 
 and so he spoke to you in that way did he my child said the 
 and her lips trembled as she spoke he says you have a mother who is good for nothing well perhaps he is right but he should not have said it to my child how much has happened to me from that house 
 
 yes said martha i remember you were in service there and 
 lived in the house when the parents were alive how many years ago that is bushels of salt have been eaten since then and people may well be thirsty and martha smiled the great 
 ought to have been put off but the news came 
 too late the footman told me the dinner was already cooked when a 
 letter came to say that the younger brother in copenhagen is 
 dead 
 
 dead cried the laundress turning pale as death 
 
 yes certainly replied martha but why do you take it so 
 much to heart i suppose you knew him years ago when you were in 
 service there 
 
 is he dead she exclaimed oh he was such a kind 
 man there are not many like him and the tears rolled down her 
 cheeks as she spoke then she cried oh dear me i feel quite ill 
 everything is going round me i cannot bear it is the bottle 
 empty and she leaned against the plank 
 
 dear me you are ill indeed said the other woman come 
 cheer up perhaps it will pass off no indeed i see you are really 
 ill the best thing for me to do is to lead you home 
 
 but my washing yonder 
 
 i will take care of that come give me your arm the boy can 
 stay here and take care of the linen and come back and finish 
 the washing it is but a trifle 
 
 the limbs of the laundress shook under her and she said i 
 have stood too long in the cold water and i have had nothing to eat 
 the whole day since the morning o kind heaven help me to get home i am in a burning fever oh my poor child and she burst into tears and he poor boy wept also as he sat alone by the river near to and watching the damp linen 
 
 the two women walked very slowly the laundress slipped and 
 tottered through the lane and round the corner into the street where 
 the mayor lived and just as she reached the front of his house she 
 sank down upon the pavement many persons came round her and lame martha ran into the house for help the mayor and his guests came to the window 
 
 oh it is the laundress said he she has had a little drop too 
 much she is good for nothing it is a sad thing for her pretty little 
 son i like the boy very well but the mother is good for nothing 
 after a while the laundress recovered herself and they led her to 
 her poor dwelling and put her to bed kind martha warmed a mug of 
 beer for her with butter and sugar she considered this the best 
 medicine and then hastened to the river washed and rinsed badly 
 enough to be sure but she did her best then she drew the linen 
 ashore wet as it was and laid it in a basket before evening she 
 was sitting in the poor little room with the laundress the 
 cook had given her some roasted potatoes and a beautiful piece of 
 fat for the sick woman martha and the boy enjoyed these good things very much but the sick woman could only say that the smell was very nourishing she thought the boy was put to bed in the same bed as the one in which his mother lay but he slept at her feet covered with an old quilt made of blue and white patchwork 
 the laundress felt a little better by this time the warm beer had 
 strengthened her and the smell of the good food had been pleasant 
 to her 
 
 many thanks you good soul she said to martha now the boy 
 is asleep i will tell you all he is soon asleep how gentle and 
 sweet he looks as he lies there with his eyes closed he does not know how his mother has suffered and heaven grant he never may know it i was in service at the the father of the mayor and it happened that the youngest of his sons the student came home i was a young wild girl then but honest that i can declare in the sight of heaven the student was merry and gay brave and 
 affectionate every drop of blood in him was good and honorable a 
 better man never lived on earth he was the son of the house and i 
 was only a maid but he loved me truly and honorably and he told 
 his mother of it she was to him as an angel upon earth she was so 
 wise and loving he went to travel and before he started he placed 
 a gold ring on my finger and as soon as he was out of the house my 
 mistress sent for me gently and earnestly she drew me to her and 
 spake as if an angel were speaking she showed me clearly in spirit 
 and in truth the difference there was between him and me he is 
 pleased now she said with your pretty face but good looks do 
 not last long you have not been educated like he has you are not 
 equals in mind and rank and therein lies the misfortune i esteem the 
 poor she added in the sight of god they may occupy a higher place than many of the rich but here upon earth we must beware of 
 entering upon a false track lest we are overturned in our plans like 
 a carriage that travels by a dangerous road i know a worthy man an 
 artisan who wishes to marry you i mean eric the glovemaker he is a widower without children and in a good position will you think it 
 over every word she said pierced my heart like a knife but i knew 
 she was right and the thought pressed heavily upon me i kissed her 
 hand and wept bitter tears and i wept still more when i went to my 
 room and threw myself on the bed i passed through a dreadful 
 night god knows what i suffered and how i struggled the following sunday i went to the house of god to pray for light to direct my path 
 
 it seemed like a providence that as i stepped out of church eric 
 came towards me and then there remained not a doubt in my mind 
 we were suited to each other in rank and circumstances he was even then a man of good means i went up to him and took his hand and said do you still feel the same for me yes ever and always said he will you then marry a maiden who honors and esteems you although she cannot offer you her love but that may come yes it will come said he and we joined our hands together and i went home to my mistress the gold ring which her son had given me i wore next to my heart i could not place it on my finger during the daytime but only in the evening when i went to bed i kissed the ring till my lips almost bled and then i gave it to my mistress and told her that the banns were to be put up for me and the glovemaker the following week then my mistress threw her arms round me and kissed me she did not say that i was good for nothing very likely i was better then than i am now but the misfortunes of this world were unknown to me then at michaelmas we were married and for the first year everything went well with us we had a journeyman and an apprentice and you were our servant martha 
 
 ah yes and you were a dear good mistress said martha i 
 shall never forget how kind you and your husband were to me 
 yes those were happy years when you were with us although we 
 had no children at first the student i never met again yet i saw him 
 once although he did not see me he came to his funeral i 
 saw him looking pale as death and deeply troubled standing at her 
 grave for she was his mother sometime after when his father died 
 he was in foreign lands and did not come home i know that he never 
 married i believe he became a lawyer he had forgotten me and even 
 had we met he would not have known me for i have lost all my good 
 looks and perhaps that is all for the best and then she spoke of 
 the dark days of trial when misfortune had fallen upon them 
 
 we had five hundred dollars she said and there was a house in 
 the street to be sold for two hundred so we thought it would be worth our while to pull it down and build a new one in its place so it 
 was bought the builder and carpenter made an estimate that the new 
 house would cost ten hundred and twenty dollars to build eric had 
 credit so he borrowed the money in the chief town but the captain 
 who was bringing it to him was shipwrecked and the money lost 
 just about this time my dear sweet boy who lies sleeping there 
 was born and my husband was attacked with a severe lingering illness 
 
 for three quarters of a year i was obliged to dress and undress him 
 we were backward in our payments we borrowed more money and all that we had was lost and sold and then my husband died since then i have worked toiled and striven for the sake of the child i have 
 scrubbed and washed both coarse and fine linen but i have not been 
 able to make myself better off and it was will in his own time 
 he will take me to himself but i know he will never forsake my 
 boy then she fell asleep in the morning she felt much refreshed 
 and strong enough as she thought to go on with her work but as soon as she stepped into the cold water a sudden faintness seized her she clutched at the air convulsively with her hand took one step forward and fell her head rested on dry land but her feet were in the water her wooden shoes which were only tied on by a wisp of straw were carried away by the stream and thus she was found by martha when she came to bring her some coffee 
 
 in the meantime a messenger had been sent to her house by the 
 mayor to say that she must come to him immediately as he had 
 something to tell her it was too late a surgeon had been sent for to 
 open a vein in her arm but the poor woman was dead 
 
 she has drunk herself to death said the cruel mayor in the 
 letter containing the news of his death it was stated that 
 he had left in his will a legacy of six hundred dollars to the 
 widow who had been his maid to be paid with discretion in large or small sums to the widow or her child 
 there was something between my brother and her i remember said the mayor it is a good thing that she is out of the way for now the boy will have the whole i will place him with honest people to 
 bring him up that he may become a respectable working man and the blessing of god rested upon these words the mayor sent for the boy to come to him and promised to take care of him but most cruelly added that it was a good thing that his mother was dead for she was good for nothing they carried her to the churchyard the 
 churchyard in which the poor were buried martha strewed sand on the grave and planted a upon it and the boy stood by her side 
 
 oh my poor mother he cried while the tears rolled down his 
 cheeks is it true what they say that she was good for nothing 
 no indeed it is not true replied the old servant raising her 
 eyes to heaven she was worth a great deal i knew it years ago 
 and since the last night of her life i am more certain of it than 
 ever i say she was a good and worthy woman and god who is in 
 heaven knows i am speaking the truth though the world may say 
 even now she was good for nothing

 chapter ii 
 
 an view of paris 
 a being who could have hovered over paris that night with the wing of the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle 
 all that old quarter of the halles which is like a city within a city through which run the rues and where a thousand lanes cross and of which the insurgents had made their redoubt and their stronghold would have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of paris there the glance fell into an abyss 
 thanks to the broken lanterns thanks to the closed windows there all radiance all life all sound all movement ceased 
 the invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere and maintained order that is to say night 
 the necessary tactics of insurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity to multiply every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains at dusk every window where a candle was burning received a shot the light was extinguished sometimes the inhabitant was killed hence nothing was stirring 
 there was nothing but fright mourning stupor in the houses and in the streets a sort of sacred horror not even the long rows of windows and stores the indentations of the chimneys and the roofs and the vague reflections which are cast back by the wet and muddy pavements were visible an eye cast upward at that mass of shadows might perhaps have caught a glimpse here and there at intervals of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines and profiles of singular buildings something like the lights which go and come in ruins it was at such points that the barricades were situated the rest was a lake of obscurity foggy heavy and funereal above which in motionless and melancholy outlines rose the tower of the church of and two or three more of those grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms 
 all around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth in the quarters where the parisian circulation had not been annihilated and where a few street lanterns still burned the aerial observer might have distinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets the dull rumble of artillery and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were swelling from minute to minute a formidable girdle which was slowly drawing in and around the insurrection 
 the invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous cavern everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless and as we have just seen any street which one might come to offered nothing but darkness 
 a wild darkness full of traps full of unseen and formidable shocks into which it was alarming to penetrate and in which it was terrible to remain where those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street snares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night all was over 
 no more light was to be hoped for henceforth except the lightning of guns no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death 
 where 
 how 
 when 
 no one knew but it was certain and inevitable 
 in this place which had been marked out for the struggle the government and the insurrection the national guard and popular societies the bourgeois and the uprising groping their way were about to come into contact the necessity was the same for both 
 the only possible issue thenceforth was to emerge thence killed or conquerors 
 a situation so extreme an obscurity so powerful that the most timid felt themselves seized with resolution and the most daring with terror 
 moreover on both sides the fury the rage and the determination were equal 
 for the one party to advance meant death and no one dreamed of retreating for the other to remain meant death and no one dreamed of flight 
 it was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day that triumph should rest either here or there that the insurrection should prove itself a revolution or a skirmish 
 the government understood this as well as the parties the most insignificant bourgeois felt it hence a thought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable gloom of this quarter where all was at the point of being decided hence a redoubled anxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point of emerging 
 here only one sound was audible a sound as as the death rattle as menacing as a malediction the tocsin of nothing could be more than the clamor of that wild and desperate bell wailing amid the shadows 
 as it often happens nature seemed to have fallen into accord with what men were about to do 
 nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect 
 the stars had disappeared heavy clouds filled the horizon with their melancholy folds 
 a black sky rested on these dead streets as though an immense were being outspread over this immense tomb 
 while a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in the same locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary events while youth the secret associations the schools in the name of principles and the middle classes in the name of interests were approaching preparatory to dashing themselves together clasping and throwing each other while each one hastened and invited the last and decisive hour of the crisis far away and quite outside of this fatal quarter in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of that wretched old paris which disappears under the splendor of happy and opulent paris the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving utterance to a dull roar 
 a fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute and of the word of god which terrifies the weak and which warns the wise which comes both from below like the voice of the lion and from on high like the voice of the thunder

 book thirteen 
 chapter xi 
 
 early in the morning of the sixth of october pierre went out of the shed and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little dog with a long body and short bandy legs that jumped about him this little dog lived in their shed sleeping beside karataev at night it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned again probably it had never had an owner and it still belonged to nobody and had no name the french called it azor the soldier who told stories called it femgalka karataev and others called it gray or sometimes flabby its lack of a master a name or even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to trouble the dog in the least its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume its bandy legs served it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three legs as if disdaining to use all four everything pleased it now it would roll on its back yelping with delight now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance and now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw 
 attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt the only remnant of his former clothing a pair of trousers which by advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth and a peasant coat and cap physically he had changed much during this time he no longer seemed stout though he still had the appearance of solidity and strength hereditary in his family a beard and mustache covered the lower part of his face and a tangle of hair infested with lice curled round his head like a cap the look of his eyes was resolute calm and animatedly alert as never before the former slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an energetic readiness for action and resistance his feet were bare 
 pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen were passing that morning then into the distance across the river then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various positions moving his dirty thick big toes every time he looked at his bare feet a smile of animated flitted across his face the sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him 
 for some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in the mornings what is called an old wives summer 
 in the sunshine the air was warm and that warmth was particularly pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in the air 
 on everything far and near lay the magic crystal glitter seen only at that time autumn the sparrow hills were visible in the distance with the village the church and the large white house the bare trees the sand the bricks and roofs of the houses the green church spire and the corners of the white house in the distance all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a mansion occupied by the french with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fence and even that ruined and befouled house which in dull weather was repulsively ugly seemed quietly beautiful now in the clear motionless brilliance 
 a french corporal with coat unbuttoned in a homely way a skullcap on his head and a short pipe in his mouth came from behind a corner of the shed and approached pierre with a friendly wink 
 what sunshine monsieur kiril their name for pierre eh just like spring 
 and the corporal leaned against the door and offered pierre his pipe though whenever he offered it pierre always declined it 
 to be on the march in such weather he began 
 pierre inquired what was being said about leaving and the corporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an order about the prisoners that day sokolov one of the soldiers in the shed with pierre was dying and pierre told the corporal that something should be done about him the corporal replied that pierre need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and arrangements would be made for the sick and that in general everything that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities 
 besides monsieur kiril you have only to say a word to the captain you know he is a man who never forgets anything speak to the captain when he makes his round he will do anything for you 
 the captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with pierre and showed him all sorts of favors 
 you see st thomas he said to me the other day monsieur kiril is a man of education who speaks french he is a russian seigneur who 
 has had misfortunes but he is a man he knows what if he wants anything and asks me he get a refusal when one has studied you see one likes education and people it is for your sake i mention it monsieur kiril the other day if it had not been for you that affair would have ended ill 
 and after chatting a while longer the corporal went away the affair he had alluded to had happened a few days before a fight between the prisoners and the french soldiers in which pierre had succeeded in pacifying his comrades some of the prisoners who had heard pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the frenchman had said while pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving moscow a thin sallow tattered french soldier came up to the door of the shed rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way of greeting he asked pierre whether the soldier platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that shed 
 a week before the french had had boot leather and linen issued to them which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and shirts for them 
 ready ready dear fellow said karataev coming out with a neatly folded shirt 
 karataev on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot his hair was bound round workman fashion with a wisp of bast and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever 
 a promise is own brother to performance i said friday and here it is ready said platon smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn 
 the frenchman glanced around uneasily and then as if overcoming his hesitation rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt he had a long greasy flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow thin bare body but no shirt he was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on would laugh at him and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly none of the prisoners said a word 
 see it fits well platon kept repeating pulling the shirt straight 
 the frenchman having pushed his head and hands through without raising his eyes looked down at the shirt and examined the seams 
 you see dear man this is not a sewing shop and i had no proper tools and as they say one needs a tool even to kill a louse said platon with one of his round smiles obviously pleased with his work 
 good quite good thank you said the frenchman in french but there must be some linen left over 
 it will fit better still when it sets to your body said karataev still admiring his handiwork be nice and comfortable 
 thanks thanks old fellow but the bits left over said the frenchman again and smiled he took out an assignation ruble note and gave it to karataev but give me the pieces that are over 
 pierre saw that platon did not want to understand what the frenchman was saying and he looked on without interfering karataev thanked the frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work the frenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked pierre to translate what he said 
 what does he want the bits for said karataev make fine leg bands for us well never mind 
 and karataev with a suddenly changed and saddened expression took a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the frenchman without looking at him oh dear muttered karataev and went away the frenchman looked at the linen considered for a moment then looked inquiringly at pierre and as if look had told him something suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice 
 platoche eh platoche keep them yourself and handing back the odd bits he turned and went out 
 there look at that said karataev swaying his head people said they were not christians but they too have souls what the old folk used to say a sweating an open hand a dry close naked but yet given it back 
 karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the pieces 
 but make grand leg bands dear friend he said and went back into the shed

 chapter iii 
 
 the extreme edge 
 marius had reached the halles 
 there everything was still calmer more obscure and more motionless than in the neighboring streets 
 one would have said that the glacial peace of the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the heavens 
 nevertheless a red glow brought out against this black background the lofty roofs of the houses which barred the rue de la chanvrerie on the side 
 it was the reflection of the torch which was burning in the corinthe barricade 
 marius directed his steps towards that red light 
 it had drawn him to the and he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the rue des precheurs he entered it 
 the insurgents sentinel who was guarding the other end did not see him 
 he felt that he was very close to that which he had come in search of and he walked on tiptoe in this manner he reached the elbow of that short section of the rue mondetour which was as the reader will remember the only communication which enjolras had preserved with the outside world at the corner of the last house on his left he thrust his head forward and looked into the fragment of the rue mondetour 
 a little beyond the angle of the lane and the rue de la chanvrerie which cast a broad curtain of shadow in which he was himself engulfed he perceived some light on the pavement a bit of the and beyond a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall and men crouching down with guns on their knees 
 all this was ten fathoms distant from him 
 it was the interior of the barricade 
 the houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of the the large barricade and the flag from him 
 marius had but a step more to take 
 then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post folded his arms and fell to thinking about his father 
 he thought of that heroic colonel pontmercy who had been so proud a soldier who had guarded the frontier of france under the republic and had touched the frontier of asia under napoleon who had beheld genoa alexandria milan turin madrid vienna dresden berlin moscow who had left on all the victorious of europe drops of that same blood which he marius had in his veins who had grown gray before his time in discipline and command who had lived with his buckled his epaulets falling on his breast his cockade blackened with powder his brow furrowed with his helmet in barracks in camp in the bivouac in ambulances and who at the expiration of twenty years had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek a smiling countenance tranquil admirable pure as a child having done everything for france and nothing against her 
 he said to himself that his day had also come now that his hour had struck that following his father he too was about to show himself brave intrepid bold to run to meet the bullets to offer his breast to bayonets to shed his blood to seek the enemy to seek death that he was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battle and that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was the street and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil war 
 he beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him and into this he was about to fall 
 then he shuddered 
 he thought of his sword which his grandfather had sold to a dealer and which he had so mournfully regretted he said to himself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape from him and to depart in wrath into the gloom that if it had thus fled it was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion the war of the gutters the war of the pavements fusillades through blows given and received in the rear it was because coming from marengo and friedland it did not wish to go to the rue de la chanvrerie it was because after what it had done with the father it did not wish to do this for the son he told himself that if that sword were there if after taking possession of it at his pillow he had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darkness between frenchmen in the streets it would assuredly have scorched his hands and burst out aflame before his eyes like the sword of the angel he told himself that it was fortunate that it was not there and that it had disappeared that that was well that that was just that his grandfather had been the true guardian of his glory and that it was far better that the sword should be sold at auction sold to the man thrown among the old junk than that it should wound the side of his country 
 and then he fell to weeping bitterly 
 this was horrible 
 but what was he to do 
 live without cosette he could not 
 since she was gone he must needs die 
 had he not given her his word of honor that he would die 
 she had gone knowing that this meant that it pleased her that marius should die 
 and then it was clear that she no longer loved him since she had departed thus without warning without a word without a letter although she knew his address 
 what was the good of living and why should he live now and then what should he retreat after going so far should he flee from danger after having approached it should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade slip away all in a tremble saying 
 after all i have had enough of it as it is i have seen it that suffices this is civil war and i shall take my leave 
 should he abandon his friends who were expecting him who were in need of him possibly who were a mere handful against an army 
 should he be untrue at once to his love to country to his word 
 should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism but this was impossible and if the phantom of his father was there in the gloom and beheld him retreating he would beat him on the loins with the flat of his sword and shout to him 
 march on you poltroon 
 thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts he dropped his head 
 all at once he raised it 
 a sort of splendid rectification had just been effected in his mind 
 there is a widening of the sphere of thought which is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave it makes one see clearly to be near death 
 the vision of the action into which he felt that he was perhaps on the point of entering appeared to him no more as lamentable but as superb 
 the war of the street was suddenly transfigured by some unfathomable inward working of his soul before the eye of his thought all the tumultuous interrogation points of revery recurred to him in throngs but without troubling him 
 he left none of them unanswered 
 let us see why should his father be indignant 
 are there not cases where insurrection rises to the dignity of duty what was there that was degrading for the son of colonel pontmercy in the combat which was about to begin 
 it is no longer montmirail nor champaubert it is something quite different 
 the question is no longer one of sacred of a holy idea the country wails that may be but humanity applauds 
 but is it true that the country does wail 
 france bleeds but liberty smiles and in the presence of smile france forgets her wound and then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view why do we speak of civil war 
 civil does that mean 
 is there a foreign war is not all war between men war between brothers 
 war is qualified only by its object 
 there is no such thing as foreign or civil war there is only just and unjust war 
 until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded war that at least which is the effort of the future which is hastening on against the past which is lagging in the rear may be necessary 
 what have we to reproach that war with 
 war does not become a disgrace the sword does not become a disgrace except when it is used for assassinating the right progress reason civilization truth 
 then war whether foreign or civil is iniquitous it is called crime outside the pale of that holy thing justice by what right does one form of man despise another 
 by what right should the sword of washington disown the pike of camille desmoulins 
 leonidas against the stranger timoleon against the tyrant which is the greater the one is the defender the other the liberator 
 shall we brand every appeal to arms within a limits without taking the object into a consideration 
 then note the infamy of brutus marcel arnould von blankenheim coligny hedgerow war 
 war of the streets why not 
 that was the war of ambiorix of artevelde of marnix of pelagius 
 but ambiorix fought against rome artevelde against france marnix against spain pelagius against the moors all against the foreigner 
 well the monarchy is a foreigner oppression is a stranger the right divine is a stranger 
 despotism violates the moral frontier an invasion violates the geographical frontier driving out the tyrant or driving out the english in both cases regaining possession of own territory 
 there comes an hour when protestation no longer suffices after philosophy action is required live force finishes what the idea has sketched out prometheus chained begins arostogeiton ends the encyclopedia enlightens souls the th of august electrifies them 
 after aeschylus thrasybulus after diderot danton 
 multitudes have a tendency to accept the master their mass bears witness to apathy 
 a crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience 
 men must be stirred up pushed on treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance their eyes must be wounded by the true light must be hurled at them in terrible handfuls they must be a little thunderstruck themselves at their own this dazzling awakens them 
 hence the necessity of tocsins and wars great combatants must rise must enlighten nations with audacity and shake up that sad humanity which is covered with gloom by the right divine caesarian glory force fanaticism irresponsible power and absolute majesty a rabble stupidly occupied in the contemplation in their twilight splendor of these sombre triumphs of the night down with the tyrant 
 of whom are you speaking 
 do you call louis philippe the tyrant 
 no no more than louis xvi both of them are what history is in the habit of calling good kings but principles are not to be parcelled out the logic of the true is rectilinear the peculiarity of truth is that it lacks complaisance no concessions then all encroachments on man should be repressed there is a divine right in louis xvi there is because a bourbon in louis philippe both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of right and in order to clear away universal insurrection they must be combated it must be done france being always the one to begin when the master falls in france he falls everywhere 
 in short what cause is more just and consequently what war is greater than that which social truth restores her throne to liberty restores the people to the people restores sovereignty to man replaces the purple on the head of france restores equity and reason in their plenitude suppresses every germ of antagonism by restoring each one to himself annihilates the obstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord and places the human race once more on a level with the right 
 these wars build up peace an enormous fortress of prejudices privileges superstitions lies exactions abuses violences iniquities and darkness still stands erect in this world with its towers of hatred it must be cast down 
 this monstrous mass must be made to crumble to conquer at austerlitz is grand to take the bastille is immense 
 there is no one who has not noticed it in his own soul and therein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with ubiquity has a strange aptitude for reasoning almost coldly in the most violent extremities and it often happens that heartbroken passion and profound despair in the very agony of their blackest monologues treat subjects and discuss theses 
 logic is mingled with convulsion and the thread of the syllogism floats without breaking in the mournful storm of thought 
 this was the situation of marius mind 
 as he meditated thus dejected but resolute hesitating in every direction and in short shuddering at what he was about to do his glance strayed to the interior of the barricade the insurgents were here conversing in a low voice without moving and there was perceptible that which marks the last stage of expectation 
 overhead at the small window in the third story marius descried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly attentive 
 this was the porter who had been killed by le cabuc 
 below by the lights of the torch which was thrust between the this head could be vaguely distinguished nothing could be stranger in that sombre and uncertain gleam than that livid motionless astonished face with its bristling hair its eyes fixed and staring and its yawning mouth bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity 
 one would have said that the man who was dead was surveying those who were about to die a long trail of blood which had flowed from that head descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first floor where it stopped

 chapter xii 
 
 four weeks had passed since pierre had been taken prisoner and though the french had offered to move him from the to the officers shed he had stayed in the shed where he was first put 
 in burned and devastated moscow pierre experienced almost the extreme limits of privation a man can endure but thanks to his physical strength and health of which he had till then been unconscious and thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began he endured his position not only lightly but joyfully and just at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach he had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind that inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of borodino he had sought it in philanthropy in freemasonry in the dissipations of town life in wine in heroic feats of and in romantic love for natasha he had sought it by reasoning and all these quests and experiments had failed him and now without thinking about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death through privation and through what he recognized in karataev 
 those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important it did not now occur to him to think of russia or the war or politics or napoleon it was plain to him that all these things were no business of his and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so russia and summer weather are not bound together he thought repeating words of which he found strangely consoling his intention of killing napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous his anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing what concern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading the life she preferred what did it matter to anybody and especially to him whether or not they found out that their name was count bezukhov 
 he now often remembered his conversation with prince andrew and quite agreed with him though he understood prince thoughts somewhat differently prince andrew had thought and said that happiness could only be negative but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied but pierre believed it without any mental reservation the absence of suffering the satisfaction of needs and consequent freedom in the choice of occupation that is of way of life now seemed to pierre to be indubitably highest happiness here and now for the first time he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat drinking when he wanted to drink sleeping when he wanted to sleep of warmth when he was cold of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk and to hear a human voice the satisfaction of needs good food cleanliness and freedom now that he was deprived of all this seemed to pierre to constitute perfect happiness and the choice of occupation that is of his way of life now that that was so restricted seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying needs while great freedom in the choice of occupation such freedom as his wealth his education and his social position had given him in his own life is just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation 
 all daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free yet subsequently and for the rest of his life he thought and spoke with enthusiasm of that month of captivity of those irrecoverable strong joyful sensations and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner freedom which he experienced only during those weeks 
 when on the first day he got up early went out of the shed at dawn and saw the cupolas and crosses of the new convent of the virgin still dark at first the hoarfrost on the dusty grass the sparrow hills and the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying from moscow across the field and when afterwards light gleamed from the east and the rim appeared solemnly from behind a cloud and the cupolas and crosses the hoarfrost the distance and the river all began to sparkle in the glad light pierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he had never before known and this not only stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment but even grew in strength as the hardships of his position increased 
 that feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed with his knowledge of languages the respect shown him by the french his simplicity his readiness to give anything asked of him he received the allowance of three rubles a week made to officers with his strength which he showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut his gentleness to his companions and his capacity for sitting still and thinking without doing anything which seemed to them incomprehensible he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being the very qualities that had been a hindrance if not actually harmful to him in the world he had lived in his strength his disdain for the comforts of life his and simplicity here among these people gave him almost the status of a hero and pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities upon him

 the flag act first 
 as yet nothing had come 
 ten had sounded from enjolras and combeferre had gone and seated themselves carbines in hand near the outlet of the grand barricade they no longer addressed each other they listened seeking to catch even the faintest and most distant sound of marching 
 suddenly in the midst of the dismal calm a clear gay young voice which seemed to come from the rue rose and began to sing distinctly to the old popular air of by the light of the moon this bit of poetry terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock 
 
 mon nez est en larmes 
 mon ami bugeaud 
 prete moi tes gendarmes 
 pour leur dire un mot 
 
 en capote bleue 
 la poule au shako 
 voici la banlieue 
 
 my nose is in tears my friend bugeaud lend me thy gendarmes that i may say a word to them 
 with a blue capote and a chicken in his shako the banlieue 
 they pressed each hands 
 that is gavroche said enjolras 
 he is warning us said combeferre 
 a hasty rush troubled the deserted street they beheld a being more agile than a clown climb over the omnibus and gavroche bounded into the barricade all breathless saying 
 my gun 
 here they are 
 an electric quiver shot through the whole barricade and the sound of hands seeking their guns became audible 
 would you like my carbine said enjolras to the lad 
 i want a big gun replied gavroche 
 and he seized gun 
 two sentinels had fallen back and had come in almost at the same moment as gavroche 
 they were the sentinels from the end of the street and the vidette of the rue de la the vidette of the lane des precheurs had remained at his post which indicated that nothing was approaching from the direction of the bridges and halles 
 the rue de la chanvrerie of which a few alone were dimly visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag offered to the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a smoke 
 each man had taken up his position for the conflict 
 insurgents among whom were enjolras combeferre courfeyrac bossuet joly bahorel and gavroche were kneeling inside the large barricade with their heads on a level with the crest of the barrier the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as though at attentive mute ready to fire 
 six commanded by feuilly had installed themselves with their guns levelled at their shoulders at the windows of the two stories of corinthe 
 several minutes passed thus then a sound of footsteps measured heavy and numerous became distinctly audible in the direction of this sound faint at first then precise then heavy and sonorous approached slowly without halt without intermission with a tranquil and terrible continuity nothing was to be heard but this 
 it was that combined silence and sound of the statue of the commander but this stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it which awakened the idea of a throng and at the same time the idea of a spectre one thought one heard the terrible statue legion marching onward this tread drew near it drew still nearer and stopped 
 it seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of the street 
 nothing was to be seen however but at the bottom of that dense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic threads as fine as needles and almost imperceptible which moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneath closed eyelids in the first mists of slumber at the moment when one is dropping off to sleep 
 these were bayonets and confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch 
 a pause ensued as though both sides were waiting 
 all at once from the depths of this darkness a voice which was all the more sinister since no one was visible and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking shouted 
 who goes there 
 at the same time the click of guns as they were lowered into position was heard 
 enjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone 
 the french revolution 
 fire shouted the voice 
 a flash empurpled all the facades in the street as though the door of a furnace had been flung open and hastily closed again 
 a fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade 
 the red flag fell the discharge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the staff that is to say the very tip of the omnibus pole 
 bullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated the barricade and wounded several men 
 the impression produced by this first discharge was freezing the attack had been rough and of a nature to inspire reflection in the boldest 
 it was evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment at the very least 
 comrades shouted courfeyrac let us not waste our powder let us wait until they are in the street before replying 
 and above all said enjolras let us raise the flag again 
 he picked up the flag which had fallen precisely at his feet 
 outside the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard the troops were their arms 
 enjolras went on 
 who is there here with a bold heart 
 who will plant the flag on the barricade again 
 not a man responded 
 to mount on the barricade at the very moment when without any doubt it was again the object of their aim was simply death 
 the bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation 
 enjolras himself felt a thrill 
 he repeated 
 does no one volunteer

 chapter xiii 
 
 the french evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh of october kitchens and sheds were dismantled carts loaded and troops and baggage trains started 
 at seven in the morning a french convoy in marching trim wearing shakos and carrying muskets knapsacks and enormous sacks stood in front of the sheds and animated french talk mingled with curses sounded all along the lines 
 in the shed everyone was ready dressed belted shod and only awaited the order to start the sick soldier sokolov pale and thin with dark shadows round his eyes alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed his eyes prominent from the emaciation of his face gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no attention to him and he moaned regularly and quietly it was evidently not so much his sufferings that caused him to moan he had dysentery as his fear and grief at being left alone 
 pierre girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes karataev had made for him from some leather a french soldier had torn off a tea chest and brought to have his boots mended with went up to the sick man and squatted down beside him 
 you know sokolov they are not all going away they have a hospital here you may be better off than we others said pierre 
 o lord oh it will be the death of me o lord moaned the man in a louder voice 
 go and ask them again directly said pierre rising and going to the door of the shed 
 just as pierre reached the door the corporal who had offered him a pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers the corporal and soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal straps and these changed their familiar faces 
 the corporal came according to orders to shut the door the prisoners had to be counted before being let out 
 corporal what will they do with the sick man pierre began 
 but even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he knew or a stranger so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that moment moreover just as pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was suddenly heard from both sides the corporal frowned at words and uttering some meaningless oaths slammed the door the shed became semidark and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned the sick groans 
 there it is it again said pierre to himself and an involuntary shudder ran down his spine in the changed face in the sound of his voice in the stirring and deafening noise of the drums he recognized that mysterious callous force which compelled people against their will to kill their fellow men that force the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions to fear or to try to escape that force to address entreaties or exhortations to those who served as its tools was useless pierre knew this now one had to wait and endure he did not again go to the sick man nor turn to look at him but stood frowning by the door of the hut 
 when that door was opened and the prisoners crowding against one another like a flock of sheep squeezed into the exit pierre pushed his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had assured him was ready to do anything for him the captain was also in marching kit and on his cold face appeared that same it which pierre had recognized in the words and in the roll of the drums 
 pass on pass on the captain reiterated frowning sternly and looking at the prisoners who thronged past him 
 pierre went up to him though he knew his attempt would be vain 
 what now the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing pierre 
 pierre told him about the sick man 
 manage to walk devil take him said the captain pass on pass on he continued without looking at pierre 
 but he is dying pierre again began 
 be so good shouted the captain frowning angrily 
 rattled the drums and pierre understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it was now useless to say any more 
 the officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march in front there were about thirty officers with pierre among them and about three hundred men 
 the officers who had come from the other sheds were all strangers to pierre and much better dressed than he they looked at him and at his shoes mistrustfully as at an alien not far from him walked a fat major with a sallow bloated angry face who was wearing a kazan dressing grown tied round with a towel and who evidently enjoyed the respect of his fellow prisoners he kept one hand in which he clasped his tobacco pouch inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other panting and puffing the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at another a thin little officer was speaking to everyone conjecturing where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day an official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of moscow loudly announcing his observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city was that they could see a third officer who by his accent was a pole disputed with the commissariat officer arguing that he was mistaken in his identification of the different wards of moscow 
 what are you disputing about said the major angrily what does it matter whether it is st nicholas or st blasius you see burned down and an end of it what are you pushing for the road wide enough said he turning to a man behind him who was not pushing him at all 
 oh oh oh what have they done the prisoners on one side and another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins all beyond the river and zubova and in the kremlin just look not half of it left yes i told you the whole quarter beyond the river and so it is 
 well you know burned so the use of talking said the major 
 as they passed near a church in the khamovniki one of the few unburned quarters of moscow the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard 
 ah the villains what heathens yes dead dead so he is and smeared with something 
 pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these exclamations and dimly made out something leaning against the palings surrounding the church from the words of his comrades who saw better than he did he found that this was the body of a man set upright against the palings with its face smeared with soot 
 go on what the devil go on thirty thousand devils the convoy guards began cursing and the french soldiers with fresh virulence drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead man

 the flag act second 
 since they had arrived at corinthe and had begun the construction of the barricade no attention had been paid to father mabeuf m mabeuf had not quitted the mob however he had entered the of the and had seated himself behind the counter 
 there he had so to speak retreated into himself he no longer seemed to look or to think 
 courfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times warning him of his peril beseeching him to withdraw but he did not hear them 
 when they were not speaking to him his mouth moved as though he were replying to some one and as soon as he was addressed his lips became motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive 
 several hours before the barricade was attacked he had assumed an attitude which he did not afterwards abandon with both fists planted on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a precipice 
 nothing had been able to move him from this attitude it did not seem as though his mind were in the barricade when each had gone to take up his position for the combat there remained in the where javert was bound to the post only a single insurgent with a naked sword watching over javert and himself mabeuf 
 at the moment of the attack at the detonation the physical shock had reached him and had as it were awakened him he started up abruptly crossed the room and at the instant when enjolras repeated his appeal 
 does no one volunteer the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold of the his presence produced a sort of commotion in the different groups a shout went up 
 it is the voter 
 it is the member of the convention it is the representative of the people 
 it is probable that he did not hear them 
 he strode straight up to enjolras the insurgents withdrawing before him with a religious fear he tore the flag from enjolras who recoiled in amazement and then since no one dared to stop or to assist him this old man of eighty with shaking head but firm foot began slowly to ascend the staircase of arranged in the barricade 
 this was so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried 
 off with your hats 
 at every step that he mounted it was a frightful spectacle his white locks his decrepit face his lofty bald and wrinkled brow his amazed and open mouth his aged arm upholding the red banner rose through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of emerging from the earth with the flag of terror in his hand 
 when he had reached the last step when this trembling and terrible phantom erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve hundred invisible guns drew himself up in the face of death and as though he were more powerful than it the whole barricade assumed amid the darkness a supernatural and colossal form 
 there ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence of prodigies 
 in the midst of this silence the old man waved the red flag and shouted 
 long live the revolution 
 long live the republic 
 fraternity equality and death 
 those in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper like the murmur of a priest who is despatching a prayer in haste it was probably the commissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other end of the street 
 then the same piercing voice which had shouted 
 who goes there shouted 
 retire 
 m mabeuf pale haggard his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame of aberration raised the flag above his head and repeated 
 long live the republic 
 fire said the voice 
 a second discharge similar to the first rained down upon the barricade 
 the old man fell on his knees then rose again dropped the flag and fell backwards on the pavement like a log at full length with outstretched arms 
 rivulets of blood flowed beneath him 
 his aged head pale and sad seemed to be gazing at the sky 
 one of those emotions which are superior to man which make him forget even to defend himself seized upon the insurgents and they approached the body with respectful awe 
 what men these regicides were said enjolras 
 courfeyrac bent down to enjolras ear 
 this is for yourself alone i do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm but this man was anything rather than a regicide 
 i knew him his name was father mabeuf 
 i do not know what was the matter with him but he was a brave blockhead 
 just look at his head 
 the head of a blockhead and the heart of a brutus replied enjolras 
 then he raised his voice 
 citizens 
 this is the example which the old give to the young we hesitated he came 
 we were drawing back he advanced 
 this is what those who are trembling with age teach to those who tremble with fear 
 this aged man is august in the eyes of his country he has had a long life and a magnificent death 
 now let us place the body under cover that each one of us may defend this old man dead as he would his father living and may his presence in our midst render the barricade impregnable 
 a murmur of gloomy and energetic assent followed these words 
 enjolras bent down raised the old head and fierce as he was he kissed him on the brow then throwing wide his arms and handling this dead man with tender precaution as though he feared to hurt it he removed his coat showed the bloody holes in it to all and said 
 this is our flag now

 chapter xiv 
 
 through the cross streets of the khamovniki quarter the prisoners marched followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons belonging to that escort but when they reached the supply stores they came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with private vehicles 
 at the bridge they all halted waiting for those in front to get across from the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage trains before and behind them to the right where the kaluga road turns near neskuchny endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into the distance these were troops of beauharnais corps which had started before any of the others behind along the riverside and across the stone bridge were troops and transport 
 troops in whose charge were the prisoners were crossing the crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the kaluga road but the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of beauharnais train had not yet got out of moscow and reached the kaluga road when the vanguard of army was already emerging from the great ordynka street 
 when they had crossed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps forward halted and again moved on and from all sides vehicles and men crowded closer and closer together they advanced the few hundred paces that separated the bridge from the kaluga road taking more than an hour to do so and came out upon the square where the streets of the transmoskva ward and the kaluga road converge and the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway from all sides like the roar of the sea were heard the rattle of wheels the tramp of feet and incessant shouts of anger and abuse pierre stood pressed against the wall of a charred house listening to that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums 
 to get a better view several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of the house against which pierre was leaning 
 what crowds just look at the crowds loaded goods even on the cannon look there those are furs they exclaimed just see what the blackguards have looted there see what that one has behind in the cart why those are settings taken from some icons by heaven oh the rascals see how that fellow has loaded himself up he can hardly walk good lord even grabbed those chaises see that fellow there sitting on the trunks heavens fighting 
 right hit him on the snout on his snout like this we get away before evening look look there why that must be own see what horses and the monograms with a crown like a portable house that dropped his sack and see it fighting again a woman with a baby and not either yes i dare say the way let you pass just look no end to it russian wenches by heaven so they are in carriages see how comfortably settled themselves 
 again as at the church in khamovniki a wave of general curiosity bore all the prisoners forward onto the road and pierre thanks to his stature saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their curiosity in three carriages involved among the munition carts closely squeezed together sat women with rouged faces dressed in glaring colors who were shouting something in shrill voices 
 from the moment pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned ruins of moscow all that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression on him as if his soul making ready for a hard struggle refused to receive impressions that might weaken it 
 the vehicles drove by behind them came more carts soldiers wagons soldiers gun carriages carriages soldiers ammunition carts more soldiers and now and then women 
 pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement 
 all these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible power during the hour pierre watched them they all came flowing from the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly they all jostled one another began to grow angry and to fight white teeth gleamed brows frowned ever the same words of abuse flew from side to side and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck pierre that morning on the face when the drums were beating 
 it was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among the baggage trains and the prisoners hemmed in on all sides emerged onto the kaluga road 
 they marched very quickly without resting and halted only when the sun began to set the baggage carts drew up close together and the men began to prepare for their rest they all appeared angry and dissatisfied for a long time oaths angry shouts and fighting could be heard from all sides a carriage that followed the escort ran into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole several soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides some beat the carriage horses on their heads turning them aside others fought among themselves and pierre saw that one german was badly wounded on the head by a sword 
 it seemed that all these men now that they had stopped amid fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening experienced one and the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start once at a standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know where they were going and that much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey 
 during this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had done at the start it was here that the prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their meat ration 
 from the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners in unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations 
 this spite increased still more when on calling over the roll of prisoners it was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one russian soldier who had pretended to suffer from colic had escaped pierre saw a frenchman beat a russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the road and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the russian to the noncommissioned excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the executions but which be had not felt during his imprisonment now again controlled his existence it was terrible but he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it 
 he ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his comrades 
 neither pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in moscow or of the roughness of their treatment by the french or of the order to shoot them which had been announced to them as if in reaction against the worsening of their position they were all particularly animated and gay they spoke of personal reminiscences of amusing scenes they had witnessed during the campaign and avoided all talk of their present situation 
 the sun had set long since bright stars shone out here and there in the sky a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full moon and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray haze it grew light the evening was ending but the night had not yet come pierre got up and left his new companions crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed he wanted to talk to them on the road he was stopped by a french sentinel who ordered him back 
 pierre turned back not to his companions by the campfire but to an unharnessed cart where there was nobody tucking his legs under him and dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad laughter so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean 
 laughed pierre and he said aloud to himself the soldier did not let me pass they took me and shut me up they hold me captive what me me my immortal soul and he laughed till tears started to his eyes 
 a man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at all by himself pierre stopped laughing got up went farther away from the inquisitive man and looked around him 
 the huge endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet the red campfires were growing paler and dying down high up in the light sky hung the full moon forests and fields beyond the camp unseen before were now visible in the distance and farther still beyond those forests and fields the bright oscillating limitless distance lured one to itself pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway depths and all that is me all that is within me and it is all i thought pierre and they caught all that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks he smiled and went and lay down to sleep beside his companions

 gavroche would have done better to accept enjolras carbine 
 they threw a long black shawl of widow over father mabeuf six men made a litter of their guns on this they laid the body and bore it with bared heads with solemn slowness to the large table in the 
 these men wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in which they were engaged thought no more of the perilous situation in which they stood 
 when the corpse passed near javert who was still impassive enjolras said to the spy 
 it will be your turn presently 
 during all this time little gavroche who alone had not quitted his post but had remained on guard thought he espied some men stealthily approaching the barricade 
 all at once he shouted 
 look out 
 courfeyrac enjolras jean prouvaire combeferre joly bahorel bossuet and all the rest ran tumultuously from the it was almost too late 
 they saw a glistening density of bayonets undulating above the barricade 
 municipal guards of lofty stature were making their way in some striding over the omnibus others through the cut thrusting before them the urchin who retreated but did not flee 
 the moment was critical 
 it was that first redoubtable moment of inundation when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when the water begins to filter through the fissures of dike a second more and the barricade would have been taken 
 bahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering and killed him on the spot with a blow from his gun the second killed bahorel with a blow from his bayonet 
 another had already overthrown courfeyrac who was shouting 
 follow me 
 the largest of all a sort of colossus marched on gavroche with his bayonet fixed the urchin took in his arms immense gun levelled it resolutely at the giant and fired 
 no discharge followed gun was not loaded 
 the municipal guard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the child 
 before the bayonet had touched gavroche the gun slipped from the grasp a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the centre of the forehead and he fell over on his back a second bullet struck the other guard who had assaulted courfeyrac in the breast and laid him low on the pavement 
 this was the work of marius who had just entered the barricade

 chapter xv 
 
 in the early days of october another envoy came to kutuzov with a letter from napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from moscow though napoleon was already not far from kutuzov on the old kaluga road kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought by lauriston saying that there could be no question of peace 
 soon after that a report was received from guerrilla detachment operating to the left of tarutino that troops of division had been seen at forminsk and that being separated from the rest of the french army they might easily be destroyed the soldiers and officers again demanded action generals on the staff excited by the memory of the easy victory at tarutino urged kutuzov to carry out suggestion kutuzov did not consider any offensive necessary the result was a compromise which was inevitable a small detachment was sent to forminsk to attack broussier 
 by a strange coincidence this task which turned out to be a most difficult and important one was entrusted to dokhturov that same modest little dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of battles dashing about in front of regiments showering crosses on batteries and so on and who was thought to be and was spoken of as undecided and undiscerning but whom we find commanding wherever the position was most difficult all through the wars from austerlitz to the year at austerlitz he remained last at the augezd dam rallying the regiments saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear guard ill with fever he went to smolensk with twenty thousand men to defend the town against whole army in smolensk at the malakhov gate he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the town and smolensk held out all day long at the battle of borodino when bagration was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the french artillery fire was directed against it the man sent there was this same irresolute and undiscerning dokhturov kutuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first and the quiet little dokhturov rode thither and borodino became the greatest glory of the russian army many heroes have been described to us in verse and prose but of dokhturov scarcely a word has been said 
 it was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there to the place where the last battle with the french was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the french army began and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign but of dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that dubiously and this silence about dokhturov is the clearest testimony to his merit 
 it is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most important part the man who does not understand the construction of the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine and not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working 
 on the tenth of october when dokhturov had gone halfway to forminsk and stopped at the village of aristovo preparing faithfully to execute the orders he had received the whole french army having in its convulsive movement reached position apparently in order to give battle suddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new kaluga road and began to enter forminsk where only broussier had been till then at that time dokhturov had under his command besides detachment the two small guerrilla detachments of figner and seslavin 
 on the evening of october seslavin came to the aristovo headquarters with a french guardsman he had captured the prisoner said that the troops that had entered forminsk that day were the vanguard of the whole army that napoleon was there and the whole army had left moscow four days previously that same evening a house serf who had come from borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town some cossacks of detachment reported having sighted the french guards marching along the road to borovsk from all these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there was now the whole french army marching from moscow in an unexpected direction along the kaluga road dokhturov was unwilling to undertake any action as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do he had been ordered to attack forminsk but only broussier had been there at that time and now the whole french army was there ermolov wished to act on his own judgment but dokhturov insisted that he must have instructions so it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff 
 for this purpose a capable officer bolkhovitinov was chosen who was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth besides delivering a written report toward midnight bolkhovitinov having received the dispatch and verbal instructions galloped off to the general staff accompanied by a cossack with spare horses

 the barrel of powder 
 marius still concealed in the turn of the rue mondetour had witnessed shuddering and irresolute the first phase of the combat 
 but he had not long been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which may be designated as the call of the abyss 
 in the presence of the imminence of the peril in the presence of the death of m mabeuf that melancholy enigma in the presence of bahorel killed and courfeyrac shouting 
 follow me of that child threatened of his friends to succor or to avenge all hesitation had vanished and he had flung himself into the conflict his two pistols in hand with his first shot he had saved gavroche and with the second delivered courfeyrac 
 amid the sound of the shots amid the cries of the assaulted guards the assailants had climbed the entrenchment on whose summit municipal guards soldiers of the line and national guards from the suburbs could now be seen gun in hand rearing themselves to more than half the height of their bodies 
 they already covered more than of the barrier but they did not leap into the enclosure as though wavering in the fear of some trap 
 they gazed into the dark barricade as one would gaze into a den 
 the light of the torch illuminated only their bayonets their caps and the upper part of their uneasy and angry faces 
 marius had no longer any weapons he had flung away his discharged pistols after firing them but he had caught sight of the barrel of powder in the near the door 
 as he turned half round gazing in that direction a soldier took aim at him 
 at the moment when the soldier was sighting marius a hand was laid on the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it this was done by some one who had darted young workman in velvet trousers 
 the shot sped traversed the hand and possibly also the workman since he fell but the ball did not strike marius all this which was rather to be apprehended than seen through the smoke marius who was entering the hardly noticed still he had in a confused way perceived that aimed at him and the hand which had blocked it and he had heard the discharge but in moments like this the things which one sees vacillate and are precipitated and one pauses for nothing 
 one feels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still and all is cloud 
 the insurgents surprised but not terrified had rallied enjolras had shouted 
 wait 
 fire at random in the first confusion they might in fact wound each other the majority of them had ascended to the window on the first story and to the attic windows whence they commanded the assailants 
 the most determined with enjolras courfeyrac jean prouvaire and combeferre had proudly placed themselves with their backs against the houses at the rear unsheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers and guards who crowned the barricade 
 all this was accomplished without haste with that strange and threatening gravity which precedes engagements 
 they took aim point blank on both sides 
 they were so close that they could talk together without raising their voices 
 when they had reached this point where the spark is on the brink of darting forth an officer in a gorget extended his sword and said 
 lay down your arms 
 fire replied enjolras 
 the two discharges took place at the same moment and all disappeared in smoke 
 an acrid and stifling smoke in which dying and wounded lay with weak dull groans 
 when the smoke cleared away the combatants on both sides could be seen to be thinned out but still in the same positions reloading in silence 
 all at once a thundering voice was heard shouting 
 be off with you or blow up the barricade 
 all turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded 
 marius had entered the and had seized the barrel of powder then he had taken advantage of the smoke and the sort of obscure mist which filled the entrenched enclosure to glide along the barricade as far as that cage of where the torch was fixed to tear it from the torch to replace it by the barrel of powder to thrust the pile of stones under the barrel which was instantly staved in with a sort of horrible this had cost marius but the time necessary to stoop and rise again and now all national guards municipal guards officers soldiers huddled at the other extremity of the barricade gazed stupidly at him as he stood with his foot on the stones his torch in his hand his haughty face illuminated by a fatal resolution drooping the flame of the torch towards that redoubtable pile where they could make out the broken barrel of powder and giving vent to that startling cry 
 be off with you or blow up the barricade 
 marius on that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision of the young revolution after the apparition of the old 
 blow up the barricade said a sergeant and yourself with it 
 marius retorted 
 and myself also 
 and he dropped the torch towards the barrel of powder 
 but there was no longer any one on the barrier 
 the assailants abandoning their dead and wounded flowed back and in disorder towards the extremity of the street and there were again lost in the night 
 it was a headlong flight 
 the barricade was free

 it was a warm dark autumn night it had been raining for four days having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half over a sticky muddy road bolkhovitinov reached litashevka after one at night dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a signboard general staff and throwing down his reins he entered a dark passage 
 the general on duty quick very important said he to someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage 
 he has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night he has not slept said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper you should wake the captain first 
 but this is very important from general dokhturov said bolkhovitinov entering the open door which he had found by feeling in the dark 
 the orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody 
 your honor your honor a courier 
 what that from whom came a sleepy voice 
 from dokhturov and from alexey petrovich napoleon is at forminsk said bolkhovitinov unable to see in the dark who was speaking but guessing by the voice that it was not konovnitsyn 
 the man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself 
 i like waking him he said fumbling for something he is very ill perhaps this is only a rumor 
 here is the dispatch said bolkhovitinov my orders are to give it at once to the general on duty 
 wait a moment light a candle you damned rascal where do you always hide it said the voice of the man who was stretching himself to the orderly this was shcherbinin adjutant found it found it he added 
 the orderly was striking a light and shcherbinin was fumbling for something on the candlestick 
 oh the nasty beasts said he with disgust 
 by the light of the sparks bolkhovitinov saw youthful face as he held the candle and the face of another man who was still asleep this was konovnitsyn 
 when the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up first blue and then red shcherbinin lit the tallow candle from the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running away and looked at the messenger bolkhovitinov was bespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve 
 who gave the report inquired shcherbinin taking the envelope 
 the news is reliable said bolkhovitinov prisoners cossacks and the scouts all say the same thing 
 nothing to be done have to wake him said shcherbinin rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a greatcoat peter petrovich said he konovnitsyn did not stir to the general staff he said with a smile knowing that those words would be sure to arouse him 
 and in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once on handsome resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs but then he suddenly started and his face assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance 
 well what is it from whom he asked immediately but without hurry blinking at the light 
 while listening to the report konovnitsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his boots then he took off his nightcap combed his hair over his temples and donned his cap 
 did you get here quickly let us go to his highness 
 konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time must be lost he did not consider or ask himself whether the news was good or bad that did not interest him he regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his reason but by something else there was within him a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well but that one must not trust to this and still less speak about it but must only attend to own work and he did his work giving his whole strength to the task 
 peter petrovich konovnitsyn like dokhturov seems to have been included merely for sake in the list of the heroes of the barclays raevskis ermolovs platovs and miloradoviches like dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity and information and like dokhturov he never made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult since his appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up in battle he was always under fire so that kutuzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front and like dokhturov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that without clatter or noise constitute the most essential part of the machine 
 coming out of the hut into the damp dark night konovnitsyn frowned partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him of how all that nest of influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news especially bennigsen who ever since tarutino had been at daggers drawn with kutuzov and how they would make suggestions quarrel issue orders and rescind them and this premonition was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be helped 
 and in fact toll to whom he went to communicate the news immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters until konovnitsyn who listened in weary silence reminded him that they must go to see his highness

 end of the verses of jean prouvaire 
 all flocked around marius 
 courfeyrac flung himself on his neck 
 here you are 
 what luck said combeferre 
 you came in opportunely ejaculated bossuet 
 if it had not been for you i should have been dead began courfeyrac again 
 if it had not been for you i should have been gobbled up added gavroche 
 marius asked 
 where is the chief 
 you are he said enjolras 
 marius had had a furnace in his brain all day long now it was a whirlwind 
 this whirlwind which was within him produced on him the effect of being outside of him and of bearing him away it seemed to him that he was already at an immense distance from life his two luminous months of joy and love ending abruptly at that frightful precipice cosette lost to him that barricade m mabeuf getting himself killed for the republic himself the leader of the insurgents all these things appeared to him like a tremendous nightmare he was obliged to make a mental effort to recall the fact that all that surrounded him was real 
 marius had already seen too much of life not to know that nothing is more imminent than the impossible and that what it is always necessary to foresee is the unforeseen 
 he had looked on at his own drama as a piece which one does not understand 
 in the mists which enveloped his thoughts he did not recognize javert who bound to his post had not so much as moved his head during the whole of the attack on the barricade and who had gazed on the revolt seething around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of a judge 
 marius had not even seen him 
 in the meanwhile the assailants did not stir they could be heard marching and swarming through at the end of the street but they did not venture into it either because they were awaiting orders or because they were awaiting reinforcements before hurling themselves afresh on this impregnable redoubt 
 the insurgents had posted sentinels and some of them who were medical students set about caring for the wounded 
 they had thrown the tables out of the with the exception of the two tables reserved for lint and cartridges and of the one on which lay father mabeuf they had added them to the barricade and had replaced them in the with mattresses from the bed of the widow hucheloup and her servants 
 on these mattresses they had laid the wounded 
 as for the three poor creatures who inhabited corinthe no one knew what had become of them they were finally found however hidden in the cellar 
 a poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade 
 the roll was called 
 one of the insurgents was missing 
 and who was it one of the dearest 
 one of the most valiant 
 jean prouvaire he was sought among the wounded he was not there 
 he was sought among the dead he was not there 
 he was evidently a prisoner combeferre said to enjolras 
 they have our friend we have their agent 
 are you set on the death of that spy 
 yes replied enjolras but less so than on the life of jean prouvaire 
 this took place in the near post 
 well resumed combeferre i am going to fasten my handkerchief to my cane and go as a flag of truce to offer to exchange our man for theirs 
 listen said enjolras laying his hand on arm 
 at the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms 
 they heard a manly voice shout 
 vive la france 
 long live france 
 long live the future 
 they recognized the voice of prouvaire 
 a flash passed a report rang out 
 silence fell again 
 they have killed him exclaimed combeferre 
 enjolras glanced at javert and said to him 
 your friends have just shot you

 kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night he often fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime but at night lying on his bed without undressing he generally remained awake thinking 
 so he lay now on his bed supporting his large heavy scarred head on his plump hand with his one eye open meditating and peering into the darkness 
 since bennigsen who corresponded with the emperor and had more influence than anyone else on the staff had begun to avoid him kutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements the lesson of the tarutino battle and of the day before it which kutuzov remembered with pain must he thought have some effect on others too 
 they must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive patience and time are my warriors my champions thought kutuzov he knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green it will fall of itself when ripe but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled the tree is harmed and your teeth are set on edge like an experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded and wounded as only the whole strength of russia could have wounded it but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided question now by the fact of lauriston and barthelemi having been sent and by the reports of the guerrillas kutuzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal but he needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait 
 they want to run to see how they have wounded it wait and we shall see continual maneuvers continual advances thought he what for only to distinguish themselves as if fighting were fun they are like children from whom one get any sensible account of what has happened because they all want to show how well they can fight but not what is needed now 
 and what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me it seems to them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies he remembered the general plan sent him from petersburg they have foreseen everything but the contingencies are endless 
 the undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at borodino was mortal or not had hung over head for a whole month on the one hand the french had occupied moscow on the other kutuzov felt assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal but in any case proofs were needed he had waited a whole month for them and grew more impatient the longer he waited lying on his bed during those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals for doing he imagined all sorts of possible contingencies just like the younger men but with this difference that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them the longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves he imagined all sorts of movements of the napoleonic army as a whole or in sections against petersburg or against him or to outflank him he thought too of the possibility which he feared most of all that napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in moscow awaiting him kutuzov even imagined that army might turn back through medyn and yukhnov but the one thing he could not foresee was what happened the insane convulsive stampede of army during its first eleven days after leaving moscow a stampede which made possible what kutuzov had not yet even dared to think of the complete extermination of the french report about division the guerrillas reports of distress in army rumors of preparations for leaving moscow all confirmed the supposition that the french army was beaten and preparing for flight but these were only suppositions which seemed important to the younger men but not to kutuzov with his sixty years experience he knew what value to attach to rumors knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire and he knew how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary and the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it this question absorbed all his mental powers all else was to him only customary routine to such customary routine belonged his conversations with the staff the letters he wrote from tarutino to madame de stael the reading of novels the distribution of awards his correspondence with petersburg and so on but the destruction of the french which he alone foresaw was his one desire 
 on the night of the eleventh of october he lay leaning on his arm and thinking of that 
 there was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of toll konovnitsyn and bolkhovitinov 
 eh there come in come in what news the field marshal called out to them 
 while a footman was lighting a candle toll communicated the substance of the news 
 who brought it asked kutuzov with a look which when the candle was lit struck toll by its cold severity 
 there can be no doubt about it your highness 
 call him in call him here 
 kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him he screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his own mind 
 tell me tell me friend said he to bolkhovitinov in his low aged voice as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest come nearer nearer what news have you brought me eh that napoleon has left moscow are you sure eh 
 bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had been told to report 
 speak quicker quicker torture me kutuzov interrupted him 
 bolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent awaiting instructions toll was beginning to say something but kutuzov checked him he tried to say something but his face suddenly puckered and wrinkled he waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side of the room to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there 
 o lord my creator thou has heard our prayer said he in a tremulous voice with folded hands russia is saved i thank thee o lord and he wept

 the agony of death after the agony of life 
 a peculiarity of this species of war is that the attack of the barricades is almost always made from the front and that the assailants generally abstain from turning the position either because they fear ambushes or because they are afraid of getting entangled in the tortuous streets 
 the insurgents whole attention had been directed therefore to the grand barricade which was evidently the spot always menaced and there the struggle would infallibly recommence but marius thought of the little barricade and went thither it was deserted and guarded only by the which trembled between the moreover the mondetour alley and the branches of the rue de la petite truanderie and the rue du cygne were profoundly calm 
 as marius was withdrawing after concluding his inspection he heard his name pronounced feebly in the darkness 
 monsieur marius 
 he started for he recognized the voice which had called to him two hours before through the gate in the rue plumet 
 only the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath 
 he looked about him but saw no one 
 marius thought he had been mistaken that it was an illusion added by his mind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing around him 
 he advanced a step in order to quit the distant recess where the barricade lay 
 monsieur marius repeated the voice 
 this time he could not doubt that he had heard it distinctly he looked and saw nothing 
 at your feet said the voice 
 he bent down and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itself towards him 
 it was crawling along the pavement 
 it was this that had spoken to him 
 the allowed him to distinguish a blouse torn trousers of coarse velvet bare feet and something which resembled a pool of blood 
 marius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted towards him and which was saying to him 
 you do not recognize me 
 no 
 eponine 
 marius bent hastily down 
 it was in fact that unhappy child she was dressed in clothes 
 how come you here 
 what are you doing here 
 i am dying said she 
 there are words and incidents which arouse dejected beings marius cried out with a start 
 you are wounded 
 wait i will carry you into the room 
 they will attend to you there 
 is it serious 
 how must i take hold of you in order not to hurt you 
 where do you suffer 
 help 
 my god but why did you come hither 
 and he tried to pass his arm under her in order to raise her 
 she uttered a feeble cry 
 have i hurt you asked marius 
 a little 
 but i only touched your hand 
 she raised her hand to marius and in the middle of that hand marius saw a black hole 
 what is the matter with your hand said he 
 it is pierced 
 pierced 
 yes 
 what with 
 a bullet 
 how 
 did you see a gun aimed at you 
 yes and a hand stopping it 
 it was mine 
 marius was seized with a shudder 
 what madness 
 poor child 
 but so much the better if that is all it is nothing let me carry you to a bed 
 they will dress your wound one does not die of a pierced hand 
 she murmured 
 the bullet traversed my hand but it came out through my back it is useless to remove me from this spot 
 i will tell you how you can care for me better than any surgeon 
 sit down near me on this stone 
 he obeyed she laid her head on marius knees and without looking at him she said 
 oh 
 how good this is 
 how comfortable this is 
 there i no longer suffer 
 she remained silent for a moment then she turned her face with an effort and looked at marius 
 do you know what monsieur marius 
 it puzzled me because you entered that garden it was stupid because it was i who showed you that house and then i ought to have said to myself that a young man like you 
 she paused and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly existed in her mind she resumed with a heartrending smile 
 you thought me ugly you 
 she continued 
 you see you are lost 
 now no one can get out of the barricade it was i who led you here by the way 
 you are going to die i count upon that 
 and yet when i saw them taking aim at you i put my hand on the muzzle of the gun 
 how queer it is 
 but it was because i wanted to die before you 
 when i received that bullet i dragged myself here no one saw me no one picked me up i was waiting for you i said 
 so he is not coming 
 oh if you only knew 
 i bit my blouse i suffered so 
 now i am well do you remember the day i entered your chamber and when i looked at myself in your mirror and the day when i came to you on the boulevard near the washerwomen 
 how the birds sang 
 that was a long time ago 
 you gave me a hundred sous and i said to you i want your money 
 i hope you picked up your coin you are not rich 
 i did not think to tell you to pick it up the sun was shining bright and it was not cold 
 do you remember monsieur marius 
 oh 
 how happy i am 
 every one is going to die 
 she had a mad grave and air 
 her torn blouse disclosed her bare throat 
 as she talked she pressed her pierced hand to her breast where there was another hole and whence there spurted from moment to moment a stream of blood like a jet of wine from an open 
 marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion 
 oh she resumed it is coming again i am stifling 
 she caught up her blouse and bit it and her limbs stiffened on the pavement 
 at that moment the young crow executed by little gavroche resounded through the barricade 
 the child had mounted a table to load his gun and was singing gayly the song then so popular 
 en voyant lafayette on beholding lafayette le gendarme repete the gendarme repeats sauvons nous sauvons nous 
 let us flee let us flee 
 sauvons nous let us flee 
 eponine raised herself and listened then she murmured 
 it is he 
 and turning to marius 
 my brother is here 
 he must not see me 
 he would scold me 
 your brother inquired marius who was meditating in the most bitter and sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the thenardiers which his father had bequeathed to him who is your brother 
 that little fellow 
 the one who is singing 
 yes 
 marius made a movement 
 oh go away said she it will not be long now 
 she was sitting almost upright but her voice was very low and broken by hiccoughs 
 at intervals the death rattle interrupted her 
 she put her face as near that of marius as possible 
 she added with a strange expression 
 listen i do not wish to play you a trick 
 i have a letter in my pocket for you 
 i was told to put it in the post 
 i kept it i did not want to have it reach you 
 but perhaps you will be angry with me for it when we meet again presently 
 take your letter 
 she grasped marius hand convulsively with her pierced hand but she no longer seemed to feel her sufferings 
 she put marius hand in the pocket of her blouse 
 there in fact marius felt a paper 
 take it said she 
 marius took the letter 
 she made a sign of satisfaction and contentment 
 now for my trouble promise me 
 and she stopped 
 what asked marius 
 promise me 
 i promise 
 promise to give me a kiss on my brow when i am shall feel it 
 she dropped her head again on marius knees and her eyelids closed he thought the poor soul had departed 
 eponine remained motionless all at once at the very moment when marius fancied her asleep forever she slowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity of death and said to him in a tone whose sweetness seemed already to proceed from another world 
 and by the way monsieur marius i believe that i was a little bit in love with you 
 she tried to smile once more and expired

 from the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all activity was directed toward restraining his troops by authority by guile and by entreaty from useless attacks maneuvers or encounters with the perishing enemy dokhturov went to but kutuzov lingered with the main army and gave orders for the evacuation of kaluga a retreat beyond which town seemed to him quite possible 
 everywhere kutuzov retreated but the enemy without waiting for his retreat fled in the opposite direction 
 historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at tarutino and and make conjectures as to what would have happened had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern provinces 
 but not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing into those southern provinces for the russian army did not bar his way the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army for then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin how could that army which had found abundant supplies in moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them and on arriving at smolensk had looted provisions instead of storing them how could that army recuperate in kaluga province which was inhabited by russians such as those who lived in moscow and where fire had the same property of consuming what was set ablaze 
 that army could not recover anywhere since the battle of borodino and the pillage of moscow it had borne within itself as it were the chemical elements of dissolution 
 the members of what had once been an army napoleon himself and all his soldiers fled without knowing whither each concerned only to make his escape as quickly as possible from this position of the hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious 
 so it came about that at the council at when the generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions all mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the soldier mouton who speaking last said what they all felt that the one thing needful was to get away as quickly as possible and no one not even napoleon could say anything against that truth which they all recognized 
 but though they all realized that it was necessary to get away there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee an external shock was needed to overcome that shame and this shock came in due time it was what the french called le hourra de 
 the day after the council at napoleon rode out early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and an escort on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the previous and of the impending battle some cossacks on the prowl for booty fell in with the emperor and very nearly captured him if the cossacks did not capture napoleon then what saved him was the very thing that was destroying the french army the booty on which the cossacks fell here as at tarutino they went after plunder leaving the men disregarding napoleon they rushed after the plunder and napoleon managed to escape 
 when les enfants du don might so easily have taken the emperor himself in the midst of his army it was clear that there was nothing for it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest familiar road napoleon with his stomach understood that hint not feeling his former agility and boldness and under the influence of the fright the cossacks had given him he at once agreed with mouton and issued orders as the historians tell us to retreat by the smolensk road 
 that napoleon agreed with mouton and that the army retreated does not prove that napoleon caused it to retreat but that the forces which influenced the whole army and directed it along the mozhaysk that is the smolensk road acted simultaneously on him also

 gavroche as a profound calculator of distances 
 marius kept his promise 
 he dropped a kiss on that livid brow where the icy perspiration stood in beads 
 this was no infidelity to cosette it was a gentle and pensive farewell to an unhappy soul 
 it was not without a tremor that he had taken the letter which eponine had given him 
 he had immediately felt that it was an event of weight 
 he was impatient to read it the heart of man is so constituted that the unhappy child had hardly closed her eyes when marius began to think of unfolding this paper 
 he laid her gently on the ground and went away 
 something told him that he could not peruse that letter in the presence of that body 
 he drew near to a candle in the it was a small note folded and sealed with a elegant care 
 the address was in a hand and ran 
 to monsieur monsieur marius pontmercy at m rue de la verrerie no 
 he broke the seal and read 
 my dearest alas my father insists on our setting out immediately we shall be this evening in the rue de arme no in a week we shall be in england 
 cosette 
 june th 
 such was the innocence of their love that marius was not even acquainted with handwriting 
 what had taken place may be related in a few words 
 eponine had been the cause of everything 
 after the evening of the d of june she had cherished a double idea to defeat the projects of her father and the ruffians on the house of the rue plumet and to separate marius and cosette 
 she had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came across who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman while eponine disguised herself like a man it was she who had conveyed to jean valjean in the champ de mars the expressive warning 
 leave your house 
 jean valjean had in fact returned home and had said to cosette 
 we set out this evening and we go to the rue de arme with toussaint next week we shall be in london 
 cosette utterly overwhelmed by this unexpected blow had hastily penned a couple of lines to marius 
 but how was she to get the letter to the post she never went out alone and toussaint surprised at such a commission would certainly show the letter to m fauchelevent in this dilemma cosette had caught sight through the fence of eponine in clothes who now prowled incessantly around the garden cosette had called to this young workman and had handed him five francs and the letter saying 
 carry this letter immediately to its address 
 eponine had put the letter in her pocket 
 the next day on the th of june she went to quarters to inquire for marius not for the purpose of delivering the letter thing which every jealous and loving soul will see there she had waited for marius or at least for courfeyrac still for the purpose of seeing 
 when courfeyrac had told her we are going to the barricades an idea flashed through her mind to fling herself into that death as she would have done into any other and to thrust marius into it also 
 she had followed courfeyrac had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of construction and quite certain since marius had received no warning and since she had intercepted the letter that he would go at dusk to his trysting place for every evening she had betaken herself to the rue plumet had there awaited marius and had sent him in the name of his friends the appeal which would she thought lead him to the barricade 
 she reckoned on marius despair when he should fail to find cosette she was not mistaken she had returned to the rue de la chanvrerie herself 
 what she did there the reader has just seen 
 she died with the tragic joy of jealous hearts who drag the beloved being into their own death and who say no one shall have him 
 marius covered letter with kisses 
 so she loved him for one moment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now then he said to himself 
 she is going away 
 her father is taking her to england and my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage nothing is changed in our fates 
 dreamers like marius are subject to supreme attacks of dejection and desperate resolves are the result the fatigue of living is insupportable death is sooner over with then he reflected that he had still two duties to fulfil 
 to inform cosette of his death and send her a final farewell and to save from the impending catastrophe which was in preparation that poor child brother and son 
 he had a about him the same one which had contained the in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love for cosette 
 he tore out a leaf and wrote on it a few lines in pencil 
 our marriage was impossible 
 i asked my grandfather he refused i have no fortune neither hast thou 
 i hastened to thee thou wert no longer there 
 thou knowest the promise that i gave thee i shall keep it 
 i die 
 i love thee 
 when thou readest this my soul will be near thee and thou wilt smile 
 having nothing wherewith to seal this letter he contented himself with folding the paper in four and added the address 
 to mademoiselle cosette fauchelevent at m rue de arme no 
 having folded the letter he stood in thought for a moment drew out his again opened it and wrote with the same pencil these four lines on the first page 
 my name is marius pontmercy 
 carry my body to my grandfather m gillenormand rue des no in the marais 
 he put his pocketbook back in his pocket then he called gavroche 
 the gamin at the sound of marius voice ran up to him with his merry and devoted air 
 will you do something for me 
 anything said gavroche 
 good god if it had not been for you i should have been done for 
 do you see this letter 
 yes 
 take it 
 leave the barricade instantly gavroche began to scratch his ear uneasily and morning you will deliver it at its address to mademoiselle cosette at m rue de arme no 
 the heroic child replied 
 well but in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken and i shall not be there 
 the barricade will not be attacked until daybreak according to all appearances and will not be taken before noon 
 the fresh respite which the assailants were granting to the barricade had in fact been prolonged 
 it was one of those intermissions which frequently occur in nocturnal combats which are always followed by an increase of rage 
 well said gavroche what if i were to go and carry your letter 
 it will be too late 
 the barricade will probably be blockaded all the streets will be guarded and you will not be able to get out go at once 
 gavroche could think of no reply to this and stood there in indecision scratching his ear sadly 
 all at once he took the letter with one of those birdlike movements which were common with him 
 all right said he 
 and he started off at a run through mondetour lane 
 an idea had occurred to gavroche which had brought him to a decision but he had not mentioned it for fear that marius might offer some objection to it 
 this was the idea 
 it is barely midnight the rue de arme is not far off i will go and deliver the letter at once and i shall get back in time

 chapter xix 
 
 a man in motion always devises an aim for that motion to be able to go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the end of those thousand miles one must have the prospect of a promised land to have the strength to move 
 the promised land for the french during their advance had been moscow during their retreat it was their native land but that native land was too far off and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself today i shall get to a place miles off where i shall rest and spend the night and during the first journey that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires and the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd 
 for the french retreating along the old smolensk road the final goal their native land was too remote and their immediate goal was smolensk toward which all their desires and hopes enormously intensified in the mass urged them on it was not that they knew that much food and fresh troops awaited them in smolensk nor that they were told so on the contrary their superior officers and napoleon himself knew that provisions were scarce there but because this alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present privations so both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves and pushed on to smolensk as to a promised land 
 coming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising energy and rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of french into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy there was another cause binding them together their great numbers as with the physical law of gravity their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself in their hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation 
 each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery but on the one hand the force of this common attraction to smolensk their goal drew each of them in the same direction on the other hand an army corps could not surrender to a company and though the french availed themselves of every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the slightest decent pretext such pretexts did not always occur their very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the russians to stop this movement to which the french were directing all their energies beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of decomposition 
 a lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously there is a certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow on the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow becomes 
 of the russian commanders kutuzov alone understood this when the flight of the french army along the smolensk road became well defined what konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of october began to occur the superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves to cut off to seize to capture and to overthrow the french and all clamored for action 
 kutuzov alone used all his power and such power is very limited in the case of any commander in chief to prevent an attack 
 he could not tell them what we say now why fight why block the road losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches what is the use of that when a third of their army has melted away on the road from moscow to vyazma without any battle but drawing from his aged wisdom what they could understand he told them of the golden bridge and they laughed at and slandered him flinging themselves on rending and exulting over the dying beast 
 ermolov miloradovich platov and others in proximity to the french near vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two french corps and by way of reporting their intention to kutuzov they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope 
 and try as kutuzov might to restrain the troops our men attacked trying to bar the road infantry regiments we are told advanced to the attack with music and with drums beating and killed and lost thousands of men 
 but they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the french army closing up more firmly at the danger continued while steadily melting away to pursue its fatal path to smolensk

 book rue de arme 
 chapter i 
 
 a drinker is a babbler 
 what are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections of the soul 
 man is a depth still greater than the people jean valjean at that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval every sort of gulf had opened again within him 
 he also was trembling like paris on the brink of an obscure and formidable revolution a few hours had sufficed to bring this about 
 his destiny and his conscience had suddenly been covered with gloom 
 of him also as well as of paris it might have been said 
 two principles are face to face 
 the white angel and the black angel are about to seize each other on the bridge of the abyss 
 which of the two will hurl the other over 
 who will carry the day 
 on the evening preceding this same th of june jean valjean accompanied by cosette and toussaint had installed himself in the rue de arme 
 a change awaited him there 
 cosette had not quitted the rue plumet without making an effort at resistance 
 for the first time since they had lived side by side will and the will of jean valjean had proved to be distinct and had been in opposition at least if they had not clashed there had been objections on one side and inflexibility on the other the abrupt advice 
 leave your house hurled at jean valjean by a stranger had alarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory he thought that he had been traced and followed 
 cosette had been obliged to give way 
 both had arrived in the rue de arme without opening their lips and without uttering a word each being absorbed in his own personal preoccupation jean valjean so uneasy that he did not notice sadness cosette so sad that she did not notice jean uneasiness 
 jean valjean had taken toussaint with him a thing which he had never done in his previous absences 
 he perceived the possibility of not returning to the rue plumet and he could neither leave toussaint behind nor confide his secret to her 
 besides he felt that she was devoted and trustworthy 
 treachery between master and servant begins in curiosity 
 now toussaint as though she had been destined to be jean servant was not curious she stammered in her peasant dialect of barneville 
 i am made so i do my work the rest is no affair of mine 
 in this departure from the rue plumet which had been almost a flight jean valjean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise baptized by cosette the inseparable full trunks would have required porters and porters are witnesses a fiacre had been summoned to the door on the rue de babylone and they had taken their departure 
 it was with difficulty that toussaint had obtained permission to pack up a little linen and clothes and a few toilet articles cosette had taken only her portfolio and her 
 jean valjean with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery of this departure had arranged to quit the pavilion of the rue plumet only at dusk which had allowed cosette time to write her note to marius they had arrived in the rue de arme after night had fully fallen 
 they had gone to bed in silence 
 the lodgings in the rue de arme were situated on a back court on the second floor and were composed of two a and a kitchen adjoining the with a garret where there was a and which fell to share the was an antechamber as well and separated the two bedrooms 
 the apartment was provided with all necessary utensils 
 people confidence as foolishly as they lose it human nature is so constituted 
 hardly had jean valjean reached the rue de arme when his anxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated there are soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on the mind 
 an obscure street peaceable inhabitants 
 jean valjean experienced an indescribable contagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient paris which is so narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse beam placed on two posts which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the clamorous city dimly lighted at and is so to speak incapable of emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries old which hold their peace like ancients as they are there was a touch of stagnant oblivion in that street 
 jean valjean drew his breath once more there 
 how could he be found there 
 his first care was to place the inseparable beside him 
 he slept well 
 night brings wisdom we may add night soothes on the following morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay he thought the charming though it was hideous furnished with an old round table a long sideboard surmounted by a slanting mirror a dilapidated and several plain chairs which were encumbered with packages 
 in one of these packages jean uniform of a national guard was visible through a rent 
 as for cosette she had had toussaint take some broth to her room and did not make her appearance until evening 
 about five toussaint who was going and coming and busying herself with the tiny establishment set on the table a cold chicken which cosette out of deference to her father consented to glance at 
 that done cosette under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache had bade jean valjean good night and had shut herself up in her chamber jean valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good appetite and with his elbows on the table having gradually recovered his serenity had regained possession of his sense of security 
 while he was discussing this modest dinner he had twice or thrice noticed in a confused way stammering words as she said to him 
 monsieur there is something going on they are fighting in paris 
 but absorbed in a throng of inward calculations he had paid no heed to it 
 to tell the truth he had not heard her he rose and began to pace from the door to the window and from the window to the door growing ever more serene 
 with this calm cosette his sole anxiety recurred to his thoughts not that he was troubled by this headache a little nervous crisis a young fit of sulks the cloud of a moment there would be nothing left of it in a day or two but he meditated on the future and as was his habit he thought of it with pleasure 
 after all he saw no obstacle to their happy life resuming its course at certain hours everything seems impossible at others everything appears easy jean valjean was in the midst of one of these good hours they generally succeed the bad ones as day follows night by virtue of that law of succession and of contrast which lies at the very foundation of nature and which superficial minds call antithesis in this peaceful street where he had taken refuge jean valjean got rid of all that had been troubling him for some time past this very fact that he had seen many shadows made him begin to perceive a little azure 
 to have quitted the rue plumet without complications or incidents was one good step already accomplished perhaps it would be wise to go abroad if only for a few months and to set out for london 
 well they would go 
 what difference did it make to him whether he was in france or in england provided he had cosette beside him 
 cosette was his nation 
 cosette sufficed for his happiness the idea that he perhaps did not suffice for happiness that idea which had formerly been the cause of his fever and sleeplessness did not even present itself to his mind he was in a state of collapse from all his past sufferings and he was fully entered on optimism 
 cosette was by his side she seemed to be his an optical illusion which every one has experienced he arranged in his own mind with all sorts of felicitous devices his departure for england with cosette and he beheld his felicity reconstituted wherever he pleased in the perspective of his revery 
 as he paced to and fro with long strides his glance suddenly encountered something strange 
 in the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard he saw the four lines which follow 
 my dearest alas my father insists on our setting out immediately we shall be this evening in the rue de arme no in a week we shall be in england 
 cosette 
 june th 
 jean valjean halted perfectly haggard 
 cosette on her arrival had placed her on the sideboard in front of the mirror and utterly absorbed in her agony of grief had forgotten it and left it there without even observing that she had left it wide open and open at precisely the page on which she had laid to dry the four lines which she had penned and which she had given in charge of the young workman in the rue plumet the writing had been printed off on the blotter 
 the mirror reflected the writing 
 the result was what is called in geometry the symmetrical image so that the writing reversed on the blotter was righted in the mirror and presented its natural appearance and jean valjean had beneath his eyes the letter written by cosette to marius on the preceding evening 
 it was simple and withering 
 jean valjean stepped up to the mirror 
 he read the four lines again but he did not believe them 
 they produced on him the effect of appearing in a flash of lightning 
 it was a hallucination it was impossible 
 it was not so 
 little by little his perceptions became more precise he looked at and the consciousness of the reality returned to him 
 he caught up the blotter and said 
 it comes from there 
 he feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter the reversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl and he saw no sense in it 
 then he said to himself but this signifies nothing there is nothing written here and he drew a long breath with inexpressible relief 
 who has not experienced those foolish joys in horrible instants 
 the soul does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted all illusions 
 he held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the dupe 
 all at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again and again he beheld the vision 
 there were the four lines outlined with inexorable clearness 
 this time it was no mirage the recurrence of a vision is a reality it was palpable it was the writing restored in the mirror 
 he understood 
 jean valjean tottered dropped the blotter and fell into the old beside the buffet with drooping head and glassy eyes in utter bewilderment 
 he told himself that it was plain that the light of the world had been eclipsed forever and that cosette had written that to some one 
 then he heard his soul which had become terrible once more give vent to a dull roar in the gloom try then the effect of taking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage 
 strange and sad to say at that very moment marius had not yet received letter chance had treacherously carried it 
 to jean valjean before delivering it to marius 
 up to that day jean valjean had not been vanquished by trial 
 he had been subjected to fearful proofs no violence of bad fortune had been spared him the ferocity of fate armed with all vindictiveness and all social scorn had taken him for her prey and had raged against him he had accepted every extremity when it had been necessary he had sacrificed his inviolability as a reformed man had yielded up his liberty risked his head lost everything suffered everything and he had remained disinterested and stoical to such a point that he might have been thought to be absent from himself like a martyr his conscience inured to every assault of destiny might have appeared to be forever impregnable 
 well any one who had beheld his spiritual self would have been obliged to concede that it weakened at that moment 
 it was because of all the tortures which he had undergone in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him this was the most terrible 
 never had such pincers seized him hitherto 
 he felt the mysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities 
 he felt the plucking at the strange chord alas the supreme trial let us say rather the only trial is the loss of the beloved being 
 poor old jean valjean certainly did not love cosette otherwise than as a father but we have already remarked above that into this paternity the widowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love he loved cosette as his daughter and he loved her as his mother and he loved her as his sister and as he had never had either a woman to love or a wife as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest that sentiment also the most impossible to lose was mingled with the rest vague ignorant pure with the purity of blindness unconscious celestial angelic divine less like a sentiment than like an instinct less like an instinct than like an imperceptible and invisible but real attraction and love properly speaking was in his immense tenderness for cosette like the thread of gold in the mountain concealed and virgin 
 let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already indicated 
 no marriage was possible between them not even that of souls and yet it is certain that their destinies were wedded 
 with the exception of cosette that is to say with the exception of a childhood jean valjean had never in the whole of his long life known anything of that which may be loved the passions and loves which succeed each other had not produced in him those successive green growths tender green or dark green which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winter and in men who pass fifty 
 in short and we have insisted on it more than once all this interior fusion all this whole of which the sum total was a lofty virtue ended in rendering jean valjean a father to cosette a strange father forged from the grandfather the son the brother and the husband that existed in jean valjean a father in whom there was included even a mother a father who loved cosette and adored her and who held that child as his light his home his family his country his paradise 
 thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come that she was escaping from him that she was slipping from his hands that she was gliding from him like a cloud like water when he had before his eyes this crushing proof 
 another is the goal of her heart another is the wish of her life there is a dearest one i am no longer anything but her father i no longer exist when he could no longer doubt when he said to himself 
 she is going away from me the grief which he felt surpassed the bounds of possibility to have done all that he had done for the purpose of ending like this and the very idea of being nothing 
 then as we have just said a quiver of revolt ran through him from head to foot 
 he felt even in the very roots of his hair the immense reawakening of egotism and the i in this abyss howled 
 there is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil a despairing certainty does not make its way into a man without thrusting aside and breaking certain profound elements which in some cases are the very man himself 
 grief when it attains this shape is a headlong flight of all the forces of the conscience these are fatal crises 
 few among us emerge from them still like ourselves and firm in duty 
 when the limit of endurance is overstepped the most imperturbable virtue is disconcerted jean valjean took the blotter again and convinced himself afresh he remained bowed and as though petrified and with staring eyes over those four unobjectionable lines and there arose within him such a cloud that one might have thought that everything in this soul was crumbling away 
 he examined this revelation athwart the exaggerations of revery with an apparent and terrifying calmness for it is a fearful thing when a calmness reaches the coldness of the statue 
 he measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without his having a suspicion of the fact he recalled his fears of the preceding summer so foolishly dissipated he recognized the precipice it was still the same only jean valjean was no longer on the brink he was at the bottom of it 
 the unprecedented and thing about it was that he had fallen without perceiving it 
 all the light of his life had departed while he still fancied that he beheld the sun 
 his instinct did not hesitate 
 he put together certain circumstances certain dates certain blushes and certain pallors on part and he said to himself 
 it is he 
 the divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never misses its aim 
 he struck marius with his first conjecture he did not know the name but he found the man instantly he distinctly perceived in the background of the implacable conjuration of his memories the unknown prowler of the luxembourg that wretched seeker of love adventures that idler of romance that idiot that coward for it is cowardly to come and make eyes at young girls who have beside them a father who loves them 
 after he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man was at the bottom of this situation and that everything proceeded from that quarter he jean valjean the regenerated man the man who had so labored over his soul the man who had made so many efforts to resolve all life all misery and all unhappiness into love looked into his own breast and there beheld a spectre hate 
 great griefs contain something of dejection 
 they discourage one with existence 
 the man into whom they enter feels something within him withdraw from him 
 in his youth their visits are lugubrious later on they are sinister 
 alas if despair is a fearful thing when the blood is hot when the hair is black when the head is erect on the body like the flame on the torch when the roll of destiny still retains its full thickness when the heart full of desirable love still possesses beats which can be returned to it when one has time for redress when all women and all smiles and all the future and all the horizon are before one when the force of life is complete what is it in old age when the years hasten on growing ever paler to that twilight hour when one begins to behold the stars of the tomb 
 while he was meditating toussaint entered 
 jean valjean rose and asked her 
 in what quarter is it 
 do you know 
 toussaint was struck dumb and could only answer him 
 what is it sir 
 jean valjean began again 
 did you not tell me that just now that there is fighting going on 
 ah yes sir replied toussaint 
 it is in the direction of 
 there is a mechanical movement which comes to us unconsciously from the most profound depths of our thought 
 it was no doubt under the impulse of a movement of this sort and of which he was hardly conscious that jean valjean five minutes later found himself in the street 
 bareheaded he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house he seemed to be listening 
 night had come

 book fourteen 
 chapter i 
 
 the battle of borodino with the occupation of moscow that followed it and the flight of the french without further conflicts is one of the most instructive phenomena in history 
 all historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength of states and nations increases or decreases 
 strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor having quarreled with another collects an army fights his army gains a victory by killing three five or ten thousand men and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions all the facts of history as far as we know it confirm the truth of the statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another is the cause or at least an essential indication of an increase or decrease in the strength of the nation even though it is unintelligible why the defeat of an army a hundredth part of a nation should oblige that whole nation to submit an army gains a victory and at once the rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated an army has suffered defeat and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated 
 so according to history it has been found from the most ancient times and so it is to our own day all wars serve to confirm this rule in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army austria loses its rights and the rights and the strength of france increase the victories of the french at jena and auerstadt destroy the independent existence of prussia 
 but then in the french gain a victory near moscow moscow is taken and after that with no further battles it is not russia that ceases to exist but the french army of six hundred thousand and then napoleonic france itself to strain the facts to fit the rules of history to say that the field of battle at borodino remained in the hands of the russians or that after moscow there were other battles that destroyed army is impossible 
 after the french victory at borodino there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious yet the french army ceased to exist what does this mean if it were an example taken from the history of china we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon which is the historians usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part we might treat it as an exception but this event occurred before our fathers eyes and for them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland and it happened in the greatest of all known wars 
 the period of the campaign of from the battle of borodino to the expulsion of the french proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors nor even in armies and battles but in something else 
 the french historians describing the condition of the french army before it left moscow affirm that all was in order in the grand army except the cavalry the artillery and the transport there was no forage for the horses or the cattle that was a misfortune no one could remedy for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the french have it 
 the victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants karp and vlas who after the french had evacuated moscow drove in their carts to pillage the town and in general personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings and the whole innumerable multitude of such peasants did not bring their hay to moscow for the high price offered them but burned it instead 
 let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing the fencing has gone on for some time suddenly one of the combatants feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his life throws down his rapier and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it then let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and desiring to conceal the facts of the case insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to all the rules of art one can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel 
 the fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was the french army his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up the cudgel was the russian people those who try to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described the event 
 after the burning of smolensk a war began which did not follow any previous traditions of war the burning of towns and villages the retreats after battles the blow dealt at borodino and the renewed retreat the burning of moscow the capture of marauders the seizure of transports and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules 
 napoleon felt this and from the time he took up the correct fencing attitude in moscow and instead of his rapier saw a cudgel raised above his head he did not cease to complain to kutuzov and to the emperor alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the rules as if there were any rules for killing people in spite of the complaints of the french as to the nonobservance of the rules in spite of the fact that to some highly placed russians it seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules and to make an adroit thrust en prime and so on the cudgel of the war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength and without consulting tastes or rules and regardless of anything else it rose and fell with stupid simplicity but consistently and belabored the french till the whole invasion had perished 
 and it is well for a people who do not as the french did in salute according to all the rules of art and presenting the hilt of their rapier gracefully and politely hand it to their magnanimous conqueror but at the moment of trial without asking what rules others have adopted in similar cases simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion

 of the true greatness of kingdoms estates 
 the speech of themistocles the athenian which was haughty and arrogant in taking so much to himself had been a grave and wise observation and censure applied at large to others desired at a feast to touch a lute he said he could not fiddle but yet he could make a small town a great city these words holpen a little with a metaphor may express two differing abilities in those mat deal in business of estate for if a true survey be taken of counsellors and statesmen there may be found though rarely those which can make a small state great and yet cannot fiddle as on the other side there will be found a great many that can fiddle very cunningly but yet are so far from being able to make a small state great as their gift lieth the other way to bring a great and flourishing estate to ruin and decay and certainly those degenerate arts and shifts whereby many counsellor and governors gain both favour with their masters and estimation with the vulgar deserve no better name then fiddling being things rather pleasing for the time and graceful to themselves only than tending to the weal and advancement of the state which they serve 
 there are also no doubt counsellor and governors which may be held sufficient negotus pares able to manage affairs and to keep them from precipices and manifest inconveniences which nevertheless are far from the ability to raise and amplify an estate in power means and fortune but be the workmen what they may be let us speak of the work that is the true greatness of kingdoms and estates and the means thereof an argument fit for great and mighty princes to have in their hand to the end that neither by their forces they lose themselves in vain enterprises nor on the other side by undervaluing them they descend to fearful and pusillanimous counsels 
 
 the greatness of an estate in bulk and territory doth fall under measure and the 
 greatness of finances and revenue doth fall under computation the population may 
 appear by musters and the number and greatness of cities and towns by cards and 
 maps but yet there is not anything amongst civil affairs more subject to error than 
 the right valuation and true judgement concerning the power and forces of an estate 
 
 the kingdom of heaven is compared not to any great kernel or nut but to a grain 
 of which is one of the least grains but hath in it a property and spirit hastily to get up and spread so are there states great in territory and yet not 
 apt to enlarge or command and some that have but a small dimension of stem and yet apt to be the foundations of great monarchies 
 
 walled towns stored arsenals and armouries goodly races of horse chariots of war elephants ordnance artillery and the like all this is but a sheep in a 
 skin except the breed and disposition of the people be stout and warlike nay number itself in armies importeth not much where the people is of weak courage for as virgil saith it never troubles a wolf how many the sheep be the army of the persians in the plains of arbela was such a vast sea of people as it did somewhat astonish the commanders in army who came to him therefore and wished him to set upon them by night but he answered he would not pilfer the victory 
 and the defeat was easy when tigranes the armenian being encamped upon a hill with four hundred thousand men discovered the army of the romans being not above fourteen thousand marching towards him he made himself merry with it and said yonder men are too many for an ambassage and too few for a fight but before the sun set he found them enough to give him the chase with infinite slaughter many are the examples of the great odds between number and courage so that a man may truly make a judgement that the principal point of greatness in any state is to have a race of military men neither is money the sinews of war as it is trivially said where the sinews of arms in base and effeminate people are failing for solon said well to croesus when in ostentation he showed him his gold sir if any other come that hath better iron than you he will be master of all this gold therefore let any prince or state think soberly of his forces except his militia of natives be of good and valiant soldiers 
 
 and let princes on the other side that have subjects of martial disposition know 
 their own strength unless they be otherwise wanting unto themselves as for mercenary forces which is the help in this case all examples show that whatsoever estate or prince doth rest upon them he may spread his feathers for a time but he will mew them soon after 
 
 the blessing of judah and issachar will never meet that the same people or nation 
 should be both the whelp and the ass between burthens neither will it be 
 that a people with taxes should ever become valiant and martial it is 
 true that taxes levied by consent of the estate do abate courage less as 
 it hath been seen notably in the excises of the low countries and in some degree 
 in the subsidies of england for you must note that we speak now of the heart and not of the purse so that although the same tribute and tax laid by consent or by imposing be all one to the purse yet it works diversely upon the courage so that you may conclude that no people with tribute is fit for empire 
 let states that aim at greatness take heed how their nobility and gentlemen do 
 multiply too fast for that maketh the common subject grow to be a peasant and base swain driven out of heart and in effect but the labourer 
 even as you may see in coppice woods if you leave your staddles too thick you shall never have clean underwood but shrubs and bushes so in countries if the gentlemen be too many the commons will be base and you will bring it to that that not the hundred poll will be fit for an helmet especially as to the infantry which is the nerve of an army and so there will be 
 great population and little strength this which i speak of hath been nowhere 
 better seen then by comparing of england and france whereof england though far less in territory and population hath been nevertheless an overmatch in regard the middle people of england make good soldiers which the peasants of france do not and herein the device of king henry the seventh whereof i have spoken largely in the history of his life was profound and admirable in making farms and houses of husbandry of a standard that is maintained with such a proportion of land unto mem as may breed a subject to live in convenient plenty and no servile condition and to keep the plough in the hands of the owners and not mere hirelings 
 and thus indeed you shall attain to character which he gives to ancient italy terra potens arrnis atque ubere glebae neither is that state which for anything 
 i know is almost peculiar to england and hardly to be found anywhere else except 
 it be perhaps in poland to be passed over i mean die state of free servants and 
 attendants upon noblemen and gentlemen which are no ways inferior unto the yeomanry for arms 
 and therefore out of all question the splendour and magnificence and 
 great retinues and hospitality of noblemen and gentlemen received into custom doth much conduce unto martial greatness whereas contrariwise the close and reserved living of noblemen and gentlemen causeth a penury of military forces 
 
 by all means it is to be procured that the trunk of tree of monarchy be great enough to bear the branches and the boughs that is that the natural subjects of the crown or state bear a sufficient proportion to the stronger subjects that they govern therefore all states that are liberal of naturalisation towards strangers are fit for empire for to think that an handful of people can with the greatest courage and policy in the world embrace too large extent of dominion it may hold for a time but it will fail suddenly the spartans were a nice people in point of naturalisation whereby while they kept their compass they stood firm but when they did spread and their boughs were becoming too great for their stem they became a windfall upon the sudden never any state was in this point so open to receive strangers into their body as were the romans 
 therefore it sorted with them accordingly for they grew to the greatest monarchy their manner was to grant naturalisation which they called ins civitatis and to grant it in the highest degree that is not only ins conmercci ius connubii ius heredhatis but also ius suffragii and ius honorum and this not to singular persons alone but likewise to whole families yea to cities and sometimes to nations add to this their custom of plantation of colonies whereby the roman plant was removed into the soil of other nations and putting both constitutions together you will say that it was not the roman that spread upon the world but it was the world that spread upon the romans and that was the sure way of greatness i have marvelled sometimes at spain how they clasp and contain so large dominions with so few natural spaniards but sure the whole compass of spain is a very great body of a tree far above rome and sparta at the first and besides though they have not had that usage to naturalise liberally yet they have that which is next to it that is to employ almost indifferently all nations in their militia of ordinary soldiers yea and sometimes in their highest commands nay it seemeth at this instant they are sensible of this want of natives as by the pragmatical sanction now published appeareth 
 
 it is certain that sedentary and arts and delicate manufactures that 
 require rather the finger than the arm have in their nature a contrariety to a 
 military disposition and generally all warlike people are a little idle and love 
 danger better then travail neither must they be too much broken of it if they shall be preserved in vigour 
 therefore it was great advantage in the ancient states of sparta athens rome and others that they had the use of slaves which commonly did rid those manufactures 
 
 but that is abolished in greatest part by the christian law that which cometh 
 nearest to it is to leave those arts chiefly to strangers which for that purpose 
 are the more easily to be received and to contain the principal bulk of the vulgar 
 natives within those three kinds tillers of the ground free servants and 
 of strong and manly arts as smiths masons carpenters etc not 
 reckoning professed soldiers 
 
 but above all for empire and greatness it importeth most that a nation do profess 
 arms as their principal honour study and occupation for the things which we 
 formerly have spoken of are but habitations towards arms and what is habilitation 
 without intention and act romulus after his death as they report or feign sent 
 a present to the romans that above all they should intend arms and then they 
 should prove the greatest empire of the world the fabric of the state of sparta was 
 wholly though not wisely framed and composed to that scope and end the 
 persians and macedonians had it for a flash the gauls germans goths saxons normans and others had it for a time the turks have it at this day though in great declination 
 
 of christian europe they that have it are in effect only the spaniards but it 
 is so plain that every man profiteth in that he most intendeth that it needeth not 
 to be stood upon it is enough to point at it that no nation which doth not directly 
 profess arms may look to have greatness fall into their mouths and on the other 
 side it is a most certain oracle of time that those states that continue long in that profession as the romans and turks principally have done do wonders and those that have professed arms but for an age have notwithstanding commonly attained that greatness in that age which maintained them long after when their profession and exercise of arms hath grown to decay 
 
 incident to this point is for a state to have those laws or customs which may reach forth unto them just occasions as may be pretended of war for there is that justice imprinted in the nature of men that they enter not upon wars whereof so many calamities do ensue but upon some at the least specious grounds and quarrels 
 the turk hath at hand for cause of war the propagation of his law or sect a quarrel that he may always command the romans though they esteemed the extending the limits of their empire to be great honour to their generals when it was done yet they never rested upon that alone to begin a war first therefore let nations that pretend to greatness have this that they be sensible of wrongs either upon borderers merchants or politic ministers and mat they sit not too long upon a provocation 
 secondly let them be pressed and ready to give aids and succours to their 
 confederates as it ever was with the roman in so much as if the confederate had 
 leagues defensive with divers other states and upon invasion offered did implore 
 their aids severally yet the romans would ever be the foremost and leave it to none other to have the honour as for the wars which were anciently made on the behalf of a kind of party or tacit conformity of estate i do not see how they may be well justified as when the romans made a war for the liberty of greece or when the lacedaemonians and athenians made wars to set up or pull down democracies and oligarchies or when wars were made by foreigners under the pretence of justice or protection to deliver the subjects of others from tyranny and oppression and the like let it suffice that no estate expect to be great that is not awake upon any just occasion of arming 
 
 no body can be healthful without exercise neither natural body nor politic and 
 certainly to a kingdom or estate a just and honourable war is the true exercise 
 a civil war indeed is like the heat of a fever but a foreign war is like the heat 
 of exercise and serveth to keep the body in health for in a slothful peace both 
 courages will effeminate and manners corrupt but howsoever it be for happiness 
 without all question for greatness it maketh to be still for the most part in arms 
 and the strength of a veteran army though it be a chargeable business always on 
 foot is that which commonly giveth the law or at least the reputation amongst all 
 neighbour states as may well be seen in spain which hath had in one part or other a veteran army almost continually now by the space of years 
 
 to be master of the sea is an abridgement of a monarchy cicero writing to atticus of pompey his preparation against caesar saith consilium pompeii plane themistocum est putat enim qui mari potitur eum rerum potiri and without doubt pompey had tired out caesar if upon vain confidence he had not left that way we see the great effects of battles by sea the battle of actium decided the empire of the world the battle of lepanto arrested the greatness of the turks 
 there be many examples where have been final to the war 
 but this is when princes or states have set up their rest upon the battles but thus 
 much is certain that he that commands the sea is at great liberty and may take as 
 much and as little of the war as he will whereas those that be strongest by land 
 are many times nevertheless in great straits surely at this day with us of europe 
 the vantage of strength at sea which is one of the principal dowries of this kingdom of great britain is great both because most of the kingdoms of europe are not merely inland but girt with the sea most part of their compass and because the wealth of both indies seems in great part but an accessory to the command of the seas 
 
 the wars of latter ages seem to be made in the dark in respect of the glory and honour which reflected upon men from the wars in ancient time there be now for martial encouragement some degrees and orders of chivalry which nevertheless are conferred promiscuously upon soldiers and no soldiers and some remembrance perhaps upon the scutcheon and some hospitals for maimed soldiers and such like things but in ancient times the trophies erected upon the place of the victory the funeral laudatives and monuments for those that died in the wars the crowns and garlands personal the style of emperor which the great kings of the world after borrowed the triumphs of the generals upon their return the great donatives and largesses upon the disbanding of the armies were things able to inflame all courage but above all that of the triumph amongst the romans was not pageants or gaudery but one of the wisest and noblest institutions that ever was 
 
 for it contained three things honour to the general riches to the treasury out of the spoils and donatives to the army but that honour perhaps were not fit for monarchies except it be in the person of the monarch himself or his sons as it came to pass in the times of the roman emperors who did appropriate the actual triumphs to themselves and their sons for such wars as they did achieve in person and left only for wars achieved by subjects some triumphal garments and ensigns to the general 
 
 to conclude no man can by care taking as the scripture saith add a cubit to his 
 stature in this little model of body but in the great frame of kingdoms and 
 commonwealths it is in the power of princes or estates to add amplitude and 
 greatness to their kingdoms for by introducing such ordinances constitutions and customs as we have now touched they may sow greatness to their posterity and succession but these things are commonly not observed but left to take their chance

 return of the jedi 
 prologue 
 
 the very depth of space there was the length and width and height and thenthese dimensions curved over on themselves into a bending blackness measurableonly by the glinting stars that tumbled through the chasm receding to infinity tothe very depth 
 these stars marked the moments of the universe there were aging orangeembers blue dwarfs twin yellow giants there were collapsing neutron stars andangry supernovae that hissed into the icy emptiness there were borning stars pulsing stars and dying stars there was the death star 
 at the feathered edge of the galaxy the death star floated in stationary orbitabove the green moon moon whose mother planet had long since died ofunknown cataclysm and disappeared into unknown realms the death star was armored battle station nearly twice as big as its predecessor which rebelforces had destroyed so many years twice as big but more than twiceas powerful yet it was only half complete 
 half a steely dark orb it hung above the green world of endor tentacles ofunfinished superstructure curling away toward its living companion like the gropinglegs of a deadly spider 
 an imperial star destroyer approached the giant space station at cruising was city it moved with deliberate grace like some great seadragon it was accompanied by dozens of twin ion engines combat flyers that zipped back and forth around the battle sounding docking regrouping 
 soundlessly the main bay of the ship opened there was a brief an imperial shuttle emerged from the darkness of the hold into the darkness ofspace it sped toward the death star with quiet purpose 
 in the cockpit the shuttle captain and his copilot made final readings monitoreddescent functions it was a sequence each performed a thousand times yetthere was an unusual tension in the air now the captain flipped the transmitterswitch and spoke into his mouthpiece 
 command station this is st code clearance blue starting ourapproach deactivate the security shield 
 static filtered over the receiver then the voice of the port controller thesecurity deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your codetransmission stand by 
 once more silence filled the cockpit the shuttle captain bit the inside of hischeek smiled nervously at his copilot and muttered quick as you can not take long in no mood to wait 
 they refrained from glancing back into the passenger section of the shuttle nowunder for landing the unmistakable sound of the mechanical breathingcoming from the shadow filled the cabin with a terrible impatience 
 in the control room of death star below operators moved along the bank ofpanels monitoring all the space traffic in the area authorizing flight certain areas to certain vehicles the shield operator suddenly checked hismonitor with alarm the depicted the battle station itself the moon a web of deflector from the green the death star only now the security web was beginning to retract and form a clear channel through which the dot that was theimperial shuttle sailed unimpeded toward the massive space station 
 the shield operator quickly called his control officer over to the how to proceed 
 what is it the officer demanded 
 that shuttle has a priority ranking he tried to replace the fear inhis voice with disbelief 
 the officer glanced at the for only a moment before realizing whowas on the shuttle and spoke to himself vader 
 he strode past the view port where the shuttle could be seen already making itsfinal approach and headed toward the docking bay he turned to the controller 
 inform the commander that lord shuttle has arrived 
 the shuttle sat quietly dwarfed by the cavernous reaches of the huge dockingbay hundreds of troops stood assembled in formation flanking the base of theshuttle armored imperial stormtroopers officers and imperial guard they snapped to attention as moff jerjerrod entered 
 thin the death star commander he walkedwithout hurry up the ranks of soldiers to the ramp of the shuttle hurry was not injerjerrod for hurry implied a wanting to be elsewhere and he was a man whodistinctively was exactly where he wanted to be great men never hurried he wasfond of saying great men caused others to hurry 
 yet jerjerrod was not blind to ambition and a visit by such a one as this greatdark lord could not be taken too lightly he stood at the shuttle mouth respect but not hurry 
 suddenly the exit hatch of the shuttle opened pulling the troops in formation toeven tauter attention only darkness glowed from the exit at first then the characteristic electrical respirations like the breathing of a machine andfinally darth vader lord of the sith emerged from the void 
 vader strode down the ramp looking over the assemblage he stopped when hecame to jerjerrod the commander bowed from the neck and smiled 
 lord vader this is an unexpected pleasure we are honored by yourpresence 
 we can dispense with the pleasantries commander words echoed asfrom the bottom of a well the emperor is concerned with your progress i amhere to put you back on schedule 
 jerjerrod turned to pale this was news not expected i assure vader my men are working as fast as they can 
 perhaps i can encourage their progress in ways you have not considered vadergrowled he had ways of course this was known ways and ways again 
 jerjerrod kept his tone even though deep inside the ghost of hurry began toscrabble at his throat that be necessary my lord i tell you withoutquestion this station will be operational as planned 
 afraid the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of thesituation 
 i fear he asks the impossible the commander suggested 
 perhaps you could explain that to him when he arrives face remainedinvisible behind the deathly black mask that protected him but the malice was clear inthe electronically modified voice 
 pallor intensified the emperor is coming here 
 yes commander and he will be quite displeased if you are still behindschedule when he arrives he spoke loudly to spread the threat over all who couldhear 
 we shall double our efforts lord vader and he meant it for even great men hurry in time of great need 
 vader lowered his voice again i hope so commander for your sake theemperor will tolerate no further delay in the final destruction of the outlaw we have secret news included jerjerrod only in this rebel fleet has gathered all its forces into a single giant armada thetime is at hand when we can crush them without mercy in a single blow 
 for the briefest second breathing seemed to quicken then resumed itsmeasured pace like the rising of hollow wind

 book two 
 chapter i 
 
 in october a russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the archduchy of austria and yet other regiments freshly arriving from russia were settling near the fortress of braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered braunau was the headquarters of the kutuzov 
 on october one of the infantry regiments that had just reached braunau had halted half a mile from the town waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief despite the appearance of the locality and surroundings fruit gardens stone fences tiled roofs and hills in the distance and despite the fact that the inhabitants who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not russians the regiment had just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of russia 
 on the evening of the last march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order on the principle that it is always better to bow too low than not bow low enough so the soldiers after a march were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned and by morning the regiment instead of the straggling disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before presented a array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty had every button and every strap in place and shone with cleanliness and not only externally was all in order but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles awl soap and all as the soldiers say there was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease it was the state of the soldiers boots more than half the boots were in holes but this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the austrian commissariat and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles 
 the commander of the regiment was an elderly choleric stout and general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders he had on a uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders he had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up slightly arching his back it was plain that the commander admired his regiment rejoiced in it and that his whole mind was engrossed by it yet his strut seemed to indicate that besides military matters social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts 
 well michael mitrich sir he said addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain that they both felt happy we had our hands full last night however i think the regiment is not a bad one eh 
 the battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed 
 it would not be turned off the field even on the tsaritsin meadow 
 what asked the commander 
 at that moment on the road from the town on which signalers had been posted two men appeared on horse back they were an followed by a cossack 
 the was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before namely that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march in their greatcoats and packs and without any preparation whatever 
 a member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutuzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the archduke ferdinand and mack and kutuzov not considering this junction advisable meant among other arguments in support of his view to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from russia with this object he intended to meet the regiment so the worse the condition it was in the better pleased the commander in chief would be though the did not know these circumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied on hearing this the regimental commander hung his head silently shrugged his shoulders and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture 
 a fine mess made of it he remarked 
 there now i tell you michael mitrich that if it was said on the march it meant in greatcoats said he reproachfully to the battalion commander oh my god he added stepping resolutely forward company commanders he shouted in a voice accustomed to command sergeants major how soon will he be here he asked the with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he was referring to 
 in an time i should say 
 shall we have time to change clothes 
 i know general 
 the regimental commander going up to the line himself ordered the soldiers to change into their greatcoats the company commanders ran off to their companies the sergeants major began bustling the greatcoats were not in very good condition and instantly the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and hum with voices on all sides soldiers were running to and fro throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms 
 in half an hour all was again in order only the squares had become gray instead of black the regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance 
 whatever is this this he shouted and stood still commander of the third company 
 commander of the third company wanted by the general commander to the general third company to the commander the words passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer 
 when the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a cry of the general to the third company the missing officer appeared from behind his company and though he was a man and not in the habit of running trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general the face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned spots appeared on his nose the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance and his mouth twitched nervously the general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting slackening his pace as he approached 
 you will soon be dressing your men in petticoats what is this shouted the regimental commander thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth which contrasted with the others what have you been after the commander in chief is expected and you leave your place eh teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade eh 
 the commander of the company with his eyes fixed on his superior pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap as if in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation 
 well why you speak whom have you got there dressed up as a hungarian said the commander with an austere gibe 
 your excellency 
 well your excellency what your excellency but what about your excellency nobody knows 
 your excellency the officer dolokhov who has been reduced to the ranks said the captain softly 
 well has he been degraded into a field marshal or into a soldier if a soldier he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others 
 your excellency you gave him leave yourself on the march 
 gave him leave leave just like you young men said the regimental commander cooling down a little leave indeed one says a word to you and you what he added with renewed irritation i beg you to dress your men decently 
 and the commander turning to look at the adjutant directed his jerky steps down the line he was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge at another because his line was not straight he reached the third company 
 are you standing your leg your leg shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice while there were still five men between him and dolokhov with his uniform 
 dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee looking straight with his clear insolent eyes in the face 
 why a blue coat off with it sergeant major change his coat the ras he did not finish 
 general i must obey orders but i am not bound to endure dolokhov hurriedly interrupted 
 no talking in the ranks no talking no talking 
 not bound to endure insults dolokhov concluded in loud ringing tones 
 the eyes of the general and the soldier met the general became silent angrily pulling down his tight scarf 
 i request you to have the goodness to change your coat he said as he turned away

 chapter 
 
 the evening after the funeral my young lady and i were seated in the library now musing of us our loss now venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future 
 we had just agreed the best destiny which could await catherine would be a permission to continue resident at the grange at least during life he being allowed to join her there and i to remain as housekeeper that seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for and yet i did hope and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home and my employment and above all my beloved young mistress when a of the discarded ones not yet hastily in and said that devil heathcliff was coming through the court should he fasten the door in his face 
 if we had been mad enough to order that proceeding we had not time he made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name he was master and availed himself of the privilege to walk straight in without saying a word the sound of our voice directed him to the library he entered and motioning him out shut the door 
 it was the same room into which he had been ushered as a guest eighteen years before the same moon shone through the window and the same autumn landscape lay outside we had not yet lighted a candle but all the apartment was visible even to the portraits on the wall the splendid head of mrs linton and the graceful one of her husband heathcliff advanced to the hearth time had little altered his person either there was the same man his dark face rather sallower and more composed his frame a stone or two heavier perhaps and no other difference catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out when she saw him 
 stop he said arresting her by the arm no more runnings away where would you go come to fetch you home and i hope be a dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience i was embarrassed how to punish him when i discovered his part in the business such a cobweb a pinch would annihilate him but see by his look that he has received his due i brought him down one evening the day before yesterday and just set him in a chair and never touched him afterwards i sent hareton out and we had the room to ourselves in two hours i called joseph to carry him up again and since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost and i fancy he sees me often though i am not near hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the night by the hour together and calls you to protect him from me and whether you like your precious mate or not you must come your concern now i yield all my interest in him to you 
 why not let catherine continue here i pleaded and send master linton to her as you hate them both not miss them they can only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart 
 seeking a tenant for the grange he answered and i want my children about me to be sure besides that lass owes me her services for her bread not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after linton has gone make haste and get ready now and oblige me to compel you 
 i shall said catherine linton is all i have to love in the world and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me and me to him you cannot make us hate each other and i defy you to hurt him when i am by and i defy you to frighten me 
 you are a boastful champion replied heathcliff but i like you well enough to hurt him you shall get the full benefit of the torment as long as it lasts it is not i who will make him hateful to is his own sweet spirit as bitter as gall at your desertion and its consequences expect thanks for this noble devotion i heard him draw a pleasant picture to zillah of what he would do if he were as strong as i the inclination is there and his very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength 
 i know he has a bad nature said catherine your son but glad a better to forgive it and i know he loves me and for that reason i love him mr heathcliff you have nobody to love you and however miserable you make us we shall still have the revenge of thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery you are miserable are you not lonely like the devil and envious like him nobody loves will cry for you when you die i be you 
 catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph she seemed to have made up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family and draw pleasure from the griefs of her enemies 
 you shall be sorry to be yourself presently said her if you stand there another minute begone witch and get your things 
 she scornfully withdrew in her absence i began to beg for place at the heights offering to resign mine to her but he would suffer it on no account he bid me be silent and then for the first time allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures having studied mrs linton he said 
 i shall have that home not because i need it but he turned abruptly to the fire and continued with what for lack of a better word i must call a tell you what i did yesterday i got the sexton who was digging grave to remove the earth off her and i opened it i thought once i would have stayed there when i saw her face hers had hard work to stir me but he said it would change if the air blew on it and so i struck one side of the coffin loose and covered it up not side damn him i wish been soldered in lead and i bribed the sexton to pull it away when laid there and slide mine out too have it made so and then by the time linton gets to us not know which is which 
 you were very wicked mr heathcliff i exclaimed were you not ashamed to disturb the dead 
 i disturbed nobody nelly he replied and i gave some ease to myself i shall be a great deal more comfortable now and have a better chance of keeping me underground when i get there disturbed her no she has disturbed me night and day through eighteen yesternight and yesternight i was tranquil i dreamt i was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper with my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers 
 and if she had been dissolved into earth or worse what would you have dreamt of then i said 
 of dissolving with her and being more happy still he answered do you suppose i dread any change of that sort i expected such a transformation on raising the lid but better pleased that it should not commence till i share it besides unless i had received a distinct impression of her passionless features that strange feeling would hardly have been removed it began oddly you know i was wild after she died and eternally from dawn to dawn praying her to return to me her spirit i have a strong faith in ghosts i have a conviction that they can and do exist among us the day she was buried there came a fall of snow in the evening i went to the churchyard it blew bleak as round was solitary i fear that her fool of a husband would wander up the den so late and no one else had business to bring them there being alone and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole barrier between us i said to have her in my arms again if she be cold think it is this north wind that chills me and if she be motionless it is sleep i got a spade from the toolhouse and began to delve with all my scraped the coffin i fell to work with my hands the wood commenced cracking about the screws i was on the point of attaining my object when it seemed that i heard a sigh from someone above close at the edge of the grave and bending down if i can only get this off i muttered i wish they may shovel in the earth over us both and i wrenched at it more desperately still there was another sigh close at my ear i appeared to feel the warm breath of it displacing the wind i knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by but as certainly as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark though it cannot be discerned so certainly i felt that cathy was there not under me but on the earth a sudden sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb i relinquished my labour of agony and turned consoled at once unspeakably consoled her presence was with me it remained while i refilled the grave and led me home you may laugh if you will but i was sure i should see her there i was sure she was with me and i could not help talking to her having reached the heights i rushed eagerly to the door it was fastened and i remember that accursed earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance i remember stopping to kick the breath out of him and then hurrying upstairs to my room and hers i looked round felt her by could almost see her and yet i could not i ought to have sweat blood then from the anguish of my the fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse i had not one she showed herself as she often was in life a devil to me and since then sometimes more and sometimes less been the sport of that intolerable torture infernal keeping my nerves at such a stretch that if they had not resembled catgut they would long ago have relaxed to the feebleness of when i sat in the house with hareton it seemed that on going out i should meet her when i walked on the moors i should meet her coming in when i went from home i hastened to return she must be somewhere at the heights i was certain and when i slept in her was beaten out of that i lie there for the moment i closed my eyes she was either outside the window or sliding back the panels or entering the room or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child and i must open my lids to see and so i opened and closed them a hundred times a be always disappointed it racked me often groaned aloud till that old rascal joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me now since seen her little it s a strange way of killing not by inches but by fractions and hairbreadths to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen years 
 mr heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead his hair clung to it wet with perspiration his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire the brows not contracted but raised next the temples diminishing the grim aspect of his countenance but imparting a peculiar look of trouble and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject he only half addressed me and i maintained silence i like to hear him talk after a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture took it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better advantage and while so occupied catherine entered announcing that she was ready when her pony should be saddled 
 send that over tomorrow said heathcliff to me then turning to her he may do without your pony it is a fine evening and need no ponies at wuthering heights for what journeys you take your own feet will serve you come along 
 goodbye ellen whispered my dear little mistress as she kissed me her lips felt like ice come and see me ellen forget 
 take care you do no such thing mrs dean said her new father when i wish to speak to you come here i want none of your prying at my house 
 he signed her to precede him and casting back a look that cut my heart she obeyed i watched them from the window walk down the garden heathcliff fixed arm under his though she disputed the act at first evidently and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley whose trees concealed them

 come jo time 
 for what 
 you mean to say you have forgotten that you promised to make half a dozen calls with me today 
 done a good many rash and foolish things in my life but i think i ever was mad enough to say make six calls in one day when a single one upsets me for a week 
 yes you did it was a bargain between us i was to finish the crayon of beth for you and you were to go properly with me and return our neighbors visits 
 if it was fair that was in the bond and i stand to the letter of my bond shylock there is a pile of clouds in the east not fair and i go 
 now shirking a lovely day no prospect of rain and you pride yourself on keeping promises so be honorable come and do your duty and then be at peace for another six months 
 at that minute jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking for she was general to the family and took especial credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen it was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first tryingon and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm july day she hated calls of the formal sort and never made any till amy compelled her with a bargain bribe or promise in the present instance there was no escape and having clashed her scissors rebelliously while protesting that she smelled thunder she gave in put away her work and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of resignation told amy the victim was ready 
 jo march you are perverse enough to provoke a saint you intend to make calls in that state i hope cried amy surveying her with amazement 
 why not neat and cool and comfortable quite proper for a dusty walk on a warm day if people care more for my clothes than they do for me i wish to see them you can dress for both and be as elegant as you please it pays for you to be fine it for me and furbelows only worry me 
 oh dear sighed amy now in a contrary fit and will drive me distracted before i can get her properly ready sure no pleasure to me to go today but a debt we owe society and no one to pay it but you and me do anything for you jo if only dress yourself nicely and come and help me do the civil you can talk so well look so aristocratic in your best things and behave so beautifully if you try that proud of you afraid to go alone do come and take care of me 
 an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your cross old sister in that way the idea of my being aristocratic and and your being afraid to go anywhere alone i know which is the most absurd well go if i must and do my best you shall be commander of the expedition and obey blindly will that satisfy you said jo with a sudden change from perversity to lamblike submission 
 a perfect cherub now put on all your best things and tell you how to behave at each place so that you will make a good impression i want people to like you and they would if only try to be a little more agreeable do your hair the pretty way and put the pink rose in your bonnet becoming and you look too sober in your plain suit take your light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief stop at and borrow her white sunshade and then you can have my one 
 while amy dressed she issued her orders and jo obeyed them not without entering her protest however for she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel as the last touch of elegance she turned to amy with an imbecile expression of countenance saying meekly 
 perfectly miserable but if you consider me presentable i die happy 
 highly satisfactory turn slowly round and let me get a careful view jo revolved and amy gave a touch here and there then fell back with her head on one side observing graciously yes do your head is all i could ask for that white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing hold back your shoulders and carry your hands easily no matter if your gloves do pinch one thing you can do well jo that is wear a shawl i but very nice to see you and so glad aunt march gave you that lovely one simple but handsome and those folds over the arm are really artistic is the point of my mantle in the middle and have i looped my dress evenly i like to show my boots for my feet are pretty though my nose 
 you are a thing of beauty and a joy forever said jo looking through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the golden hair am i to drag my best dress through the dust or loop it up please 
 hold it yup when you walk but drop it in the house the sweeping style suits you best and you must learn to trail your skirts gracefully you half buttoned one cuff do it at once never look finished if you are not careful about the little details for they make yup the pleasing whole 
 jo sighed and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove in doing up her cuff but at last both were ready and sailed away looking as pretty as picters hannah said as she hung out of the upper window to watch them 
 now jo dear the chesters consider themselves very elegant people so i want you to put on your best deportment make any of your abrupt remarks or do anything odd will you just be calm cool and quiet safe and ladylike and you can easily do it for fifteen minutes said amy as they approached the first place having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by meg with a baby on each arm 
 let me see calm cool and quiet yes i think i can promise that played the part of a prim young lady on the stage and try it off my powers are great as you shall see so be easy in your mind my child 
 amy looked relieved but naughty jo took her at her word for during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed every fold correctly draped calm as a summer sea cool as a snowbank and as silent as the sphinx in vain mrs chester alluded to her charming novel and the misses chester introduced parties picnics the opera and the fashions each and all were answered by a smile a bow and a demure yes or no with the chill on in vain amy telegraphed the word talk tried to draw her out and administered covert pokes with her foot jo sat as if blandly unconcious of it all with deportment like face icily regular splendidly null 
 what a haughty uninteresting creature that oldest miss march is was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies as the door closed upon their guests jo laughed noiselessly all through the hall but amy looked disgusted at the failure of her instructions and very naturally laid the blame upon jo 
 how could you mistake me so i merely meant you to be properly dignified and composed and you made yourself a perfect stock and stone try to be sociable at the gossip as other girls do and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense comes up they move in the best society are valuable persons for us to know and i fail to make a good impression there for anything 
 be agreeable gossip and giggle and have horrors and raptures over any trifle you like i rather enjoy this and now imitate what is called a charming girl i can do it for i have may chester as a model and improve upon her see if the lambs say what a lively nice creature that jo march is 
 amy felt anxious as well she might for when jo turned freakish there was no knowing where she would stop face was a study when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room kiss all the young ladies with effusion beam graciously upon the young gentlemen and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder amy was taken possession of by mrs lamb with whom she was a favorite and forced to hear a long account of last attack while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her so situated she was powerless to check jo who seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief and talked away as volubly as the lady a knot of heads gathered about her and amy strained her ears to hear what was going on for broken sentences filled her with curiosity and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun one may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of conversation 
 she rides splendidly who taught her 
 no one she used to practice mounting holding the reins and sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree now she rides anything for she know what fear is and the stableman lets her have horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well she has such a passion for it i often tell her if everything else fails she can be a horsebreaker and get her living so 
 at this awful speech amy contained herself with difficulty for the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady which was her especial aversion but what could she do for the old lady was in the middle of her story and long before it was done jo was off again make more droll revelations and committing still more fearful blunders 
 yes amy was in despair that day for all the good beasts were gone and of three left one was lame one blind and the other so balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start nice animal for a pleasure party it 
 which did she choose asked one of the laughing gentlemen who enjoyed the subject 
 none of them she heard of a young horse at the farm house over the river and though a lady had never ridden him she resolved to try because he was handsome and spirited her struggles were really pathetic there was no one to bring the horse to the saddle so she took the saddle to the horse my dear creature she actually rowed it over the river put it on her head and marched up to the barn to the utter amazement of the old man 
 did she ride the horse 
 of course she did and had a capital time i expected to see her brought home in fragments but she managed him perfectly and was the life of the party 
 well i call that plucky and young mr lamb turned an approving glance upon amy wondering what his mother could be saying to make the girl look so red and uncomfortable 
 she was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of dress one of the young ladies asked jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid jo instead of mentioning the place where it was bought two years ago must needs answer with unnecessary frankness oh amy painted it you buy those soft shades so we paint ours any color we like a great comfort to have an artistic sister 
 that an original idea cried miss lamb who found jo great fun 
 nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances nothing the child do why she wanted a pair of blue boots for party so she just painted her soiled white ones the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw and they looked exactly like satin added jo with an air of pride in her accomplishments that exasperated amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw her cardcase at her 
 we read a story of yours the other day and enjoyed it very much observed the elder miss lamb wishing to compliment the literary lady who did not look the character just then it must be confessed 
 any mention of her works always had a bad effect upon jo who either grew rigid and looked offended or changed the subject with a brusque remark as now sorry you could find nothing better to read i write that rubbish because it sells and ordinary people like it are you going to new york this winter 
 as miss lamb had enjoyed the story this speech was not exactly grateful or complimentary the minute it was made jo saw her mistake but fearing to make the matter worse suddenly remembered that it was for her to make the first move toward departure and did so with an abruptness that left three people with half finished sentences in their mouths 
 amy we must go dear do come and see us we are pining for a visit i dare to ask you mr lamb but if you should come i think i shall have the heart to send you away 
 jo said this with such a droll imitation of may gushing style that amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time 
 i do well asked jo with a satisfied air as they walked away 
 nothing could have been worse was crushing reply what possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle and the hats and boots and all the rest of it 
 why funny and amuses people they know we are poor so no use pretending that we have grooms buy three or four hats a season and have things as easy and fine as they do 
 you go and tell them all our little shifts and expose our poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way you a bit of proper pride and never will learn when to hold your tongue and when to speak said amy despairingly 
 poor jo looked abashed and silently chafed the end of her nose with the stiff handkerchief as if performing a penance for her misdemeanors 
 how shall i behave here she asked as they approached the third mansion 
 just as you please i wash my hands of you was short answer 
 then enjoy myself the boys are at home and have a comfortable time goodness knows i need a little change for elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution returned jo gruffly being disturbed by her failure to suit 
 an enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings and leaving amy to entertain the hostess and mr tudor who happened to be calling likewise jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing she listened to college stories with deep interest caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur agreed heartily that tom brown was a brick regardless of the improper form of praise and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle tank she went with an alacrity which caused mamma to smile upon her as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous condition by filial hugs bearlike but affectionate and dearer to her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired frenchwoman 
 leaving her sister to her own devices amy proceeded to enjoy herself to her content mr uncle had married an english lady who was third cousin to a living lord and amy regarded the whole family with great respect for in spite of her american birth and breeding she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming of a royal laddie some years ago and which still has something to do with the love the young country bears the old like that of a big son for an imperious little mother who held him while she could and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled but even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the british nobility did not render amy forgetful of time and when the proper number of minutes had passed she reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society and looked about for jo fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of march 
 it might have been worse but amy considered it bad for jo sat on the grass with an encampment of boys about her and a dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress as she related one of pranks to her admiring audience one small child was poking turtles with cherished parasol a second was eating gingerbread over best bonnet and a third playing ball with her gloves but all were enjoying themselves and when jo collected her damaged property to go her escort accompanied her begging her to come again it was such fun to hear about larks 
 capital boys they i feel quite young and brisk again after that said jo strolling along with her hands behind her partly from habit partly to conceal the bespattered parasol 
 why do you always avoid mr tudor asked amy wisely refraining from any comment upon dilapidated appearance 
 like him he puts on airs snubs his sisters worries his father a nd speak respectfully of his mother laurie says he is fast and i consider him a desirable acquaintance so i let him alone 
 you might treat him civilly at least you gave him a cool nod and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to tommy chamberlain whose father keeps a grocery store if you had just reversed the nod and the bow it would have been right said amy reprovingly 
 no it returned jo i neither like respect nor admire tudor though his niece was a third cousin to a lord tommy is poor and bashful and good and very clever i think well of him and like to show that i do for he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels 
 no use trying to argue with you began amy 
 not the least my dear interrupted jo so let us look amiable and drop a card here as the kings are evidently out for which deeply grateful 
 the family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on and jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house and being told that the young ladies were engaged 
 now let us go home and never mind aunt march today we can run down there any time and really a pity to trail through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers when we are tired and cross 
 speak for yourself if you please aunt march likes to have us pay her the compliment of coming in style and making a formal call a little thing to do but it gives her pleasure and i believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs and clumping boys spoil them stoop down and let me take the crumbs off of your bonnet 
 what a good girl you are amy said jo with a repentant glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister which was fresh and spotless still i wish it was as easy for me to do little things to please people as it is for you i think of them but it takes too much time to do them so i wait for a chance to confer a great favor and let the small ones slip but they tell best in the end i fancy 
 amy smiled and was mollified at once saying with a maternal air women should learn to be agreeable particularly poor ones for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive if remember that and practice it be better liked than i am because there is more of you 
 a crotchety old thing and always shall be but willing to own that you are right only easier for me to risk my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when i feel like it a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes it 
 a greater not to be able to hide them i mind saying that i approve of tudor any more than you do but not called upon to tell him so neither are you and there is no use in making yourself disagreeable because he is 
 but i think girls ought to show when they disapprove of young men and how can they do it except by their manners preaching does not do any good as i know to my sorrow since had teddie to manage but there are many little ways in which i can influence him without a word and i say we ought to do it to others if we can 
 teddy is a remarkable boy and be taken as a sample of other boys said amy in a tone of solemn conviction which would have convulsed the remarkable boy if he had heard it if we were belles or women of wealth and position we might do something perhaps but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we approve of them and smile upon another set because we do have a particle of effect and we should only be considered odd and puritanical 
 so we are to countenance things and people which we detest merely because we are not belles and millionaires are we a nice sort of morality 
 i argue about it i only know that the way of the world and people who set themselves against it only get laughed at for their pains i like reformers and i hope you never try to be one 
 i do like them and i shall be one if i can for in spite of the laughing the world would never get on without them we agree about that for you belong to the old set and i to the new you will get on the best but i shall have the liveliest time of it i should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting i think 
 well compose yourself now and worry aunt with your new ideas 
 try not to but always possessed to burst out with some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before her my doom and i help it 
 they found aunt carrol with the old lady both absorbed in some very interesting subject but they dropped it as the girls came in with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been talking about their nieces jo was not in a good humor and the perverse fit returned but amy who had virtuously done her duty kept her temper and pleased everybody was in a most angelic frame of mind this amiable spirit was felt at once and both aunts my deared her affectionately looking what they afterward said emphatically that child improves every day 
 are you going to help about the fair dear asked mrs carrol as amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like so well in the young 
 yes aunt mrs chester asked me if i would and i offered to tend a table as i have nothing but my time to give 
 not put in jo decidedly i hate to be patronized and the chesters think a great favor to allow us to help with their highly connected fair i wonder you consented amy they only want you to work 
 i am willing to work for the freedmen as well as the chesters and i think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun patronage does not trouble me when it is well meant 
 quite right and proper i like your grateful spirit my dear a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts some do not and that is trying observed aunt march looking over her spectacles at jo who sat apart rocking herself with a somewhat morose expression 
 if jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance for one of them she would have turned in a minute but unfortunately we have windows in our breasts and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends better for us that we cannot as a general thing but now and then it would be such a comfort such a saving of time and temper by her next speech jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure and received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue 
 i like favors they oppress and make me feel like a slave rather do everything for myself and be perfectly independent 
 ahem coughed aunt carrol softly with a look at aunt march 
 i told you so said aunt march with a decided nod to aunt carrol 
 mercifully unconscious of what she had done jo sat with her nose in the air and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting 
 do you speak french dear asked mrs carrol laying a hand on 
 pretty well thanks to aunt march who lets esther talk to me as often as i like replied amy with a grateful look which caused the old lady to smile affably 
 how are you about languages asked mrs carrol of jo 
 know a word very stupid about studying anything bear french such a slippery silly sort of language was the brusque reply 
 another look passed between the ladies and aunt march said to amy you are quite strong and well no dear i believe eyes trouble you any more do they 
 not at all thank you very well and mean to do great things next winter so that i may be ready for rome whenever that joyful time arrives 
 good girl you deserve to go and sure you will some day said aunt march with an approving pat on the head as amy picked up her ball for her 
 crosspatch draw the latch sit by the fire and spin 
 squalled polly bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to peep into face with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing 
 most observing bird said the old lady 
 come and take a walk my dear cried polly hopping toward the china closet with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar 
 thank you i will come amy and jo brought the visit to an end feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon her constitution she shook hands in a gentlemanly manner but amy kissed both the aunts and the girls departed leaving behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine which impression caused aunt march to say as they vanished 
 better do it mary supply the money and aunt carrol to reply decidedly i certainly will if her father and mother consent

 you disapparate on the hogwarts grounds i told you enough times said hermione 
 
 okayhows this for a theory said ron excitedly krum attacked crouch no wait for it and then stunned himself 
 
 and mr crouch evaporated did he said hermione coldly 
 
 oh yeah 
 
 it was daybreak harry ron and hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the owlery together to send a note to sirius now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds all three of them were and pale because they had been talking late into the night about mr crouch 
 
 just go through it again harry said hermione what did mr crouch actually say 
 
 told you he making much sense said harry he said he wanted to warn dumbledore about something he definitely mentioned bertha jorkins and he seemed to think she was dead he kept saying stuff was his mentioned his son 
 
 well that was his fault said hermione testily 
 
 he was out of his mind said harry half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive and he kept talking to percy about work and giving him instructions 
 
 andremind me what he said about said ron tentatively 
 
 told you harry repeated dully he said getting stronger 
 
 there was a pause then ron said in a falsely confident voice but he was out of his mind like you said so half of it was probably just raving 
 
 he was sanest when he was trying to talk about voldemort said harry and ron winced at the sound of the name he was having real trouble stringing two words together but that was when he seemed to know where he was and know what he wanted to do he just kept saying he had to see dumbledore 
 
 harry turned away from the window and stared up into the rafters the many perches were every now and then another owl would swoop in through one of the windows returning from its hunting with a mouse in its beak 
 
 if snape held me up harry said bitterly we got there in time the headmaster is busy this rubbish potter why he have just got out of the way 
 
 maybe he want you to get there said ron quickly maybe hang on how fast reckon he gotten down to the forest reckon he beaten you and dumbledore there 
 
 not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something said harry 
 
 put it past him ron muttered 
 
 we need to see professor moody said hermione we need to find out whether he found mr crouch 
 
 if he had the map on him it been easy said harry 
 
 unless crouch was already outside the grounds said ron because it only shows up to the boundaries 
 
 shh said hermione suddenly 
 
 somebody was climbing the steps up to the owlery harry could hear two voices arguing coming closer and closer 
 
 blackmail that is we could get into a lot of trouble for that 
 
 tried being polite time to play dirty like him he like the ministry of magic knowing what he did 
 
 telling you if you put that in writing blackmail 
 
 yeah and you be complaining if we get a nice fat payoff will you 
 
 the owlery door banged open fred and george came over the threshold then froze at the sight of harry ron and hermione 
 
 you doing here ron and fred said at the same time 
 
 sending a letter said harry and george in unison 
 
 what at this time said hermione and fred 
 
 fred grinned 
 
 fine we ask you what doing if you ask us he said 
 
 he was holding a sealed envelope in his hands harry glanced at it but fred whether accidentally or on purpose shifted his hand so that the name on it was covered 
 
 well let us hold you up fred said making a mock bow and pointing at the door 
 
 ron move you blackmailing he said 
 
 the grin vanished from face harry saw george half glance at fred before smiling at ron 
 
 be stupid i was only joking he said easily 
 
 sound like that said ron 
 
 fred and george looked at each other then fred said abruptly told you before ron keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is see why you would but 
 
 my business if blackmailing someone said ron right you could end up in serious trouble for that 
 
 told you i was joking said george he walked over to fred pulled the letter out of his hands and began attaching it to the leg of the nearest barn owl starting to sound a bit like our dear older brother you are ron carry on like this and be made a prefect 
 
 no i said ron hotly 
 
 george carried the barn owl over to the window and it took off george turned around and grinned at ron 
 
 well stop telling people what to do then see you later 
 
 he and fred left the owlery harry ron and hermione stared at one another 
 
 you think they know something about all this do you hermione whispered about crouch and everything 
 
 no said harry if it was something that serious tell someone tell dumbledore 
 
 ron however was looking uncomfortable 
 
 the matter hermione asked him 
 
 well said ron slowly i dunno if they would obsessed with making money lately i noticed it when i was hanging around with them when you know 
 
 we talking harry finished the sentence for him yeah but blackmail 
 
 this joke shop idea got said ron i thought they were only saying it to annoy mum but they really mean it they want to start one only got a year left at hogwarts they keep going on about how time to think about their future and dad help them and they need gold to get started 
 
 hermione was looking uncomfortable now 
 
 yes butthey do anything against the law to get gold 
 
 they said ron looking skeptical i dunnothey exactly mind breaking rules do they 
 
 yes but this is the law said hermione looking scared this some silly school get a lot more than detention for blackmail ronmaybe better tell percy 
 
 are you mad said ron tell percy probably do a crouch and turn them in he stared at the window through which fred and owl had departed then said come on get some breakfast 
 
 think too early to go and see professor moody hermione said as they went down the spiral staircase 
 
 yes said harry probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn think trying to attack him while asleep give it till break 
 
 history of magic had rarely gone so slowly harry kept checking watch having finally discarded his own but was moving so slowly he could have sworn it had stopped working too all three of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads down on the desks and slept even hermione taking her usual notes but was sitting with her head on her hand gazing at professor binns with her eyes out of focus 
 
 when the bell finally rang they hurried out into the corridors toward the dark arts classroom and found professor moody leaving it he looked as tired as they felt the eyelid of his normal eye was drooping giving his face an even more lopsided appearance than usual 
 
 professor moody harry called as they made their way toward him through the crowd 
 
 hello potter growled moody his magical eye followed a couple of passing first years who sped up looking nervous it rolled into the back of head and watched them around the corner before he spoke again 
 
 come in here 
 
 he stood back to let them into his empty classroom limped in after them and closed the door 
 
 did you find him harry asked without preamble mr crouch 
 
 no said moody he moved over to his desk sat down stretched out his wooden leg with a slight groan and pulled out his hip flask 
 
 did you use the map harry said 
 
 of course said moody taking a swig from his flask took a leaf out of your book potter summoned it from my office into the forest he anywhere on there 
 
 so he did disapparate said ron 
 
 you disapparate on the grounds ron said hermione there are other ways he could have disappeared there professor 
 
 magical eye quivered as it rested on hermione another one who might think about a career as an auror he told her mind works the right way granger 
 
 hermione flushed pink with pleasure 
 
 well he invisible said harry the map shows invisible people he left the grounds then 
 
 but under his own steam said hermione eagerly or because someone made him 
 
 yeah someone pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him they said ron quickly looking hopefully at moody as if he too wanted to be told he had the makings of an auror 
 
 we rule out kidnap growled moody 
 
 so said ron reckon somewhere in hogsmeade 
 
 could be anywhere said moody shaking his head only thing we know for sure is that not here 
 
 he yawned widely so that his scars stretched and his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth then he said now told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators but nothing you can do for crouch the be looking for him now notified them potter you just keep your mind on the third task 
 
 what said harry oh yeah 
 
 he given the maze a single thought since left it with krum the previous night 
 
 should be right up your street this one said moody looking up at harry and scratching his scarred and stubbly chin from what said managed to get through stuff like this plenty of times broke your way through a series of obstacles guarding the sorcerers stone in your first year you 
 
 we helped ron said quickly me and hermione helped 
 
 moody grinned 
 
 well help him practice for this one and be very surprised if he win said moody in the meantimeconstant vigilance potter constant vigilance he took another long draw from his hip flask and his magical eye swiveled onto the window the topmost sail of the durmstrang ship was visible through it 
 
 you two counseled moody his normal eye on ron and hermione you stick close to potter all right keeping an eye on things but all the sameyou can never have too many eyes out 
 
 
 
 sirius sent their owl back the very next morning it fluttered down beside harry at the same moment that a tawny owl landed in front of hermione clutching a copy of the daily prophet in its beak she took the newspaper scanned the first few pages said ha she got wind of crouch then joined ron and harry in reading what sirius had to say on the mysterious events of the night before last 
 
 harry 
 what do you think you are playing at walking off into the forest with viktor krum i want you to swear by return owl that you are not going to go walking with anyone else at night there is somebody highly dangerous at hogwarts it is clear to me that they wanted to stop crouch from seeing dumbledore and you were probably feet away from them in the dark you could have been killed 
 your name get into the goblet of fire by accident if trying to attack you on their last chance stay close to ron and hermione do not leave gryffindor tower after hours and arm yourself for the third task practice stunning and disarming a few hexes go amiss either nothing you can do about crouch keep your head down and look after yourself waiting for your letter giving me your word you stray again 
 sirius 
 he to lecture me about being said harry in mild indignation as he folded up letter and put it inside his robes after all the stuff he did at school 
 
 worried about you said hermione sharply just like moody and hagrid so listen to them 
 
 no tried to attack me all year said harry no done anything to me at all 
 
 except put your name in the goblet of fire said hermione and they done that for a reason harry snuffles is right maybe been biding their time maybe this is the task going to get you 
 
 look said harry impatiently say sirius is right and someone stunned krum to kidnap crouch well they been in the trees near us they but they waited till i was out of the way until they acted they so it look like their target does it 
 
 they have made it look like an accident if murdered you in the forest said hermione but if you die during a task 
 
 they care about attacking krum did they said harry why they just polish me off at the same time they made it look like krum and i had a duel or something 
 
 harry i understand it either said hermione desperately i just know there are a lot of odd things going on and i like right sirius is right got to get in training for the third task straight away and you make sure you write back to sirius and promise him not going to go sneaking off alone again 
 
 
 
 the hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when harry had to stay indoors for the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with hermione and ron looking up hexes or else in empty classrooms which they sneaked into to practice harry was concentrating on the stunning spell which he had never used before the trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on and part 
 
 we kidnap mrs norris ron suggested on monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their charms classroom having just been stunned and reawoken by harry for the fifth time in a row stun her for a bit or you could use dobby harry i bet do anything to help you not complaining or anything he got gingerly to his feet rubbing his backside but aching all over 
 
 well you keep missing the cushions you said hermione impatiently rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the banishing spell which flitwick had left in a cabinet just try and fall backward 
 
 once stunned you aim too well hermione said ron angrily why you take a turn 
 
 well i think got it now anyway said hermione hastily and we have to worry about disarming because been able to do that for think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening 
 
 she looked down the list they had made in the library 
 
 i like the look of this one she said this impediment curse should slow down anything trying to attack you harry start with that one 
 
 the bell rang they hastily shoved the cushions back into cupboard and slipped out of the classroom 
 
 see you at dinner said hermione and she set off for arithmancy while harry and ron headed toward north tower and divination broad strips of dazzling gold sunlight tell across the corridor from the high windows the sky outside was so brightly blue it looked as though it had been enameled 
 
 going to be boiling in room she never puts out that fire said ron as they started up the staircase toward the silver ladder and the trapdoor 
 
 he was quite right the dimly lit room was swelteringly hot the fumes from the perfumed fire were heavier than ever head swam as he made his way over to one of the curtained windows while professor trelawney was looking the other way disentangling her shawl from a lamp he opened it an inch or so and settled back in his chintz armchair so that a soft breeze played across his face it was extremely comfortable 
 
 my dears said professor trelawney sitting down in her winged armchair in front of the class and peering around at them all with her strangely enlarged eyes we have almost finished our work on planetary divination today however will be an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of mars for he is placed most interestingly at the present time if you will all look this way i will dim the lights 
 
 she waved her wand and the lamps went out the fire was the only source of light now professor trelawney bent down and lifted from under her chair a miniature model of the solar system contained within a glass dome it was a beautiful thing each of the moons glimmered in place around the nine planets and the fiery sun all of them hanging in thin air beneath the glass harry watched lazily as professor trelawney began to point out the fascinating angle mars was making to neptune the heavily perfumed fumes washed over him and the breeze from the window played across his face he could hear an insect humming gently somewhere behind the curtain his eyelids began to droop 
 
 he was riding on the back of an eagle owl soaring through the clear blue sky toward an old house set high on a hillside lower and lower they flew the wind blowing pleasantly in face until they reached a dark and broken window in the upper story of the house and entered now they were flying along a gloomy passageway to a room at the very endthrough the door they went into a dark room whose windows were boarded up 
 
 harry had left the backhe was watching now as it fluttered across the room into a chair with its back to were two dark shapes on the floor beside the chairboth of them were stirring 
 
 one was a huge snakethe other was a mana short balding man a man with watery eyes and a pointed nosehe was wheezing and sobbing on the hearth rug 
 
 you are in luck wormtail said a cold voice from the depths of the chair in which the owl had landed you are very fortunate indeed your blunder has not ruined everything he is dead 
 
 my lord gasped the man on the floor my lord i ami am so pleasedand so sorry 
 
 nagini said the cold voice you are out of luck i will not be feeding wormtail to you after allbut never mind never mindthere is still harry potter 
 
 the snake hissed harry could see its tongue fluttering 
 
 now wormtail said the cold voice perhaps one more little reminder why i will not tolerate another blunder from you 
 
 my lordnoi beg you 
 
 the tip of a wand emerged from around the back of the chair it was pointing at wormtail 
 
 crucio said the cold voice 
 
 wormtail screamed screamed as though every nerve in his body were on fire the screaming filled ears as the scar on his forehead seared with pain he was yelling toovoldemort would hear him would know he was there 
 
 harry harry 
 
 harry opened his eyes he was lying on the floor of professor room with his hands over his face his scar was still burning so badly that his eyes were watering the pain had been real the whole class was standing around him and ron was kneeling next to him looking terrified 
 
 you all right he said 
 
 of course he said professor trelawney looking thoroughly excited her great eyes loomed over harry gazing at him what was it potter a premonition an apparition what did you see 
 
 nothing harry lied he sat up he could feel himself shaking he stop himself from looking around into the shadows behind him voice had sounded so close 
 
 you were clutching your scar said professor trelawney you were rolling on the floor clutching your scar come now potter i have experience in these matters 
 
 harry looked up at her 
 
 i need to go to the hospital wing i think he said bad headache 
 
 my dear you were undoubtedly stimulated by the extraordinary clairvoyant vibrations of my room said professor trelawney if you leave now you may lose the opportunity to see further than you have ever 
 
 i want to see anything except a headache cure said harry 
 
 he stood up the class backed away they all looked unnerved 
 
 see you later harry muttered to ron and he picked up his bag and headed for the trapdoor ignoring professor trelawney who was wearing an expression of great frustration as though she had just been denied a real treat 
 
 when harry reached the bottom of her stepladder however he did not set off for the hospital wing he had no intention whatsoever of going there sirius had told him what to do if his scar hurt him again and harry was going to follow his advice he was going straight to office he marched down the corridors thinking about what he had seen in the dreamit had been as vivid as the one that had awoken him on privet ran over the details in his mind trying to make sure he could remember had heard voldemort accusing wormtail of making a blunderbut the owl had brought good news the blunder had been repaired somebody was deadso wormtail was not going to be fed to the snakehe harry was going to be fed to it instead 
 
 harry had walked right past the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to dumbledores office without noticing he blinked looked around realized what he had done and retraced his steps stopping in front of it then he remembered that he know the password 
 
 sherbet lemon he tried tentatively 
 
 the gargoyle did not move 
 
 okay said harry staring at it pear drop er licorice wand fizzing whizbee best blowing gum bertie every flavor beansoh no he like them does just open you he said angrily i really need to see him its urgent 
 
 the gargoyle remained immovable 
 
 harry kicked it achieving nothing but an excruciating pain in his big toe 
 
 chocolate frog he yelled angrily standing on one leg sugar quill cockroach cluster 
 
 the gargoyle sprang to life and jumped aside harry blinked 
 
 cockroach cluster he said amazed i was only joking 
 
 he hurried through the gap in the walls and stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him taking him up to a polished oak door with a brass door knocker 
 
 he could hear voices from inside the office he stepped off the moving staircase and hesitated listening 
 
 dumbledore afraid i see the connection see it at all it was the voice of the minister of magic cornelius fudge ludo says berthas perfectly capable of getting herself lost i agree we would have expected to have found her by now but all the same no evidence of foul play dumbledore none at all as for her disappearance being linked with barty 
 
 and what do you thinks happened to barty crouch minister said growling voice 
 
 i see two possibilities alastor said fudge either crouch has finally cracked more than likely sure agree given his personal history lost his mind and gone wandering off somewhere 
 
 he wandered extremely quickly if that is the case cornelius said dumbledore calmly 
 
 or else well fudge sounded embarrassed well reserve judgment until after seen the place where he was found but you say it was just past the beauxbatons carriage dumbledore you know what that woman is 
 
 i consider her to be a very able headmistress and an excellent dancer said dumbledore quietly 
 
 dumbledore come said fudge angrily you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of hagrid they all turn out harmless if indeed you can call hagrid harmless with that monster fixation got 
 
 i no more suspect madame maxime than hagrid said dumbledore just as calmly i think it possible that it is you who are prejudiced cornelius 
 
 can we wrap up this discussion growled moody 
 
 yes yes go down to the grounds then said fudge impatiently 
 
 no not that said moody just that potter wants a word with you dumbledore just outside the door 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the goblet of fire 
 

lionfish nov chapter careers advicecontents prev chapter next chapter 
 but why you got occlumency lessons any more said hermione frowning 
 
 told you harry muttered snape reckons i can carry on by myself now got the basics 
 
 so stopped having funny dreams said hermione sceptically 
 
 pretty much said harry not looking at her 
 
 well i think snape should stop until absolutely sure you can control them said hermione indignantly harry i think you should go back to him and ask 
 
 no said harry forcefully just drop it hermione ok 
 
 it was the first day of the easter holidays and hermione as was her custom had spent a large part of the day drawing up revision timetables for the three of them harry and ron had let her do it it was easier than arguing with her and in any case they might come in useful 
 
 ron had been startled to discover there were only six weeks left until their exams 
 
 how can that come as a shock hermione demanded as she tapped each little square on timetable with her wand so that it flashed a different colour according to its subject 
 
 i dunno said ron been a lot going on 
 
 well there you are she said handing him his timetable if you follow that you should do fine 
 
 ron looked down it gloomily but then brightened 
 
 given me an evening off every week 
 
 for quidditch practice said hermione 
 
 the smile faded from face 
 
 the point he said dully got about as much chance of winning the quidditch cup this year as got of becoming minister for magic 
 
 hermione said nothing she was looking at harry who was staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while crookshanks pawed at his hand trying to get his ears scratched 
 
 wrong harry 
 
 what he said quickly nothing 
 
 he seized his copy of defensive magical theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index crookshanks gave him up as a bad job and slunk away under chair 
 
 i saw cho earlier said hermione tentatively she looked really miserable too have you two had a row again 
 
 whaoh yeah we have said harry seizing gratefully on the excuse 
 
 what about 
 
 that sneak friend of hers marietta said harry 
 
 yeah well i blame you said ron angrily setting down his revision timetable if it been for her 
 
 ron went into a rant about marietta edgecombe which harry found helpful all he had to do was look angry nod and say yeah and right whenever ron drew breath leaving his mind free to dwell ever more miserably on what he had seen in the pensieve 
 
 he felt as though the memory of it was eating him from inside he had been so sure his parents were wonderful people that he had never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving the aspersions snape cast on his character people like hagrid and sirius told harry how wonderful his father had been yeah well look what sirius was like himself said a nagging voice inside head he was as bad he yes he had once overheard professor mcgonagall saying that his father and sirius had been troublemakers at school but she had described them as forerunners of the weasley twins and harry could not imagine fred and george dangling someone for the fun of it not unless they really loathed them perhaps malfoy or somebody who really deserved it 
 
 harry tried to make a case for snape having deserved what he had suffered at hands but lily asked he done to you and james replied more the fact that he exists if you know what i mean james started it all simply because sirius had said he was bored harry remembered lupin saying back in grimmauld place that dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over james and sirius but in the pensieve he had sat there and let it all happen 
 
 harry kept reminding himself that lily had intervened his mother had been decent yet the memory of the look on her face as she had shouted at james disturbed him quite as much as anything else she had clearly loathed james and harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married once or twice he even wondered whether james had forced her into it 
 
 for nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort of inspiration whenever someone had told him he was like james he had glowed with pride inside and now now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him 
 
 the weather grew breezier brighter and warmer as the easter holidays passed but harry along with the rest of the fifth and was trapped inside revising traipsing back and forth to the library harry pretended his bad mood had no other cause but the approaching exams and as his fellow gryffindors were sick of studying themselves his excuse went unchallenged 
 
 harry talking to you can you hear me 
 
 huh 
 
 he looked round ginny weasley looking very windswept had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone it was late on sunday evening hermione had gone back to gryffindor tower to revise ancient runes and ron had quidditch practice 
 
 oh hi said harry pulling his books towards him how come not at practice 
 
 over said ginny ron had to take jack sloper up to the hospital wing 
 
 why 
 
 well not sure but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat she sighed heavily anyway a package just arrived only just got through new screening process 
 
 she hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper on to the table it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly there was a scribbled note across it in red ink reading inspected and passed by the hogwarts high inquisitor 
 
 easter eggs from mum said ginny one for you there you go 
 
 she handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small iced snitches and according to the packaging containing a bag of fizzing whizzbees harry looked at it for a moment then to his horror felt a lump rise in his throat 
 
 are you ok harry ginny asked quietly 
 
 yeah fine said harry gruffly the lump in his throat was painful he did not understand why an easter egg should have made him feel like this 
 
 you seem really down lately ginny persisted you know sure if you just talked to cho 
 
 not cho i want to talk to said harry brusquely 
 
 who is it then asked ginny watching him closely 
 
 i 
 
 he glanced around to make quite sure nobody was listening madam pince was several shelves away stamping out a pile cf books for a hannah abbott 
 
 i wish i could talk to sirius he muttered but i know i 
 
 ginny continued to watch him thoughtfully more to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any harry unwrapped his easter egg broke off a large bit and put it into his mouth 
 
 well said ginny slowly helping herself to a bit of egg too if you really want to talk to sirius i expect we could think of a way to do it 
 
 come on said harry dully with umbridge policing the fires and reading all our mail 
 
 the thing about growing up with fred and george said ginny thoughtfully is that you sort of start thinking possible if got enough nerve 
 
 harry looked at her perhaps it was the effect of the chocolatelupin had always advised eating some after encounters with dementorsor simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week but he felt a bit more hopeful 
 
 what do you think you are doing 
 
 oh damn whispered ginny jumping to her feet i forgot 
 
 madam pince was swooping down on them her shrivelled face contorted with rage 
 
 chocolate in the library she screamed outoutout and whipping out her wand she caused books bag and ink bottle to chase him and ginny from the library whacking them repeatedly over the head as they ran 
 
 as though to underline the importance of their upcoming examinations a batch of pamphlets leaflets and notices concerning various wizarding careers appeared on the tables in gryffindor tower shortly before the end of the holidays along with yet another notice on the board which read 
 
 careers advice 
 
 all are required to attend a short meeting with their 
 
 head of house during the first week of the summer term to discuss 
 
 their future careers times of individual appointments are listed below 
 
 
 
 harry looked down the list and found that he was expected in professor office at half past two on monday which would mean missing most of divination he and the other spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the easter break reading all the careers information that had been left there for their perusal 
 
 well i fancy healing said ron on the last evening of the holidays he was immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed emblem of st on its front it says here you need at least e at newt level in potions herbology transfiguration charms and defence against the dark arts i mean blimey want much do they 
 
 well a very responsible job it said hermione absently 
 
 she was poring over a bright pink and orange leaflet that was headed so you think like to work in muggle relations you seem to need many qualifications to liaise with muggles all they want is an owl in muggle studies much more important is your enthusiasm patience and a good sense of fun 
 
 need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle said harry darkly good sense of when to duck more like he was halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking listen to this are you seeking a challenging career involving travel adventure and substantial treasure bonuses then consider a position with gringotts wizarding bank who are currently recruiting for thrilling opportunities abroad they want arithmancy though you could do it hermione 
 
 i much fancy banking said hermione vaguely now immersed in have you got what it takes to train security trolls 
 
 hey said a voice in ear he looked round fred and george had come to join them had a word with us about you said fred stretching out his legs on the table in front of them and causing several booklets on careers with the ministry of magic to slide off on to the floor she says you need to talk to sirius 
 
 what said hermione sharply freezing with her hand halfway towards picking up make a bang at the department of magical accidents and catastrophes 
 
 yeah said harry trying to sound casual yeah i thought like 
 
 be so ridiculous said hermione straightening up and looking at him as though she could not believe her eyes with umbridge groping around in the fires and frisking all the owls 
 
 well we think we can find a way around that said george stretching and smiling a simple matter of causing a diversion now you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the easter holidays 
 
 what was the point we asked ourselves of disrupting leisure time continued fred no point at all we answered ourselves and of course have messed up revision too which would be the very last thing want to do 
 
 he gave hermione a sanctimonious little nod she looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness 
 
 but business as usual from tomorrow fred continued briskly and if going to be causing a bit of uproar why not do it so that harry can have his chat with sirius 
 
 yes but still said hermione with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse even if you do cause a diversion how is harry supposed to talk to him 
 
 office said harry quietly 
 
 he had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could come up with no alternative umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that was not being watched was her own 
 
 areyou insane said hermione in a hushed voice 
 
 ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the cultivated fungus trade and was watching the conversation warily 
 
 i think so said harry shrugging 
 
 and how are you going to get in there in the first place 
 
 harry was ready for this question 
 
 knife he said 
 
 excuse me 
 
 christmas before last sirius gave me a knife open any lock said harry so even if bewitched the door so alahomora work which i bet she has 
 
 what do you think about this hermione demanded of ron and harry was reminded irresistibly of mrs weasley appealing to her husband during first dinner in grimmauld place 
 
 i dunno said ron looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion if harry wants to do it up to him it 
 
 spoken like a true friend and weasley said fred clapping ron hard on the back right then thinking of doing it tomorrow just after lessons because it should cause maximum impact in in the corridorsharry set it off in the east wing somewhere draw her right away from her own officei reckon we should be able to guarantee you what twenty minutes he said looking at george 
 
 easy said george 
 
 what sort of diversion is it asked ron 
 
 see little bro said fred as he and george got up again at least you will if you trot along to gregory the corridor round about five tomorrow 
 
 harry awoke very early the next day feeling almost as anxious as he had done on the morning of his disciplinary hearing at the ministry of magic it was not only the prospect of breaking into office and using her fire to speak to sirius that was making him feel nervous though that was certainly bad enough today also happened to be the first time harry would be in close proximity to snape since snape had thrown him out of his office 
 
 after lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside bed and stared out on a truly glorious morning the sky was a clear misty opalescent blue directly ahead of him harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented snape he was not sure what sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the pensieve but he was desperate to hear own account of what had happened to know of any mitigating factors there might have been any excuse at all for his behaviour 
 
 something caught attention movement on the edge of the forbidden forest harry squinted into the sun and saw hagrid emerging from between the trees he seemed to be limping as harry watched hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it harry watched the cabin for several minutes hagrid did not emerge again but smoke furled from the chimney so hagrid could not be so badly injured that he was unequal to stoking the fire 
 
 harry turned away from the window headed back to his trunk and started to dress 
 
 with the prospect of forcing entry into office ahead harry had never expected the day to be a restful one but he had not reckoned on almost continual attempts to dissuade him from what he was planning to do at five for the first time ever she was at least as inattentive to professor binns in history of magic as harry and ron were keeping up a stream of whispered admonitions that harry tried very hard to ignore 
 
 and if she does catch you there apart from being expelled be able to guess been talking to snuffles and this time i expect force you to drink veritaserum and answer her questions 
 
 hermione said ron in a low and indignant voice are you going to stop telling harry off and listen to binns or am i going to have to take my own notes 
 
 you take notes for a change it kill you 
 
 by the time they reached the dungeons neither harry nor ron was speaking to hermione undeterred she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warnings all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused seamus to waste five whole minutes checking his cauldron for leaks 
 
 snape meanwhile seemed to have decided to act as though harry were invisible harry was of course to this tactic as it was one of uncle favourites and on the whole was grateful he had to suffer nothing worse in fact compared to what he usually had to endure from snape in the way of taunts and snide remarks he found the new approach something of an improvement and was pleased to find that when left well alone he was able to concoct an invigoration draught quite easily at the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask corked it and took it up to desk for marking feeling that he might at last have scraped an e 
 
 he had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter harry whipped around his potion sample lay in pieces on the floor and snape was surveying him with a look of gloating pleasure 
 
 whoops he said softly another zero then potter 
 
 harry was too incensed to speak he strode back to his cauldron intending to fill another flask and force snape to mark it but saw to his horror that the rest of the contents had vanished 
 
 sorry said hermione with her hands over her mouth really sorry harry i thought finished so i cleared up 
 
 harry could not bring himself to answer when the bell rang he hurried out of the dungeon without a backwards glance and made sure that he found himself a seat between neville and seamus for lunch so that hermione could not start nagging him again about using office 
 
 he was in such a bad mood by the time he got to divination that he had quite forgotten his careers appointment with professor mcgonagall remembering it only when ron asked him why he in her office he hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath only a few minutes late 
 
 sorry professor he panted as he closed the door i forgot 
 
 no matter potter she said briskly but as she spoke somebody else sniffed from the corner harry looked round 
 
 professor umbridge was sitting there a clipboard on her knee a fussy little around her neck and a small horribly smug smile on her face 
 
 sit down potter said professor mcgonagall tersely her hands shook slightly as she shuffled the many pamphlets littering her desk 
 
 harry sat down with his back to umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard 
 
 well potter this meeting is to talk over any career ideas you might have and to help you decide which subjects you should continue into the sixth and seventh years said professor mcgonagall have you had any thoughts about what you would like to do after you leave hogwarts 
 
 er said harry 
 
 he was finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting 
 
 yes professor mcgonagall prompted harry 
 
 well i thought of maybe being an auror harry mumbled 
 
 need top grades for that said professor mcgonagall extracting a small dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it they ask for a minimum of five newts and nothing under exceeds expectations grade i see then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the auror office a difficult career path potter they only take the best in fact i think anybody has been taken on in the last three years 
 
 at this moment professor umbridge gave a very tiny cough as though she was trying to see how quietly she could do it professor mcgonagall ignored her 
 
 want to know which subjects you ought to take i suppose she went on talking a little louder than before 
 
 yes said harry defence against the dark arts i suppose 
 
 naturally said professor mcgonagall crisply i would also advise 
 
 professor umbridge gave another cough a little more audible this time professor mcgonagall closed her eyes for a moment opened them again and continued as though nothing had happened 
 
 i would also advise transfiguration because aurors frequently need to transfigure or untransfigure in their work and i ought to tell you now potter that i do not accept students into my newt classes unless they have achieved exceeds expectations or higher at ordinary wizarding level say averaging acceptable at the moment so need to put in some good hard work before the exams to stand a chance of continuing then you ought to do charms always useful and potions yes potter potions she added with the merest flicker of a smile poisons and antidotes are essential study for aurors and i must tell you that professor snape absolutely refuses to take students who get anything other than outstanding in their owls so 
 
 professor umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet 
 
 may i offer you a cough drop dolores professor mcgonagall asked curtly without looking at professor umbridge 
 
 oh no thank you very much said umbridge with that simpering laugh harry hated so much i just wondered whether i could make the teensiest interruption minerva 
 
 i daresay find you can said professor mcgonagall through tightly gritted teeth 
 
 i was just wondering whether mr potter has quite the temperament for an auror said professor umbridge sweetly 
 
 were you said professor mcgonagall haughtily well potter she continued as though there had been no interruption if you are serious in this ambition i would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your transfiguration and potions up to scratch i see professor flitwick has graded you between acceptable and exceeds expectations for the last two years so your charmwork seems satisfactory as for defence against the dark arts your marks have been generally high professor lupin in particular thought youare you quite sure you like a cough drop dolores 
 
 oh no need thank you minerva simpered professor umbridge who had just coughed her loudest yet i was just concerned that you might not have most recent defence against the dark arts marks in front of you quite sure i slipped in a note 
 
 what this thing said professor mcgonagall in a tone of revulsion as she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaves of folder she glanced down it her eyebrows slightly raised then placed it back into the folder without comment 
 
 yes as i was saying potter professor lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject and obviously for an auror 
 
 did you not understand my note minerva asked professor umbndge in honeyed tones quite forgetting to cough 
 
 of course i understood it said professor mcgonagall her teeth clenched so tightly the words came out a little muffled 
 
 well then i am confused afraid i quite understand how you can give mr potter false hope that 
 
 false hope repeated professor mcgonagall still refusing to look round at professor umbridge he has achieved high marks in all his defence against the dark arts tests 
 
 terribly sorry to have to contradict you minerva but as you will see from my note harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me 
 
 i should have made my meaning plainer said professor mcgonagall turning at last to look umbridge directly in the eyes he has achieved high marks in all defence against the dark arts tests set by a competent teacher 
 
 professor smile vanished as suddenly as a light bulb blowing she sat back in her chair turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed her bulging eyes rolling from side to side professor mcgonagall turned back to harry her thin nostrils flared her eyes burning 
 
 any questions potter 
 
 yes said harry what sort of character and aptitude tests do the ministry do on you if you get enough newts 
 
 well need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth said professor mcgonagall perseverance and dedication because auror training takes a further three years not to mention very high skills in practical defence it will mean a lot more study even after left school so unless prepared to 
 
 i think also find said umbridge her voice very cold now that the ministry looks into the records of those applying to be aurors their criminal records 
 
 unless prepared to take even more exams after hogwarts you should really look at another 
 
 which means that this boy has as much chance of becoming an auror as dumbledore has of ever returning to this school 
 
 a very good chance then said professor mcgonagall 
 
 potter has a criminal record said umbridge loudly 
 
 potter has been cleared of all charges said mcgonagall even more loudly 
 
 professor umbridge stood up she was so short that this did not make a great deal of difference but her fussy simpering demeanour had given place to a hard fury that made her broad flabby face look oddly sinister 
 
 potter has no chance whatsoever of becoming an auror 
 
 professor mcgonagall got to her feet too and in her case this was a much more impressive move she towered over professor umbridge 
 
 potter she said in ringing tones i will assist you to become an auror if it is the last thing i do if i have to coach you nightly i will make sure you achieve the required results 
 
 the minister for magic will never employ harry potter said umbridge her voice rising furiously 
 
 there may well be a new minister for magic by the time potter is ready to join shouted professor mcgonagall 
 
 aha shrieked professor umbridge pointing a stubby linger at mcgonagall yes yes yes yes of course what you want it minerva mcgonagall you want cornelius fudge replaced by albus dumbledore you think be where i am you senior undersecretary to the minister and headmistress to boot 
 
 you are raving said professor mcgonagall superbly disdainful potter that concludes our careers consultation 
 
 harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room not daring to look at professor umbridge he could hear her and professor mcgonagall continuing to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor 
 
 professor umbridge was still breathing as though she had just run a race when she strode into their defence against the dark arts lesson that afternoon 
 
 i hope thought better of what you were planning to do harry hermione whispered the moment they had opened their books to chapter and negotiation umbridge looks like in a really bad mood already 
 
 every now and then umbridge shot glowering looks at harry who kept his head down staring at defensive magical theory his eyes unfocused thinking 
 
 he could just imagine professor reaction if he was caught trespassing in professor office mere hours after she had vouched for him there was nothing to stop him simply going back to gryffindor tower and hoping that some time during the next summer holidays he would have a chance to ask sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the pensieve nothing except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel as though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach and then there was the matter of fred and george whose diversion was already planned not to mention the knife sirius had given him which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his old invisibility cloak 
 
 but the fact remained that if he was caught 
 
 dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school harry whispered hermione raising her book to hide her face from umbridge and if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing 
 
 he could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a day more than twenty years ago 
 
 and then he remembered sirius in the fire upstairs in the gryffindor common room 
 
 less like your father than i thought the risk been what made it fun for james 
 
 but did he want to be like his father any more 
 
 harry do it please do it hermione said in anguished tones as the bell rang at the end of the class 
 
 he did not answer he did not know what to do 
 
 ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice he would not look at harry though when hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading harry some more he said in a low voice give it a rest ok he can make up his own mind 
 
 heart beat very fast as he left the classroom he was halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakeable sounds of a diversion going off in the distance there were screams and yells reverberating from somewhere above them people exiting the classrooms all around harry were stopping in their tracks and looking up at the ceiling fearfully 
 
 umbridge came pelting out of her classroom as fast as her short legs would carry her pulling out her wand she hurried off in the opposite direction it was now or never 
 
 harryplease hermione pleaded weakly 
 
 but he had made up his mind hitching his bag more securely on to his shoulder he set off at a run weaving in and out of students now hurrying in the opposite direction to see what all the fuss was about in the east wing 
 
 harry reached the corridor to office and found it deserted dashing behind a large suit of armour whose helmet creaked around to watch him he pulled open his bag seized knife and donned the invisibility cloak he then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armour and along the corridor until he reached door 
 
 he inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down then withdrew it there was a tiny click and the door swung open he ducked inside the office closed the door quickly behind him and looked around 
 
 nothing was moving except the horrible kittens that were still frolicking on the wall plates above the confiscated broomsticks 
 
 harry pulled off his cloak and striding over to the fireplace found what he was looking for within seconds a small box containing glittering floo powder 
 
 he crouched down in front of the empty grate his hands shaking he had never done this before though he thought he knew how it must work sticking his head into the fireplace he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it on to the logs stacked neatly beneath him they exploded at once into emerald green flames 
 
 number twelve grimmauld place harry said loudly and clearly 
 
 it was one of the most curious sensations he had ever experienced he had travelled by floo powder before of course but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around in the flames through the network of wizarding fireplaces that stretched over the country this time his knees remained firm upon the cold floor of office and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire 
 
 and then as abruptly as it had begun the spinning stopped feeling rather sick and as though he were wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head harry opened his eyes to find that he was looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long wooden table where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment 
 
 sirius 
 
 the man jumped and looked around it was not sirius but lupin 
 
 harry he said looking thoroughly shocked what are happened is everything all right 
 
 yeah said harry i just wonderedi mean i just fancied aa chat with sirius 
 
 call him said lupin getting to his feet still looking perplexed he went upstairs to look for kreacher he seems to be hiding in the attic again 
 
 and harry saw lupin hurry out of the kitchen now he was left with nothing to look at but the chair and table legs he wondered why sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it was to speak out of the fire his knees were already objecting painfully to their prolonged contact with hard stone floor 
 
 lupin returned with sirius at his heels moments later 
 
 what is it said sirius urgently sweeping his long dark hair out of his eyes and dropping to the ground in front of the fire so that he and harry were on a level lupin knelt down too looking very concerned are you all right do you need help 
 
 no said harry nothing like that i just wanted to talk about my dad 
 
 they exchanged a look of great surprise but harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed his knees were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed five minutes had already passed from the start of the diversion george had only guaranteed him twenty he therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the pensieve 
 
 when he had finished neither sirius nor lupin spoke for a moment then lupin said quietly i like you to judge your father on what you saw there harry he was only fifteen 
 
 fifteen said harry heatedly 
 
 look harry said sirius placatingly james and snape hated each other from the moment they set eyes on each other it was just one of those things you can understand that you i think james was everything snape wanted to behe was popular he was good at quidditchgood at pretty much everything and snape was just this little oddball who was up to his eyes in the dark arts and jameswhatever else he may have appeared to you harryalways hated the dark arts 
 
 yeah said harry but he just attacked snape for no good reason just becausewell just because you said you were bored he finished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice 
 
 i m not proud of it said sirius quickly 
 
 lupin looked sideways at sirius then said look harry what got to understand is that your father and sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did everyone thought they were the height of coolif they sometimes got a bit carried away 
 
 if we were sometimes arrogant little berks you mean said sirius 
 
 lupin smiled 
 
 he kept messing up his hair said harry in a pained voice 
 
 sirius and lupin laughed 
 
 forgotten he used to do that said sirius affectionately 
 
 was he playing with the snitch said lupin eagerly 
 
 yeah said harry watching uncomprehendingly as sirius and lupin beamed reminiscently well i thought he was a bit of an idiot 
 
 of course he was a bit of an idiot said sirius bracingly we were all idiots well not moony so much he said fairly looking at lupin 
 
 but lupin shook his head did i ever tell you to lay off snape he said did i ever have the guts to tell you i thought you were out of order 
 
 yeah well said sirius you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes that was something 
 
 and said harry doggedly determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here he kept looking over at the girls by the lake hoping they were watching him 
 
 oh well he always made a fool of himself whenever lily was around said sirius shrugging he stop himself showing off whenever he got near her 
 
 how come she married him harry asked miserably she hated him 
 
 nah she said sirius 
 
 she started going out with him in seventh year said lupin 
 
 once james had deflated his head a bit said sirius 
 
 and stopped hexing people just for the fun of it said lupin 
 
 even snape said harry 
 
 well said lupin slowly snape was a special case i mean he never lost an opportunity to curse james so you really expect james to take that lying down could you 
 
 and my mum was ok with that 
 
 she know too much about it to tell you the truth said sirius i mean james take snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her did he 
 
 sirius frowned at harry who was still looking unconvinced 
 
 look he said your father was the best friend i ever had and he was a good person a lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen he grew out of it 
 
 yeah ok said harry heavily i just never thought feel sorry for snape 
 
 now you mention it said lupin a faint crease between his eyebrows how did snape react when he found seen all this 
 
 he told me never teach me occlumency again said harry indifferently like a big disappoint 
 
 he what shouted sirius causing harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ashes 
 
 are you serious harry said lupin quickly stopped giving you lessons 
 
 yeah said harry surprised at what he considered a great but ok i care a bit of a relief to tell you the 
 
 coming up there to have a word with snape said sirius forcefully and he actually made to stand up but lupin wrenched him back down again 
 
 if going to tell snape it will be me he said firmly but harry first of all to go back to snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessonswhen dumbledore hears 
 
 i tell him that kill me said harry outraged you see him when we got out of the pensieve 
 
 harry there is nothing so important as you learning occlumency said lupin sternly do you understand me nothing 
 
 ok ok said harry thoroughly discomposed not to mention annoyed try and say something to him but it be 
 
 he fell silent he could hear distant footsteps 
 
 is that kreacher coming downstairs 
 
 no said sirius glancing behind him it must be somebody your end 
 
 heart skipped several beats 
 
 better go he said hastily and pulled his head backwards out of the grimmauld place fire for a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulders then he found himself kneeling in front of fire with it firmly back on and watching the emerald flames flicker and die 
 
 quickly quickly he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door ah left it open 
 
 harry dived for the invisibility cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when filch burst into the office he looked absolutely delighted about something and was talking to himself feverishly as he crossed the room pulled open a drawer in desk and began rifling through the papers inside it 
 
 approval for whipping approval for whipping i can do it at last had it coming to them for years 
 
 he pulled out a piece of parchment kissed it then shuffled rapidly back out of the door clutching it to his chest 
 
 harry leapt to his feet and making sure he had his bag and that the invisibility cloak was completely covering him he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after filch who was hobbling along faster than harry had ever seen him go 
 
 one landing down from office harry thought it was safe to become visible again he pulled off the cloak shoved it in his bag and hurried onwards there was a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the entrance hall he ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there 
 
 it was just like the night when trelawney had been sacked students were standing all around the walls in a great ring some of them harry noticed covered in a substance that looked very like stinksap teachers and ghosts were also in the crowd prominent among the onlookers were members of the inquisitorial squad who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves and peeves who was bobbing overhead gazed down at fred and george who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakeable look of two people who had just been cornered 
 
 so said umbridge triumphantly harry realised she was standing just a few stairs in front of him once more looking down upon her prey soyou think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp do you 
 
 pretty amusing yeah said fred looking up at her without the slightest sign of fear 
 
 filch elbowed his way closer to umbridge almost crying with happiness 
 
 got the form headmistress he said hoarsely waving the piece of parchment harry had just seen him take from her desk got the form and got the whips waiting oh let me do it now 
 
 very good argus she said you two she went on gazing down at fred and george are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school 
 
 you know what said fred i think we are 
 
 he turned to his twin 
 
 george said fred i think outgrown education 
 
 yeah been feeling that way myself said george lightly 
 
 time to test our talents in the real world reckon asked fred 
 
 definitely said george 
 
 and before umbridge could say a word they raised their wands and said together 
 
 accio brooms 
 
 harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance looking to his left he ducked just in time fred and broomsticks one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which umbridge had fastened them to the wall were hurtling along the corridor towards their owners they turned left streaked down the stairs and stopped sharply in front of the twins the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor 
 
 we be seeing you fred told professor umbridge swinging his leg over his broomstick 
 
 yeah bother to keep in touch said george mounting his own 
 
 fred looked around at the assembled students at the silent watchful crowd 
 
 it anyone fancies buying a portable swamp as demonstrated upstairs come to number diagon wizarding wheezes he said in a loud voice our new premises 
 
 special discounts to students who swear going to use our products to get rid of this old bat added george pointing at professor umbridge 
 
 stop them shrieked umbridge but it was too late as the inquisitorial squad closed in fred and george kicked off from the floor shooting fifteen feet into the air the iron peg swinging dangerously below fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd 
 
 give her hell from us peeves 
 
 and peeves who harry had never seen take an order from a student before swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as fred and george wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the order of the phoenix 
 

lionfish nov chapter the pheonix lamentcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 harry 
 
 no 
 
 yeh can stay here harry come on now 
 
 no 
 
 he did not want to leave side he did not want to move anywhere hand on his shoulder was trembling then another voice said harry come on 
 
 a much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward he obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize from a trace of flowery scent on the air that it was ginny who was leading him back into the castle incomprehensible voices battered him sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night but harry and ginny walked on back up the steps into the entrance hall faces swam on the edges of vision people were peering at him whispering wondering and gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase 
 
 going to the hospital wing said ginny 
 
 not hurt said harry 
 
 orders said ginny up there ron and hermione and lupin and everyone 
 
 fear stirred in chest again he had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind 
 
 ginny who else is dead 
 
 worry none of us 
 
 but the dark markmalfoy said he stepped over a body 
 
 he stepped over bill but all right alive 
 
 there was something in her voice however that harry knew boded ill 
 
 are you sure 
 
 of course sure aa bit of a mess all greyback attacked him madam pomfrey says he look the same anymore 
 
 voice trembled a little 
 
 we really know what the will be i mean greyback being a werewolf but not transformed at the time 
 
 but the other there were other bodies on the ground 
 
 neville and professor flitwick are both hurt but madam pomfrey says be all right and a death dead he got hit by a killing curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhereharry if we had your felix potion i think all have been killed but everything seemed to just miss us 
 
 they had reached the hospital wing pushing open the doors harry saw neville lying apparently asleep in a bed near the door ron hermione luna tonks and lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward at the sound of the doors opening they all looked up hermione ran to harry and hugged him lupin moved forward too looking anxious 
 
 are you all right harry 
 
 fine bill 
 
 nobody answered harry looked over shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on pillow so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque madam pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some green ointment harry remembered how snape had mended sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand 
 
 you fix them with a charm or something he asked the matron 
 
 no charm will work on these said madam pomfrey tried everything i know but there is no cure for werewolf bites 
 
 but he bitten at the full moon said ron who was gazing down into his face as though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring greyback transformed so surely bill be aa real 
 
 he looked uncertainly at lupin 
 
 no i think that bill will be a true werewolf said lupin but that does not mean that there be some contamination those are cursed wounds they are unlikely ever to heal fully andand bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on 
 
 dumbledore might know something work though ron said where is he bill fought those maniacs on orders dumbledore owes him he leave him in this state 
 
 dead said ginny 
 
 no lupin looked wildly from ginny to harry as though hoping the latter might contradict her but when harry did nor lupin collapsed into a chair beside bed his hands over his face harry had never seen lupin lose control before he felt as though he was intruding upon something private indecent he turned away and caught eye instead exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what ginny had said 
 
 how did he die whispered tonks how did it happen 
 
 snape killed him said harry i was there i saw it we arrived back on the astronomy tower because where the mark was dumbledore was ill he was weak but i think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs he immobilized me i do anything i was under the invisibility cloakand then malfoy came through the door and disarmed him 
 
 hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and ron groaned mouth trembled 
 
 more death eaters arrivedand then snapeand snape did it the avada kedavra harry go on 
 
 madam pomfrey burst into tears nobody paid her any attention except ginny who whispered shh listen 
 
 gulping madam pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth her eyes wide somewhere out in the darkness a phoenix was singing in a way harry had never heard before a stricken lament of terrible beauty and harry felt as he had felt about phoenix song before that the music was inside him not without it was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows 
 
 how long they all stood there listening he did not know nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and professor mcgonagall entered the ward like all the rest she bore marks of the recent battle there were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped 
 
 molly and arthur are on their way she said and the spell of the music was broken everyone roused themselves as though coming out of trances turning again to look at bill or else to rub their own eyes shake their heads harry what happened according to hagrid you were with professor dumbledore when hewhen it happened he says professor snape was involved in some 
 
 snape killed dumbledore said harry 
 
 she stared at him for a moment then swayed alarmingly madam pomfrey who seemed to have pulled herself together ran forward conjuring a chair from thin air which she pushed under mcgonagall 
 
 snape repeated mcgonagall faintly falling into the chair we all wondered but he trusted always snape i believe it 
 
 snape was a highly accomplished occlumens said lupin his voice uncharacteristically harsh we always knew that 
 
 but dumbledore swore he was on our side whispered tonks i always thought dumbledore must know something about snape that we 
 
 he always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting snape muttered professor mcgonagall now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a handkerchief i mean with history of course people were bound to wonder but dumbledore told me explicitly that repentance was absolutely genuine hear a word against him 
 
 love to know what snape told him to convince him said tonks 
 
 i know said harry and they all turned to look at him snape passed voldemort the information that made voldemort hunt down my mum and dad then snape told dumbledore he realized what he was doing he was really sorry done it sorry that they were dead 
 
 they all stared at him 
 
 and dumbledore believed that said lupin incredulously dumbledore believed snape was sorry james was dead snape hated james 
 
 and he think my mother was worth a damn either said harry because she was mudblood he called her 
 
 nobody asked how harry knew this all of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened 
 
 this is all my fault said professor mcgonagall suddenly she looked disoriented twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands my fault i sent filius to fetch snape tonight i actually sent for him to come and help us if i alerted snape to what was going on he might never have joined forces with the death eaters i think he knew they were there before filius told him i think he knew they were coming 
 
 it your fault minerva said lupin firmly we all wanted more help we were glad to think snape was on his way 
 
 so when he arrived at the fight he joined in on the death eaters side asked harry who wanted every detail of duplicity and infamy feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him to swear vengeance 
 
 i know exactly how it happened said professor mcgonagall distractedly all so confusing dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case remus bill and nymphadora were to join us and so we patrolled all seemed quiet every secret passageway out of the school was covered we knew nobody could fly in there were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle i still know how the death eaters can possibly have entered 
 
 i do said harry and he explained briefly about the pair of vanishing cabinets and the magical pathway they formed so they got in through the room of requirement 
 
 almost against his will he glanced from ron to hermione both of whom looked devastated 
 
 i messed up harry said ron bleakly we did like you told us we checked the map and we see malfoy on it so we thought he must be in the room of requirement so me ginny and neville went to keep watch on it but malfoy got past us 
 
 he came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch said ginny he was on his own clutching that awful shriveled arm 
 
 his hand of glory said ron gives light only to the holder remember 
 
 anyway ginny went on he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the death eaters out because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went 
 
 peruvian instant darkness powder said ron bitterly fred and going to be having a word with them about who they let buy their products 
 
 we tried everything lumos incendio said ginny nothing would penetrate the darkness all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past us obviously malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them but we dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other and by the time reached a corridor that was light gone 
 
 luckily said lupin hoarsely ron ginny and neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened we found the death eaters minutes later heading in the direction of the astronomy tower malfoy obviously expected more people to be on the watch he seemed to have exhausted his supply of darkness powder at any rate a fight broke out they scattered and we gave chase one of them gibbon broke away and headed up the tower stairs 
 
 to set off the mark asked harry 
 
 he must have done yes they must have arranged that before they left the room of requirement said lupin but i think gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for dumbledore because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a killing curse that just missed me 
 
 so if ron was watching the room of requirement with ginny and neville said harry turning to hermione were you 
 
 outside office yes whispered hermione her eyes sparkling with tears with luna we hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened we know what was going on upstairs ron had taken the map it was nearly midnight when professor flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons he was shouting about death eaters in the castle i think he really registered that luna and i were there at all he just burst his way into office and we heard him saying that snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us andand 
 
 what harry urged her 
 
 i was so stupid harry said hermione in a whisper he said professor flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while hewhile he went to help fight the death eaters 
 
 she covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers so that her voice was muffled we went into his office to see if we could help professor flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor and oh so obvious now snape must have stupefied flitwick but we realize harry we realize we just let snape go 
 
 not your fault said lupin firmly hermione had you not obeyed snape and got out of the way he probably would have killed you and luna 
 
 so then he came upstairs said harry who was watching snape running up the marble staircase in his eye his black robes billowing behind him as ever pulling his wand from under his cloak as he ascended and he found the place where you were all fighting 
 
 we were in trouble we were losing said tonks in a low voice gibbon was down but the rest of the death eaters seemed ready to fight to the death neville had been hurt bill had been savaged by greyback it was all dark curses flying everywhere the malfoy boy had vanished he must have slipped past up the stairs then more of them ran after him but one of them blocked the stairs behind them with some kind of curse neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air 
 
 none of us could break through said ron and that massive death eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us 
 
 and then snape was there said tonks and then he 
 
 i saw him running toward us but that huge death jinx just missed me right afterward and i ducked and lost track of things said ginny 
 
 i saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it there said lupin i tried to follow him but was thrown back just like neville 
 
 he must have known a spell we whispered mcgonagall after allhe was the defense against the dark arts teacher i just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the death eaters escaped up to the tower 
 
 he was said harry savagely but to help them not to stop the and bet you had to have a dark mark to get through that barrierso what happened when he came back down 
 
 well the big death eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in and also broke the curse blocking the stairs said lupin we all ran forwardthose of us who were still standing anywayand then snape and the boy emerged out of the dustobviously none of us attacked them 
 
 we just let them pass said tonks in a hollow voice we thought they were being chased by the death eatersand next thing the other death eaters and greyback were back and we were fighting againi thought i heard snape shout something but i know what 
 
 he shouted over said harry done what meant to do 
 
 they all fell silent lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside as the music reverberated upon the air unbidden unwelcome thoughts slunk into mind had they taken body from the foot of the tower yet what would happen to it next where would it rest he clenched his fists tighdy in his pockets he could feel the small cold lump of the fake horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand 
 
 the doors of the hospital wing burst open making them all jump mr and mrs weasley were striding up the ward fleur just behind them her beautiful face terrified 
 
 mollyarthur said professor mcgonagall jumping up and hurrying to greet them i am so sorry 
 
 bill whispered mrs weasley darting past professor mcgonagall as she caught sight of mangled face oh bill 
 
 lupin and tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that mr and mrs weasley could get nearer to the bed mrs weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead 
 
 you said greyback attacked him mr weasley asked professor mcgonagall distractedly but he transformed so what does that mean what will happen to bill 
 
 we yet know said professor mcgonagall looking helplessly at lupin 
 
 there will probably be some contamination arthur said lupin it is an odd case possibly unique we know what his behavior might be like when he awakens 
 
 mrs weasley took the ointment from madam pomfrey and began dabbing at wounds 
 
 and dumbledore said mr weasley minerva is it true is he really 
 
 as professor mcgonagall nodded harry felt ginny move beside him and looked at her her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon fleur who was gazing down at bill with a frozen expression on her face 
 
 dumbledore gone whispered mr weasley but mrs weasley had eyes only for her eldest son she began to sob tears falling onto mutilated face 
 
 of course it matter how he looks not important but he was a very handsome little always very handsome and he was to be married 
 
 and what do you mean by zat said fleur suddenly and loudly what do you mean he was going to be married 
 
 mrs weasley raised her face looking startled wellonly that 
 
 you theenk bill will not wish to marry me anymore demanded fleur you theenk because of these bites he will not love me 
 
 no not what i 
 
 because e will said fleur drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair it would take more zan a werewolf to stop bill loving me 
 
 well yes sure said mrs weasley but i thought perhapsgiven howhow he 
 
 you thought i would not weesh to marry him or you hoped said fleur her nostrils flaring what do i care how he looks i am enough for both of us i theenk all these scars show is zat my husband is brave and i shall do zat she added fiercely pushing mrs weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her 
 
 mrs weasley fell back against her husband and watched fleur mopping up wounds with a most curious expression upon her face nobody said anything harry did not dare move like everybody else he was waiting for the explosion 
 
 our muriel said mrs weasley after a long pause has a very beautiful i am sure i could persuade her to lend you for the wedding she is very fond of bill you know and it would look lovely with your hair 
 
 thank you said fleur stiffly i am sure zat will be lovely 
 
 and then harry did not quite see how it happened both women were crying and hugging each other completely bewildered wondering whether the world had gone mad he turned around ron looked as stunned as he felt and ginny and hermione were exchanging startled looks 
 
 you see said a strained voice tonks was glaring at lupin she still wants to marry him even though been bitten she care 
 
 different said lupin barely moving his lips and looking suddenly tense bill will not be a full werewolf the cases are completely 
 
 but i care either i care said tonks seizing the front of robes and shaking them told you a million times 
 
 and the meaning of patronus and her hair and the reason she had come running to find dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by greyback all suddenly became clear to harry it had not been sirius that tonks had fallen in love with after all 
 
 and told you a million times said lupin refusing to meet her eyes staring at the floor that i am too old for you too poor too dangerous 
 
 said all along taking a ridiculous line on this remus said mrs weasley over shoulder as she patted her on the back 
 
 i am not being ridiculous said lupin steadily tonks deserves somebody young and whole 
 
 but she wants you said mr weasley with a small smile and after all remus young and whole men do not necessarily remain so 
 
 he gestured sadly at his son lying between them 
 
 this is not the moment to discuss it said lupin avoiding eyes as he looked around distractedly dumbledore is dead 
 
 dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world said professor mcgonagall curtly just as the hospital doors opened again and hagrid walked in 
 
 the little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen he was shaking with tears a vast spotted handkerchief in his hand 
 
 done it professor he choked him professor got the kids back in bed professor lyin down but he says be all righ in a jiffy an professor slughorn says the bin informed 
 
 thank you hagrid said professor mcgonagall standing up at once and turning to look at the group around bed i shall have to see the ministry when they get here hagrid please tell the heads of housesslughorn can represent slytherin that i want to see them in my office forthwith i would like you to join us too 
 
 as hagrid nodded turned and shuffled out of the room again she looked down at harry before i meet them i would like a quick word with you harry if come with me 
 
 harry stood up murmured see you in a bit to ron hermione and ginny and followed professor mcgonagall back down the ward the corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song it was several minutes before harry became aware that they were not heading for professor office but for and another few seconds before he realized that of course she had been deputy headmistress apparently she was now headmistress so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers 
 
 in silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office he did not know what he had expected that the room would be draped in black perhaps or even that body might be lying there in fact it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and dumbledore had left it mere hours previously the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle legged tables sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight the sorting hat on a shelf behind the desk the perch stood empty he was still crying his lament to the grounds and a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of hogwarts dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk his spectacle perched upon his crooked nose looking peaceful and untroubled 
 
 after glancing once at this portrait professor mcgonagall made an odd movement as though steeling herself then rounded the desk to look at harry her face taut and lined 
 
 harry she said i would like to know what you and professor dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school 
 
 i tell you that professor said harry he had expected the question and had his answer ready it had been here in this very room that dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but ron and hermione 
 
 harry it might be important said professor mcgonagall 
 
 it is said harry very but he want me to tell anyone 
 
 professor mcgonagall glared at him 
 
 registered the renewed use of his the light of professor death i think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat 
 
 i think so said harry shrugging professor dumbledore never told me to stop following his orders if he died 
 
 but 
 
 one thing you should know before the ministry gets here though madam under the imperius curse she was helping malfoy and the death eaters how the necklace and the poisoned mead 
 
 rosmerta said professor mcgonagall incredulously but before she could go on there was a knock on the door behind them and professors sprout flitwick and slughorn traipsed into the room followed by hagrid who was still weeping copiously his huge frame trembling with grief 
 
 snape ejaculated slughorn who looked the most shaken pale and sweating snape i taught him i thought i knew him 
 
 but before any of them could respond to this a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall a wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas minerva the minister will be here within seconds he has just disapparated from the ministry 
 
 thank you everard said professor mcgonagall and she turned quickly to her teachers 
 
 i want to talk about what happens to hogwarts before he gets here she said quickly personally i am not convinced that the school should reopen next year the death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon hogwarts history it is horrible 
 
 i am sure dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open said professor sprout i feel that if a single pupil wants to come then the school ought to remain open for that pupil 
 
 but will we have a single pupil after this said slughorn now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief parents will want to keep their children at home and i say i blame them personally i think in more danger at hogwarts than we are anywhere else but you expect mothers to think like that want to keep their families together only natural 
 
 i agree said professor mcgonagall and in any case it is not true to say that dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which hogwarts might close when the chamber of secrets reopened he considered the closure of the schooland i must say that professor murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle 
 
 we must consult the governors said professor flitwick in his squeaky little voice he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in office we must follow the established procedures a decision should not be made hastily 
 
 hagrid you said anything said professor mcgonagall what are your views ought hogwarts to remain open 
 
 hagrid who had been weeping silently into his large spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation now raised puffy red eyes and croaked i dunno professor fer the heads of house an the headmistress ter decide 
 
 professor dumbledore always valued your views said professor mcgonagall kindly and so do i 
 
 well stayin said hagrid fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard me home bin me home since i was thirteen an if kids who wan me ter teach em do it but i dunno hogwarts without dumbledore he gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more and there was silence 
 
 very well said professor mcgonagall glancing out of the window at the grounds checking to see whether the minister was yet approaching then i must agree with filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governors who will make the final decision 
 
 now as to getting students home there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later we could arrange for the hogwarts express to come tomorrow if necessary 
 
 what about funeral said harry speaking at last 
 
 well said professor mcgonagall losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook ii know that it was wish to be laid to rest here at hogwarts 
 
 then happen it said harry fiercely 
 
 if the ministry thinks it appropriate said professor mcgonagall no other headmaster or headmistress has ever been 
 
 no other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school growled hagrid 
 
 hogwarts should be final resting place said professor flitwick 
 
 absolutely said professor sprout 
 
 and in that case said harry you send the students home until the over want to say 
 
 the last word caught in his throat but professor sprout completed the sentence for him 
 
 goodbye 
 
 well said squeaked professor flitwick well said indeed our students should pay tribute it is fitting we can arrange transport home afterward 
 
 seconded barked professor sprout 
 
 i suppose yes said slughorn in a rather agitated voice while hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent 
 
 coming said professor mcgonagall suddenly gazing down into the grounds the minister and by the looks of it brought a delegation 
 
 can i leave professor said harry at once 
 
 he had no desire at all to see or be interrogated by rufus scrimgeour tonight 
 
 you may said professor mcgonagall and quickly 
 
 she strode toward the door and held it open for him he sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor he had left his invisibility cloak at the top of the astronomy tower but it did not matter there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass not even filch mrs norris or peeves he did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the gryffindor common room 
 
 is it true whispered the fat lady as he approached her it is really true dumbledoredead 
 
 yes said harry 
 
 she let out a wail and without waiting for the password swung forward to admit him 
 
 as harry had suspected it would be the common room was the room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole he saw dean and seamus sitting in a group nearby this meant that the dormitory must be empty or nearly so without speaking to anybody without making eye contact at all harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys dormitories 
 
 as he had hoped ron was waiting for him still fully dressed sitting on his bed harry sat down on his own and for a moment they simply stared at each other 
 
 talking about closing the school said harry 
 
 lupin said they would said ron 
 
 there was a pause 
 
 so said ron in a very low voice as though he thought the furniture might be listening in did you find one did you get it aa horcrux 
 
 harry shook his head all that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now had it really happened and only hours ago 
 
 you get it said ron looking crestfallen it there 
 
 no said harry someone had already taken it and left a fake in its place 
 
 already taken 
 
 wordlessly harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket opened it and passed it to ron the full story could wait it did not matter tonight nothing mattered except the end the end of their pointless adventure the end of life 
 
 whispered ron but who was that 
 
 dunno said harry lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards he felt no curiosity at all about he doubted that he would ever feel curious again as he lay there he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent fawkes had stopped singing 
 
 and he knew without knowing how he knew it that the phoenix had gone had left hogwarts for good just as dumbledore had left the school had left the world had left harry 
 
 rowling 
 
 harry potter 
 
 the half blood prince 
 

lionfish nov chapter the lost diademcontents prev chapter next chapter 
 
 neville c what the c how c 
 
 but neville had spotted ron and hermione and with yells of delight was hugging them too the longer harry looked at neville the worse he appeared one of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple there were gouge marks on his face and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living enough nevertheless his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of hermione and said again i knew youd come kept telling seamus it was a matter of time 
 
 neville whats happened to you 
 
 what this neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head this is nothing seamus is worse youll see shall we get going then oh he turned to aberforth ab there might be a couple more people to the way 
 
 couple more repeated aberforth ominously what dyou mean a couple more longbottom theres a curfew and a camwaulding charm on the whole village 
 
 i know thats why theyll be apparating directly into the bar said neville just send them down the passage when they get here will you thanks a lot 
 
 neville held out his hand to hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel ron followed then neville harry addressed aberforth 
 
 i dont know how to thank you youve saved our lives twice 
 
 look after em then said aberforth gruffly i might not be able to save em a third time 
 
 harry chambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind arianas portrait there were smooth stone steps on the other side it looked as though the passageway had been there for years brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth as they walked their shadows rippled fanlike across the wall 
 
 how longs this been here ron asked as they set off it isnt on the marauders map is it harry i thought there were only seven passages in and out of school 
 
 they sealed off all of those before the start of the year said neville theres no chance of getting through any of them now not with the curses over the entrances and death eaters and dementors waiting at the exits he started walking backward beaming drinking them in never mind that stuff is it true did you break into gringotts did you escape on a dragon its everywhere everyones talking about it terry boot got beaten up by carrow for yelling about it in the great hall at dinner 
 
 yeah its true said harry 
 
 neville laughed gleefully 
 
 what did you do with the dragon 
 
 released it into the wild said ron hermione was all for keeping it as a pet 
 
 dont exaggerate ron c 
 
 but what have you been doing people have been saying youve just been on the run harry but i dont think so i think youve been up to something 
 
 youre right said harry but tell us about hogwarts neville we havent heard anything 
 
 its been well its not really like hogwarts anymore said neville the smile fading from his face as he spoke do you know about the carrows 
 
 those two death eaters who teach here 
 
 they do more than teach said neville theyre in charge of all discipline they like punishment the carrows 
 
 like umbridge 
 
 nah they make her look tame the other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the carrows if we do anything wrong they dont though if they can avoid it you can tell they all hate them as much as we do 
 
 amycus the bloke he teaches what used to be defense against the dark arts except now its just the dark arts were supposed to practice the cruciatus curse on people whove earned detentions c 
 
 what 
 
 harry ron and hermiones united voices echoed up and down the passage 
 
 yeah said neville thats how i got this one he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek i refused to do it some people are into it though crabbe and goyle love it first time theyve ever been top in anything i expect 
 
 alecto amycuss sister teaches muggle studies which is compulsory for everyone weve all got to listen to her explain how muggles are like animals stupid and dirty and how they drive wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them and how the natural order is being reestablished i got this one he indicated another slash to his face for asking her how much muggle blood she and her brother have got 
 
 blimey neville said ron theres a time and a place for getting a smart mouth 
 
 you didnt see her said neville you wouldnt have stood it either the thing is it helps when people stand up to them it gives everyone hope i used to notice that when you did it harry 
 
 but theyve used you as a knife sharpener said ron winding slightly as they passed a lamp and nevilles injuries were thrown into even greater relief 
 
 neville shrugged 
 
 doesnt matter they dont want to spill too much pure blood so theyll torture us a bit if were mouthy but they wont actually kill us 
 
 harry did not know what was worse the things that neville was saying or the tone in which he said them 
 
 the only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble they get taken hostage old xeno lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in the quibbler so they dragged luna off the train on the way back for christmas 
 
 neville shes all right weve seen her c 
 
 yeah i know she managed to get a message to me 
 
 from his pocket he pulled a golden coin and harry recognized it as one of the fake galleons that dumbledores army had used to send one another messages 
 
 these have been great said neville beaming at hermione the carrows never rumbled how we were communicating it drove them mad we used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls dumbledores army still recruiting stuff like that snape hated it 
 
 you used to said harry who had noticed the past tense 
 
 well it got more difficult as time went on said neville we lost luna at christmas and ginny never came back after easter and the three of us were sort of the leaders the carrows seemed to know i was behind a lot of it so they started coming down on me hard and then michael corner went and got caught releasing a theyd chained up and they tortured him pretty badly that scared people off 
 
 no kidding muttered ron as the passage began to slope upward 
 
 yeah well i couldnt ask people to go through what michael did so we dropped those kinds of stunts but we were still fighting doing underground stuff right up until a couple of weeks ago thats when they decided there was only one way to stop me i suppose and they went for gran 
 
 they what said harry ron and hermione together 
 
 yeah said neville panting a little now because the passage was climbing so steeply well you can see their thinking it had worked really well kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave i spose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around thing was he faced them and harry was astonished to see that he was grinning they bit off a bit more than they could chew with gran little old witch living alone they probably thought hey didnt need to send anyone particularly powerful anyway neville laughed dawlish is still in st mungos and grans on the run she sent me a letter he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes telling me she was proud of me that im my parents son and to keep it up 
 
 cool said ron 
 
 yea said neville happily only thing was once they realized they had no hold over me they decided hogwarts could do without me after all i dont know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to azkaban either way i knew it was time to disappear 
 
 but said ron looking thoroughly confused arent c arent we heading straight back for hogwarts 
 
 course said neville youll see were here 
 
 they turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage another short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind arianas portrait neville pushed it open and climbed through as harry followed he heard neville call out for unseen people 
 
 look who it is didnt i tell you 
 
 as harry emerged into the room behind the passage there were several screams and yells harry 
 
 its potter its potter 
 
 ron 
 
 hermione 
 
 he had a confused impression of colored hangings of lamps and many faces the next moment he ron and hermione were engulfed hugged pounded on the back their hair ruffled their hands shaken by what seemed to be more than twenty people they might have just won a quidditch final 
 
 okay okay calm down neville called and as the crowd backed away harry was able to take in their surroundings 
 
 he did not recognize the dorm at all it was enormous and looked rather like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house or perhaps a gigantic ships cabin multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from the balcony that ran around the dark and windowless walls which were covered in bright tapestry hangings harry saw the gold gryffindor lion emblazoned on scarlet the black badger of hufflepuff set against yellow and the bronze eagle of ravenclaw on blue the silver and green of slytherin alone were absent there were bulging bookcases a few broomsticks propped against the walls and in the corner a large wireless 
 
 where are we 
 
 room of requirement of course said neville surpassed itself hasnt it the carrows were chasing me and i knew i had just one chance for a hideout i managed to get through the door and this is what i found well it wasnt exactly like this when i arrived it was a load smaller there was only one hammock and just gryffindor hangings but its expanded as more and more of the have arrived 
 
 and the carrows cant get in asked harry looking around for the door 
 
 no said seamus finnigan whom harry had not recognized until he spoke seamuss face was bruised and puffy its a proper hideout as long as one of us stays in here they cant get at us the door wont open its all down to neville he really gets this room youve got to ask for exactly what you need c like i dont want any carrow supporters to be able to get in c and itll do it for you youve just got to make sure you close the loopholes nevilles the man 
 
 its quite straightforward really said neville modestly id been in here about a day and a half and getting really hungry and wishing i could get something to eat and thats when the passage to hogs head opened up i went through it and met aberforth hes been providing us with food because for some reason thats the one thing the room doesnt really do 
 
 yeah well foods one of the five exceptions to gamps law of elemental transfiguration said ron to general astonishment 
 
 so weve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks said seamus and it just makes more hammocks every time we need room and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up c 
 
 c and thought theyd quite like to wash yes supplied lavender brown whom harry had not noticed until that point now that he looked around properly he recognized many familiar faces both patil twins were there as were terry boot ernie macmillan anthony goldstein and michael corner 
 
 tell us what youve been up to though said ernie thereve been so many rumors weve been trying to keep up with you on potterwatch he pointed at the wireless you didnt break into gringotts 
 
 they did said neville and the dragons true too 
 
 there was a smattering of applause and a few whoops ron took a bow 
 
 what were you after asked seamus eagerly 
 
 before any of them could parry the question with one of their own harry felt a terrible scorching pain in the lightning scar as he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces the room of requirement vanished and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole and voldemorts scream of fury vibrated inside his head 
 
 with an enormous effort he pulled out of voldemorts mind again back to where he stood swaying in the room of requirement sweat pouring from his face and ron holding him up 
 
 are you all right harry neville was saying what to sit down i expect youre tired arent c 
 
 no said harry he looked at ron and hermione trying to tell them without words that voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other horcruxes time was running out fast if voldemort chose to visit hogwarts next they would miss their chance 
 
 we need to get going he said and their expressions told him that they understood 
 
 what are we going to do then harry asked seamus whats the plan 
 
 plan repeated harry he was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself succumbing again to voldemorts rage his scar was still burning well theres something we c ron hermione and i c need to do and then well get out of here 
 
 nobody was laughing or whooping anymore neville looked confused 
 
 what dyou mean get out of here 
 
 we havent come back to stay said harry rubbing his scar trying to soothe the pain theres something important we need to do c 
 
 what is it 
 
 i c i cant tell you 
 
 there was a ripple of muttering at this nevilles brows contracted 
 
 why cant you tell us its something to do with fighting right 
 
 well yeah c 
 
 then well help you 
 
 the other members of dumbledores army were nodding some enthusiastically others solemnly a couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action 
 
 you dont understand harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours we c we cant tell you weve got to do it c alone 
 
 why asked neville 
 
 because in his desperation to start looking for the missing horcrux or at least have a private discussion with ron and hermione about where they might commence their search harry found it difficult to gather his thoughts his scar was still searing dumbledore left the three of us a job he said carefully and we werent supposed to tell c i mean he wanted us to do it just the three of us 
 
 were his army said neville dumbledores army we were all in it together weve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own c 
 
 it hasnt exactly been a picnic mate said ron 
 
 i never said it had but i dont see why you cant trust us everyone in this rooms been fighting and theyve been driven in here because the carrows were hunting them down everyone in heres proven theyre loyal to dumbledore c loyal to you 
 
 look harry began without knowing what he was going to say but it did not matter the tunnel door had just opened behind him 
 
 we got your message neville hello you three i thought you must be here 
 
 it was luna and dean seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend 
 
 hi everyone said luna happily oh its great to be back 
 
 luna said harry distractedly what are you doing here how did you c 
 
 i sent for her said neville holding up the fake galleon i promised her and ginny that if you turned up id let them know we all thought that if you came back it would mean revolution that we were going to overthrow snape and the carrows 
 
 of course thats what it means said luna brightly isnt it harry were going to fight them out of hogwarts 
 
 listen said harry with a rising sense of panic im sorry but thats not what we came back for theres something weve got to do and then c 
 
 youre going to leave us in this mess demanded michael cornet 
 
 no said ron what were doing will benefit everyone in the end its all about trying to get rid of c 
 
 then let us help said neville angrily we want to be a part of it 
 
 there was another noise behind them and harry turned his heart seemed to fall ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall closely followed by fred george and lee jordan ginny gave harry a radiant smile he had forgotten he had never fully appreciated how beautiful she was but he had never been less pleased to see her 
 
 aberforths getting a bit annoyed said fred raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting he wants a kip and his bars turned into a railway station 
 
 harrys mouth fell open right behind lee jordan came harrys old girlfriend cho chang she smiled at him 
 
 i got the message she said holding up her own fake galleon and she walked over to sit beside michael corner 
 
 so whats the plan harry said george 
 
 there isnt one said harry still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely 
 
 just going to make it up as we go along are we my favorite kind said fred 
 
 youve got to stop this harry told neville what did you call them all back for this is insane c 
 
 were fighting arent we said dean taking out his fake galleon the message said harry was back and we were going to fight ill have to get a wand though c 
 
 you havent got a wandc began seamus 
 
 ron turned suddenly to harry 
 
 why cant they help 
 
 what 
 
 they can help he dropped his voice and said so that none of them could hear but hermione who stood between them we dont know where it is weve got to find it fast we dont have to tell them its a horcrux 
 
 harry looked from ron to hermione who murmured i think rons right we dont even know what were looking for we need them and when harry looked unconvinced you dont have to do everything alone harry 
 
 harry thought fast his scar still prickling his head threatening to split again dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but ron and hermione about the horcruxes secrets and lies thats how we grew up and albus he was a natural was he turning into dumbledore keeping his secrets clutched to his chest afraid to trust but dumbledore had trusted snape and where had that led to murder at the top of the highest tower 
 
 all right he said quietly to the other two okay he called to the room at large and all noise ceased fred and george who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest fell silent and all of the looked alert excited 
 
 theres something we need to find harry said something c something thatll help us overthrow its here at hogwarts but we dont know where it might have belonged to ravenclaw has anyone heard of an object like that has anyone come across something with her eagle on it for instance 
 
 he looked hopefully toward the little group of ravenclaws to padma michael terry and cho but it was luna who answered perched on the arm of ginnys chair 
 
 well theres her lost diadem i told you about it remember harry the lost diadem of ravenclaw daddys trying to duplicate it 
 
 yeah but the lost diadem said michael corner rolling his eyes is lost luna thats sort of the point 
 
 when was it lost asked harry 
 
 centuries ago they say said cho and harrys heart sank professor flitwick says the diadem vanished with ravenclaw herself people have looked but she appealed to her fellow ravenclaws nobodys ever found a trace of it have them 
 
 they all shook their heads 
 
 sorry but what is a diadem asked ron 
 
 its a kind of crown said terry boot ravenclaws was supposed to have magical properties enhance the wisdom of the wearer 
 
 yes daddys wrackspurt siphons c 
 
 but harry cut across luna 
 
 and none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it 
 
 they all shook their heads again harry looked at ron and hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him an object that had been lost this long and apparently without trace did not seem like a good candidate for the horcrux hidden in the castle before he could formulate a new question however cho spoke again 
 
 if youd like to see what the diadems supposed to look like i could take you up to our common room and show you harry ravenclaws wearing it in her statue 
 
 harrys scar scorched again for a moment the room of requirement swam before him and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders voldemort was flying again whether to the underground lake or here to the castle he did not know either way there was hardly any time left 
 
 hes on the move he said quietly to ron and hermione he glanced at cho and then back at them listen i know its not much of a lead but im going to go look at this statue at least find out what the diadem looks like wait for me here and keep you know c the other one c safe 
 
 cho had got to her feet but ginny said rather fiercely no luna will take harry wont you luna 
 
 oooh yes id like to said luna happily as cho sat down again looking disappointed 
 
 how do we get out harry asked neville 
 
 over here 
 
 he led harry and luna to a corner where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase it comes out somewhere different every day so theyve never been able to find it he said only trouble is we never know exactly where were going to end up when we go out be careful harry theyre always patrolling the corridors at night 
 
 no problem said harry see you in a bit 
 
 he and luna hurried up the staircase which was long lit by torches and turned corners in unexpected places at last they reached what appeared to be solid wall 
 
 get under here harry told luna pulling out the invisibility cloak and throwing it over both of them he gave the wall a little push 
 
 it melted away at his touch and they slipped outside harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once they were standing in a dark corridor harry pulled luna back into the shadows fumbled in the pouch around his neck and took out the marauders map holding it close to his nose he searched and located his and lunas dots at last 
 
 were up on the fifth floor he whispered watching filch moving away from them a corridor ahead come on this way 
 
 they crept off 
 
 harry had prowled the castle at night many times before but never had his heart hammered that fast never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place through squares of moonlight upon the floor past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps around corners beyond which who knew what lurked harry and luna walked checking the marauders map whenever light permitted twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves he expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment his worst fear was peeves and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first telltale signs of the poltergeists approach 
 
 the way harry breathed luna plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral staircase 
 
 they climbed in tight dizzying circles harry had never been up here before at last they reached a door there was no handle and no keyhole nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood and a bronze knocker in the shape an eagle 
 
 luna reached out a pale hand which looked eerie floating in midair unconnected to arm or body she knocked once and in the silence it sounded to harry like a cannon blast at once the beak of the eagle opened but instead of a birds called a soft musical voice said which came first the phoenix or the flame 
 
 hmm what do you think harry said luna looking thoughtful 
 
 what isnt there a password 
 
 oh no youve got to answer a question said luna 
 
 what if you get it wrong 
 
 well you have to wait for somebody who gets it right said luna that way you learn you see 
 
 yeah trouble is we cant really afford to wait for anyone else luna 
 
 no i see what you mean said luna seriously well then i think the answer is that a circle has no beginning 
 
 well reasoned said the voice and the door swung open 
 
 the deserted ravenclaw common room was a wide circular room airier than any harry had ever seen at hogwarts graceful arched windows punctuated the walls which were hung with silks by day the ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains the ceiling was domed and painted with stars which were echoed in the carpet there were tables chairs and bookcases and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble 
 
 harry recognized rowena ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at lunas house the statue stood beside a door that led he guessed to dormitories above he strode right up to the marble woman and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face beautiful yet slightly intimidating a circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head it was not unlike the tiara fleur had worn at her wedding there were tiny words etched into it harry stepped out from under the cloak and climbed up onto ravenclaws plinth to read them 
 
 wit beyond measure is mans greatest treasure 
 
 which makes you pretty skint witless said a cackling voice 
 
 harry whirled around slipped off the plinth and landed on the floor the figure of alecto carrow was standing before him and even as harry raised his wand she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm 
 
 rowling

 fairy tales of hans christian andersen 
 something 
 by hans christian andersen 
 
 i mean to be somebody and do something useful in the world 
 said the eldest of five brothers i care how humble my position 
 is so that i can only do some good which will be something i intend 
 to be a brickmaker bricks are always wanted and i shall be really 
 doing something 
 
 your something is not enough for me said the second 
 brother what you talk of doing is nothing at all it is 
 work or might even be done by a machine no i should prefer to be 
 a builder at once there is something real in that a man gains a 
 position he becomes a citizen has his own sign his own house of 
 call for his workmen so i shall be a builder if all goes well in 
 time i shall become a master and have my own journeymen and my 
 wife will be treated as a wife this is what i call 
 something 
 
 i call it all nothing said the third not in reality any 
 position there are many in a town far above a master builder in 
 position you may be an upright man but even as a master you will 
 only be ranked among common men i know better what to do than that i will be an architect which will place me among those who possess riches and intellect and who speculate in art i shall certainly have to rise by my own endeavors from a laborer or as a 
 apprentice a lad wearing a paper cap although i now wear a silk hat i shall have to fetch beer and spirits for the journeymen and they will call me thou which will be an insult i shall 
 endure it however for i shall look upon it all as a mere representation a masquerade a mummery which that is 
 when i myself as a journeyman shall have served my time will vanish and i shall go my way and all that has passed will be nothing to me then i shall enter the academy and get instructed in drawing and be called an architect i may even attain to rank and have 
 something placed before or after my name and i shall build as 
 others have done before me by this there will be always something 
 to make me remembered and is not that worth living for 
 
 not in my opinion said the fourth i will never follow the 
 lead of others and only imitate what they have done i will be a 
 genius and become greater than all of you together i will create a 
 new style of building and introduce a plan for erecting houses 
 suitable to the climate with material easily obtained in the country 
 and thus suit national feeling and the developments of the age 
 besides building a storey for my own genius 
 
 but supposing the climate and the material are not good for 
 much said the fifth brother that would be very unfortunate for 
 you and have an influence over your experiments nationality may 
 assert itself until it becomes affectation and the developments of 
 a century may run wild as youth often does i see clearly that none 
 of you will ever really be anything worth notice however you may 
 now fancy it but do as you like i shall not imitate you i mean to 
 keep clear of all these things and criticize what you do in every 
 action something imperfect may be discovered something not right 
 which i shall make it my business to find out and expose that will be 
 something i fancy and he kept his word and became a critic 
 
 people said of this fifth brother there is something very precise about him he has a good but he does nothing and 
 on that very account they thought he must be something 
 
 now you see this is a little history which will never end as 
 long as the world exists there will always be men like these five 
 brothers and what became of them were they each nothing or 
 something you shall hear it is quite a history 
 
 the eldest brother he who fabricated bricks soon discovered that 
 each brick when finished brought him in a small coin if only a 
 copper one and many copper pieces if placed one upon another can be changed into a shining shilling and at whatever door a person knocks who has a number of these in his hands whether it be the the or the the door flies open and he can get all he wants so you see the value of bricks some of the bricks however crumbled to pieces or were broken but the elder brother found a use for even these 
 
 on the high bank of earth which formed a dyke on the a 
 poor woman named margaret wished to build herself a house so all 
 the imperfect bricks were given to her and a few whole ones with 
 them for the eldest brother was a man although he never achieved anything higher than making bricks the poor woman built herself a little house it was small and narrow and the window was quite crooked the door too low and the straw roof might have been better thatched but still it was a shelter and from within you could look far over the sea which dashed wildly against the on which the little house was built the salt waves sprinkled their white foam over it but it stood firm and remained long after he who had given the bricks to build it was dead and buried 
 
 the second brother of course knew better how to build than poor 
 margaret for he served an apprenticeship to learn it when his time 
 was up he packed up his knapsack and went on his travels singing 
 the song 
 while young i can wander without a care 
 and build new houses everywhere 
 fair and bright are my dreams of home 
 always thought of wherever i roam 
 hurrah for a life of glee 
 a loved one at home who thinks of me 
 home and friends i can forget 
 and i mean to be a master yet 
 and that is what he did on his return home he became a master 
 builder built one house after another in the town till they 
 formed quite a street which when finished became really an ornament to the town these houses built a house for him in return which was to be his own but how can houses build a house if the houses were asked they could not answer but the people would understand and say certainly the street built his house for him it was not very large and the floor was of lime but when he danced with his bride on the floor it was to him white and shining and from every stone in the wall flowers seemed to spring forth and decorate the room as with the richest tapestry it was really a pretty house and in it were a happy pair the flag of the corporation fluttered before it and the journeymen and apprentices shouted hurrah he had gained his position he had made himself something and at last he died which was something too 
 
 now we come to the architect the third brother who had been 
 first a apprentice had worn a cap and served as an 
 errand boy but afterwards went to the academy and risen to be an 
 architect a high and noble gentleman ah yes the houses of the new 
 street which the brother who was a master builder erected may have 
 built his house for him but the street received its name from the 
 architect and the handsomest house in the street became his property 
 
 that was something and he was something for he had a list of 
 titles before and after his name his children were called wellborn 
 and when he died his widow was treated as a lady of position and 
 that was something his name remained always written at the corner 
 of the street and lived in every mouth as its name yes this 
 also was something 
 
 and what about the genius of the family the fourth brother who 
 wanted to invent something new and original he tried to build a lofty 
 storey himself but it fell to pieces and he fell with it and broke 
 his neck however he had a splendid funeral with the city flags 
 and music in the procession flowers were strewn on the pavement 
 and three orations were spoken over his grave each one longer than 
 the other he would have liked this very much during his life as well 
 as the poems about him in the papers for he liked nothing so well 
 as to be talked of a monument was also erected over his grave it was only another storey over him but that was something now he was dead like the three other brothers 
 
 the youngest the critic outlived them all which was quite right 
 for him it gave him the opportunity of having the last word which to 
 him was of great importance people always said he had a good 
 at last his hour came and he died and arrived at the 
 gates of heaven souls always enter these gates in pairs so he 
 found himself standing and waiting for admission with another and who should it be but old dame margaret from the house on the dyke 
 it is evidently for the sake of contrast that i and this wretched soul 
 should arrive here exactly at the same time said the critic pray 
 who are you my good woman said he do you want to get in here 
 too 
 
 and the old woman curtsied as well as she could she thought it 
 must be st peter himself who spoke to her i am a poor old woman 
 
 she said without my family i am old margaret that lived in the 
 house on the dyke 
 
 well and what have you done what great deed have you 
 performed down below 
 
 i have done nothing at all in the world that could give me a 
 claim to have these doors open for me she said it would be only 
 through mercy that i can be allowed to slip in through the gate 
 
 in what manner did you leave the world he asked just for the 
 sake of saying something for it made him feel very weary to stand 
 there and wait 
 
 how i left the world she replied why i can scarcely tell 
 you during the last years of my life i was sick and miserable and 
 i was unable to bear creeping out of bed suddenly into the frost and 
 cold last winter was a hard winter but i have got over it all now 
 there were a few mild days as your honor no doubt knows the ice lay thickly on the lake as far one could see the people came from the town and walked upon it and they say there were dancing and skating upon it i believe and a great feasting the sound of 
 beautiful music came into my poor little room where i lay towards 
 evening when the moon rose beautifully though not yet in her full 
 splendor i glanced from my bed over the wide sea and there just 
 where the sea and sky met rose a curious white cloud i lay looking 
 at the cloud till i observed a little black spot in the middle of 
 it which gradually grew larger and larger and then i knew what it 
 meant i am old and experienced and although this token is not 
 often seen i knew it and a shuddering seized me twice in my life 
 had i seen this same thing and i knew that there would be an awful 
 storm with a spring tide which would overwhelm the poor people who were now out on the ice drinking dancing and making merry 
 young and old the whole city were there who was to warn them if no one noticed the sign or knew what it meant as i did i was so alarmed that i felt more strength and life than i had done for some time i got out of bed and reached the window i could not crawl any 
 farther from weakness and exhaustion but i managed to open the 
 window i saw the people outside running and jumping about on the ice i saw the beautiful flags waving in the wind i heard the boys 
 shouting hurrah and the lads and lasses singing and everything 
 full of merriment and joy but there was the white cloud with the 
 black spot hanging over them i cried out as loudly as i could but no 
 one heard me i was too far off from the people soon would the 
 storm burst the ice break and all who were on it be irretrievably 
 lost they could not hear me and to go to them was quite out of my 
 power oh if i could only get them safe on land then came the 
 thought as if from heaven that i would rather set fire to my bed 
 and let the house be burnt down than that so many people should 
 perish miserably i got a light and in a few moments the red flames 
 leaped up as a beacon to them i escaped fortunately as far as the 
 threshold of the door but there i fell down and remained i could 
 go no farther the flames rushed out towards me flickered on the 
 window and rose high above the roof the people on the ice became 
 aware of the fire and ran as fast as possible to help a poor sick 
 woman who as they thought was being burnt to death there was not one who did not run i heard them coming and i also at the same 
 time was conscious of a rush of air and a sound like the roar of heavy 
 artillery the spring flood was lifting the ice covering which 
 brake into a thousand pieces but the people had reached the where the sparks were flying round i had saved them all but i 
 suppose i could not survive the cold and fright so i came up here 
 to the gates of paradise i am told they are open to poor creatures 
 such as i am and i have now no house left on earth but i do not 
 think that will give me a claim to be admitted here 
 
 then the gates were opened and an angel led the old woman in she 
 had dropped one little straw out of her straw bed when she set it 
 on fire to save the lives of so many it had been changed into the 
 purest gold into gold that constantly grew and expanded into 
 flowers and fruit of immortal beauty 
 
 see said the angel pointing to the wonderful straw this is 
 what the poor woman has brought what dost thou bring i know thou hast accomplished nothing not even made a single brick even if 
 thou couldst return and at least produce so much very likely when 
 made the brick would be useless unless done with a good will 
 which is always something but thou canst not return to earth and i 
 can do nothing for thee 
 
 then the poor soul the old mother who had lived in the house on 
 the dyke pleaded for him she said his brother made all the stone 
 and bricks and sent them to me to build my poor little dwelling 
 which was a great deal to do for a poor woman like me could not all 
 these bricks and pieces be as a wall of stone to prevail for him it 
 is an act of mercy he is wanting it now and here is the very 
 fountain of mercy 
 
 then said the angel thy brother he who has been looked 
 upon as the meanest of you all he whose honest deeds to thee appeared so humble it is he who has sent you this heavenly gift 
 thou shalt not be turned away thou shalt have permission to stand without the gate and reflect and repent of thy life on earth but thou shalt not be admitted here until thou hast performed one good deed of repentance which will indeed for thee be something 
 
 i could have expressed that better thought the critic but he 
 did not say it aloud which for him was something after all

 richard m nixon 
 delivered september 
 my fellow americans 
 i come before you tonight as a candidate for the vice presidency and as a man whose honesty and integrity has been questioned 
 now the usual political thing to do when charges are made against you is to either ignore them or to deny them without giving details i believe had enough of that in the united states particularly with the present administration in washington to me the office of the vice presidency of the united states is a great office and i feel that the people have got to have confidence in the integrity of the men who run for that office and who might obtain it 
 i have a theory too that the best and only answer to a smear or to an honest misunderstanding of the facts is to tell the truth and why i am here tonight i want to tell you my side of the case sure that you have read the charge and heard it that i senator nixon took from a group of my supporters 
 now was that wrong and let me say that it was wrong i am saying it incidentally that it was wrong just not illegal because it a question of whether it was legal or illegal that enough the question is was it morally wrong i say that it was morally wrong if any of that went to senator nixon for my personal use i say that it was morally wrong if it was secretly given and secretly handled and i say that it was morally wrong if any of the contributors got special favors for the contributions that they made 
 and now to answer those questions let me say this not one cent of the or any other money of that type ever went to me for my personal use every penny of it was used to pay for political expenses that i did not think should be charged to the taxpayers of the united states it was not a secret fund as a matter of fact when i was on meet the press some of you may have seen it last sunday peter edson came up to me after the program and he said dick what about is fund we hear about and i said well there is no secret about it go out and see dana smith who was the administrator of the fund and i gave him edson his address and i said you will find that the purpose of the fund simply was to defray political expenses that i did not feel should be charged to the government and third let me point out and i want to make this particularly clear that no contributor to this fund no contributor to any of my campaigns has ever received any consideration that he would not have received as an ordinary constituent 
 i just believe in that and i can say that never while i have been in the senate of the united states as far as the people that contributed to this fund are concerned have i made a telephone call for them to an agency or have i gone down to an agency on their behalf and the records will show that the records which are in the hands of the administration 
 well then some of you will say and rightly well what did you use the fund for senator why did you have to have it let me tell you in just a word how a senate office operates first of all a senator gets a year in salary he gets enough money to pay for one trip a year a round trip that is for himself and his family between his home and washington and then he gets an allowance to handle the people that work in his office to handle his mail and the allowance for my state of california is enough to hire people and let me say incidentally that that allowance is not paid to the senator it is paid directly to the individuals that the senator puts on his pay roll but all of these people and all of these allowances are for strictly official business business for example when a constituent writes in and wants you to go down to the administration and get some information about his gi policy items of that type for example but there are other expenses that are not covered by the government and i think i can best discuss those expenses by asking you some questions 
 do you think that when i or any other senator makes a political speech has it printed should charge the printing of that speech and the mailing of that speech to the taxpayers do you think for example when i or any other senator makes a trip to his home state to make a purely political speech that the cost of that trip should be charged to the taxpayers do you think when a senator makes political broadcasts or political television broadcasts radio or television that the expense of those broadcasts should be charged to the taxpayers well i know what your answer is the same answer that audiences give me whenever i discuss this particular problem the answer is no the taxpayers be required to finance items which are not official business but which are primarily political business 
 well then the question arises you say well how do you pay for these and how can you do it legally and there are several ways that it can be done incidentally and it is done legally in the united states senate and in the congress the first way is to be a rich man i happen to be a rich man so i use that one another way that is used is to put your wife on the pay roll let me say incidentally that my opponent my opposite number for the vice presidency on the democratic ticket does have his wife on the pay roll and has had her on his pay roll for the past ten years now let me just say this that his business and not critical of him for doing that you will have to pass judgment on that particular point 
 but i have never done that for this reason i have found that there are so many deserving stenographers and secretaries in washington that needed the work that i just feel it was right to put my wife on the pay roll my sitting over here she is a wonderful stenographer she used to teach stenography and she used to teach shorthand in high school that was when i met her and i can tell you folks that worked many hours at night and many hours on saturdays and sundays in my office and done a fine job and i am proud to say tonight that in the six years i have been in the house and the senate of the united states pat nixon has never been on the government pay roll 
 what are other ways that these finances can be taken care of some who are lawyers and i happen to be a lawyer continue to practice law but i been able to do that i am so far away from california that i have been so busy with my senatorial work that i have not engaged in any legal practice and also as far as law practice is concerned it seemed to me that the relationship between an attorney and the client was so personal that you possibly represent a man as an attorney and then have an unbiased view when he presented his case to you in the event that he had one before government 
 and so i felt that the best way to handle these necessary political expenses of getting my message to the american people and the speeches i made the speeches i had printed for the most part concerned this one message of exposing this administration the communism in it the corruption in it the only way that i could do that was to accept the aid which people in my home state of california who contributed to my campaign and who continued to make these contributions after i was elected were glad to make 
 and let me say i am proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me for a special favor i am proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me to vote on a bill other than my own conscience would dictate and i am proud of the fact that the taxpayers by subterfuge or otherwise have never paid one dime for expenses which i thought were political and be charged to the taxpayers 
 let me say incidentally that some of you may say well that is all right senator your explanation but have you got any proof and like to tell you this evening that just an hour ago we received an independent audit of this entire fund i suggested to governor sherman adams who is the chief of staff of the dwight eisenhower campaign that an independent audit and legal report be obtained and i have that audit in my hands an audit made by the price waterhouse co firm and the legal opinion by gibson dunn crutcher lawyers in los angeles the biggest law firm and incidentally one of the best ones in los angeles 
 i am proud to be able to report to you tonight that this audit and this legal opinion is being forwarded to general eisenhower and like to read to you the opinion that was prepared by gibson dunn crutcher and based on all the pertinent laws and statutes together with the audit report prepared by the certified public accountants 
 it is our conclusion that senator nixon did not obtain any financial gain from the collection and disbursement of the fund by dana smith that senator nixon did not violate any federal or state law by reason of the operation of the fund and that neither the portion of the fund paid by dana smith directly to third persons nor the portion paid to senator nixon to reimburse him for designated office expenses constituted income to the senator which was either reportable or taxable as income under applicable tax laws

 now that my friends is not nixon speaking but an independent audit which was requested because i want the american people to know all the facts and i am not afraid of having independent people go in and check the facts and that is exactly what they did but then i realized that there are still some who may say and rightly so and let me say that i recognize that some will continue to smear regardless of what the truth may be but that there has been understandably some honest misunderstanding on this matter and there are some that will say well maybe you were able senator to fake the thing how can we believe what you say after all is there a possibility that maybe you got some sums in cash is there a possibility that you might have feathered your own nest and so now that i am going to do and incidentally this is unprecedented in the history of american politics i am going at this time to give to this television and radio audience a complete financial history everything earned everything spent everything i own and i want you to know the facts 
 have to start early i was born in our family was one of modest circumstances and most of my early life was spent in a store out in east whittier it was a grocery store one of those family enterprises the only reason we were able to make it go was because my mother and dad had five boys and we all worked in the store i worked my way through college and to a great extent through law school and then in probably the best thing that ever happened to me happened i married pat who is sitting over here we had a rather difficult time after we were married like so many of the young couples who may be listening to us i practiced law she continued to teach school 
 then in i went into the service let me say that my service record was not a particularly unusual one i went to the south pacific i guess entitled to a couple of battle stars i got a couple of letters of commendation but i was just there when the bombs were falling and then i returned returned to the united states and in i ran for the congress when we came out of the war pat and i pat during the war had worked as a stenographer and in a bank and as an economist for a government agency and when we came out the total of our savings from both my law practice her teaching and all the time i was in the war the total for that entire period was just a little less than every cent of that incidentally was in government bonds well where we start when i go into politics 
 now what have i earned since i went into politics well here it is jotted it down let me read the notes first of all i have had my salary as a congressman and as a senator second i have received a total in this past six years of from estates which were in my law firm at the time that i severed my connection with it and incidentally as i said before i have not engaged in any legal practice and have not accepted any fees from business that came into the firm after i went into politics i have made an average of approximately a year from nonpolitical speaking engagements and lectures 
 and then fortunately we have inherited little money pat sold her interest in her estate for and i inherited from my grandfather we lived rather modestly for four years we lived in an apartment in parkfairfax in alexandria virginia the rent was a month and we saved for the time that we could buy a house now that was what we took in what did we do with this money what do we have today to show for it this will surprise you because it is so little i suppose as standards generally go of people in public life 
 first of all got a house in washington which cost and on which we owe we have a house in whittier california which cost and on which we owe my folks are living there at the present time i have just in life insurance plus my gi policy which never been able to convert and which will run out in two years i have no life insurance whatever on pat i have no life insurance on our two youngsters tricia and julie i own a oldsmobile car we have our furniture we have no stocks and bonds of any type we have no interest of any kind direct or indirect in any business now what we have what do we owe 
 well in addition to the mortgage the mortgage on the house in washington the one on the house in whittier i owe to the riggs bank in washington with interest and percent i owe to my parents and the interest on that loan which i pay regularly because a part of the savings they made through the years they were working so hard i pay regularly percent interest and then i have a loan which i have on my life insurance 
 well about it what we have and what we owe it very much but pat and i have the satisfaction that every dime that got is honestly ours i should say this that pat have a mink coat but she does have a respectable republican cloth coat and i always tell her look good in anything 
 one other thing i probably should tell you because if i probably be saying this about me too we did get something a gift after the election a man down in texas heard pat on the radio mention the fact that our two youngsters would like to have a dog and believe it or not the day before we left on this campaign trip we got a message from union station in baltimore saying they had a package for us we went down to get it you know what it was it was a little cocker spaniel dog in a crate that he had sent all the way from texas black and white spotted and our little girl tricia the six year old named it checkers and you know the kids like all kids love the dog and i just want to say this right now that regardless of what they say about it gonna keep it 
 it easy to come before a nationwide audience and bare your life as done but i want to say some things before i conclude that i think most of you will agree on mr mitchell the chairman of the democratic national committee made this statement that if a man afford to be in the united states senate he run for the senate and i just want to make my position clear i agree with mr mitchell when he says that only a rich man should serve his government in the united states senate or in the congress i believe that represents the thinking of the democratic party and i know that it represent the thinking of the republican party 
 i believe that fine that a man like governor stevenson who inherited a fortune from his father can run for president but i also feel that essential in this country of ours that a man of modest means can also run for president because you know remember abraham lincoln you remember what he said god must have loved the common people he made so many of them 
 and now going to suggest some courses of conduct first of all you have read in the papers about other funds now mr stevenson apparently had a couple one of them in which a group of business people paid and helped to supplement the salaries of state employees here is where the money went directly into their pockets and i think that what mr stevenson should do should be to come before the american people as i have give the names of the people that contributed to that fund give the names of the people who put this money into their pockets at the same time that they were receiving money from their state government and see what favors if any they gave out for that 
 i condemn mr stevenson for what he did but until the facts are in there is a doubt that will be raised and as far as mr sparkman is concerned i would suggest the same thing had his wife on the pay roll i condemn him for that but i think that he should come before the american people and indicate what outside sources of income he has had i would suggest that under the circumstances both mr sparkman and mr stevenson should come before the american people as i have and make a complete financial statement as to their financial history and if they it will be an admission that they have something to hide and i think you will agree with me because folks remember a man to be president of the united states a man to be vice president of the united states must have the confidence of all the people and why doing what doing and why i suggest that mr stevenson and mr sparkman since they are under attack should do what doing 
 now let me say this i know that this is not the last of the smears in spite of my explanation tonight other smears will be made others have been made in the past and the purpose of the smears i know is this to silence me to make me let up well they just know who dealing with going to tell you this i remember in the dark days of the hiss case some of the same columnists some of the same radio commentators who are attacking me now and misrepresenting my position were violently opposing me at the time i was after alger hiss but i continued to fight because i knew i was right and i can say to this great television and radio audience that i have no apologies to the american people for my part in putting alger hiss where he is today and as far as this is concerned i intend to continue to fight 
 why do i feel so deeply why do i feel that in spite of the smears the misunderstanding the necessity for a man to come up here and bare his soul as i have why is it necessary for me to continue this fight and i want to tell you why because you see i love my country and i think my country is in danger and i think the only man that can save america at this time is the man running for president on my ticket dwight eisenhower you say why do i think it is in danger and i say look at the record seven years of the administration and happened six hundred million people lost to communists and a war in korea in which we have lost american casualties and i say to all of you that a policy that results in the loss of million people to the communists and a war that cost us american casualties good enough for america and i say that those in the state department that made the mistakes which caused that war and which resulted in those losses should be kicked out of the state department just as fast as we get them out of there 
 and let me say that i know mr stevenson do that because he defends the truman policy and i know that dwight eisenhower will do that and that he will give america the leadership that it needs take the problem of corruption read about the mess in washington mr stevenson clean it up because he was picked by the man truman under whose administration the mess was made 
 you trust the man who made the mess to clean it up truman and by the same token you trust the man who was picked by the man who made the mess to clean it up and stevenson and so i say eisenhower who owes nothing to truman nothing to the big city bosses he is the man that can clean up the mess in washington take communism i say that as far as that subject is concerned the danger is great to america in the hiss case they got the secrets which enabled them to break the american secret state department code they got secrets in the atomic bomb case which enabled them to get the secret of the atomic bomb five years before they would have gotten it by their own devices and i say that any man who called the alger hiss case a red herring fit to be president of the united states 
 i say that a man who like mr stevenson has and ridiculed the communist threat in the united states he said that they are phantoms among ourselves he has accused us that have attempted to expose the communists of looking for communists in the bureau of fisheries and wildlife i say that a man who says that qualified to be president of the united states and i say that the only man who can lead us in this fight to rid the government of both those who are communists and those who have corrupted this government is eisenhower because eisenhower you can be sure recognizes the problem and he knows how to deal with it 
 now let me that finally this evening i want to read to you just briefly excerpts from a letter which i received a letter which after all this is over no one can take away from us it reads as follows 
 dear senator nixon 
 since i am only years of age i vote in this presidential election but believe me if i could you and general eisenhower would certainly get my vote my husband is in the fleet marines in korea he a corpsman on the front lines and we have a two month old son never seen and i feel confident that with great americans like you and general eisenhower in the white house lonely americans like myself will be united with their loved ones now in korea i only pray to god that you be too late enclosed is a small check to help you in your campaign living on a month it is all i can afford at present but let me know what else i can do 
 folks a check for and one that i will never cash and just let me say this we hear a lot about prosperity these days but i say why we have prosperity built on peace rather than prosperity built on war why we have prosperity and an honest government in washington at the same time believe me we can and eisenhower is the man that can lead this crusade to bring us that kind of prosperity 
 and now finally i know that you wonder whether or not i am going to stay on the republican ticket or resign let me say this i believe that i ought to quit because not a quitter and incidentally not a quitter after all her name was patricia ryan and she was born on st day and you know the irish never quit but the decision my friends is not mine i would do nothing that would harm the possibilities of dwight eisenhower to become president of the united states and for that reason i am submitting to the republican national committee tonight through this television broadcast the decision which it is theirs to make let them decide whether my position on the ticket will help or hurt and i am going to ask you to help them decide wire and write the republican national committee whether you think i should stay on or whether i should get off and whatever their decision is i will abide by it 
 but just let me say this last word regardless of what happens going to continue this fight going to campaign up and down in america until we drive the crooks and the communists and those that defend them out of washington and remember folks eisenhower is a great man believe me a great man and a vote for eisenhower is a vote for good for america

 sergei ivanovich koznishev wanted a rest from mental work and instead of going abroad as he usually did he came toward the end of may to stay in the country with his brother in his judgment the best sort of life was a country life he had come now to enjoy such a life at his konstantin levin was very glad to have him especially as he did not expect his brother nikolai that summer but in spite of his affection and respect for sergei ivanovich konstantin levin was uncomfortable with his brother in the country it made him uncomfortable and it even annoyed him to see his attitude to the country to konstantin levin the country was the background of life that is of pleasures endeavors labor to sergei ivanovich the country meant on one hand rest from work on the other a valuable antidote to laxness an antidote which he took with satisfaction and a sense of its salutariness to konstantin levin the country was good because it afforded a field for labor of the usefulness of which there could be no doubt to sergei ivanovich the country was particularly good because there it was possible and fitting to do nothing moreover sergei attitude toward the people rather piqued konstantin sergei ivanovich used to say that he knew and liked the people and he often talked to the peasants which he knew how to do without affectation or condescension and from every such conversation he would deduce general conclusions in favor of the people and in confirmation of his knowing them konstantin levin did not like such an attitude toward the people to konstantin the people was simply the chief partner in the common labor and in spite of all the respect and the love almost like that of kinship he had for the peasant sucked in probably as he said himself with the milk of his peasant nurse konstantin as a fellow worker with them while sometimes enthusiastic over the vigor gentleness and justice of these men was very often when their common labors called for other qualities exasperated with the peasant for his carelessness slovenliness drunkenness and lying if he had been asked whether he liked or like the people konstantin levin would have been absolutely at a loss what to reply he liked and did not like the people just as he liked and did not like men in general of course being a goodhearted man he liked men more than he disliked them and so too with the people but like or dislike the people as something peculiar he could not not only because he lived with the people and all his interests were bound up with theirs but also because he regarded himself as a part of the people did not see any peculiar qualities or failings distinguishing himself from the people and could not contrast himself with them moreover although he had lived so long in the closest relations with the peasants as farmer and arbitrator and what was more as adviser the peasants trusted him and for forty verstas round they would come to ask his advice he had no definite views of the people and would have been as much at a loss to answer the question whether he knew the people as the question whether he liked them for him to say he knew the people would have been the same as to say he knew men he was continually watching and getting to know people of all sorts and among them peasants whom he regarded as good and interesting people and he was continually observing new points in them altering his former views of them and forming new ones 
 with sergei ivanovich it was quite the contrary just as he liked and praised a country life in comparison with the life he did not like so too he liked the people in contradistinction to the class of men he did not like and so too he knew the people as something distinct from and opposed to men in general in his methodical brain there were distinctly formulated certain aspects of peasant life deduced partly from that life itself but chiefly from contrast with other modes of life he never changed his opinion of the people and his sympathetic attitude toward them 
 in the discussions that arose between the brothers on their views of the people sergei ivanovich always got the better of his brother precisely because sergei ivanovich had definite ideas about the peasant his character his qualities and his tastes konstantin levin had no definite and unalterable idea on the subject and so in their arguments konstantin was readily convicted of contradicting himself 
 in sergei eyes his younger brother was a capital fellow with his heart in the right place as he expressed it in french but with a mind which though fairly quick was too much influenced by the impressions of the moment and consequently filled with contradictions with all the condescension of an elder brother he sometimes explained to him the true import of things but he derived little satisfaction from arguing with him because he got the better of him too easily 
 konstantin levin regarded his brother as a man of immense intellect and culture as generous in the highest sense of the word and possessed of a special faculty for working for the public good but in the depths of his heart the older he became and the more intimately he knew his brother the more and more frequently the thought struck him that this faculty of working for the public good of which he felt himself utterly devoid was possibly not so much a quality as a lack of something not a lack of good honest noble desires and tastes but a lack of vital force of what is called heart of that impulse which drives a man to choose some one out of the innumerable paths of life and to care only for that one the better he knew his brother the more he noticed that sergei ivanovich and many other people who worked for the public welfare were not led by any impulse of the heart to care for the public good but reasoned from intellectual considerations that it was a right thing to take an interest in public affairs and consequently took an interest in them levin was confirmed in this conjecture by observing that his brother did not take questions affecting the public welfare or the question of the immortality of the soul a bit more to heart than he did chess problems or the ingenious construction of a new machine 
 besides this konstantin levin was not at his ease with his brother because in the country especially in summertime levin was continually busy with work on the land and the long summer day was not long enough for him to get through all he had to do while sergei ivanovich was merely taking a holiday but though he was taking a holiday now that is to say he was doing no writing he was so used to intellectual activity that he liked to put into concise and eloquent shape the ideas that occurred to him and liked to have someone listen to him his most usual and natural listener was his brother and so in spite of the friendliness and directness of their relations konstantin felt an awkwardness in leaving him alone sergei ivanovich liked to stretch himself on the grass in the sun and to lie so basking and chatting lazily 
 you believe he would say to his brother what a pleasure this rural laziness is to me not an idea in brain as empty as a drum 
 but konstantin levin found it dull sitting and listening to him especially when he knew that while he was away manure would be carted into fields not plowed ready for it and heaped up god knows how and the shares in the plows would not be screwed in so that they would come off and then his men would say the new plows were a silly invention and there was nothing like the old wooden plow and so on 
 come done enough trudging about in the heat sergei ivanovich would say to him 
 no i must just run round to the countinghouse for a minute levin would answer and would run off to the fields

 konstantin levin whose presence was needed in the plowland and the meadows had come to take his brother in the cabriolet 
 it was that time of the year the turning point of summer when the crops of the present year are a certainty when one begins to think of the sowing for next year and the mowing is at hand when the rye is all in ear though its ears are still light not yet full and it waves in billows in the wind when the green oats with tufts of yellow grass scattered here and there among it droop irregularly over the fields when the early buckwheat is already out and hiding the ground when the fallow lands trodden hard as stone by the cattle are over with paths left untouched by the plow when the odor from the dry manure heaps carted into the fields mingles at sunset with the smell of meadowsweet and on the lands the preserved meadows are a thick sea of grass waiting for the mowing with blackened heaps of sorrel stalks among it 
 it was the time when there comes a brief pause in the toil of the fields before the beginning of the labors of harvest every year recurring every year claiming all the thews the crop was a splendid one and bright hot summer days had set in with short dewy nights 
 the brothers had to drive through the woods to reach the meadows sergei ivanovich was all the while admiring the beauty of the woods which were a tangled mass of leaves pointing out to his brother now an old lime tree on the point of flowering dark on the shady side and brightly spotted with yellow stipules now the young shoots of this saplings brilliant with emerald konstantin levin did not like talking and hearing about the beauty of nature words for him took away the beauty of what he saw he assented to what his brother said but could not help thinking of other things when they came out of the woods all his attention was engrossed by the view of the fallow land on the upland in parts yellow with grass in parts trampled and checkered with furrows in parts dotted with ridges of manure and in parts even plowed a string of telegas was moving across it levin counted the telegas and was pleased that all that were wanted had been brought and at the sight of the meadows his thoughts passed to the mowing he always felt something peculiar moving him to the quick at haymaking on reaching the meadow levin stopped the horse 
 the morning dew was still lying on the thick undergrowth of the grass and that he might not get his feet wet sergei ivanovich asked his brother to drive him in the cabriolet up to the willow tree from which the perch were caught sorry as konstantin levin was to crush down his mowing grass he drove him into the meadow the high grass softly turned about the wheels and the legs leaving its seeds clinging to the wet axles and spokes of the wheels 
 his brother seated himself under a bush arranging his tackle while levin led the horse away tied him up and walked into the vast sea of grass unstirred by the wind the silky grass with its ripe seeds came almost to his waist in the riverside spots 
 crossing the meadow konstantin levin came out on the road and met an old man with a swollen eye carrying a swarming basket with bees 
 what taken a stray swarm fomich he asked 
 no indeed konstantin mitrich all we can do to keep our own this is the second new swarm that has flown away luckily the lads caught them they were plowing your field they unyoked the horses and galloped after them 
 well what do you say fomich start mowing or wait a bit 
 well now our to wait till st day but you always mow sooner well to be sure please god the good be plenty for the beasts 
 what do you think about the weather 
 in hands maybe even the weather will favor us 
 levin walked up to his brother 
 sergei ivanovich had caught nothing but he was not bored and seemed in the most cheerful frame of mind levin saw that stimulated by his conversation with the doctor he wanted to talk levin on the other hand would have liked to get home as soon as possible to give orders about getting together the mowers for next day and to set at rest his doubts about the mowing which greatly absorbed him 
 well be going he said 
 why be in such a hurry stay a little but how wet you are even though one catches nothing fine the best thing about every part of sport that one has to do with nature how exquisite this steely water is said sergei ivanovich these riverside banks always remind me of the riddle do you know it the grass says to the river we quiver and we quiver 
 i know the riddle answered levin cheerlessly

 no indeed konstantin mitrich all we can do to keep our own this is the second new swarm that has flown away luckily the lads caught them they were plowing your field they unyoked the horses and galloped after them 
 well what do you say fomich start mowing or wait a bit 
 well now our to wait till st day but you always mow sooner well to be sure please god the good be plenty for the beasts 
 what do you think about the weather 
 in hands maybe even the weather will favor us 
 levin walked up to his brother 
 sergei ivanovich had caught nothing but he was not bored and seemed in the most cheerful frame of mind levin saw that stimulated by his conversation with the doctor he wanted to talk levin on the other hand would have liked to get home as soon as possible to give orders about getting together the mowers for next day and to set at rest his doubts about the mowing which greatly absorbed him 
 well be going he said 
 why be in such a hurry stay a little but how wet you are even though one catches nothing fine the best thing about every part of sport that one has to do with nature how exquisite this steely water is said sergei ivanovich these riverside banks always remind me of the riddle do you know it the grass says to the river we quiver and we quiver 
 i know the riddle answered levin cheerlessly

 do you know been thinking about you said sergei ivanovich beyond everything being done in the district according to what this doctor tells me a very intelligent fellow and as told you before i tell you again not right for you not to go to the meetings and to keep out of the zemstvo affairs entirely if decent people go into it of course bound to go all wrong we pay the money and it all goes in salaries and there are no schools nor district dressers nor midwives nor pharmacies nothing 
 well i did try you know levin said gently and unwillingly i and so no help for it 
 but why you i must own i make it out indifference incapacity i admit surely not simply laziness 
 none of those things tried and i see i can do nothing said levin 
 he had hardly grasped what his brother was saying looking toward the plowland across the river he made out something black but he could not distinguish whether it was a horse or the bailiff on horseback 
 why is it you can do nothing you made an attempt and succeed as you think and you give in how can you have so little ambition 
 ambition said levin stung to the quick by his words i understand if told me at college that other people understood the integral calculus and i then ambition would have come in but in this case one wants first to be convinced that one has certain abilities for this sort of business and especially that all this business is of great importance 
 what do you mean to say not of importance said sergei ivanovich stung to the quick in his turn by his considering of no importance anything that interested him and still more at his obviously paying little attention to what he was saying 
 i think it important it does not take hold of me i help it answered levin making out that what he saw was the bailiff and that the bailiff seemed to be letting the peasants go off the plowed land they were turning the plow over can they have finished plowing he wondered 
 come really though said the elder brother with a frown on his handsome clever face a limit to everything very well to be original and genuine and to dislike everything hypocritical i know all about that but really what saying either has no meaning or it has a very wrong meaning how can you think it a matter of no importance whether the people whom you love as you assert 
 i never did assert it thought konstantin levin 
 die without help the ignorant peasant women starve the children and the people stagnate in darkness and are helpless in the hands of every village clerk while you have at your disposal a means of helping them and help them because to your mind of no importance 
 and sergei ivanovich put before him the dilemma either you are so undeveloped that you see all that you can do or you sacrifice your ease your vanity or whatever it is to do it 
 konstantin levin felt that there was no course open to him but to submit or to confess to a lack of zeal for the public good and this mortified him and hurt his feelings 
 both he said resolutely i see that it is possible 
 what is it impossible if the money were properly laid out to provide medical aid 
 impossible as it seems to me for the four thousand square verstas of our district what with our undersnow waters and the storms and the work in the fields i see how it is possible to provide medical aid all over and besides i believe in medicine 
 oh well unfair i can quote to you thousands of instances but the schools at least 
 why have schools 
 what do you mean can there be two opinions of the advantage of education if a good thing for you a good thing for everyone 
 konstantin levin felt himself morally pinned against a wall and so he became heated and unconsciously blurted out the chief cause of his indifference to public business 
 perhaps it may all be very good but why should i worry myself about establishing dispensaries which i shall never make use of and schools to which i shall never send my children to which even the peasants want to send their children and to which no very firm faith that they ought to send them said he 
 sergei ivanovich was for a minute surprised at this unexpected view of the subject but he promptly made a new plan of attack 
 he was silent for a little drew out a hook threw it in again and turned to his brother smiling 
 come now in the first place the dispensary is needed we ourselves sent for the district doctor for agathya mikhailovna 
 oh well but i fancy her wrist will never be straight again 
 that remains to be proved next the peasant who can read and write is as a workman of more use and value to you 
 no you can ask anyone you like konstantin levin answered with decision the man that can read and write is much inferior as a workman and mending the highroads is an impossibility and as soon as they put up bridges stolen 
 still not the point said sergei ivanovich frowning he disliked contradiction and still more arguments that were continually skipping from one thing to another introducing new and disconnected points so that there was no knowing to which to reply let me say do you admit that education is a benefit for the people 
 yes i admit it said levin without thinking and he was conscious immediately that he had said what he did not think he felt that if he admitted that it would be proved that he had been talking meaningless rubbish how it would be proved he could not tell but he knew that this would inevitably be logically proved to him and he awaited the proofs 
 the argument turned out to be far simpler than konstantin levin had expected 
 if you admit that it is a benefit said sergei ivanovich then as an honest man you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with the movement and so wishing to work for it 
 but i still do not admit this movement to be good said konstantin levin reddening 
 what but you just said now 
 to say i admit being either good or possible 
 that you tell without making the trial 
 well supposing that is so said levin though he did not suppose so at all supposing that is so still i see all the same why i should worry myself about it 
 how so 
 no since we are talking explain it to me from the philosophical point of view said levin 
 i see where philosophy comes in said sergei ivanovich in a tone levin fancied as though he did not admit his right to talk about philosophy and that irritated levin 
 tell you then he said with heat i imagine the mainspring of all our actions is after all now in the zemstvo institutions i as a nobleman see nothing that could conduce to my prosperity the roads are not better and could not be better my horses carry me well enough over bad ones doctors and dispensaries are of no use to me a justice of the peace is of no use to me i never appeal to him and never shall appeal to him the schools are of no good to me but positively harmful as i told you for me the zemstvo institutions simply mean the liability of paying eighteen kopecks for every dessiatina of driving into the town sleeping with bedbugs and listening to all sorts of idiocy and blather and offers me no inducement 
 excuse me sergei ivanovich interposed with a smile did not induce us to work for the emancipation of the serfs yet we did work for it 
 no konstantin levin broke in with still greater heat the emancipation of the serfs was a different matter there did come in one longed to throw off that yoke that crushed us all the decent people among us but to be a member of the zemstvo and discuss how many street cleaners are needed and how sewers shall be constructed in the town in which i live to serve on a jury and try a peasant who has stolen a flitch of bacon and listen for six hours at a stretch to all sorts of jabber from the counsel for the defense and the prosecution and the president my old simpleton alioshka do you admit prisoner at the bar the fact of the removal of the bacon eh 
 konstantin levin had warmed to his subject and began mimicking the president and the alioshka it seemed to him that it was all to the point 
 but sergei ivanovich shrugged his shoulders 
 well what do you mean to say then 
 i simply mean to say that those rights that touch me my interest i shall always defend to the best of my ability that when raids were made on us students and the police read our letters i was ready to defend those rights to the utmost to defend my rights to education and freedom i can understand compulsory military service which affects my children my brothers and myself i am ready to deliberate on what concerns me but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of money or judging the alioshka that i understand and i do it 
 konstantin levin spoke as though the floodgates of his speech had burst open sergei ivanovich smiled 
 but tomorrow be your turn to be tried would it have suited your tastes better to be tried in the old criminal court 
 not going to be tried i murder anybody and no need of it well i tell you what he went on flying off again to a subject quite beside the point our district and all the rest of it just like the birch saplings we stick in the ground as we would do it on trinity day to look like a copse which has grown up of itself in europe and i gush over these birch saplings and believe in them 
 sergei ivanovich merely shrugged his shoulders as though to express his wonder how the birch saplings had come into their argument at that point though he did really understand at once what his brother meant 
 excuse me but you know one really argue in that way he observed 
 but konstantin levin wanted to justify himself for the failing of which he was conscious of a lack of zeal for the public welfare and he went on 
 i imagine konstantin said that no sort of activity is likely to be lasting if it is not founded on a universal principle a philosophical principle he said repeating the word philosophical with determination as though wishing to show that he had as much right as anyone else to talk of philosophy 
 sergei ivanovich smiled he too has a philosophy of his own at the service of his natural tendencies he thought 
 come better let philosophy alone he said the chief problem of the philosophy of all ages consists precisely in finding that indispensable connection which exists between individual and social interests but not to the point what is to the point is a correction i must make in your comparison the birches are not simply stuck in but some are sown and some are planted and one must deal carefully with them only those peoples that have an intuitive sense of of importance and significance in their institutions and know how to value them who have a future before them only those peoples that one can truly call historical 
 and sergei ivanovich carried the subject into the regions of philosophical history where konstantin levin could not follow him and showed him all the incorrectness of his outlook 
 as for your dislike of it excuse my saying so simply our russian sloth and old serfowners ways and convinced that in you a temporary error and will pass 
 konstantin was silent he felt himself vanquished on all sides but he felt at the same time that what he wanted to say was unintelligible to his brother only he could not make up his mind whether it was unintelligible because he was not capable of expressing his meaning clearly or because his brother would not or could not understand him but he did not pursue the speculation and without replying he fell to musing on a quite different and personal matter 
 sergei ivanovich wound up the last line unhitched the horse and they drove off

 chapter 
 
 the personal matter that absorbed levin during his conversation with his brother was this once the year previous he had gone to look at the mowing and being made very angry by the bailiff he had had recourse to his favorite means for regaining his temper he had taken a scythe from a peasant and begun mowing 
 he liked the work so much that he had several times tried his hand at mowing since he had cut the whole of the meadow in front of his house and this year ever since the early spring he had cherished a plan for mowing for whole days together with the peasants ever since his arrival he had been in doubt as to whether to mow or not he was loath to leave his brother alone all day long and he was afraid his brother would laugh at him about it but as he drove into the meadow and recalled the sensations of mowing he came near deciding that he would go mowing after the irritating discussion with his brother he pondered over this intention again 
 i must have physical exercise or my certainly be ruined he thought and he determined he would go mowing however awkward he might feel about it with his brother or the peasants 
 toward evening konstantin levin went to his countinghouse gave directions as to the work to be done and sent about the village to summon the mowers for the morrow to cut the hay in kalinov meadow the largest and best of his grasslands 
 and send my scythe please to tit for him to set it and bring it round tomorrow i may do some mowing myself too he said trying not to be embarrassed 
 the bailiff smiled and said 
 yes sir 
 at tea the same evening levin said to his brother too 
 i fancy the fine weather will last said he tomorrow i shall start mowing 
 so fond of that form of field labor said sergei ivanovich 
 awfully fond of it i sometimes mow myself with the peasants and tomorrow i want to try mowing the whole day 
 sergei ivanovich lifted his head and looked with curiosity at his brother 
 how do you mean just like one of the peasants all day long 
 yes very pleasant said levin 
 splendid as exercise only hardly be able to stand it said sergei ivanovich without a shade of irony 
 tried it hard work at first but you get into it i dare say i shall manage to keep it up 
 oh so it but tell me how do the peasants look at it i suppose they laugh in their sleeves at their being such a queer fish 
 no i think so but so delightful and at the same time such hard work that one has no time to think about it 
 but how will you do about dining with them to send you a bottle of lafitte and roast turkey out there would be a little awkward 
 no simply come home at the time of their noonday rest 
 next morning konstantin levin got up earlier than usual but he was detained giving directions on the farm and when he reached the mowing grass the mowers were already at their second swath 
 from the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below with the grayish swaths and the black heaps of coats taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had started cutting 
 gradually as he rode toward the meadow the peasants came into sight some in coats some in their shirts mowing one behind another in a long string each swinging his scythe in his own way he counted of them 
 they were mowing slowly over the uneven parts of the meadow where there had been an old dam levin recognized some of his own men here was old iermil in a very long white smock bending forward to swing a scythe there was a young fellow vaska who had been a coachman of taking every swath with a wide sweep here too was tit preceptor in the art of mowing a thin little peasant he went on ahead and cut his wide swath without bending as though playing with his scythe 
 levin got off his mare and fastening her up by the roadside went to meet tit who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it him 
 ready sir like a razor it cuts of itself said tit taking off his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe 
 levin took the scythe and began trying it as they finished their swaths the mowers hot and came out into the road one after another and smirking greeted the master they all stared at him but no one made any remark till a tall old man with a wrinkled beardless face wearing a short sheepskin jacket came out into the road and accosted him 
 now master once take hold of the rope no letting go he said and levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers 
 try not to let it go he said taking his stand behind tit and waiting for the time to begin 
 repeated the old man 
 tit made room and levin started behind him the grass was short close to the road and levin who had not done any mowing for a long while and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him cut badly for the first moments though he swung his scythe vigorously behind him he heard voices 
 not set right too high see how he has to stoop to it said one 
 press more on the heel of the scythe said another 
 never mind get on all right the old man resumed see made a start you swing it too wide tire yourself out the master sure does his best for himself but see the grass missed out for such work us fellows would catch it 
 the grass became lusher and levin listening without answering followed tit trying to do the best he could they moved a hundred paces tit kept moving on without stopping nor showing the slightest weariness but levin was already beginning to fear he would not be able to keep it up so tired was he 
 he felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his strength and was making up his mind to ask tit to stop but at that very moment tit stopped of his own accord and stooping down picked up some grass rubbed his scythe and began whetting it levin straightened himself and drawing a deep breath looked round behind him came a peasant and he too was evidently tired for he stopped at once without waiting to mow up to levin and began whetting his scythe tit sharpened his scythe and and they went on 
 the next time it was just the same tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his scythe without stopping or showing signs of weariness levin followed him trying not to get left behind and he found it harder and harder the moment came when he felt he had no strength left but at that very moment tit stopped and whetted the scythes 
 so they mowed the first row and this long row seemed particularly hard work to levin but when the end was reached and tit shouldering his scythe began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by his heels in the cut grass and levin walked back in the same way over the space he had cut in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over his face and fell in drops down his nose and drenched his back as though he had been soaked in water he felt very happy what delighted him particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out 
 his pleasure was only disturbed by his swath not being well cut i will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body he thought comparing swath which looked as if it had been cut along a cord with his own scattered and irregularly lying grass 
 the first swath as levin noticed tit had mowed especially quickly probably wishing to put his master to the test and the swath happened to be a long one the next swaths were easier but still levin had to strain every nerve not to drop behind the peasants 
 he thought of nothing wished for nothing save not to be left behind the peasants and to do his work as well as possible he heard nothing save the swish of scythes and saw before him upright figure mowing away the curve of the cut grass the grass and flowers slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his scythe and ahead of him the end of the swath where would come the rest 
 suddenly in the midst of his toil without understanding what it was or whence it came he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot moist shoulders he glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the scythes a heavy lowering storm cloud had blown up and big raindrops were falling some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on others just like levin himself merely shrugged their shoulders enjoying the pleasant coolness of it 
 another swath and yet another swath followed long swaths and short swaths with good grass and with poor grass levin lost all sense of time and could not have told whether it were late or early now a change began to come over his work which gave him immense satisfaction in the midst of his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was doing and it all came easy to him and at those same moments his swath was almost as smooth and well cut as but as soon as he recollected what he was doing and began trying to do better he was at once conscious of all the difficulty of his task and the swath was badly mown 
 on finishing yet another swath he would have gone back to the top of the meadow again to begin the next but tit stopped and going up to the old man said something in a low voice to him they both looked at the sun what are they talking about and why he go back thought levin without guessing that the peasants had been mowing no less than four hours without stopping and that it was time for their lunch 
 lunch sir said the old man 
 is it really time lunch it is then 
 levin gave his scythe to tit and together with the peasants who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass slightly sprinkled with rain to get their bread from the heap of coats he went toward his horse only then did he suddenly awake to the fact that he had been wrong about the weather and that the rain was drenching his hay 
 the hay will be spoiled he said 
 not a bit of it sir mow in the rain and rake in fine weather said the old man 
 levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee 
 sergei ivanovich was just getting up when he had drunk his coffee levin rode back again to the mowing before sergei ivanovich had had time to dress and come down to the dining room

 next morning konstantin levin got up earlier than usual but he was detained giving directions on the farm and when he reached the mowing grass the mowers were already at their second swath 
 from the uplands he could get a view of the shaded cut part of the meadow below with the grayish swaths and the black heaps of coats taken off by the mowers at the place from which they had started cutting 
 gradually as he rode toward the meadow the peasants came into sight some in coats some in their shirts mowing one behind another in a long string each swinging his scythe in his own way he counted of them 
 they were mowing slowly over the uneven parts of the meadow where there had been an old dam levin recognized some of his own men here was old iermil in a very long white smock bending forward to swing a scythe there was a young fellow vaska who had been a coachman of taking every swath with a wide sweep here too was tit preceptor in the art of mowing a thin little peasant he went on ahead and cut his wide swath without bending as though playing with his scythe 
 levin got off his mare and fastening her up by the roadside went to meet tit who took a second scythe out of a bush and gave it him 
 ready sir like a razor it cuts of itself said tit taking off his cap with a smile and giving him the scythe 
 levin took the scythe and began trying it as they finished their swaths the mowers hot and came out into the road one after another and smirking greeted the master they all stared at him but no one made any remark till a tall old man with a wrinkled beardless face wearing a short sheepskin jacket came out into the road and accosted him 
 now master once take hold of the rope no letting go he said and levin heard smothered laughter among the mowers 
 try not to let it go he said taking his stand behind tit and waiting for the time to begin 
 repeated the old man 
 tit made room and levin started behind him the grass was short close to the road and levin who had not done any mowing for a long while and was disconcerted by the eyes fastened upon him cut badly for the first moments though he swung his scythe vigorously behind him he heard voices 
 not set right too high see how he has to stoop to it said one 
 press more on the heel of the scythe said another 
 never mind get on all right the old man resumed see made a start you swing it too wide tire yourself out the master sure does his best for himself but see the grass missed out for such work us fellows would catch it 
 the grass became lusher and levin listening without answering followed tit trying to do the best he could they moved a hundred paces tit kept moving on without stopping nor showing the slightest weariness but levin was already beginning to fear he would not be able to keep it up so tired was he 
 he felt as he swung his scythe that he was at the very end of his strength and was making up his mind to ask tit to stop but at that very moment tit stopped of his own accord and stooping down picked up some grass rubbed his scythe and began whetting it levin straightened himself and drawing a deep breath looked round behind him came a peasant and he too was evidently tired for he stopped at once without waiting to mow up to levin and began whetting his scythe tit sharpened his scythe and and they went on 
 the next time it was just the same tit moved on with sweep after sweep of his scythe without stopping or showing signs of weariness levin followed him trying not to get left behind and he found it harder and harder the moment came when he felt he had no strength left but at that very moment tit stopped and whetted the scythes 
 so they mowed the first row and this long row seemed particularly hard work to levin but when the end was reached and tit shouldering his scythe began with deliberate stride returning on the tracks left by his heels in the cut grass and levin walked back in the same way over the space he had cut in spite of the sweat that ran in streams over his face and fell in drops down his nose and drenched his back as though he had been soaked in water he felt very happy what delighted him particularly was that now he knew he would be able to hold out 
 his pleasure was only disturbed by his swath not being well cut i will swing less with my arm and more with my whole body he thought comparing swath which looked as if it had been cut along a cord with his own scattered and irregularly lying grass 
 the first swath as levin noticed tit had mowed especially quickly probably wishing to put his master to the test and the swath happened to be a long one the next swaths were easier but still levin had to strain every nerve not to drop behind the peasants 
 he thought of nothing wished for nothing save not to be left behind the peasants and to do his work as well as possible he heard nothing save the swish of scythes and saw before him upright figure mowing away the curve of the cut grass the grass and flowers slowly and rhythmically falling before the blade of his scythe and ahead of him the end of the swath where would come the rest 
 suddenly in the midst of his toil without understanding what it was or whence it came he felt a pleasant sensation of chill on his hot moist shoulders he glanced at the sky in the interval for whetting the scythes a heavy lowering storm cloud had blown up and big raindrops were falling some of the peasants went to their coats and put them on others just like levin himself merely shrugged their shoulders enjoying the pleasant coolness of it 
 another swath and yet another swath followed long swaths and short swaths with good grass and with poor grass levin lost all sense of time and could not have told whether it were late or early now a change began to come over his work which gave him immense satisfaction in the midst of his toil there were moments during which he forgot what he was doing and it all came easy to him and at those same moments his swath was almost as smooth and well cut as but as soon as he recollected what he was doing and began trying to do better he was at once conscious of all the difficulty of his task and the swath was badly mown 
 on finishing yet another swath he would have gone back to the top of the meadow again to begin the next but tit stopped and going up to the old man said something in a low voice to him they both looked at the sun what are they talking about and why he go back thought levin without guessing that the peasants had been mowing no less than four hours without stopping and that it was time for their lunch 
 lunch sir said the old man 
 is it really time lunch it is then 
 levin gave his scythe to tit and together with the peasants who were crossing the long stretch of mown grass slightly sprinkled with rain to get their bread from the heap of coats he went toward his horse only then did he suddenly awake to the fact that he had been wrong about the weather and that the rain was drenching his hay 
 the hay will be spoiled he said 
 not a bit of it sir mow in the rain and rake in fine weather said the old man 
 levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee 
 sergei ivanovich was just getting up when he had drunk his coffee levin rode back again to the mowing before sergei ivanovich had had time to dress and come down to the dining room

 after lunch levin was not in the same place in the string of mowers as before but stood between the old man who had accosted him jocosely and now invited him to be his neighbor and a young peasant who had only been married in the autumn and who was mowing this summer for the first time 
 the old man holding himself erect moved in front with his feet turned out taking long regular strides and with a precise and regular action which seemed to cost him no more effort than swinging arms in walking as though it were in play he laid down the high even swath of grass it was as though it were not he but the sharp scythe of itself swishing through the juicy grass 
 behind levin came the lad mishka his comely youthful face with a twist of fresh grass bound round his hair was all working with effort but whenever anyone looked at him he smiled he would clearly have died sooner than own it was hard work for him 
 
 levin kept between them in the very heat of the day the mowing did not seem such hard work to him the perspiration with which he was drenched cooled him while the sun that burned his back his head and his arms bare to the elbow gave a vigor and dogged energy to his labor and more and more often now came those moments of unconsciousness when it was possible not to think of what one was doing the scythe cut of itself these were happy moments still more delightful were the moments when they reached the stream where the swaths ended and the old man rubbed his scythe with the wet thick grass rinsed its blade in the fresh water of the stream ladled out a little in a whetstone case and offered levin a drink 
 what do you say to my kvass eh good eh he would say winking 
 and truly levin had never drunk any liquor as good as this warm water with green bits floating in it and a taste of rust from the tin whetstone case and immediately after this came the delicious slow saunter with his hand on the scythe during which he could wipe away the streaming sweat take deep breaths of air and look about at the long string of mowers and at what was happening around in the forest and the field 
 the longer levin mowed the oftener he felt the moments of unconsciousness in which it seemed that it was not his hands which swung the scythe but that the scythe was moving together with itself a body full of life and consciousness of its own and as though by magic without thinking of it the work turned out regular and of itself these were the most blissful moments 
 it was only hard work when he had to break off the motion which had become unconscious and to think when he had to mow round a hummock or an unweeded tuft of sorrel the old man did this easily when a hummock came he changed his action and at one time with the heel and at another with the tip of his scythe clipped the hummock round both sides with short strokes and while he did this he kept looking about and watching what came into his view at one moment he picked a wild berry and ate it or offered it to levin then he flung away a twig with the blade of the scythe then he looked at a nest from which the bird flew just under the scythe or caught a snake that crossed his path and lifting it on the scythe as though on a fork showed it to levin and threw it away 
 for both levin and the young peasant behind him such changes of position were difficult both of them repeating over and over again the same strained movement were in a perfect frenzy of toil and were incapable of shifting their position and at the same time watching what was before them 
 levin did not notice how time was passing if he had been asked how long he had been working he would have said half an hour yet it was getting on to dinnertime as they were walking back over the cut grass the old man called attention to the little girls and boys who were coming from different directions hardly visible through the long grass and along the road toward the mowers carrying sacks of bread that stretched their little arms and lugging small pitchers of kvass stopped up with rags 
 at the little doodlebugs crawling he said pointing to them and he shaded his eyes with his hand to look at the sun 
 they mowed two more swaths the old man stopped 
 come master dinnertime he said decidedly and on reaching the stream the mowers moved off across the swaths toward their pile of coats where the children who had brought their dinners were sitting waiting for them the peasants gathered those who came from afar under their telegas those who lived near under a willow bush covered with grass 
 levin sat down by them he felt disinclined to go away 
 all constraint with the master had disappeared long ago the peasants got ready for dinner some washed the young lads bathed in the stream others made a place comfortable for a rest untied their sacks of bread and uncovered the pitchers of kvass the old man crumbled up some bread in a cup stirred it with the handle of a spoon poured water on it from his whetstone case broke up some more bread and having seasoned it with salt he turned to the east to say his prayer 
 come master taste my sop said he kneeling down before the cup 
 the sop was so good that levin gave up the idea of going home for dinner he ate with the old man and talked to him about his family affairs taking the keenest interest in them and told him about his own affairs and all the circumstances that could be of interest to the old man he felt much nearer to him than to his brother and could not help smiling at the affection he felt for this man when the old man got up again said his prayer and lay down under a bush putting some grass under his head for a pillow levin did the same and in spite of the clinging flies that were so persistent in the sunshine and the midges that tickled his hot face and body he fell asleep at once and only waked when the sun had passed to the other side of the bush and reached him the old man had been awake a long while and was sitting up whetting the scythes of the younger lads 
 levin looked about him and hardly recognized the place everything was so changed the immense stretch of meadow had been mown and was sparkling with a peculiar fresh brilliance with its lines of already grass in the slanting rays of the evening sun and the bushes about the river mowed around and the river itself not visible before now gleaming like steel in its bends and the moving ascending peasants and the sharp wall of grass of the unmown part of the meadow and the hawks hovering over the stripped meadow all was perfectly new raising himself levin began considering how much had been cut and how much more could still be done that day 
 the work done was exceptionally great for men they had cut the whole of the big meadow which had in the years of corvee taken thirty scythes two days to mow only the corners remained to do where the swaths were short but levin felt a longing to get as much mowing done that day as possible and was vexed with the sun sinking so quickly in the sky he felt no weariness all he wanted was to get his work done more and more quickly and as much of it as possible 
 could we cut the mashkin upland too what do you think he said to the old man 
 as god wills the not high a little vodka for the lads 
 at the afternoon rest when they were sitting down again and those who smoked had lighted their pipes the old man told the men that the mashkin to be cut be vodka 
 why not cut it come on tit look sharp we can eat at night come on voices cried out and eating up their bread the mowers went back to work 
 come lads keep it up said tit and ran on ahead almost at a trot 
 get along get along said the old man hurrying after him and easily overtaking him mow thee down look out 
 and young and old mowed away as though they were racing with one another but however fast they worked they did not spoil the grass and the swaths were laid just as neatly and exactly the little piece left uncut in the corner was mown in five minutes the last of the mowers were just ending their swaths while the foremost snatched up their coats onto their shoulders and crossed the road toward the mashkin upland 
 the sun was already sinking among the trees when they went with their jingling whetstone cases into the wooded ravine of the mashkin upland the grass was up to their waists in the middle of the hollow lush tender and feathery spotted here and there among the trees with wild heartsease 
 after a brief consultation whether to take the swaths lengthwise or diagonally prokhor iermilin also a doughty mower a huge peasant went on ahead he went up to the top turned back again and started mowing and they all proceeded to form in line behind him going downhill through the hollow and uphill right up to the edge of the forest the sun sank behind the forest the dew was falling by now the mowers were in the sun only on the hillside but below where a mist was rising and on the opposite side they mowed into the fresh dewy shade the work went rapidly 
 the spicily fragrant grass cut with a succulent sound was at once laid in high swaths the mowers from all sides brought closer together in the short swath kept urging one another on to the sound of jingling whetstone cases and clanging scythes and the hiss of the whetstones sharpening them and shouts 
 levin still kept between the young peasant and the old man the old man who had put on his short sheepskin jacket was just as jocose and free in his movements among the trees they were continually cutting with their scythes the birch mushrooms swollen fat in the succulent grass but the old man bent down every time he came across a mushroom picked it up and put it in his bosom another present for my old woman he would say as he did so 
 easy as it was to mow the wet lush grass it was hard work going up and down the steep sides of the ravine but this did not trouble the old man swinging his scythe just as ever and moving his feet in their big plaited bast sandals with firm short steps he climbed slowly up the steep place and though his breeches hanging out below his smock and his whole frame trembled with effort he did not miss one blade of grass or one mushroom on his way and kept making jokes with the peasants and levin levin walked after him and often thought he must fall as he climbed with a scythe up a steep hillock where it would have been hard work to clamber even without the scythe but he climbed up and did what he had to do he felt as though some external force were moving him

 the mashkin upland was mown the last swaths finished the peasants had put on their coats and were gaily trudging home levin got on his horse and parting regretfully from the peasants rode homeward on the hillside he looked back he could not see them in the mist that had risen from the valley he could only hear their rough voices their laughter and the sound of clanking scythes 
 sergei ivanovich had long ago finished dinner and was drinking iced lemonade in his own room looking through the reviews and papers which he had just received by post when levin rushed into the room talking merrily with his wet and matted hair sticking to his forehead and his back and chest grimed and moist 
 we mowed the whole meadow oh it is fine wonderful and how have you been getting on said levin completely forgetting the disagreeable conversation of the previous day 
 dear me what you look like said sergei ivanovich for the first moment looking round with some dissatisfaction and the door do shut the door he cried you must have let in a dozen at least 
 sergei ivanovich could not endure flies and in his own room he never opened the window except at night and carefully kept the door shut 
 not one on my honor but if i have catch them you believe what a pleasure mowing is how have you spent the day 
 very well but have you really been mowing the whole day i expect as hungry as a wolf kouzma has got everything ready for you 
 no i feel hungry even i had something to eat there but go and wash 
 yes go along go along and come to you directly said sergei ivanovich shaking his head as he looked at his brother go along make haste he added smiling and gathering up his books he prepared to go too he too felt suddenly and disinclined to leave his side but what did you do while it was raining 
 rain why there was scarcely a drop come directly so you had a good day too and levin went off to change his clothes 
 five minutes later the brothers met in the dining room although it seemed to levin that he was not hungry and he sat down to dinner simply so as not to hurt feelings yet when he began to eat the dinner struck him as extraordinarily good sergei ivanovich watched him with a smile 
 oh by the way a letter for you said he kouzma bring it from below please and mind you shut the doors 
 the letter was from oblonsky levin read it aloud oblonsky wrote to him from peterburg i have had a letter from dolly at ergushovo and everything seems going wrong there do ride over and see her please help her with advice you know all about it she will be so glad to see you quite alone poor thing my and all of them are still abroad 
 capital i will certainly ride over to her said levin or go together such a good woman she 
 not far from here then 
 thirty verstas or perhaps forty but a capital road it will be a capital drive 
 i shall be delighted said sergei ivanovich still smiling 
 the sight of his younger appearance had immediately put him in a good humor 
 well you have an appetite he said looking at his sunburned face and neck bent over the plate 
 splendid you imagine what an effective remedy it is for every sort of foolishness i want to enrich medicine with a new word arbeitskur 
 well but you need it i should fancy 
 no but for all sorts of nervous invalids 
 yes it ought to be tried i had meant to come to the mowing to look at you but it was so unbearably hot that i got no further than the forest i sat there a little and went on by the forest to the village met your old nurse and sounded her as to the view of you as far as i can make out they approve of this she said not a work altogether i fancy that in the ideas there are very clear and definite notions of certain as they call it gentlemanly lines of action and they sanction the moving outside bounds clearly laid down in their ideas 
 maybe so but anyway a pleasure such as i have never known in my life and no harm in it you know is there answered levin i help it if they like it though i do believe all right eh 
 altogether pursued sergei ivanovich satisfied with your day 
 quite satisfied we cut the whole meadow and i made friends with such a splendid old man there you fancy how delightful he was 
 well so satisfied with your day and so am i first i solved two chess problems and one a very pretty one a pawn opening show it to you and then i thought over our conversation of yesterday 
 eh our conversation of yesterday said levin blissfully dropping his eyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his dinner and absolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation of yesterday had been about 
 i think you are partly right our difference of opinion amounts to this that you make the mainspring while i contend that interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain degree of advancement possibly you are right too that action founded on material interest would be more desirable you are altogether as the french say too primesautire a nature you must have intense energetic action or nothing 
 levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single word and did not want to understand he was only afraid his brother might ask him some question which would make it evident he had not heard 
 so what i think it is my dear boy said sergei ivanovich touching him on the shoulder 
 yes of course but do you know i stand up for my view answered levin with a guilty childlike smile whatever was it i was disputing about he wondered of course right and right and all only i must go round to the countinghouse and see to things he got up stretching and smiling 
 sergei ivanovich smiled too 
 if you want to go out go together he said disinclined to be parted from his brother who seemed positively breathing out freshness and energy come go to the countinghouse if you have to go there 
 oh heavens shouted levin so loudly that sergei ivanovich was quite frightened 
 what what is the matter 
 agathya hand said levin slapping himself on the head positively forgotten her 
 much better 
 well anyway run down to her before time to get your hat on be back 
 and he ran downstairs clattering with his heels like a spring rattle

 the letter was from oblonsky levin read it aloud oblonsky wrote to him from peterburg i have had a letter from dolly at ergushovo and everything seems going wrong there do ride over and see her please help her with advice you know all about it she will be so glad to see you quite alone poor thing my and all of them are still abroad 
 capital i will certainly ride over to her said levin or go together such a good woman she 
 not far from here then 
 thirty verstas or perhaps forty but a capital road it will be a capital drive 
 i shall be delighted said sergei ivanovich still smiling 
 the sight of his younger appearance had immediately put him in a good humor 
 well you have an appetite he said looking at his sunburned face and neck bent over the plate 
 splendid you imagine what an effective remedy it is for every sort of foolishness i want to enrich medicine with a new word arbeitskur 
 well but you need it i should fancy 
 no but for all sorts of nervous invalids 
 yes it ought to be tried i had meant to come to the mowing to look at you but it was so unbearably hot that i got no further than the forest i sat there a little and went on by the forest to the village met your old nurse and sounded her as to the view of you as far as i can make out they approve of this she said not a work altogether i fancy that in the ideas there are very clear and definite notions of certain as they call it gentlemanly lines of action and they sanction the moving outside bounds clearly laid down in their ideas 
 maybe so but anyway a pleasure such as i have never known in my life and no harm in it you know is there answered levin i help it if they like it though i do believe all right eh 
 altogether pursued sergei ivanovich satisfied with your day 
 quite satisfied we cut the whole meadow and i made friends with such a splendid old man there you fancy how delightful he was 
 well so satisfied with your day and so am i first i solved two chess problems and one a very pretty one a pawn opening show it to you and then i thought over our conversation of yesterday 
 eh our conversation of yesterday said levin blissfully dropping his eyelids and drawing deep breaths after finishing his dinner and absolutely incapable of recalling what their conversation of yesterday had been about 
 i think you are partly right our difference of opinion amounts to this that you make the mainspring while i contend that interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain degree of advancement possibly you are right too that action founded on material interest would be more desirable you are altogether as the french say too primesautire a nature you must have intense energetic action or nothing 
 levin listened to his brother and did not understand a single word and did not want to understand he was only afraid his brother might ask him some question which would make it evident he had not heard 
 so what i think it is my dear boy said sergei ivanovich touching him on the shoulder 
 yes of course but do you know i stand up for my view answered levin with a guilty childlike smile whatever was it i was disputing about he wondered of course right and right and all only i must go round to the countinghouse and see to things he got up stretching and smiling 
 sergei ivanovich smiled too 
 if you want to go out go together he said disinclined to be parted from his brother who seemed positively breathing out freshness and energy come go to the countinghouse if you have to go there 
 oh heavens shouted levin so loudly that sergei ivanovich was quite frightened 
 what what is the matter 
 agathya hand said levin slapping himself on the head positively forgotten her 
 much better 
 well anyway run down to her before time to get your hat on be back 
 and he ran downstairs clattering with his heels like a spring rattle

 stepan arkadyevich had gone to peterburg to perform the most natural and essential official duty so familiar to everyone in the government service though incomprehensible to outsiders that duty but for which one could hardly be in government service of reminding the ministry of his existence and having for the due performance of this rite taken all the available cash from home was gaily and agreeably spending his days at the races and in the summer villas meanwhile dolly and the children had moved into the country to cut down expenses as much as possible she had gone to ergushovo the estate that had been her dowry and the one where in spring the forest had been sold it was nearly fifty verstas from pokrovskoe 
 the big old house at ergushovo had been pulled down long ago and the old prince had had the wing done up and added to twenty years before when dolly was a child the wing had been roomy and comfortable though like all wings it stood sideways to the entrance avenue and to the south but by now this wing was old and dilapidated when stepan arkadyevich had gone down in the spring to sell the forest dolly had begged him to look over the house and order what repairs might be needed stepan arkadyevich like an unfaithful husbands indeed was very solicitous for his comfort and he had himself looked over the house and given instructions about everything that he considered necessary what he considered necessary was to cover all the furniture with new cretonne to put up curtains to weed the garden to make a little bridge on the pond and to plant flowers but he forgot many other essential matters the want of which greatly distressed darya alexandrovna later on 
 in spite of stepan efforts to be an attentive father and husband he never could keep in his mind that he had a wife and children he had bachelor tastes and it was in accordance with them that he shaped his life on his return to moscow he informed his wife with pride that everything was ready that the house would be a pretty toy and that he most certainly advised her to go his staying away in the country was very agreeable to stepan arkadyevich from every point of view it did the children good it decreased expenses and it left him more at liberty darya alexandrovna regarded staying in the country for the summer as essential for the children especially for the little girl who had not succeeded in regaining her strength after the scarlatina and also as a means of escaping the petty humiliations the little bills owing to the wood merchant the fishmonger the shoemaker which made her miserable besides this she was pleased to go away to the country because she was dreaming of getting her sister kitty to stay with her there kitty was to be back from abroad in the middle of the summer and bathing had been prescribed for her kitty wrote that no prospect was so alluring as to spend the summer with dolly at ergushovo full of childhood associations for both of them 
 the first days of her existence in the country were very hard for dolly she used to stay in the country as a child and the impression she had retained of it was that the country was a refuge from all the unpleasantness of the town that life there though not luxurious dolly could easily make up her mind to that was cheap and comfortable that there was plenty of everything everything was cheap everything could be got and children were happy but now coming to the country as the head of a family she perceived that it was all utterly unlike what she had fancied

 she had immediately made friends with the wife and on the very first day she drank tea with her and the bailiff under the acacias and reviewed all the circumstances of the position very soon matriona philimonovna had established her club so to say under the acacias and there it was in this club consisting of the wife the village elder and the countinghouse clerk that the difficulties of existence were gradually smoothed away and in a time everything actually had come round the roof was mended a kitchenmaid was found a crony of the village hens were bought the cows began giving milk the garden hedge was stopped up with stakes the carpenter made a mangle hooks were put in the cupboards and they ceased to fly open spontaneously and an ironing board covered with army cloth was placed across from the arm of a chair to the chest of drawers and there was a smell of flatirons in the maids room

 chapter 
 
 toward the end of may when everything had been more or less satisfactorily arranged she received her answer to her complaints of the disorganized state of things in the country he wrote begging her forgiveness for not having thought of everything before and promised to come down at the first chance this chance did not present itself and till the beginning of june darya alexandrovna stayed alone in the country 
 on the sunday in st week darya alexandrovna drove to mass to have all her children take the sacrament darya alexandrovna in her intimate philosophical talks with her sister her mother and her friends very often astonished them by the freedom of her views in regard to religion she had a strange religion all her own of the transmigration of souls in which she had firm faith troubling herself little about the dogmas of the church but in her family she was strict in carrying out all that was required by the church and not merely in order to set an example but with all her heart the fact that the children had not been at the sacrament for nearly a year worried her extremely and with the full approval and sympathy of matriona philimonovna she decided that this should take place now in the summer 
 for several days before darya alexandrovna was busily deliberating on how to dress all the children frocks were made or altered and washed seams and flounces were let out buttons were sewn on and ribbons got ready one dress which the english governess had undertaken cost darya alexandrovna much loss of temper the english governess in altering it had made the seams in the wrong place had taken up the sleeves too much and altogether spoiled the dress it was so narrow on shoulders that it was quite painful to look at her but matriona philimonovna had the happy thought of putting in gussets and adding a little the dress was set right but there was nearly a quarrel with the english governess in the morning however all was happily arranged and about nine the time at which they had asked the priest to wait for them for the mass the children in their new dresses stood with beaming faces on the step before the carriage waiting for their mother 
 in the carriage instead of the restive raven they had harnessed thanks to the representations of matriona philimonovna the horse brownie and darya alexandrovna delayed by anxiety over her own attire came out and got in dressed in a white muslin gown 
 darya alexandrovna had done her hair and dressed with care and excitement in the old days she had dressed for her own sake to look pretty and be admired later on as she got older dress became more and more distasteful to her she saw that she was losing her good looks but now she began to feel pleasure and interest in dress again now she did not dress for her own sake nor for the sake of her own beauty but simply that as the mother of those exquisite creatures she might not spoil the general effect and looking at herself for the last time in the looking glass she was satisfied with herself she looked well not as well as she wished to look in the old days at a ball but well for the object she now had in view 
 in the church there was no one but the peasants the servants and their womenfolk but darya alexandrovna saw or fancied she saw the sensation produced by her children and herself the children were not only beautiful to look at in their smart little dresses but they were charming in the way they behaved aliosha it is true did not stand quite correctly he kept turning round trying to look at his little jacket from behind but all the same he was wonderfully sweet tania behaved like a person and looked after the little ones and the smallest lily was bewitching in her naive astonishment at everything and it was difficult not to smile when after taking the sacrament she said in english please some more 
 on the way home the children felt that something solemn had happened and were very sedate 
 everything went happily at home too but at lunch grisha began whistling and what was worse was disobedient to the english governess and was forbidden to have any tart darya alexandrovna would not have let things go as far as the punishment on such a day had she been present but she had to support the english authority and she upheld her decision that grisha should have no tart this rather spoiled the general good humor 
 grisha cried declaring that nikolinka had whistled too yet was not punished and that he crying for the tart he care but at being unjustly treated this was really too tragic and darya alexandrovna made up her mind to persuade the english governess to forgive grisha and she went to speak to her but on her way as she passed the drawing room she beheld a scene filling her heart with such pleasure that the tears came into her eyes and she forgave the delinquent herself 
 the culprit was sitting at the window in the corner of the drawing room beside him was standing tania with a plate on the pretext of wanting to give some dinner to her dolls she had asked the permission to take her share of tart to the nursery and had taken it instead to her brother while still weeping over the injustice of his punishment he was eating the tart and kept saying through his sobs eat yourself eat it together together 
 tania had at first been under the influence of her pity for grisha then of a sense of her noble action and tears were standing in her eyes too but she did not refuse and ate her share 
 on catching sight of their mother they were dismayed but looking into her face they saw they were not doing wrong they burst out laughing and with their mouths full of tart they began wiping their smiling lips with their hands and smearing their radiant faces all over with tears and jam 
 mercy your new white frock tania grisha said their mother trying to save the frock but with tears in her eyes smiling a blissful rapturous smile 
 the new frocks were taken off and orders were given for the little girls to have their blouses put on and the boys their old jackets and the wide droshky to be harnessed with brownie to the annoyance again in the shafts to drive out for mushroom picking and bathing a roar of delighted shrieks arose in the nursery and never ceased till they had set off for the bathing place 
 they gathered a whole basketful of mushrooms even lily found a birch mushroom it had always happened before that miss hoole found them and pointed them out to her but this time she found a big one quite by herself and there was a general scream of delight lily has found a mushroom 
 then they reached the river put the horses under the birch trees and went to the bathing place the coachman terentii hitched the horses who kept whisking away the horseflies to a tree and treading down the grass lay down in the shade of a birch and smoked his shag while the shrieks of delight of the children floated across to him from the bathing place 
 though it was hard work to look after all the children and restrain their pranks though it was difficult too to keep head and not mix up all the stockings little breeches and shoes for the different legs and to undo and to do up again all the tapes and buttons darya alexandrovna who had always liked bathing herself and believed it to be very good for the children enjoyed nothing so much as bathing with all the children to go over all those fat little legs pulling on their stockings to take in her arms and dip those little naked bodies and to hear their screams of delight and alarm to see the breathless faces with scared and happy eyes of all her splashing cherubs was a great pleasure to her 
 when half the children had been dressed some peasant women in holiday dress out picking herbs came up to the bathing shed and stopped shyly matriona philimonovna called one of them and handed her a sheet and a shirt that had dropped into the water for her to dry them and darya alexandrovna began to talk to the women at first they laughed behind their hands and did not understand her questions but soon they grew bolder and began to talk winning darya heart at once by the genuine admiration of the children that they showed 
 my what a beauty as white as sugar said one admiring tanechka and shaking her head but thin 
 yes she has been ill 
 lookee been bathing him too said another pointing to the breast baby 
 no only three months old answered darya alexandrovna with pride 
 you see 
 and have you any children 
 had four two living a boy and a girl i weaned her last carnival 
 how old is she 
 why more than one year old 
 why did you nurse her so long 
 our custom for three fasts 
 and the conversation became most interesting to darya alexandrovna what sort of time did she have what was the matter with the boy where was her husband did it often happen 
 darya alexandrovna felt disinclined to leave the peasant women so interesting to her was their conversation so completely identical were all their interests what pleased her most of all was that she saw clearly what all the women admired more than anything was her having so many children and such fine ones the peasant women even made darya alexandrovna laugh and offended the english governess because she was the cause of the laughter she did not understand one of the younger women kept staring at the englishwoman who was dressing after all the rest and when she put on her third petticoat she could not refrain from the remark my she keeps putting on and putting on and never have done she said and they all went off into peals of laughter

 and the conversation became most interesting to darya alexandrovna what sort of time did she have what was the matter with the boy where was her husband did it often happen 
 darya alexandrovna felt disinclined to leave the peasant women so interesting to her was their conversation so completely identical were all their interests what pleased her most of all was that she saw clearly what all the women admired more than anything was her having so many children and such fine ones the peasant women even made darya alexandrovna laugh and offended the english governess because she was the cause of the laughter she did not understand one of the younger women kept staring at the englishwoman who was dressing after all the rest and when she put on her third petticoat she could not refrain from the remark my she keeps putting on and putting on and never have done she said and they all went off into peals of laughter

 on the drive home as darya alexandrovna with all her children round her their heads still wet from their baths and a kerchief tied over her own head was getting near the house the coachman said some gentleman coming the master of pokrovskoe i do believe 
 darya alexandrovna peeped out in front and was delighted when she recognized in the gray hat and gray coat the familiar figure of levin walking to meet them she was glad to see him at any time but at this moment she was specially glad he should see her in all her glory no one was better able to appreciate her grandeur than levin 
 seeing her he found himself face to face with one of the pictures of his daydream of family life 
 like a hen with your brood darya alexandrovna 
 ah how glad i am to see you she said holding out her hand to him 
 glad to see me but you let me know my staying with me i got a note from stiva that you were here 
 from stiva darya alexandrovna asked with surprise 
 yes he writes that you are here and that he thinks you might allow me to be of use to you said levin and as he said it he became suddenly embarrassed and stopping abruptly he walked on in silence by the droshky snapping off the buds of the lime trees and nibbling them he was embarrassed through a sense that darya alexandrovna would be annoyed by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights have come from her own husband darya alexandrovna certainly did not like this little way of stepan of foisting his domestic duties on others and she was at once aware that levin was aware of this it was just for this fineness of perception for this delicacy that darya alexandrovna liked levin 
 i know of course said levin that this simply means that you would like to see me and exceedingly glad though i can fancy that used to town housekeeping as you are you must feel you are in the wilds here and if anything wanted altogether at your disposal 
 oh no said dolly at first things were rather uncomfortable but now settled everything capitally thanks to my old nurse she said indicating matriona philimonovna who seeing that they were speaking of her smiled brightly and cordially to levin she knew him and knew that he would be a good match for her young lady and was very keen to see the matter settled 
 you get in sir make room on this side she said to him 
 no walk children like to race the horses with me 
 the children knew levin very little and could not remember when they had seen him but they experienced in regard to him none of that strange feeling of shyness and hostility which children so often experience toward hypocritical people and for which they are so often and miserably punished hypocrisy in anything whatever may deceive the cleverest and most penetrating man but the least of children recognizes it and is revolted by it however ingeniously it may be disguised whatever faults levin had there was not a trace of hypocrisy in him and so the children showed him the same friendliness that they saw in their face on his invitation the two elder ones at once jumped out to him and ran with him as simply as they would have done with their nurse or miss hoole or their mother lily too began begging to go to him and her mother handed her over to him he sat her on his shoulder and ran along with her 
 be afraid be afraid darya alexandrovna he said smiling to the mother no chance of my hurting or dropping her 
 and looking at his strong agile assiduously careful and extremely strained movements the mother felt her mind at rest and smiled gaily and approvingly as she watched him 
 here in the country with children and with darya alexandrovna with whom he was in sympathy levin was in a mood not infrequent with him of childlike lightheartedness that she particularly liked in him as he ran with the children he taught them gymnastic feats set miss hoole laughing with his queer english accent and talked to darya alexandrovna of his pursuits in the country 
 after dinner darya alexandrovna sitting alone with him on the balcony began to speak of kitty 
 you know coming here and is going to spend the summer with me 
 really he said flushing and at once to change the conversation he said then send you two cows shall i if you insist on a bill you shall pay me five roubles a month if you ashamed 
 no thank you we can manage very well now 
 oh well then have a look at your cows and if allow me give directions about their food everything depends on their food 
 and levin to turn the conversation explained to darya alexandrovna the theory of cowkeeping based on the principle that the cow is simply a machine for the transformation of food into milk and so on 
 he talked of this and passionately longed to hear more of kitty and at the same time was afraid of hearing it he dreaded the breaking up of the inward peace he had gained with such effort 
 yes but still all this has to be looked after and who is there to look after it darya alexandrovna responded reluctantly 
 she had by now got her household matters so satisfactorily arranged thanks to matriona philimonovna that she was disinclined to make any change in them besides she had no faith in knowledge of farming general principles as to the cow being a machine for the production of milk she looked on with suspicion it seemed to her that such principles could only be a hindrance in farm management it all seemed to her a far simpler matter all that was needed as matriona philimonovna had explained was to give brindle and whitebreast more food and drink and not to let the cook carry all the kitchen slops to the cow that was clear but general propositions as to feeding on meal and on grass were doubtful and obscure and what was most important she wanted to talk about kitty

 kitty writes to me that nothing she longs for so much as quiet and solitude dolly said after the silence that had followed 
 and how is she better levin asked in agitation 
 thank god quite well again i never believed her lungs were affected 
 oh very glad said levin and dolly fancied she saw something touching helpless in his face as he said this and looked silently into her face 
 let me ask you konstantin dmitrievich said darya alexandrovna smiling her kindly and rather mocking smile why are you angry with kitty 
 i not angry with her said levin 
 yes you are why was it you did not come to see us or them when you were in moscow 
 darya alexandrovna he said blushing up to the roots of his hair i wonder really that with your kind heart you feel this how it is you feel no pity for me if nothing else when you know 
 what do i know 
 you know that i proposed and was refused said levin and all the tenderness he had been feeling for kitty a minute before was replaced by a feeling of anger for the slight he had suffered 
 what makes you suppose i know 
 because everybody knows it 
 just where you are mistaken i did not know it though i had guessed it was so 
 well now you know it 
 all i knew was that something had happened that made her dreadfully miserable and that she begged me never to speak of it and if she would not tell me she would certainly not speak of it to anyone else but what did pass between you tell me 
 i have told you 
 when was it 
 when i was at their house the last time 
 do you know said darya alexandrovna i am awfully awfully sorry for her you suffer only from pride 
 perhaps so said levin but 
 she interrupted him 
 but she poor girl i am awfully awfully sorry for her now i see it all 
 well darya alexandrovna you must excuse me he said getting up darya alexandrovna till we meet again 
 no wait a minute she said clutching him by the sleeve wait a minute sit down 
 please please let us talk of this he said sitting down and at the same time feeling rise up and stir within his heart a hope he had believed to be buried 
 if i did not like you she said and tears came into her eyes if i did not know you as i do know you 
 the feeling that had seemed dead revived more and more rose up and took possession of heart 
 yes i understand it all now said darya alexandrovna you understand it for you men who are free and make your own choice always clear whom you love but a in a position of suspense with all a or modesty a girl who sees you men from afar who takes everything on trust a girl may have and often has such a feeling that she cannot tell what to say 
 yes if the heart does not speak 
 no the heart does speak but just consider you men have views about a girl you come to the house you make friends you criticize you wait to see if you have found what you love and then when you are sure you love her you propose 
 well not quite it 
 anyway you propose when your love is ripe or when the balance has completely turned between the two you are choosing from but a girl is not asked she is expected to make her choice and yet she cannot choose she can only answer yes or no 
 yes to choose between me and vronsky thought levin and the dead thing that had come to life within him died again and only weighed on his heart and set it aching 
 darya alexandrovna he said how one chooses a new dress or some purchase or other not love the choice has been made and so much the better and there can be no repetition 
 ah pride pride said darya alexandrovna as though despising him for the baseness of this feeling in comparison with that other feeling which only women know at the time when you proposed to kitty she was just in a position in which she could not answer she was in doubt doubt between you and vronsky him she was seeing every day and you she had not seen for a long while supposing she had been older i for instance in her place could have felt no doubt i always disliked him and my dislike proved to be justified 
 levin recalled answer she had said no that cannot be 
 darya alexandrovna he said dryly i appreciate your confidence in me i believe you are making a mistake but whether i am right or wrong that pride you so despise makes any thought of katerina alexandrovna out of the question for me you understand utterly out of the question 
 i will only say one thing more you know that i am speaking of my sister whom i love as i love my own children i say she cared for you all i meant to say is that her refusal at that moment proves nothing 
 i know said levin jumping up you only knew how you are hurting me just as if a child of yours were dead and they were to say to you he would have been like this and like that and he might have lived and how happy you would have been in him but dead dead dead 
 how absurd you are said darya alexandrovna looking with mournful tenderness at excitement yes i see it all more and more clearly she went on musingly so you come to see us then when here 
 no i come of course i avoid meeting katerina alexandrovna but as far as i can i will try to save her the annoyance of my presence 
 you are very very absurd repeated darya alexandrovna looking with tenderness into his face very well then let it be as though we had not spoken of this what have you come for tania she said in french to the little girl who had come in 
 my spade mamma 
 i speak french and you must too 
 the little girl tried to say it in french but could not remember the french for spade the mother prompted her and then told her in french where to look for the spade and this made a disagreeable impression on levin 
 everything in darya house and children struck him now as by no means so charming as a little while before 
 and why does she talk french with the children he thought how unnatural and false it is and the children feel it so learning french and unlearning sincerity he thought to himself unaware that darya alexandrovna had thought all that over twenty times already and yet even at the cost of some loss of sincerity believed it necessary to teach her children french in that way 
 but why are you going do stay a little 
 levin stayed to tea but his good humor had vanished and he felt ill at ease 
 after tea he went out into the hall to order his horses to be put in and when he came back he found darya alexandrovna greatly disturbed with a troubled face and tears in her eyes while levin had been outside an incident had occurred which had all at once shattered all the happiness she had been feeling that day and her pride in her children grisha and tania had been fighting over a ball darya alexandrovna hearing a scream in the nursery ran in and saw a terrible sight tania was pulling hair while he with a face hideous with rage was beating her with his fists wherever he could get at her something snapped in darya heart when she saw this it was as if darkness had swooped down upon her life she felt that these children of hers that she was so proud of were not merely most ordinary but positively bad children with coarse brutal propensities wicked children 
 she could not talk or think of anything else and she could not help speaking to levin of her misery 
 levin saw she was unhappy and tried to comfort her saying that it showed nothing bad that all children fight but even as he said it he was thinking in his heart no i be artificial and talk french with my children but my children be like that all one has to do is not spoil children not to distort their nature and be delightful no my children be like that 
 he said and drove away and she did not try to detain him

 chapter 
 
 in the middle of july the elder of the village on estate about twenty verstas from pokrovskoe came to levin to report about the hay and how things were going there the chief source of income on his estate was from the water meadows in former years the hay had been bought by the peasants for twenty roubles the dessiatina when levin took over the management of the estate he thought on examining the grasslands that they were worth more and he fixed the price at roubles the dessiatina the peasants would not give that price and as levin suspected kept off other purchasers then levin had driven over himself and arranged to have the grass cut partly by hired labor partly at a payment of a certain proportion of the crop the peasants of this village put every hindrance they could in the way of this new arrangement but it was carried out and the first year the meadows had yielded a profit almost double two years ago and the previous year the peasants had maintained the same opposition to the arrangement and the hay had been cut on the same system this year the peasants were doing all the mowing for a third of the hay crop and the village elder had come now to announce that the hay had been cut and that fearing rain he had invited the countinghouse clerk over had divided the crop in his presence and had raked together eleven stacks as the share from the vague answers to his question how much hay had been cut on the principal meadow from the hurry of the village elder who had made the division without asking leave from the whole tone of the peasant levin perceived that there was something wrong in the division of the hay and made up his mind to drive over himself to look into the matter 
 arriving by dinnertime at the village and leaving his horse at the cottage of an old friend of his the husband of his wet nurse levin went to see the old man in his beehouse wanting to find out from him the truth about the hay parmenich a talkative comely old man gave levin a very warm welcome showed him all he was doing told him everything about his bees and the swarms of that year but gave vague and unwilling answers to inquiries about the mowing this confirmed levin still more in his suspicions he went to the hayfields and examined the stacks the haystacks could not possibly contain fifty wagonloads each and to convict the peasants levin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be brought up directly to lift one stack and carry it into the barn there turned out to be only loads in the stack in spite of the village assertions about the compressibility of hay and its having settled down in the stacks and his swearing that everything had been done in fear of god levin stuck to his point that the hay had been divided without his orders and that therefore he would not accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack after a prolonged dispute the matter was decided by the peasants taking as their share these eleven stacks reckoning them as fifty loads each and apportioning the share anew the arguments and the division of the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon when the last of the hay had been divided levin entrusting the superintendence of the rest to the countinghouse clerk sat down on a haycock marked off by a stake of willow and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming with peasants 
 in front of him in the bend of the river beyond the little marsh moved a line of peasant women merrily chattering with their ringing voices and the scattered hay was being rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green aftermath after the women came the men with pitchforks and from the gray rows there were growing up broad high soft haycocks to the left telegas were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared and one after another the haycocks vanished flung up in huge forkfuls and in their place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging over the horses hindquarters 
 what weather for haying what hay be said an old man squatting down beside levin tea not hay like scattering grain to the ducks the way they pick it up he added pointing to the growing haycocks since dinnertime carried a good half of it 
 the last load eh he shouted to a young peasant who drove by standing in the front of an empty telega box shaking the reins of hemp 
 the last dad the lad shouted back pulling in the horse and smiling he looked round at a bright peasant girl who sat in the telega box smiling too and drove on 
 that your son asked levin 
 my dear youngest said the old man with a tender smile 
 what a fine fellow 
 the all right 
 married already 
 yes two years last st day 
 any children 
 children indeed why for over a year he was innocent as a babe himself and bashful too answered the old man what hay this is tea indeed he repeated wishing to change the subject 
 levin looked more attentively at vanka parmenov and his wife they were loading a haycock onto the wagon not far from him ivan parmenov was standing on the wagon taking laying in place and stamping down the huge bundles of hay which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to him at first in armfuls and then on the pitchfork the young wife worked easily merrily and deftly the hay did not once break away by her fork first she tedded it stuck the fork into it then with a rapid supple movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she drew herself up and arching her full bosom under the long white apron with a deft turn swung the fork in her arms and flung the bundle of hay high onto the wagon ivan obviously doing his best to save her every minute of unnecessary labor made haste opening wide his arms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the wagon as she raked together what was left of the hay the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had fallen on her neck and arranging the red kerchief that was gone backward baring her white brow not browned by the sun she crept under the wagon to tie up the load ivan directed her how to fasten the cord to the crosspiece and at something she said he laughed aloud in the expressions of both faces was to be seen vigorous young freshly awakened love

 arriving by dinnertime at the village and leaving his horse at the cottage of an old friend of his the husband of his wet nurse levin went to see the old man in his beehouse wanting to find out from him the truth about the hay parmenich a talkative comely old man gave levin a very warm welcome showed him all he was doing told him everything about his bees and the swarms of that year but gave vague and unwilling answers to inquiries about the mowing this confirmed levin still more in his suspicions he went to the hayfields and examined the stacks the haystacks could not possibly contain fifty wagonloads each and to convict the peasants levin ordered the wagons that had carried the hay to be brought up directly to lift one stack and carry it into the barn there turned out to be only loads in the stack in spite of the village assertions about the compressibility of hay and its having settled down in the stacks and his swearing that everything had been done in fear of god levin stuck to his point that the hay had been divided without his orders and that therefore he would not accept that hay as fifty loads to a stack after a prolonged dispute the matter was decided by the peasants taking as their share these eleven stacks reckoning them as fifty loads each and apportioning the share anew the arguments and the division of the haycocks lasted the whole afternoon when the last of the hay had been divided levin entrusting the superintendence of the rest to the countinghouse clerk sat down on a haycock marked off by a stake of willow and looked admiringly at the meadow swarming with peasants 
 in front of him in the bend of the river beyond the little marsh moved a line of peasant women merrily chattering with their ringing voices and the scattered hay was being rapidly formed into gray winding rows over the pale green aftermath after the women came the men with pitchforks and from the gray rows there were growing up broad high soft haycocks to the left telegas were rumbling over the meadow that had been already cleared and one after another the haycocks vanished flung up in huge forkfuls and in their place there were rising heavy cartloads of fragrant hay hanging over the horses hindquarters 
 what weather for haying what hay be said an old man squatting down beside levin tea not hay like scattering grain to the ducks the way they pick it up he added pointing to the growing haycocks since dinnertime carried a good half of it 
 the last load eh he shouted to a young peasant who drove by standing in the front of an empty telega box shaking the reins of hemp 
 the last dad the lad shouted back pulling in the horse and smiling he looked round at a bright peasant girl who sat in the telega box smiling too and drove on 
 that your son asked levin 
 my dear youngest said the old man with a tender smile 
 what a fine fellow 
 the all right 
 married already 
 yes two years last st day 
 any children 
 children indeed why for over a year he was innocent as a babe himself and bashful too answered the old man what hay this is tea indeed he repeated wishing to change the subject 
 levin looked more attentively at vanka parmenov and his wife they were loading a haycock onto the wagon not far from him ivan parmenov was standing on the wagon taking laying in place and stamping down the huge bundles of hay which his pretty young wife deftly handed up to him at first in armfuls and then on the pitchfork the young wife worked easily merrily and deftly the hay did not once break away by her fork first she tedded it stuck the fork into it then with a rapid supple movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it and at once with a bend of her back under the red belt she drew herself up and arching her full bosom under the long white apron with a deft turn swung the fork in her arms and flung the bundle of hay high onto the wagon ivan obviously doing his best to save her every minute of unnecessary labor made haste opening wide his arms to clutch the bundle and lay it in the wagon as she raked together what was left of the hay the young wife shook off the bits of hay that had fallen on her neck and arranging the red kerchief that was gone backward baring her white brow not browned by the sun she crept under the wagon to tie up the load ivan directed her how to fasten the cord to the crosspiece and at something she said he laughed aloud in the expressions of both faces was to be seen vigorous young freshly awakened love

 the load was tied on ivan jumped down and took the quiet sleek horse by the bridle the young wife flung the rake up on the load with a bold step swinging her arms she went to join the women who were forming a ring for the haymakers dance ivan drove off to the road and fell into line with the other loaded wagons the peasant women with their rakes on their shoulders gay with bright flowers and chattering with ringing merry voices walked behind the hay wagon one wild untrained female voice broke into a song and sang it alone through a verse and then the same verse was unanimously taken up and repeated by half a hundred strong healthy voices of all sorts coarse and fine 
 the women all singing began to come close to levin and he felt as though a storm were swooping down upon him with a thunder of merriment the storm swooped down enveloped him and the haycock on which he was lying and the other haycocks and wagonloads and the whole meadow and distant fields all seemed to be shaking and singing to the measures of this wild merry song with its shouts and whistles and clapping levin felt envious of this health and mirthfulness he longed to take part in the expression of this joy of life but he could do nothing and had to lie and look on and listen when the peasants with their singing had vanished out of sight and hearing a weary feeling of despondency at his own isolation his physical inactivity his alienation from this world came over levin 
 some of the very peasants who had been most active in wrangling with him over the hay some whom he had treated with contumely and who had tried to cheat him those very peasants had greeted him and evidently had not were incapable of having any feeling of rancor against him any regret any recollection even of having tried to deceive him all that was drowned in a sea of merry common labor god gave the day god gave the strength and the day and the strength were consecrated to labor and that labor was its own reward for whom the labor what would be its fruits these were idle considerations beside the point 
 often levin had admired this life often he had a sense of envy of the men who led this life but today for the first time especially under the influence of what he had seen in the attitude of ivan parmenov to his young wife the idea presented itself definitely to his mind that it was in his power to exchange the dreary artificial idle and individualistic life he was leading for this laborious pure and generally delightful life 
 the old man who had been sitting beside him had long ago gone home the people had all gone their different ways those who lived near had gone home while those who came from afar were gathered into a group for supper and to spend the night in the meadow levin unobserved by the peasants still lay on the haycock and still looked on and listened and mused the peasants who remained for the night in the meadow scarcely slept all the short summer night at first there was the sound of merry talk and general laughing over the supper then singing again and laughter 
 all the long day of toil had left no trace in them save lightness of heart before the early dawn all was hushed nothing was to be heard but the night sounds of the frogs that never ceased in the marsh and the horses snorting in the mist that rose over the meadow before morning rousing himself levin got up from the haycock and looking at the stars he saw that the night was over 
 well what am i going to do how am i to set about it he said to himself trying to express to himself all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through in this brief night all the thoughts and feelings he had passed through fell into three separate trains of thought one was the renunciation of his old life of his utterly useless education this renunciation gave him satisfaction and was easy and simple another series of thoughts and mental images related to the life he longed to live now the simplicity the purity the sanity of this life he felt clearly and he was convinced he would find in it its content its peace and its dignity of the lack of which he was so miserably conscious but a third series of ideas turned upon the question of how to effect this transition from the old life to the new and there nothing took clear shape for him a wife work and the necessity of work leave pokrovskoe buy land become a member of a peasant community marry a peasant girl how am i to set about it he asked himself again and could not find an answer i slept all night though and i think it out clearly he said to himself work it out later one certain this night has decided my fate all my old dreams of home life were absurd not the real thing he told himself all ever so much simpler and better 
 how beautiful he thought looking at the strange as it were shell of white fleecy cloudlets resting right over his head in the middle of the sky how exquisite it all is in this exquisite night and when was there time for that cloud shell to form just now i looked at the sky and there was nothing in it only two white streaks yes and so imperceptibly too my views of life changed 
 he went out of the meadow and walked along the highroad toward the village a slight wind arose and the sky looked gray and sullen the gloomy moment had come that usually precedes the dawn the full triumph of light over darkness 
 shrinking from the cold levin walked rapidly looking at the ground that someone coming he thought catching the tinkle of bells and lifting his head forty paces from him a carriage and four with the luggage on its top was driving toward him along the grassy highroad on which he was walking the shaft horses were tilted against the shafts by the ruts but the dexterous driver sitting on the box held the shaft over the ruts so that the wheels ran on the smooth part of the road 
 this was all levin noticed and without wondering who it could be he gazed absently at the coach 
 in the coach was an old lady dozing in one corner and at the window evidently only just awake sat a young girl holding in both hands the ribbons of a white cap with a face full of light and thought full of a subtle complex inner life that was remote from levin she was gazing from the window at the glow of the sunrise 
 at the very instant when this apparition was vanishing the truthful eyes glanced at him she recognized him and her face lighted up with wondering delight 
 he could not be mistaken there were no other eyes like those in all the world there was only one creature in the world that could concentrate for him all the brightness and meaning of life it was she it was kitty he comprehended that she was driving to ergushovo from the railway station and everything that had been stirring levin during this sleepless night all the resolutions he had made all vanished at once he recalled with horror his dreams of marrying a peasant girl there only in this carriage that had crossed over to the other side of the road and was rapidly disappearing there only could he find the solution of the riddle of his life which had weighed so agonizingly upon him of late 
 she did not look out again the sound of the carriage springs was no longer audible the bells could scarcely be heard the barking of dogs showed the carriage had reached the village and all that was left was the empty fields all round the village in front and he himself isolated and apart from it all wandering lonely along the deserted highroad 
 he glanced at the sky expecting to find there the cloud shell he had been admiring and taking as the symbol of the ideas and feelings of that night there was nothing in the sky in the least like a shell there in the remote heights above a mysterious change had been accomplished there was no trace of a shell and there was stretched over fully half the sky an even cover of tiny and ever tinier cloudlets the sky had grown blue and bright and with the same softness but with the same remoteness it met his questioning gaze 
 no he said to himself however good that life of simplicity and toil may be i cannot go back to it i love her

 none but those who were most intimate with alexei alexandrovich knew that while on the surface the coldest and most rational of men he had one weakness quite opposed to the general trend of his character alexei alexandrovich could not hear or see a child or woman crying without being moved the sight of tears threw him into a state of nervous agitation and he utterly lost all power of reflection the head clerk of his board and the secretary were aware of this and used to warn women who came with petitions on no account to give way to tears if they did not want to ruin their chances he will get angry and will not listen to you they used to say and as a fact in such cases the emotional disturbance set up in alexei alexandrovich by the sight of tears found expression in hasty anger i can do nothing kindly leave the room he would usually shout in such cases 
 when returning from the races anna had informed him of her relations with vronsky and immediately afterward had burst into tears hiding her face in her hands alexei alexandrovich for all the fury aroused in him against her was aware at the same time of a rush of that emotional disturbance always produced in him by tears conscious of it and conscious that any expression of his feelings at that minute would be out of keeping with the situation he tried to suppress every manifestation of life in himself and so neither stirred nor looked at her this was what had caused that strange expression of deathlike rigidity in his face which had so impressed anna 
 when they reached the house he helped her to get out of the carriage and making an effort to master himself took leave of her with his usual urbanity and uttered that phrase that bound him to nothing he said that tomorrow he would let her know his decision 
 his words confirming his worst suspicions had sent a cruel pang to the heart of alexei alexandrovich that pang was intensified by the strange feeling of physical pity for her engendered by her tears but when he was all alone in the carriage alexei alexandrovich to his surprise and delight felt complete relief both from this pity and from the doubts and agonies of jealousy 
 he experienced the sensations of a man who has had a tooth out after suffering long from toothache after a fearful agony and a sense of something huge bigger than the head itself being torn out of his jaw the sufferer hardly able to believe in his own good luck feels all at once that what has so long envenomed his existence and enchained his attention exists no longer and that he can live and think again and take an interest in other things besides his tooth this feeling alexei alexandrovich was experiencing the agony had been strange and terrible but now it was over he felt that he could live again and think of something other than his wife 
 no honor no heart no religion a corrupt woman i always knew it and always saw it though i tried to deceive myself to spare her he said to himself and it actually seemed to him that he always had seen it he recalled incidents of their past life in which he had never seen anything wrong before now these incidents proved clearly that she had always been a corrupt woman i made a mistake in linking my life to hers but there was nothing wrong in my mistake and so i cannot be unhappy not i who am to blame he told himself but she but i have nothing to do with her she does not exist for me 
 all that would befall her and her son toward whom his sentiments were as much changed as toward her ceased to interest him the only thing that interested him now was the question in what way he could best with most propriety and comfort for himself and so with most justice shake clear the mud with which she had spattered him in her fall and then proceed along his path of active honorable and useful existence 
 i cannot be made unhappy by the fact that a contemptible woman has committed a crime i have only to find the best way out of the difficult position in which she has placed me and i shall find it he said to himself frowning more and more neither the first nor the last and to say nothing of historical instances dating from menelaus recently revived in the memory of all by la belle hlne a whole list of contemporary examples of husbands with unfaithful wives in the highest society rose before alexei imagination daryalov poltavsky prince karibanov count paskudin dram yes even dram such an honest capable fellow semionov chagin sigonin alexei alexandrovich remembered admitting that a certain quite irrational ridicule falls to the lot of these men yet i never saw anything but a misfortune in it and always felt sympathy for it alexei alexandrovich said to himself though indeed this was not the fact and he had never felt sympathy for misfortunes of that kind but the more often he had heard of instances of unfaithful wives betraying their husbands the more highly he had thought of himself it is a misfortune which may befall anyone and this misfortune has befallen me the only thing to be done is to make the best of the situation and he began passing in review the methods of proceeding of men who had been in the same position that he was in 
 daryalov fought a duel 
 the duel had particularly fascinated the thoughts of alexei alexandrovich in his youth just because he was physically a fainthearted man and was himself well aware of the fact alexei alexandrovich could not without horror contemplate the idea of a pistol aimed at himself and never made use of any weapon in his life this horror had in his youth set him often pondering on dueling and picturing himself in a position in which he would have to expose his life to danger having attained success and an established position in the world he had long ago forgotten this feeling but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted itself and dread of his own cowardice proved even now so strong that alexei alexandrovich spent a long while thinking over the question of dueling in all its aspects and hugging the idea of a duel though he was fully aware beforehand that he would never under any circumstances fight one 
 no doubt our society is still so barbarous not the same in england that very many and among these were those whose opinion alexei alexandrovich particularly valued look favorably on the duel but what result is attained by it suppose i call him out alexei alexandrovich went on to himself and vividly picturing the night he would spend after the challenge and the pistol aimed at him he shuddered and knew that he never would do it suppose i call him out suppose i am taught he went on musing i am placed i press the trigger he said to himself closing his eyes and it turns out i have killed him alexei alexandrovich said to himself and he shook his head as though to dispel such silly ideas what sense is there in murdering a man in order to define relation to a guilty wife and son i should still have to decide what i ought to do with her but what is more probable and what would doubtlessly occur i should be killed or wounded i the innocent person should be the victim killed or wounded even more senseless but apart from that a challenge to fight would be an act hardly honest on my side i know beforehand that my friends would never allow me to fight a duel would never allow the life of a statesman needed by russia to be exposed to danger what would come of it it would come of it that knowing beforehand that the matter would never come to real danger it would amount to my simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge that would be dishonest that would be false that would be deceiving myself and others a duel is quite impossible and no one expects it of me my aim is simply to safeguard my reputation which is essential for the uninterrupted pursuit of my public duties official duties which had always been of great consequence in alexei eyes seemed of special importance to his mind at this moment 
 considering and rejecting the duel alexei alexandrovich turned to divorce another solution selected by several of the husbands he remembered passing in mental review all the instances he knew of divorces there were plenty of them in the very highest society with which he was very familiar alexei alexandrovich could not find a single example in which the object of divorce was that which he had in view in all these instances the husband had practically ceded or sold his unfaithful wife and the very party who being in fault had not the right to contract a marriage had formed counterfeit ties with a new husband in his own case alexei alexandrovich saw that a legal divorce that is to say one in which only the guilty wife would be repudiated was impossible of attainment he saw that the complex conditions of the life they led made the coarse proofs of his guilt required by the law out of the question he saw that a certain refinement in that life would not admit of such proofs being brought forward even if he had them and that to bring forward such proofs would damage him in the public estimation more than it would her 
 an attempt at divorce could lead to nothing but a public scandal which would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on his high position in society his chief object to define the position with the least amount of disturbance possible would not be attained by divorce either moreover in the event of divorce or even of an attempt to obtain a divorce it was obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover and in spite of the complete as he supposed contempt and indifference he now felt for his wife at the bottom of his heart alexei alexandrovich still had one feeling left in regard to her a disinclination to see her free to throw in her lot with vronsky so that her crime would be to her advantage the mere notion of this so exasperated alexei alexandrovich that directly it rose to his mind he groaned with inward agony and got up and changed his place in the carriage and for a long while after he sat with scowling brows wrapping his numbed and bony legs in the fleecy rug 
 apart from formal divorce one might still do as karibanov paskudin and that good fellow dram did that is separate from wife he went on thinking when he had regained his composure but this step too presented the same drawback of public scandal as a divorce and what was more a separation quite as much as a regular divorce flung his wife into the arms of vronsky no out of the question out of the question he said aloud twisting his rug about him again i cannot be unhappy but neither she nor he ought to be happy 
 the feeling of jealousy which had tortured him during the period of uncertainty had passed away at the instant when with agony the tooth had been extracted by his words but that feeling had been replaced by another the desire not merely that she should not triumph but that she should get due punishment for her crime he did not acknowledge this feeling but at the bottom of his heart he longed for her to suffer for having destroyed his peace of mind and having dishonored him and once again going over the conditions inseparable from a duel a divorce a separation and once again rejecting them alexei alexandrovich felt convinced that there was only one solution to keep her with him concealing what had happened from the world and using every measure in his power to break off the intrigue and still more though this he did not admit to himself to punish her i must communicate to her my decision that thinking over the terrible position in which she has placed her family all other solutions will be worse for both sides than an external status quo and that such i agree to retain on the strict condition of obedience on her part to my wishes that is to say cessation of all intercourse with her lover when this decision had been finally adopted another weighty consideration occurred to alexei alexandrovich in support of it by such a course only shall i be acting in accordance with the dictates of religion he told himself in adopting this course i am not casting off a guilty wife but giving her a chance of amendment and indeed difficult as the task will be to me i shall devote part of my energies to her reformation and salvation though alexei alexandrovich was perfectly aware that he could not exert any moral influence over his wife that such an attempt at reformation could lead to nothing but falsity though in passing through these difficult moments he had not once thought of seeking guidance in religion yet now when his conclusion corresponded as it seemed to him with the requirements of religion this religious sanction to his decision gave him complete satisfaction and to some extent restored his peace of mind he was pleased to think that even in such an important crisis in life no one would be able to say that he had not acted in accordance with the principles of that religion whose banner he had always held aloft amid the general coolness and indifference as he pondered over subsequent developments alexei alexandrovich did not see indeed why his relations with his wife should not remain practically the same as before no doubt she could never regain his esteem but there was not and there could not be any sort of reason why his existence should be troubled and why he should suffer because she was a bad and faithless wife yes time will pass time which arranges all things and the old relations will be reestablished alexei alexandrovich told himself so far reestablished that is that i shall not be sensible of a break in the continuity of my life she is bound to be unhappy but i am not to blame and so i cannot be unhappy
